This is in accordance with other studies that reported that thyme essential oil is efficient against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [29,30] and fungi [28,51,52].
Due to its antimicrobial, antifungal, antivermin, and antiviral activity [34,35], clove essential oil is used as a preservative but also exhibits other effects with positive impacts on consumer health, including antiseptic, antihelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antispastic, carminative, anti-neuralgic, antiulcer, anti-thrombotic, anticancerinogenic, and anticoagulant activities. Moreover, it acts as a local analgesic [36].

Gram-positive bacteria were more delicate to the EO than Gram-negative bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacteria to A. millefolium oil at the applied concentrations (5 and 10 µg/mL). The smallest inhibition zones were obtained in S. typhimurium and S. agona cultures while St. epidermidis, S. enteritidis, and E. coli were resistant against all concentrations of A. millefolium oil. MIC for B. cereus and St. aureus were 100 and 120 µg/mL, respectively; while the MIC for B. subtilis was 310 µg/mL. Among the Gram-negative tested bacteria, a remarkable antibacterial effect was observed only for S. typhimurium and S. agona with their respective MIC values 2000 and 1000 µg/mL. The effect of A. millefolium oil from Turkey [3] was also tested against St. aureus and B. cereus; it was found that the MIC was 72 mg/mL, which is remarkably higher than the MIC of A. millefolium oil measured in our study. As was shown, the composition of A. millefolium oils from various locations may be rather different. The properties and the content of individual constituents may have an important power on the antibacterial effect of oil against different bacteria species. For instance, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, which were abundant in A. millefolium oil studied in this work, are well-known natural chemicals with antibacterial potentials [21]. The EO also studied in our work also contained 12% of germacrene-D and 7.3% of (E)-nerolidol, which were absent in the Turkish oil. The antibacterial activities of germacrene-D and (E)-nerolidol were previously reported as well [22].

One of the criteria used by most researchers to measure the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum concentration of fecundity. Due to the fact that each antimicrobial agent has different effects on microorganisms, this study investigated the AEO on gram‐negative microorganisms such as S. typhimurium and E. coli and gram‐positive bacteria like S. aureus using microdilution method. According to the results (Table 2), the highest MIC values were observed in Salmonella typhimurium and the lowest values were found in S. aureus (p < .05). Several reports have shown that gram‐positive bacteria are more susceptible to antibacterial compounds than gram‐negative bacteria. The resistance of gram‐negative bacteria against antibacterial agents with the hydrophilic surface of the outer membrane of bacteria that is rich in lipopolysaccharide molecules and creates a buffer against the penetration of different antibiotic molecules, as well as with perivascular enzymes that can break the molecules imported from outside are also in contact. Gram‐positive bacteria do not have such an external membrane in the cell wall structure.

E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, P. italicum Wehmer, and P. digitatum Sacc. are different types of microorganisms. E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa are pathogenic bacteria [24], whereas P. italicum Wehmer and P. digitatum Sacc. are fungi [25]. Because these organisms infect, damage, and destroy material used in manufacturing goods or infect the goods produced; these microorganisms increase economic costs in various industries, including medicinal, cosmetic, agriculture, and food industries. Thus, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil from M. alternifolia was investigated with three different methods: the antimicrobial screening method and the MIC and MBC assays. The results presented in Table 3 clearly show that the essential oil of M. alternifolia displayed significant antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms tested. The Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the essential oil than Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. E. coli had the lowest MIC (2 mg/ml). These data are consistent with previous observations that Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil possesses antibacterial and antifungal activity [11]. According to Cox et al. (2000), the antimicrobial activity of the M. alternifolia terpenes is associated with their strong hydrophobicity. Here, the hydrophobic terpenes interact strongly with the membrane lipids of the pathogenic microorganisms, which affect the permeability of the membrane [10]. Among the main consequences of membrane permeability are (i) modification of the proton-motive force, leading to a deficit in the production of cellular energy caused by the decrease in ATP generation, and (ii) cellular lyses due to leakage or coagulation of the cytoplasm [26, 27]. The compound terpinene-4-ol, also identified amongst the main constituents of the Iranian Cymbopogon Olivieri essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans [28]."
