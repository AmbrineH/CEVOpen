# README
This site is a repository for an Open project to ine the plant chemistry literature and make the data instantly and universally available.

## CEVOpen
The project members and purpose are described in [CEVOpen](AboutCEV.md)

## The articles and derived material
The repository contains copies of the 1000 articles , as XML; then transformed into HTML, searched , fragmented, re-used (we don't yet know how!). This is quite a lot to download (500 Mb) so make sure you have space.  

## site structure
### issues
Much of the narrative will be captured as [Issues](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/issues).  We expect that the primary record will be an issue setting out the next actions, and then followups desbing what happened.
### articles
The article resource is dynamic and each operation is likely to create more files.
### dictionaries 
we shall certainly be creating new dictionaries, andalso adding fields.

## Content and Rights
CEVOpen contain large amounts of open code and scientific articles downloade from the literature. They have been transformed into more semantic formats
and data has been extracted. All articles are from EuropePMC and we believe we have the right to mount them - please contact us if any problems occur.
