**Index Oil186 Dictionaries**
=============================

This
[index](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/blob/master/articleAnalysis/oil186/raw/DictionaryDescriptionsOIL186/INDEXofOIL186Dictionaries.md)
contains information about the Manually Created Dictionaries for OIL186.

*PLEASE NOTE: Rather than alphabetical order, are listed here in the logical
progression.*

**The purpose/function of Dictionaries:**

1.  *Identify “things” as objects or concepts (eg. “e.coli" is a concept.).*

2.  *Give each object clear lexical names by which they can be searched.*  
    *(An object that goes by more than one name is a synonym*.)

3.  *Give each object a link to wikidata (or other authorities) by which we can
    learn more about them.*

**EO Compound**
---------------

Essential Oils (EOs) are the concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile
chemical compounds extracted from plants. Essential oils are also known as
volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetherolea, or simply as the oil of the plant from
which they were extracted, such as oil of clove.

chemical composition of the tested Essential Oils (Extracts?), with each known
compound linked to its IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI).
