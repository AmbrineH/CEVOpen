**Instrument​​ Dictionary**
=========================

 

A dictionary of **[24]** makes/models of Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
equipment used to identify different substances within a test sample — in this
case, Essential Oils mentioned in the 186 test articles downloaded from PubMed.

Notes:
------

-   I’m not sure if Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry equipment always go
    together, or if Gas chromatography can be one machine and mass spectrometry
    another.

-   I believe there are duplicates yet to be normalized

-   Potential errors: For example, I believe the Wiley references (lines 20 and
    21) are references to [Spectral
    Databases](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1016/1044-0305(91)85012-U ).

-   Once this dictionary is finalized, please update main description and the
    file location in this document and delete this note.

-   Currently all entries for “desc”...

    -   are from one source

        -   are described as being “Hacked" from a few papers PMR 20190904 … is
            that the best way to describe the method of extration from the
            source material?

-   As of Jan 27,2020 this equipment list contains only 24 models. Should we
    need to train software by providing some makes/models, many can be found
    here:
