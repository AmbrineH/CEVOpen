**Errors?**

-   This is the first case where the column heading “description” means
    something other than "data source / method of input"

-   In this case, is the column heading “id” related to Essoil? I don’t know how
    to describe it here. The format is: *CM.plantParts.n* where *n* is a
    serialized number

-   I don’t know how to describe the column headings for “Wikipedia” or “query”
    in this case
