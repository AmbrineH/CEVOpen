Notes:
------

-   More work needs to be done on this dictionary.

-   This dictionary has terms related to other dictionaries such as:

-   Origin (eg. altitude), timing of harvest (eg. beginning of flowering,
    autumn), plant sex (eg. Female plants), post harvest handling (eg.
    freeze-dried), water source (eg. spring), etc…. could it be that after
    normalizing, some of these are moved from here to other dictionaries?

-   I don’t know how to describe the following column headings: id, wikipedia,
    query

-   there are queries that need to be dealt with and deleted.
