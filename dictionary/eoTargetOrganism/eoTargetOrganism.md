Notes:
------

-   We need to normalize the headings across all Dictionaries

    -   This is the third case where the column heading “description” means
        something other than "data source / method of input"

    -   Capitalization

-   In this case, is the column heading “id” related to Essoil? I don’t know how
    to describe it here. The format is: *CM.TargetOrganism.n* where *n* is a
    serialized number

-   I don’t know how to describe the column headings for “Wikipedia” or “query”
    in this case
