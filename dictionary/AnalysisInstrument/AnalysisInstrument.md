**Analysis Instrument​​ Dictionary**
==================================

 

File Data
---------

-   **Description:** A dictionary of **[24]** makes/models of Gas
    chromatography–mass spectrometry equipment used to identify different
    substances within a test sample — in this case, Essential Oils mentioned in
    the 186 test articles downloaded from PubMed.

-   **Filename:** AnalysisInstrument.xml

-   **File Location**:
    <https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/blob/master/dictionary/AnalysisInstrument/AnalysisInstrument.xml>

 

Table Column Headings
---------------------

-   **id:** *DAVE.activity.n* where *n* is a serialized number

-   **term:** The name is a human readable string describing the concept.

-   **wikidataid:** Unique identifier linked to Wikidata.org — a free and open
    knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.

-   **description:** short description of the activity sourced from wikidata
    and/or wikipedia

 

Contents/Results
----------------

-   **No. of source papers:** 1

-   **No. of Entries (Headers are not counted):** 24

-   **No. of unique entries (including alternate spellings or synonyms):** 23

 

Notes:
------

-   I’m not sure if Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry equipment always go
    together, or if Gas chromatography can be one machine and mass spectrometry
    another.

-   I believe there are duplicates yet to be normalized

-   Potential errors: For example, I believe the Wiley references (lines 20 and

    1.  are references to [Spectral
        Databases](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1016/1044-0305(91)85012-U).

-   Once this dictionary is finalized, please update main description and the
    file location in this document and delete this note.

-   Currently all entries for “desc”...

    -   are from one source

        -   are described as being “Hacked" from a few papers PMR 20190904 … is
            that the best way to describe the method of extration from the
            source material?

-   As of Jan 27,2020 this equipment list contains only 24 models. Should we
    need to train software by providing some makes/models, many can be found
    here:
