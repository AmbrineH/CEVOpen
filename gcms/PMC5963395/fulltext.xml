(EA) is a well-known noxious invasive species. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the essential oil derived from EA (EAEO) is mainly composed of sesquiterpenes. However, the pharmacological value of EAEO in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unexplored. Herein, we investigated the anti-HCC activities of EAEO, and explored the potential mechanisms of EAEO-induced apoptosis. An MTT assay showed that EAEO inhibited HCC cell proliferation with little toxicity on normal liver cells. Wound healing and FACS assays revealed that EAEO suppressed HCC cell migration and arrested cell cycle, respectively. Moreover, EAEO promoted <italic>in vitro</italic> HCC cell apoptosis, and EAEO treatment inhibited HepG2 xenografts growth and enhanced apoptotic nucleus of xenografts in HepG2-bearing nude mice. Mechanistically, EAEO significantly decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and resulted in the activation of caspase-9 and -3. EAEO also reduced the expression of Grp78, which in turn relieved the inhibition of caspase-12 and -7. Meanwhile, EAEO suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 and AKT, indicative of its anti-HCC potential. In summary, we determined that EAEO treatment promoted HCC apoptosis via activation of the apoptotic signaling pathway in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as repressed the activity of STAT3 and AKT in HCC cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Eupatorium adenophorum</italic></kwd><kwd>essential oil</kwd><kwd>anticancer</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">81660656</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81573561</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81774000</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="43"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent epidemiological trends indicate that the incidence of cancer cases will increase from 14.1 million in 2012 to about 25 million in 2035 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Stewart and Wild, 2014</xref>). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the sixth most common cancer, has the second highest mortality rate of global malignancies. About 780,000 new cases of HCC are diagnosed yearly and over 745,000 deaths are estimated to occur due to HCC (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Torre et al., 2015</xref>). Only a fraction of HCC patients is eligible for potentially curative treatments, including liver resection, transplantation, and local ablation. Systemic chemotherapy therapy is the most common management strategy for the majority of HCC patients, especially those with late-stage disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bruix et al., 2016</xref>). However, poor efficacy, adverse drug reactions, and drug resistance are the biggest drawbacks to systemic chemotherapy therapy of HCC. To address these challenges, the identification of efficacious compounds as new potential chemotherapeutic agents against HCC is necessary.</p><p>Natural products originating from plants remain the basic source of highly efficient and hypotoxic compounds for anticancer agents. Many chemotherapy agents such as camptothecin, taxol, and doxorubicin, which were derived from natural products, have been successfully applied in clinic extensively. Furthermore, multitudes of anticancer agents researched from the natural products are undergoing clinical evaluations. Hence, there is feasibility in exploring new compounds to fight HCC from natural resources that may meet the growth demands of chemotherapy agent development.</p><p><italic>Eupatorium adenophorum</italic> Spreng. (EA) is a well-known noxious invasive weed belonging to genus Eupatorium. However, EA is traditionally used as a conventional medicine in treating fever, desinsectization, traumatism, and phyma in China (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yunnan Institute of Materia Medica, 1975</xref>). Admittedly, translation of EA into available medicinal resources delivers the dual benefit of environmental protection and medicinal purposes. Many plants of genus Eupatorium are used worldwide as conventional medicine: for example, <italic>E. triplinerve</italic> Vahl. is used as folk medicine in India for relieving colic and stomach pain (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Selvamangai and Bhaskar, 2012</xref>), while <italic>E. fortunei</italic> Turcz. and <italic>E. lindleyanum</italic> DC. are traditional Chinese medicines known to treat respiratory and gynecological diseases for centuries. Thus far, parts of compounds isolated from genus Eupatoriums, such as luteolin, nepetin, and eupatoriopicrin have been shown to treat several knotty diseases as well as cancer (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kupchan et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Militao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Suksamrarn et al., 2004</xref>). The main compounds in EA have been illuminated and contain a variety of secondary metabolites belonging to flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Ding, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, a number of preliminary research studies showed that EA exhibits high phytotoxicity in flora and fauna, and has potential advantages in pest control and bioherbicides (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baruah et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Nong et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, it was reported that many essential oils contained the major constituent of EA, such as torreyol, aristolone, and &#x003b1;-bisabolol, and exhibited the significant antiproliferative effect on carcinoma (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Federica et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Khadir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sobeh et al., 2016</xref>). However, few pharmacological studies investigating the anticancer activity of EA have been reported so far. Herein, we aimed to investigate the unexplored value of EA in HCC.</p><p>In this study, we prepared the essential oil from the whole plant of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> (EAEO) and elucidated the main principles of EAEO by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. The further antiproliferative assay of EAEO on HCC cells showed that EAEO inhibited HCC cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but exhibited little cytotoxicity in normal human liver cells. We further unveiled that EAEO had the ability to inhibit HCC cell migration and arrested the cell cycle in G<sub>1</sub> phase, as well as provoking HCC cells apoptosis. Mechanistically, EAEO-induced HCC cell apoptosis was executed by the activation of apoptosis signaling pathway in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as repressing the activity of STAT3 and AKT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p>The whole plants of EA were collected in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China in July, 2016 and identified by Professor Jingquan Yuan (Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China).

HepG2 cells were, respectively, incubated with 0, 10, 30, and 50 &#x003bc;g/mL of EAEO for 24 h. Results showed that EAEO treatment dose-dependently decreased the fraction of G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of HepG2 cells, which was accompanied by a concomitant increase of cells in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>. However, cells seemed to be inactive in S phase at relatively low EAEO concentrations (10 and 30 &#x003bc;g/mL) (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref></bold>). Similarly, EAEO also time-dependently decreased the fraction of G<sub>2</sub>/M phase and increased the fraction of G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> synchronously (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref></bold>). We were also interested in the effects of EAEO on cell cycle regulatory proteins involved in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> arrest (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S3</xref>). Cyclin D1 is an important factor promoting the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>- to S-phase transition which is critical for the progression of cell cycle; on the contrary, p53 and p21 Waf1/Cip1, are negative regulators of this transition.

To confirm EAEO-induced apoptosis, we compared the morphological changes of EAEO-treated HCC cells and CDDP-treated HCC cells with positive group. As depicted by the photomicrographs under a phase contrast microscope, we observed the typical apoptosis characteristics of cell shape and labeled them with the yellow points, such as shrinkage, distortion, and flotage with progressing EAEO concentrations (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>). Similar apoptotic changes of nucleus were also observed by Hoechst 33258 staining assay. Photomicrographs indicated that the quantity of chromatin condensation and apoptotic bodies increased in a dose-dependent manner and the effects induced by 50 &#x003bc;g/mL of EAEO were similar to the CDDP-treated group (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref></bold>). To further monitor the cell apoptosis, we performed Annexin-V FITC/PI staining and found that the fraction of Q2 and Q4 gradually increased. It indicated that EAEO treatment time-dependently induced early and late apoptosis. We were also interested in exploring the effects of EAEO on the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. Bcl-2 family (including Bcl-2 and Bax) regulates intrinsic apoptosis senses of death signals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fox and MacFarlane, 2016</xref>). Previous studies have reported that the balance of Bcl-2/Bax determines the initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis, and a high ratio of Bcl-2/Bax is considered anti-apoptotic (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Caspase-9 and caspase-3 play the executioner role in apoptosis, and upon their activation, their precursor forms are cleaved (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lopez and Tait, 2015</xref>). Hence, we investigated the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 using western blot analysis (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>). Decrease of Bcl-2/Bax and increase of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 are typical apoptotic indicators following CDDP treatment, which was observed in our study. Furthermore, EAEO treatment significantly reduced the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, while increased the expressions of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 in a dose-dependent manner (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,C</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data suggest that EAEO has the potential to induceHCC cell apoptosis in vitro by activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Observation of morphological changes in HepG2 cells. <bold>(A)</bold> HepG2 cells were treated with 0, 10, 30, and 50 &#x003bc;g/mL of EAEO and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL of CDDP for 24 h, after which the cells were photographed under a phase contrast microscope. <bold>(B)</bold> Then, the cells were fixed and incubated with Hoechst 33258 for 30 min, after which the cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope.

GSK-3 is a critical downstream element of the AKT cell survival pathway whose activity can be inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser21 of GSK-3&#x003b1; and Ser9 of GSK-3&#x003b2;. Inhibiting GSK-3 may improve the expression of tumorigenic proteins like, &#x003b2;-catenin and Cyclin D1. Interestingly, we notice the down-regulation of Cycline D1 which may be related to GSK-3&#x003b2; status. As expected, we observed that EAEO dose-dependently repressed the phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; without inhibiting protein levels of total GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>). Our data further strengthen the evidence that AKT appears to be a promising target of EAEO using in HCC treatment.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>FIGURE 10</label><caption><p>EAEO repressed phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro.</italic>

However, the potential use of EA as a resource in pharmaceuticals industry and agriculture may present an opportunity to counter its notoriety as an environmental hazard. Nevertheless, the pharmacological effects and mechanism of EA on humans remain poorly understood. In our study, EAEO displayed antiproliferative activity against several HCC cells lines (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref></bold>). Previous experiments showed that the anticancer activity of plant essential oils is mostly due to terpenoids as the major active compounds (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kuttan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Sieniawska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pudziuvelyte et al., 2017</xref>). Analyses of chemical compositions of EAEO by GC-MS revealed that the EAEO is mainly composed of sesquiterpenes, which were probably responsible for the anticancer activity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> and <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Our studies unveiled that EAEO dose- and time-dependently inhibited HCC cell proliferation, without inducing cytotoxicity in normal liver cells (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref></bold>). This hypotoxicity of EAEO is considered a basic requirement for potential chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, we conducted several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to further elucidate the potential of EAEO in anti-HCC activity.</p><p>The typical pathological hallmarks of HCC cells, like most malignant tumor cells, are activating invasion and metastasis, uncontrolled cell cycle, resistance to apoptosis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Igney and Krammer, 2002</xref>). Often, the prognosis of HCC patients is very poor is generally due to the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Invasiveness and migration ability largely determine the metastatic potential of most solid malignancies including HCC (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 2002</xref>). Here, our study showed that EAEO treatment inhibited HepG2 cells migration even in a lower concentration (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). These data suggest that EAEO has inhibitory potential of metastatic spread of cancer cells. Uncontrolled cell cycle is a fundamental aspect of cancer. Normal cells monitor their developmental or other mitogenic signals and decide whether to proliferate, or remain quiescent, whereas cancer cells must evade this control of proliferation in order to survive. This suggests that cancer cells have defects in regulation of the proliferation signals (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). Cell cycle checkpoints are crucial control mechanisms in proliferation. Mutations in checkpoint pathways can induce genomic abnormalities possible for survival or continued growth, thereby more likely causing malignant transformation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Massague, 2004</xref>). Cell cycle arrest is referenced as a part of a treatment strategy for slowing the progression of cancers. Our FACS data and western blot analysis showed that EAEO induced G<sub>1</sub> phase arrest and the blockage effects on cell cycle might prevent HCC cells from entering M phase (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>).</p><p>Apoptosis is an intrinsic self-destruction mechanism linked to many biological processes. Defects in apoptosis mechanisms can disrupt the delicate balance of cell process and might eventually result in cancer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Igney and Krammer, 2002</xref>). Even so, cancer cells are destined to die, and have to be under the survival stress from self-defect. Some cancers including HCC are highly dependent on aberrations of the apoptosis signaling pathways to survive, but parts of apoptotic mechanisms may still be preserved. Therefore, restoring apoptosis might be effective against cancers. In fact, various targeted drugs developed from extensive molecular understanding of apoptosis have been designed to kill cancer cells through suppressing key molecules in mutation of apoptosis signaling pathways or enhancing the activation of conservative apoptotic mechanisms (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fesik, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lopez and Tait, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria play a central role in apoptotic cell death. The relative expression of Bcl-2 and Bax and the activation of caspase-9 and -3 are classical events mediating mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, while Bcl-2 and Bax control mitochondrial permeability. Changing of ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein leads to <italic>cytochrome C</italic> release, which is associated with the activation of caspase-9 and -3, and eventually induces apoptosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Masuelli et al., 2017</xref>). Our FACS analysis showed the increase of sub G<sub>1</sub> phase as the sign of nuclear debris from apoptotic cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), which was consistent with the apoptotic change of cellular morphology observed under phase contrast microscopy (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). Based on its favorable <italic>in vitro</italic> pro-apoptotic activity against HCC cells, we employed HepG2-bearing nude mouse model and analyzed the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. We unveiled that EAEO inhibited the transplanted tumor growth. Besides, the impacts on body weight and organ index of nude mouse were provided in Supplementary Data Sheet <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Western blot analysis of both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> samples showed that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was dose-dependently decreased and the expressions of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 were dose-dependently increased after EAEO treatment. These data indicated that EAEO might be a potential anti-HCC agent by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>).</p><p>Recent studies have also pointed out the fact that the signaling pathway of apoptosis mediated by ERS is a new mechanism of apoptosis. ERS is triggered by the disequilibrium of calcium homeostasis and the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in ER. Persistence of ERS induces normal cells apoptosis, but in incipient ERS, cells evoke a repair mechanism called unfolded protein response (UPR) to reestablish ER homeostasis in an attempt to stay alive. Many cancers face metabolic dysregulations such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress, resulting in persistent ERS. However, cancer cells seem to benefit from UPR to escape from apoptosis and adapt to the transformed state (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Considering that upregulation of ERS was also detected in HCC and associated with the HCC development (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>), we examined the impact of EAEO on ERS in HCC. We detected the expression of Grp78 in EAEO-treated HCC cells, whose elevated expression usually correlates with a variety of cancer microenvironmental stresses and initiation of UPR. EAEO dose-dependently suppressed the expression of Grp78 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref></bold>) confirming that EAEO produced an effect on the ERS pathway, which piqued our interest in the involvement of ERS pathway in EAEO-induced HCC cells apoptosis. Caspase-12 as a core molecule, whose activation is mediated by Grp78 and caspas-7, is only implicated in the apoptosis signaling pathway with ERS (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa et al., 2000</xref>). The expressions of caspase-12 and -7 were detected, and the results showed that EAEO treatment increased their activity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref></bold>). These findings were replicated in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref></bold>). These findings suggested that separate from mitochondrial apoptosis, EAEO might also relieve the inhibition of Grp78 in caspase-12 and -7 to restore apoptosis signaling pathway with ERS.</p><p>Normally, the mechanism of apoptosis is also limited by anti-apoptotic pathways. In the present study, we evaluated the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax, which are associated with STAT3 or AKT signaling. STAT3 and AKT are key molecules constituting significant anti-apoptotic pathways in many cancers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Choudhari et al., 2007</xref>). To explore whether STAT3 and AKT signaling were possible mediators of HCC cell apoptosis triggered by EAEO, the activity of STAT3 and AKT were detected both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results confirmed our conjecture that EAEO treatment inhibited the activity of STAT3 and AKT in HCC (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref></bold>), suggesting that EAEO-induced HCC cell apoptosis might be triggered by the inhibition of STAT3 and AKT.</p><p>In summary, analyses of chemical compositions revealed that the EAEO is mainly composed of sesquiterpenes, and the dominant sesquiterpenes are torreyol, aristolone, and &#x003b1;-bisabolol, followed by &#x003b1;-curcumene, &#x003b2;-bisabolene, and &#x003b2;-sesquiphellandrene. Our pharmacological study indicated that EAEO was capable of arresting HCC cells cycle in G1 phase, inhibit cell proliferation and migration, but showed little toxic in normal liver cells. Animal experiments further verified that EAEO induced cell apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of EAEO-induced HCC cell apoptosis was implemented by the activation of apoptosis signaling pathway in the mitochondria and ER, as well as repressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 and AKT (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref></bold>). Our present findings suggest EAEO has the potential to be a STAT3 and AKT inhibitor in targeted chemotherapeutic drug development.</p><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>FIGURE 12</label><caption><p>A schematic summary for the mechanisms of EAEO-induced HCC cells apoptosis in the present study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphar-09-00483-g012"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of &#x02018;Guidelines for Tumor Induction in Mice and Rats, Animal Care and Use Committee of South-Central University for Nationalities.&#x02019; The protocol was approved by the &#x02018;Animal Care and Use Committee of South-Central University for Nationalities.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>HC conceived the study, performed <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological activities (Cell culture, MTT assay, Hoesct 33258 staining and FACS), and carried out data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
