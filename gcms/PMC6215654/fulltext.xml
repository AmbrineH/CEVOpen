Its very low toxicity in mammals allows it to be used in odontology (for surgical dressings, temporary fillings, pulp capping agents and cavity liners), as a food flavoring and in perfumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It also shows insecticidal and repellent activities in several insect species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An almost unexplored sublethal effect of monoterpenes consists in the modification of insect locomotor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, eugenol hyperactivates nymphs of the blood-sucking bug <italic>Triatoma infestans</italic>, vector of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the causal agent of Chagas disease in Latin America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The primary sites of action of the vast majority of insecticidal monoterpenes are unknown, but there is evidence suggesting that eugenol is a ligand of the octopamine receptor of the insects&#x02019; nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">When an organism is exposed to a mixture of two or more substances, their biological activity can be modified by the presence of the other compound. As a consequence of their interaction, the effect of the resulting combination can be higher or lower than the addition of the effects of each substance alone (synergism and antagonism, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both types of interactions have been observed in binary combinations of monoterpenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The classical concept of toxicological interactions considers the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, reaching sites of action and excretion of the components of the mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

For quantitative determination using selective ion monitoring (SIM), permethrin was identified by an ion of mass 183 (retention time: 20.15 min).

The KT50 values of permethrin were significantly lower than the controls in situations (a.i) and (b). Moreover, when eugenol was applied in the absence of permethrin, it only produced hyperactivity in those same two situations.</p><p id="Par41">Locomotor activity is a complex characteristic that is directly or indirectly involved in almost all the activities of an insect and is regulated by a neurophysiological mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It has a very important role in survival and depends on both internal (age, hormonal state) and external (presence or absence of predators and conspecifics) factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Of particular interest is the recent discovery that infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> increases the locomotor activity of <italic>R. prolixus</italic>, whereas infection with <italic>T. rangeli</italic> causes a decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Exposure to DDT and other insecticides increases the locomotor activity of insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Nymphs of <italic>T. infestans</italic> resistant to deltamethrin showed a reduced sensitivity to the hyperactivity produced by this insecticide when compared to deltamethrin-susceptible individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Hyperactivity was also observed in insects exposed to components of essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but it was only quite recently that this effect was quantified exposing <italic>T. infestans</italic> and <italic>R. prolixus</italic> to alcoholic monoterpenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">In the present study, the effect of eugenol on the locomotor activity of the nymphs varied considerably according to the form of administration. Topical application produced the highest effect, followed by exposure to vapors, whereas eugenol injection caused no modification in nymph locomotor activity.</p><p id="Par44">The amount of compound that reaches an insect depends strongly on the type of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For example, insects exposed to an insecticidal film mainly pick up the compound by their legs, whereas topical application generates a more extensive distribution on the body cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">In the present study, nymphs treated topically received a larger amount of eugenol than those exposed to vapors. Therefore, the difference observed in the effect on locomotor activity could be due to the fact that a higher dose produces a greater effect.</p><p id="Par46">Why did eugenol fail to produce hyperactivity when injected? The dose applied (2 ng of eugenol/insect) might have been too low to modify the nymphs&#x02019; locomotor activity. In fact, hyperactivity by eugenol and other monoterpenes is dose-dependent in <italic>T. infestans</italic> and <italic>R. prolixus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We were unable to test higher doses because they rapidly produced symptoms of intoxication (lateral walking, proboscis extension, leg tremors). Applying a substance that hyperactivates the nymphs at a dose that is much lower than the threshold producing intoxication symptoms could help solve this issue.</p><p id="Par47">On the other hand, the effect of eugenol on hyperactivity could be induced <italic>via</italic> the neurons of sensory structures on the cuticle that react to different environmental stimuli. If this is true, stimulation would not occur when the monoterpene is injected into the hemolymph. The very rapid manifestation of hyperactivity when nymphs were exposed to eugenol vapors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) provides evidence that supports this explanation.</p><p id="Par48">The mode of action of most monoterpenes remains unknown. Eugenol is one of the few exceptions, as evidence suggests that its primary site of action is the octopaminergic receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The octopaminergic system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems of invertebrates, where it participates in many physiological and behavioral aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Within the context of the present study, it is important to note that the octopaminergic system is involved in the initiation and maintenance of rhythmic behaviors such as walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Based upon this knowledge, an interaction between eugenol and octopaminergic receptors could explain the hyperactivity observed in our experiments.</p><p id="Par49">After demonstrating that hyperactivated nymphs become intoxicated more rapidly than the non-hyperactivated ones when exposed to a permethrin-treated surface, we quantified the amount of insecticide permethrin picked up in both situations. For this we adapted two protocols, one used for extracting dieldrin picked up by mosquitoes exposed to a surface treated with this insecticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and another used to quantify permethrin and other insecticides in water samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This way, we managed to detect minute quantities of permethrin picked up by the nymphs exposed to treated filter papers. Our results showed that the nymphs hyperactivated by eugenol picked up more permethrin than the non-hyperactivated ones.</p><p id="Par50">As mentioned in Background, a similar result was observed by other authors working with two strains of <italic>H. virescens</italic>, one susceptible and the other resistant to permethrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When exposed to a permethrin-treated surface, larvae from the resistant strain were less active and picked up less insecticide, than larvae from the susceptible strain. This behavioral response was considered partially responsible for the resistance to permethrin.</p><p id="Par51">In summary, here we have gathered a significant amount of evidence that support our hypothesis: eugenol-hyperactivated nymphs of <italic>T. infestans</italic> pick up more insecticide, and then become intoxicated faster, than non-hyperactivated nymphs when exposed to a permethrin-treated surface.</p><p id="Par52">Future studies should investigate the effects of other monoterpenes as possible enhancers of the toxicity of different insecticides on triatomines. Mixtures of monoterpenes should also be evaluated, to establish whether synergistic interactions occur. The application of mixtures of monoterpenes and conventional insecticides under field conditions is a possibility that is worth exploring, since hyperactivity could increase the exposure to recently applied insecticides, increasing the efficacy of control. Another issue to be investigated is the effect of eugenol on the locomotor activity of both trypanosomes-infected and resistant to pyrethroids <italic>T. infestans</italic>. These studies could elucidate for the physiological basis of the hyperactivity induced by insecticides in insects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">Results from toxicological, behavioral and analytical assays performed in this work support the hypothesis that eugenol-hyperactivated nymphs of <italic>T. infestans</italic> pick up more insecticide, and then become intoxicated faster, than non-hyperactivated nymphs when exposed to a permethrin-treated surface.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>95% CI</term><def><p id="Par4">95% confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DT</term><def><p id="Par5">Distance traveled</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GC-MS</term><def><p id="Par6">Gas chomatography - mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KT50</term><def><p id="Par7">Knockdown time 50%</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AL and RAA are members of the Carrera del Investigador Cient&#x000ed;fico del Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas y T&#x000e9;cnicas of Argentina (CONICET).
