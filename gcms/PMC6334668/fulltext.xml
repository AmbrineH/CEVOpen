Based on the QS interference approach, this study aimed to reveal the efficacy of <sc>L</sc>-carvone at sublethal concentrations on QS-regulated virulence factors and biofilm formation in <italic>H. alvei.</italic> QS inhibitory activity was demonstrated by the reduction in swinging motility (61.49%), swarming motility (74.94%), biofilm formation (52.41%) and acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production (0.5 &#x003bc;L/mL). Additionally, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and RT-qPCR studies for AHL synthase HalI and QS transcriptional regulator HalR revealed a plausible molecular mechanism for QS inhibition by <sc>L</sc>-carvone. These findings suggest that <sc>L</sc>-carvone (a main component of spearmint essential oils) could be used as a novel quorum sensing inhibitor to control <italic>H. alvei</italic> in the food industry.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Hafnia alvei</italic></kwd><kwd><sc>L</sc>-carvone</kwd><kwd>quorum sensing inhibitor</kwd><kwd><italic>in silico</italic> analysis</kwd><kwd>RT-qPCR</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Hafnia alvei</italic> is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, motile bacterium of the family <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>; it is an opportunistic pathogen and a dominant psychrophile found in putrid food (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Vivas et al., 2008</xref>). It has been widely isolated from different food products, such as raw meat, dairy and aquatic products, and specially from various packed food products stored at low temperatures (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these characteristics, <italic>H. alvei</italic> is often considered a specific spoilage organism (SSO) that causes severe nutrition and safety problems in these food matrices by producing extracellular enzymes and siderophores, and forming biofilms. Recent studies have described the key roles of virulence factors and biofilm production in <italic>H. alvei</italic>, which is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) systems (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Quorum sensing is a process that allows single-cell organisms (like bacteria) cooperate, communicate, and act collectively. By this process, they can produce, release, detect, and establish connections with small chemical molecules called autoinducers, which in Gram-negative bacteria are acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Thus, AHL-mediated QS systems are usually composed of the LuxI-type autoinducer synthetase, and cytoplasmic LuxR-type proteins, which are receptors activated by AHLs (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Bassler, 2009</xref>). Among these two proteins, LuxR-type proteins have more complex functions. With the increase of bacterial density (achieving a certain threshold), the ligand-binding domain of the LuxR-type proteins will bind with AHLs, which will cause changes in the protein conformation and stimulate the formation of AI-LuxR compound proteins, and lead to the binding of the DNA-binding domain of these compound proteins to target genes, thereby regulating the expression of bacterial multiplex phenotypic features such as virulence factors and biofilms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Almeida et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, interfering with AHL-mediated QS systems by using certain compounds, generally called QS inhibitors (QSIs), may be a better strategy to prevent bacterial food spoilage. Compared to antibiotics and antiseptics, QSIs aim to make the bacteria &#x02018;surrender&#x02019; instead of killing them, which would weaken them from having resistance (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Defoirdt, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Nowadays, many synthetic and natural products have been called QSIs; however, only a few of them have a therapeutic value, due to the instability or high toxicity of most other compounds (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Defoirdt et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the property of low toxicity, some natural compounds from spice plants have been widely used as antimicrobial agents in the food industry, such as curcumin, vanillin, menthol, and cinnamaldehyde (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, extracting natural compounds from spice plants to obtain effective QSIs has become a promising research hotspot. <sc>L</sc>-Carvone (or (<italic>R</italic>4)-(-)-carvone), a monoterpene, is the main component of spearmint essential oils from traditional spice plants and medical herbs. It is widely applied in the food field; it is used to enhance the fragrance and flavor in cooking, and in the beverage and the chewing gum industries (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho and da Fonseca, 2006</xref>). In many studies, <sc>L</sc>-carvone has been reported as an antimicrobial agent for foodborne pathogenic microorganisms (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Porf&#x000ed;rio et al., 2017</xref>); however, there is still limited information about the relationship between spoilage bacteria and QSIs. Therefore, our study involves the characterization of the <sc>L</sc>-carvone-mediated inhibition of the QS activity of the biosensor strain <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> CV026, and subsequently, the determination of the effect of <sc>L</sc>-carvone on virulence factor and biofilm production in the spoilage bacterium <italic>H. alvei</italic>. Additionally, we further investigated the underlying mechanism of <sc>L</sc>-carvone as a potential QSI in <italic>H. alvei</italic>, by using the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and RT-qPCR techniques. In this regard, the study has provided new information about the application of <sc>L</sc>-carvone as potential QSI and reference values for the effective control of spoilage bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents, Bacterial Strains, and Growth Conditions</title><p><sc>L</sc>-Carvone (&#x02265;99% purity) and AHL standards including C<sub>4</sub>-HSL, C<sub>6</sub>-HSL, C<sub>8</sub>-HSL, C<sub>10</sub>-HSL, C<sub>12</sub>-HSL, and C<sub>14</sub>-HSL were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (United States).

Then, the determination of biofilm was performed as described previously (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rode et al., 2007</xref>), with minor modifications. The cultures were discarded, and each tube was rinsed thrice with sterile water. The tubes were then naturally dried for 40 min and stained with 1 mL of 0.1% crystal violet (w/v) for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with sterile water, the biofilms were extracted using 33% acetic acid.

Overnight cultures of <italic>H. alvei</italic> (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5, 100 &#x003bc;L) were inoculated in these plates and then statically incubated. After cultivation (at 28&#x000b0;C for 48 h), a piece of zinc (with an adhered biofilm) was transferred to a clean sterile plate and washed thrice with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to remove the planktonic cells. For visualization by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), this zinc piece was stained with 0.01% (w/v) acridine orange (AO, dissolved in PBS) for 15 min in the dark. Then, the excessive AO was removed by washing with PBS, followed by fixing with antifade mounting medium Fluoromount-G<sup>TM</sup> (Yeasen, China) for 15 min under the same conditions. Finally, the samples were observed by CLSM (Leica SP5, German) (emission: 525 nm, excitation: 488 nm). For visualization analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the zinc piece was soaked in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol (15 min for each grade).

Many studies have revealed that the reduction of violacein production without the growth of CV026 being affected is considered a direct evidence for the interference of the QS system (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Venkadesaperumal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the above evidences, this work further explored the QS interference activity of <sc>L</sc>-carvone on <italic>H. alvei</italic>, since the QS-mediated production of virulence factors and biofilms plays a key role in the growth of this spoilage organism (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial cells in biofilms are more resistant to antiseptics and food processing conditions; this is likely to cause serious food safety issues (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>). Consequently, studies on preventing biofilm formation are garnering special interest. Previous studies have indicated that the effects of <sc>L</sc>-carvone on biofilms of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are possibly different. <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Soumya et al. (2011)</xref> reported that the sub-MICs of <sc>L</sc>-carvone could reduce biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as a natural QS-inhibitory compound. However, in case of Gram-positive bacteria, the study by <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Leonard et al. (2010)</xref> indicated that carvone could increase biofilm production in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, rather than inhibiting its production. Interestingly, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Oliveroverbel et al. (2014)</xref> also showed that carvone could inhibit violacein and pyocyanin production in <italic>C. violaceum</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively, by interfering with their QS systems, and found that this inhibition was produced by its levorotary analog. Herein, for the first time, we have reported that at sub-MICs, <sc>L</sc>-carvone, a potential natural QSI, could significantly reduce biofilm formation by <italic>H. alvei</italic> at 28&#x000b0;C on polypropylene and zinc surfaces (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result was similar to those of the reports of Soumya and Oliveroverbel. A maximum inhibition of 52.41% was observed using a microplate photometer. Furthermore, <italic>in situ</italic> analysis of the biofilm matrix performed using SEM and LCSM was able to provide further information on the structure of the formed biofilms following different treatments (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azeredo et al., 2017</xref>). As reported by <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gross (2017)</xref>, biofilms were seen as &#x02018;Microbial cities&#x02019; that included both infrastructure (generally embedded in polysaccharide matrixes) and social communication. CLSM and SEM images in our study clearly displayed a major disruption to this infrastructure and the reduction to the biofilm matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results were similar to those of the study by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al.

In HalI, <sc>L</sc>-carvone was well embedded into a cavity in the vicinity of the active site, the key residues of which included ARG16, SER17, VAL15, ARG31, TRP34, ARG24, LYS26, and LEU23. Simultaneously, <sc>L</sc>-carvone formed three hydrogen bonds with ARG16, SER17, and VAL15 and showed a hydrophobic behavior with the other residues, as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,a</xref>. In HalR, <sc>L</sc>-carvone formed one hydrogen bond with SER101 and interacted with other residues (TRP82, VAL69, ALA32, TYR50, TRP54, TYR58, and SER101) via the hydrophobic effect (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,b</xref>). C<sub>6</sub>-HSL, as a positive control, formed two hydrogen bonds with SER101 and ASP67 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,c</xref>). However, the standard QSI, halogenated furanone C30, as a negative control, did not form any hydrogen bonds with HalR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D,d</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Docked interactions of the native ligand C<sub>6</sub>-HSL and compounds <sc>L</sc>-carvone as well as halogenated furanone C30 with the HalI and HalR protein model are shown as 2D diagrams <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold> and 3D diagrams <bold>(a&#x02013;d)</bold>. The key amino acids of the proteins are shown as thin sticks, ligands are shown as thick sticks, hydrogen bonds are shown as green lines, and hydrophobic forces are shown using a light violet color. Receptor surfaces were displayed as H bonds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-09-03324-g005"/></fig><p>The hydrogen-bonding interactions are considered to play a major role in the process where ligands dock with the LuxR-type receptor (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gerdt et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, <sc>L</sc>-carvone showed a better <italic>in silico</italic> affinity toward HalR than the halogenated furanone C30, because of a higher LibDock score and additional hydrogen bonds. <sc>L</sc>-carvone and C<sub>6</sub>-HSL can form hydrogen bonds with the HalR protein at a common site, SER101, indicating a possible competitive action between them. Combined with the GC-MS results, these data confirm that the inhibitory mechanism of <sc>L</sc>-carvone on the QS system of <italic>H. alvei</italic> might involve the interaction of <sc>L</sc>-carvone with the HalI protein and subsequent interference of AHL biosynthesis in <italic>H. alvei</italic>. In addition, we also characterized the effects of <sc>L</sc>-carvone treatment using transcriptomics, and observed that the <italic>halI</italic> and <italic>halR</italic> genes were significantly downregulated in <italic>H. alvei</italic>, similar to the results reported in a previous research study (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). The RT-qPCR results were consistent with those of the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, which enhanced the credibility of the QS inhibitory mechanism of <sc>L</sc>-carvone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that <sc>L</sc>-carvone had a significant inhibitory activity on the QS system by reducing the AHL-mediated production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in <italic>H. alvei</italic>. More specifically, <sc>L</sc>-carvone combined with the AHL synthase HalI via hydrogen bonds, which led to the disruption of AHL biosynthesis. Understanding the roles and functions of QS in food ecosystems can help in preventing the colonization of food surfaces, toxin formation, and proliferation of food-related bacteria. Therefore, <sc>L</sc>-carvone, with a QS inhibitory activity, is a promising agent for controlling foodborne pathogens and improving food safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>TL and YM contributed to the conception of the study.
