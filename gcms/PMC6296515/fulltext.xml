Here we report a novel function of RARRES1 in metabolic reprogramming of epithelial cells. Using non-targeted LC-MS, we discovered that RARRES1 depletion in epithelial cells caused a global increase in lipid synthesis. RARRES1-depleted cells rewire glucose metabolism by switching from aerobic glycolysis to glucose-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL). Treatment with fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor, C75, reversed the effects of RARRES1 depletion. The increased DNL in RARRES1-depleted normal breast and prostate epithelial cells proved advantageous to the cells during starvation, as the increase in fatty acid availability lead to more oxidized fatty acids (FAO), which were used for mitochondrial respiration. Expression of RARRES1 in several common solid tumors is also contextually correlated with expression of fatty acid metabolism genes and fatty acid-regulated transcription factors. Pathway enrichment analysis led us to determine that RARRES1 is regulated by peroxisome proliferating activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. These findings open up a new avenue for metabolic reprogramming and identify RARRES1 as a potential target for cancers and other diseases with impaired fatty acid metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007188</institution-id><institution>Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-1-0424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3036-3518</contrib-id><name><surname>Byers</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Department of Defense</institution></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-1-0424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Georgetown University</institution></funding-source><award-id>SRP Grant 2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6085-0766</contrib-id><name><surname>Maimouni</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Georgetown University CTSA</institution></funding-source><award-id>NIH TL1 Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6085-0766</contrib-id><name><surname>Maimouni</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Shared Resources of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA051008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3036-3518</contrib-id><name><surname>Byers</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a TL-1 Fellowship from the Georgetown University CTSA (SM), DOD grant W81XWH-12-1-0424 to SB and DK, a Medical graduate student organization (MCGSO) mini grant (SM) and Shared Resources of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center P30-CA051008.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="27"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Our co-expression data and LC-MS and GC-MS data were deposited in Dryad: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4">10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4</ext-link>; Link to data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4">https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Our co-expression data and LC-MS and GC-MS data were deposited in Dryad: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4">10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4</ext-link>; Link to data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4">https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6t1m4k4</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinoic acid receptor responder element 1 (RARRES1), also known as tazarotene induced gene 1 (TIG1), was initially identified as a novel retinoic acid receptor-regulated gene in the skin [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We showed in prostate cancer cells that RARRES1 is able to induce autophagy, decrease mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), two important regulators of energy homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RARRES1 also induces autophagy in cervical cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ability of RARRES1 to regulate the expression of metabolic master regulators and induce autophagy suggests that it might function to reprogram metabolism in cells.</p><p>RARRES1 is differentially expressed in metabolic diseases and is associated with biological hallmarks that require metabolic reprogramming. For example, RARRES1 is among the most up-regulated genes in subcutaneous fat from obese human subjects on a diet-induced weight loss and among the most downregulated genes during weight maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In adipocyte differentiation, in which metabolic reprogramming is crucial, RARRES1 is increased during dedifferentiation and decreased during differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. RARRES1 is also differentially expressed in mouse models of hepatic steatosis and cholestatic liver disease [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Although RARRES1 is among the most commonly methylated genes in multiple cancers, it is actually increased in basal-like hormone receptor negative breast cancer and in liver cirrhosis, a risk factor for hepatocellular cancer [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Metabolic reprogramming is now considered a hallmark of cancer etiology [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For decades, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg Effect) was considered to be the most important energetic pathway that cancer cells use to survive and proliferate[<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it is now clear that oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism play a major role in cancer progression and drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Here we demonstrate that RARRES1 is regulated by starvation and that its depletion in epithelial cells reprograms metabolism by modulating a switch from aerobic glycolysis to glucose dependent <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL). RARRES1 depletion modulated DNL and increased substrates (endogenous fatty acids) for fatty acid oxidation during serum starvation and pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid synthase. We also show that <italic>RARRES1</italic> expression correlates with that of fatty acid metabolism genes in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Two of these genes, peroxisome proliferating activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;) were found to regulate RARRES1 expression in epithelial cells. These findings identify RARRES1 as a novel modulator of lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell-culture</title><p>HEK293T was cultured in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.

ECAR was measured at baseline and after adding glucose (10 mM), oligomycin (1 &#x003bc;M) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (100 mM) respectively. Fatty Acid Oxidation measurements were done as recommended by Agilent Seahorse. Cells in nutrient-rich media, were treated with BPTES (a glutaminolysis inhibitor), UK-5099 (a glycolysis inhibitor) and etomoxir (a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor). The cells were assessed for their dependency on each pathway and their plasticity when each pathway is inhibited. To measure fatty acid oxidation in a starved state, cells were starved with minimal substrate DMEM for 24 hours. The minimal substrate media included 1% serum, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5 mM carnitine, and 0.5 mM of glucose. Insulin, EGF and hydrocortisone were excluded from the media.

We treated the cells with oleic acid for 4 hours or overnight (12 hours), respectively, to induce lipid droplets since these cells do not readily form visible lipid droplets in normal conditions. Cells that exogenously expressed RARRES1 had a striking decrease in lipid droplet accumulation compared to YFP expressing cells and the surrounding cells that did not take up the RARRES1-YFP plasmid (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref></bold>). This indicates that higher levels of RARRES1 leads to the degradation or oxidation of exogenous fatty acids rather than their storage in lipid droplets. Conversely, depletion of RARRES1 leads to the accumulation of lipids. Consistent with this observation, RARRES1 expression in prostate and cervical cancer cells induces autophagy, a cellular response that sequesters and degrades lipid droplets during starvation, a mechanism called lipophagy [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Nutrient deprivation is also a major regulator of lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

It is important to note that the increase in RARRES-1 expression is only seen in normal epithelial cells. Cancer cells, in which <italic>RARRES1</italic> is silenced, cannot increase RARRES1 protein level after starvation. Taken together these data show that RARRES1 depletion in epithelial cells increases lipid content while RARRES1 overexpression decreases lipid accumulation, most likely through the upregulation of autophagy.

Aerobic glycolysis was examined in RARRES1-depleted epithelial cells using the extracellular flux assay- Glycolysis Stress Test kit (Seahorse, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Glycolytic usage was determined by measuring the extracellular acidification rate reached by a given cell after the addition of saturating amounts of glucose. Oligomycin was then injected to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and force the cell to use its glucose for glycolysis, which is observed by an increased extracellular acidification rate [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].This shift in ECAR is called the glycolytic capacity. Changes in glycolytic capacity were therefore assessed in RARRES1-depleted MCF 10A and PWR-1E cells. RARRES1 -depleted MCF 10A cells had a marked decrease in glucose usage but their capacity to induce glycolysis was higher than the control cells, which indicates that there is no glycolytic dysfunction (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s006">S6A Fig</xref></bold>). The same glycolytic capacity phenomenon was also observed in PWR-1E cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>). We next measured the glycolytic reserve which is the difference between basal glycolysis and the glycolytic capacity. This determines the glucose that is not used in the basal state. The glycolytic reserve can provide insight on whether glucose is stored or shuttled to other pathways besides aerobic glycolysis. In both cell lines their glycolytic reserve increased, which shows that there is an increase in glucose being redirected to pathways other than glycolysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Glucose can also be utilized for oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial respiration). We thus used the extracellular flux assay to measure oxygen consumption rate, which determines the mitochondrial respiration activity. We first treated cells with glucose and after 12 minutes of incubation, cells were treated with oligomycin, the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, to measure glucose-mediated OCR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s006">S6C Fig</xref></bold>). There was no difference between scrambled siRNA and RARRES1 siRNA transfected cells. This indicates that RARRES1-depleted cells do not redirect their glucose for oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. Instead, glucose is being reprogrammed for other pathways.</p><p>The decrease in citrate levels, increase in lipid synthesis and glycolytic reprogramming in RARRES1- depleted epithelial cells suggest that glucose is mostly likely used for glucose- dependent DNL (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). To test this, we used the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, which has been noted to markedly decrease lipid content by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and increase citrate levels at a concentration of 40 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We next examined whether C75 treatment can reverse the glycolytic reprogramming seen in RARRES1-depleted cells. We treated RARRES1-depleted MCF 10A cells with C75 for 1 hour or 2 hours at a concentration of 40 &#x003bc;M. In C75 treated MCF 10A cells, both control and RARRES1-depleted cells increased glycolytic usage and decreased their glycolytic reserve compared to the vehicle treated groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). These observations indicate that MCF 10A cells have a significant basal level of DNL. Importantly, treatment of RARRES1-depleted cells with C75 completely reversed the decrease in glucose usage seen in the vehicle-treated cells and they had higher aerobic glycolytic activity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). C75 also reversed the changes in glycolytic reserve seen in the transient knockdown, as the glycolytic reserve is indistinguishable from the control group treated with 40 &#x003bc;M C75 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). We also assessed lipid droplet accumulation in RARRES1-depleted cells after treatment with 40 &#x003bc;M C75. C75 treatment reversed lipid droplet accumulation after 4 hours of treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s006">S6D Fig</xref></bold>). This indicates that RARRES1-depleted cells use glucose for fatty acid synthesis instead of aerobic glycolysis and that inhibition of FAS by C75 reverses this phenotype (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>) and the accumulation of lipid droplets in RARRES1-depleted cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>RARRES1 depletion enhances substrate availability for fatty acid oxidation during starvation</title><p>Several studies have shown that treatment with C75, at a concentration of 30 to 60 &#x003bc;g/mL, for 1 to 2 hours, decreases fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which is the incorporation of acetate into fat and increase in ATP production through palmitate oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We next examined whether C75 has any effect on ATP content of RARRES1-depleted cells compared to RARRES1-expressing cells.

The RARRES1-depleted cells were also capable of increasing ATP content after 3 hours of treatment unlike the control cells, in which a significant decrease in ATP concentration occurred at this time. This indicates that even though the RARRES1-depleted cells have more fatty acids available to oxidize for FAO, the cells in nutrient-rich conditions instead store the fatty acids until FAO is triggered by C75.</p><fig id="pone.0208756.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0208756.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>RARRES1 depletion regulates fatty acid oxidation.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> ATP content was quantified in transient RARRES1 KD MCF 10A cells and scrambled siRNA MCF 10A cells after 2 and 3 hours of 40 &#x003bc;g/mL C75 treatment. <bold>(B)</bold> All detected Acylcarnitines, AC-4:0 and AC-16:0, were quantified and validated in the non-targeted LC-MS results of RARRES1 siRNA transfected MCF 10A cells <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s002">S2A Fig</xref>)</bold>. The fold change was normalized to scrambled siRNA transfected MCF 10A cells. Fatty acid oxidation rate in RARRES1-depleted cells was measured in nutrient rich media. FAO dependency and flexibility of the cells were calculated. Initial inhibition of FAO by etomoxir measures how dependent the cells are on that particular fuel source to meet the energy demand.

Acylcarnitines are involved in the first committed step of FAO. Long chain fatty acids are catabolized to acetyl- coenzyme A, a major fuel for mitochondrial respiration (especially during starvation), acyl-CoAs must then be converted to acylcarnitine to cross the outer mitochondrial membrane [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Disorders of fatty acid metabolism are typically associated with primary and secondary forms of carnitine deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus monitoring carnitine levels is an accurate way to assess transportation of long chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Acylcarnitines were detected and identified in our non-targeted LC-MS analysis of MCF 10A cells in which RARRES1 was transiently depleted. Isobutyryl-L-carnitine (AC-4:0) and L-palmitoylcarnitine (AC-6:0) were increased in the transient knockdowns (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). The data suggests that RARRES1 depletion increases the uptake of fatty acids into the mitochondria, either for beta oxidation or their diversion to the cytoplasm for fatty acid elongation. To address this, we examined fatty acid oxidation activity. FAO is a pathway that breaks down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA and subsequently feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial respiration) [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The dependency on fatty acid oxidation was assessed by measuring OCR and treating cells with the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor (etomoxir) through the extracellular flux assay. There was no notable change in fatty acid oxidation dependency between control and RARRES1-depleted cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). As suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, RARRES1 does not affect fatty acid oxidation activity in normal conditions. This suggests that during normal conditions (high glucose (10 mM) and serum (5%)), fatty acyl-carnitines are most likely utilized in the mitochondria for complex fatty acid synthesis.</p><p>As was the case with C75 treatment, during glucose and serum starvation, cells redirect their glucose dependent mitochondrial respiration to fatty acid oxidation. Because changes in ATP content were seen in RARRES1 depleted cells after C75 treatment, we monitored fatty acid dependent mitochondrial respiration in transient RARRES1 depleted MCF 10A and PWR-1E epithelial cells in starved conditions (0.5 mM glucose and 1% horse serum) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). MCF 10A and PWR-1E cells were used to ensure that the changes in fatty acid oxidation are due to epithelial specific effects rather than MCF10A specific changes. We first monitored the utilization of exogenous fatty acids for FAO by treating the cells with exogenous palmitate or BSA (as a control). This experiment ensures that RARRES1-depleted cells do not influence uptake of fatty acids for FAO. As expected, the OCR of RARRES1-depleted cells was indistinguishable from control cells after treatment with exogenous fatty acids (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). We next examined the utilization of endogenous fatty acids for FAO during starvation. We depleted RARRES1 in PWR-1E and MCF 10A cells in normal conditions (10 mM glucose and 5% serum). 24 hour after transfection, fatty acid oxidation was triggered by depleting media of glucose and serum (1% serum and 0.5 mM glucose). RARRES1-depleted cells had a distinct oxygen consumption pattern compared to control cells. RARRES1 depleted MCF 10A cells had an increase in mitochondrial respiration that was reversed by treatment with the FAO inhibitor etomoxir (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). The normal metabolic needs of prostate epithelial cells are different than mammary epithelial cells. For example, prostate tissue produces and secretes a significant amount of citrate instead of diverting it towards production of endogenous fatty acids through DNL [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In turn, they rely on exogenous fatty acids to induce fatty acid oxidation. Specifically during glucose starvation, they rely solely on exogenous fatty acids to produce ATP through mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, even in these cells, RARRES1 depletion significantly reversed the phenotype in glucose and serum starved conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s007">S7A Fig</xref></bold>).</p><p>These data demonstrate that cells in which RARRES1 expression is reduced, a phenomenon that occurs in (cancer cells, where the gene is silenced or suppressed, exposure to nutrient replete conditions (or treatment with palmitate) does not trigger fatty acid oxidation. Instead, RARRES1 depletion renders cancer cells more energetic when starved or treated with C75, mechanisms that trigger fatty acid oxidation, due to the increase in lipid substrates available for fatty acid oxidation. As transient starvation is a common phenomenon that occurs during nutrient deprivation and in the center of large tumors, our data suggest that cells may adapt to these harsh environments by reducing RARRES1 levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>RARRES1 gene expression in common solid tumors correlates with fatty acid metabolism genes</title><p>In addition to its role in hepatosteatosis and other metabolic disorders, RARRES1 is among the most commonly methylated genes in multiple human tumors [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Peroxisome proliferating activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;) in complex with RXR were predicted to bind to the non-coding regions of RARRES1 gene (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g004">Fig 4C</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s011">S2 Table</xref>).</bold> In addition, examination of the publicly available ChIP-X database, a web-based curated and interactive application that includes ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, ChIP-PET and DamID studies in order to identify genome binding sites and target genes of transcription factors, for RARRES1 binding transcription factors clearly shows that PPARs are found in association with the RARRES1 promoter [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>We thus evaluated whether PPAR signaling and treatment with their fatty acid ligands can regulate the expression of RARRES1. As noted earlier, RARRES1 is silenced in cancer cells; therefore normal epithelial cells, where RARRES1 is endogenously expressed, are the best models to use to assess whether PPARs can regulate the expression of RARRES1. We first treated in MCF 10A and PWR-1E cells with an omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an endogenous agonist of PPAR &#x003b1; and PPAR &#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. There was a rapid decrease in RARRES1 transcription after 30 minutes of treatment and a further decrease in its transcription at later times in MCF 10A cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g004">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). RARRES1 expression in PWR-1E cells also responded to DHA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208756.s007">S7B Fig</xref></bold>). We then treated cells with synthetic PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b1; agonists to identify, which PPAR isotype regulates RARRES1 expression. We observed induction of RARRES1 transcription by PPAR&#x003b3; agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, and reduction in RARRES1 expression with fenofibrate, a PPAR&#x003b1; agonist, after 48 hours of treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g004">Fig 4E</xref></bold>). Primary hepatocytes did not respond to rosiglitazone and pioglitazone because they do not express PPAR&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g004">Fig 4E</xref></bold>). This also suggests that PPAR&#x003b3; agonists regulate expression through PPAR&#x003b3; and not by a non-specific effect. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are known to induce lipid droplets whereas fenofibrate increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases lipid droplet content [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. RARRES1 could be regulated to attenuate the metabolic effects that are induced by these agonists. Taken together, we show that RARRES1 is contextually correlated with fatty acid metabolism genes in common solid tumors and we subsequently show that two of these RARRES1 correlated genes (PPARs) modulate the expression of RARRES1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that RARRES1 depletion in normal epithelial cells increases lipid content while RARRES1 overexpression decreases lipid accumulation. Second, we demonstrate that the increase seen in RARRES1-depleted cells is through glucose-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. The phenotype is reversed when RARRES1-depleted cells are treated with C75, a lipogenesis inhibitor. Third, we find that RARRES1-depleted cells do not trigger fatty acid oxidation in nutrient replete or palmitate supplemented media. Instead, RARRES1 depletion primes the cells to have a more energetic phenotype during starvation due to the increase in endogenous fatty acid substrates available for FAO (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>). This phenotype is reversed when cells are treated with the FAO inhibitor, etomoxir. RARRES1 expression was also contextually correlated to fatty acid metabolism genes in multiple cancer types. We demonstrated that two of these genes, peroxisome proliferating activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;) regulate RARRES1 expression in epithelial cells. These findings identify RARRES1 as a novel regulator of lipid metabolism.</p><fig id="pone.0208756.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0208756.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Effects of RARRES1 depleted vs. RARRES1-expressing epithelial cells on lipid metabolism.</title><p>Unlike RARRES1 expressing cells, RARRES1 depleted cells increase <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis.

For example RARRES1 is the most up-regulated gene in subcutaneous fat from obese human subjects on a diet-induced weight loss regimen, and is among the most downregulated genes in adipose tissue during weight maintenance in the obese human subjects [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Examination of deposited microarray data from a study focusing on hyperinsulinemia indicated that RARRES1 was also markedly decreased after insulin treatment in human skeletal muscles [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. RARRES1 increased during dedifferentiation of adipocytes and decreased during differentiation and is differentially expressed in mouse models of hepatic steatosis and cholestatic liver disease [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our study is the first to demonstrate a direct role for RARRES1 in the changes of lipid metabolism associated with these metabolic diseases.</p><p>RARRES1 is silenced in colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, Wilms tumor and leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Colorectal cancer and prostate cancer cell lines transfected with RARRES1 were less invasive and more apoptotic [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These findings support the idea of RARRES1 as a tumor suppressor, although this has not been formally demonstrated in animals. However, RARRES1 is increased in some mesenchymal-like cancers such as triple negative breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208756.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). The present study demonstrates an important role for RARRES1 in fatty acid metabolism and may explain the duality of RARRES1 in cancer etiology. The role of fatty metabolism on cancer progression is also contextual. During nutrient deprivation, fatty acid degradation is necessary and fatty acid synthesis, specifically DNL, is increased in metastasis and certain cancers like prostate cancer, consistent with the decrease of RARRES1 expression in prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. There is also evidence of changes in fatty acid metabolism preference in different subtypes of breast cancer, in which RARRES1 is differentially expressed. For example, fatty acid oxidation is disproportionately dysregulated in triple negative breast cancers compared to other subtypes of breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Hormone receptor status in breast cancer also correlates with changes in lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that RARRES1 is a novel regulator of fatty acid metabolism in epithelial cells and points to an important role in diseases in which lipid metabolism is a hallmark of disease progression. Treatments that regulate RARRES1 expression or activity could have utility in obesity, cholestatic liver disease, heart disease (in which RARRES1 expression is markedly decreased in hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy) and cancers where lipogenesis is crucial for the progression of certain tumors [<xref rid="pone.0208756.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208756.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Non-targeted LC-MS analysis of transient RARRES1 KD in MCF 10A cells.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Heat map of all metabolites significantly altered were depicted. <bold>(B)</bold> Important features in transient RARRES1 KD MCF 10A cells were selected by volcano plot with fold change threshold (x) 2 and t-tests threshold (y) 0.05.
