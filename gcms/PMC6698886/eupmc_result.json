    "Plants of genus Salvia have been used in folk medicine for wound healing, in the alleviation of stomach, liver, and rheumatism pains, as antioxidant, cognitive-enhancer, sedative and antiseptic, stimulant and tonic agents. The present study aimed to evaluate whether Salvia multicaulis essential oil (1% and 3%) administered for 21 days attenuates cognitive deficits and exhibits anxiolytic and antidepressant-profile in the scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats. Rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 6): (1) control, (2) scopolamine (Sco, 0.7 mg/kg) (3, 4) S. multicaulis essential oil treatment groups (SEO, 1% and 3%), (5) diazepam (DIAZ, 1.5 mg/kg) and (6) tramadol (TRM, 10 mg/kg). To establish an animal model of amnesia, Sco (0.7 mg/kg), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, was injected into male Wistar rats. Y-maze (memory), radial arm-maze (memory), elevated plus-maze (anxiety), and forced swimming (depression) tests were employed. Molecular interactions of chemical compounds from the essential oil with the GABAA receptor was explored via molecular docking experiments. Using behavioral tests, we demonstrated that inhalation of S. multicaulis essential oil exerts significant antiamnesic activity as well as anxiolytic-antidepressant-like effects in the Sco-treated rats. Our data revealed that S. multicaulis oil could act as a promising phytopharmaceutical agent for improving dementia-related abnormalities."
