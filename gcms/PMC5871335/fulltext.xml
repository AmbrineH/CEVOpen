(benzene, toluene, xylenes, BTX) were prepared by
the catalytic pyrolysis of
six different black liquors using both in situ and ex situ approaches.
A wide range of catalysts was screened and conditions were optimized
in microscale reactors. Up to 7 wt % of BTX, based on the organic
fraction of the black liquors, was obtained for both the in situ and
ex situ pyrolysis (<italic>T</italic> = 500&#x02013;600 &#x000b0;C) using
a Ga-modified H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The in situ catalytic pyrolysis of
black liquors from hardwood paper mills afforded slightly higher yields
of aromatics/BTX than softwood black liquors, a trend that could be
confirmed by the results obtained in the ex situ catalytic pyrolysis.
An almost full deoxygenation of the lignin and carbohydrate fraction
was achieved and both organic fractions were converted to a broad
range of (substituted) aromatics. The zeolite catalyst used was remarkably
stable and even after 100 experiments in batch mode with intermittent
oxidative catalyst regeneration, the yields and selectivity toward
BTX remained similar. The ex situ pyrolysis of black liquor has potential
for large-scale implementation in a paper mill without disturbing
the paper production process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>Conversion of black liquors

welfare levels will
result in a steady growing demand for materials, including plastics
in the near future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The foreseen reduction
in fossil resource supply, in combination with the demand for more
environmentally friendly processes (CO<sub>2</sub> reduction) make
renewable biomass an attractive candidate for the preparation of plastics.
Low molecular weight aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes
(BTX) are important building blocks for high-volume plastics, including
several polyesters and polyurethanes, and many examples in both the
open and patent literature describe the attempts to prepare BTX from
biomass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Routes currently under
investigation for preparation of aromatics
from nonpetrochemical sources are aqueous-phase reforming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> conversion of syngas into aromatics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> dehydration, and aromatization of pyrolysis oil
and alcohols with zeolites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and for the production
of <italic>p</italic>-xylene, a chemoenzymatic route is claimed involving
the dimerization/dehydrocyclization of renewable isobutanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, benzene and also ethylene are formed
during the gasification of biomass at high temperatures (<italic>T</italic> &#x0003e; 850 &#x000b0;C) and by catalytic hydrotreatment of either biomass
fractions like lignin or pyrolysis oils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Catalytic
pyrolysis of biomass toward BTX has been recognized as
an attractive technology as it is a scalable one-step procedure, most
often utilizing commercially available zeolite catalysts for aromatization.
Various biomass feed-streams, including lignins, have been identified
for their potential to produce bio-aromatics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been reported
for the catalytic pyrolysis of black liquor, an important and high-volume
lignin-containing stream of the paper industry, toward these essential
building blocks for the chemical industry.</p><p>Black liquor is formed
in the paper production by the digestion
of pulpwood. In the Kraft paper process the addition of sodium hydroxide
and sodium sulfide to pulpwood results in the extraction of lignins
and hemicellulose from the insoluble cellulose fraction. The liquor
obtained is most often concentrated toward approximately 30% water
content and subsequently added to large recovery boilers for energy
production and to recover the cooking chemicals from the pulping process.
The black liquor produced in this Kraft paper process consists of
an aqueous solution of lignin, tall oil, turpentine, (depolymerized)
oxidized (hemi)cellulose fragments, and inorganic salts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Until now, most of the research programs
performed on the pyrolysis
of black liquor focused on the noncatalytic, thermochemical conversion
for mainly energy and syngas production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Bhattacharya et al. pyrolyzed black liquor solids of different sizes
in a fixed bed reactor under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at different
temperatures (<italic>T</italic> = 590&#x02013;740 &#x000b0;C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Improved yields of bio-oils (liquids, condensed
volatiles) and gases were obtained at higher temperatures. At a reaction
time of 15 min black liquor was converted to roughly 50% char, 30%
liquids, and 20% gases (H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S). The particle size of the black liquor solids
only had small effects on the product distribution. The results obtained
were confirmed by studies of Demirbas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> High heating
rates and rapid quenching of the volatiles obtained are beneficial
for biocrude production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The fast quenching of volatiles
formed during pyrolysis avoids secondary pyrolysis toward higher molecular
weight compounds. Fletcher and co-workers recently used a chemical
percolation devolatilization model (CPD), originally developed for
pyrolysis of coal, to predict biocrude and light gas yields from black
liquor. The model includes the effect of heating rate, temperature,
residence time and pressure on char, pyrolysis oil and gas formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p><p>In general, the yield of bio-oils (condensed
volatiles) from pyrolyzed
black liquor solids are lower than for typical lignocellulosic biomass
streams such as cellulose or lignocellulose. The high amount of alkali
salts (NaOH, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) are considered to slow
down the formation of alcohols, phenols, hydrocarbons and aldehydes/ketones
during pyrolysis and higher temperatures are needed for release. As
a result side reactions and secondary pyrolysis of volatiles occur
that negatively influence the formation of condensable volatiles.
Addition of CaO, CuCO<sub>3</sub>, and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> slightly
increased the amount of liquids formed during pyrolysis of black liquor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no attempts
in either the open and
patent literature describe the catalytic pyrolysis of crude black
liquor toward aromatics. The study described in this paper focuses
on the catalytic pyrolysis of concentrated black liquors and their
potential to produce bio-aromatics, including BTX. Our approach was
to first screen a wide range of commercially available zeolite catalysts
for their potential to convert different black liquors to aromatics
in an in situ microscale unit (PTV GC-MS). In this setup the black
liquor is mixed with the catalyst and subsequently pyrolyzed under
an inert atmosphere. The most promising catalysts were screened in
an ex situ setup using a Tandem micro-Reactor (TMR) and optimized
for BTX synthesis. In an ex situ approach black liquors are first
pyrolyzed toward a complex mixture of small organic molecules and
subsequently catalytically aromatized in a second reaction chamber.
In addition, black liquors from various sources were tested and the
best one considering BTX yield was identified. Finally, irreversible
catalyst deactivation by e.g. accumulation of salts present in the
black liquors was tested using catalyst recycle experiments in a microreactor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Six
black liquors, obtained from various

under static air conditions with the following temperature program:
heating from room temperature to 550 &#x000b0;C within 8 h, then held
at this temperature for 8 h before cooling down. The powder was then
compacted using a mechanical hydraulic press under 7 bar pressure
for 10 s, crushed, and sieved to 212&#x02013;425 &#x003bc;m particle

procedure (TAPPI standard test
method T-650 pm-84) was used for the determination of the organic,
inorganic and water content of black liquors. A known amount (10&#x02013;12
g, triplicate) of black liquor was dried in a hot air oven at 105
&#x000b1; 2 &#x000b0;C until constant weight. The amount of water was determined
by the difference in weight before and after the experiment. Subsequently,
the crucible with the dried contents was placed in a muffle furnace
at <italic>T</italic> = 525 &#x000b1; 25 &#x000b0;C. Contents were allowed
to burn to a constant weight. The total organic content of wet black
liquor was determined by the difference in weight before and after
the experiment and the remaining residue reflects the inorganic part
of the black liquor. For black liquor obtained from Eucalyptus hardwood
the lignin content was determined according to literature procedures.
Freeze-dried samples of black liquors were obtained by first freezing
the black liquors in a flash using liquid nitrogen and subsequently
subliming the water using high vacuum.</p><p>Analysis of the organic
products of the (catalytic) pyrolysis experiments was performed by
gas chromatography (GC), using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series equipped
with a Restek Rx1&#x02013;5Sil column (length 30 m, diameter 0.25 mm
and film 10 &#x003bc;m) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) Hewlett-Packard
5972 series detector. The injection temperature was set to 280 &#x000b0;C,
with a split of 50:1. The oven program started at 45 &#x000b0;C for 5
min, then heated up to 100 &#x000b0;C at a rate of 10 &#x000b0;C/min, then
to 200 &#x000b0;C at a rate of 20 &#x000b0;C/min and finally to 300 &#x000b0;C
at a rate of 30 &#x000b0;C/min and kept constant for 3 min before cooling
down.</p><p>Quantification of aromatics produced in the PTV-GC/MS
and TMR was
performed by means of an external calibration method using benzene,
toluene, and o-, m-, <italic>p</italic>-xylene. Injection of calibration
solutions was performed by a hot needle approach where the needle
was allowed to heat up for 3&#x02013;5 s in the GC-injector before
the plunger was pressed. The injection temperature was set to 280
&#x000b0;C, the split to 50:1 and the helium flow was kept constant at
50 mL/min. Quantification of CFP (catalytic fast pyrolysis) products
was done using an adjusted GC oven program, starting by maintaining
an oven temperature of 40 &#x000b0;C for 3 min followed by heating to
300 &#x000b0;C with a rate of 10 &#x000b0;C/min. The GC inlet temperature
was set to 280 &#x000b0;C. The peaks in GC chromatograms were interpreted
by the NIST05 library of mass spectra and grouped to several product
classes for brevity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>In Situ Pyrolysis (PTV-GC/MS)</title><p>For
the in situ pyrolysis
of black liquors, a programmable temperature vaporizer was used. Catalyst
and black liquor were mixed or layered and put into a DMI insert (microvial,
30 &#x003bc;L). The vial was subsequently inserted into a liner and
supported at a fixed height by quartz wool. A continuous flow of helium
(50 mL/min) was used to maintain an inert atmosphere. The temperature
and pressure in the injector were controlled by an optic 2 device.
A split of 1/50 was applied to furnish a 1 mL/min flow on the GC column
(HP 5890 series II GC with an Agilent column VF-5MS 30 &#x000d7; 0.25
mm, 1 &#x003bc;L film thickness). The flow was led to a mass selective
detector (HP 5972 series MSD). The PTV was operated at a starting
temperature of 40 &#x000b0;C, followed by ramping at a speed of 20 &#x000b0;C/s
until the final temperature of 600 &#x000b0;C was reached. The yields

conditions for the pyrolysis (first reactor) and aromatization unit
(second reactor). A carrier gas inlet was connected on the top of
the first reactor, providing carrier gas flow through the reactors
into the GC-MS. The entire system was attached by a docking station
on top of the GC-MS and connected by an injection needle through a
rubber septum.</p><p>Before experiments, approximately 80 mg of a
ZSM-5 catalyst was put in a quartz liner inside the second reactor.
Thereafter, the system was pressurized to 150 kPa with an inert carrier
gas (helium) to check for leakage. After the leak check, the pressure
was set back to 50 kPa using a helium flow rate of 50 mL/min and the
system was heated (reactor 1:550 &#x000b0;C, reactor 2:575 &#x000b0;C and
for both interfaces: 300 &#x000b0;C). A stainless steel cup was filled
with black liquor and attached to the sample injector, which hangs
slightly above the first reactor. The system was closed and flushed
for 3 min with helium gas. After flushing, the cup was dropped into
the first reactor to start the pyrolysis reaction. The vapor products
travel through the ZSM-5 catalyst bed before entering the GC-MS. The

of the Catalyst
(Homogeneous/Heterogeneous (Top-Layered)) on the Yield of BTX for
In Situ Catalytic Pyrolysis of Black Liquors</title><p>Our screening
started with a black liquor originating from a Kraft process using
Eucalyptus wood as the feed. Three different catalysts (H-ZSM-5 (23),
H-ZSM-5 (50), and mordenite, in 20-fold weight excess on black liquor)
were explored to determine the effect of water content and the particle
size of the black liquor source and the distribution of the catalyst
in the sample (homogeneous/heterogeneous (top-layered)) on the yield
of BTX for in situ catalytic pyrolysis. To investigate the effect
of water and particle size, the black liquor as received from the
paper mill, freeze-dried black liquor and freeze-dried black liquor
that was sieved (particle size &#x0003c;150 &#x003bc;m) before testing were
used. Furthermore, two mixing procedures of catalyst-freeze-dried
black liquor were tested, namely, (i) where the black liquor was homogeneously
mixed with the catalyst and (ii) where the catalyst was placed on
top of the black liquor.</p><p>Experiments were performed in a PTV-GC/MS
and a typical GC chromatogram of an experiment is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. It clearly shows
the formation of substituted low molecular weight aromatics, including
benzene, toluene and xylenes. Besides these aromatics, it shows the
presence of higher substituted polycyclic aromatics. Almost no phenols
or other oxygen-containing compounds were present and the zeolite
catalyst is thus clearly able to deoxygenate almost all organic vapors
being formed in the pyrolysis process and to convert it to aromatics
under the conditions used. Within this setup, mass balances are far
from complete and not included are char formation, formation of gas
phase components and higher molecular weight aromatics. The latter
are insufficiently volatile and thus not detectable using gas chromatography.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Typical

that the yields (based on the organic

2.80% with the as received black liquor, and 1.90&#x02013;2.25% for
the various freeze-dried substrates. The presence of water may possibly
lead to a more efficient breakdown of the biopolymers or prevents
repolymerization. As such, the black liquor as received (including
water) from the paper mill was used as the starting material for further
studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>In Situ Catalyst Screening Studies Using
As Received Eucalyptus
Black Liquor</title><p>On the basis of the initial screening experiments
described in the previous section, a more extended in situ catalyst
screening study was conducted using a PTV GC-MS micro reactor with
ZSM-5 based catalysts and as received &#x0201c;wet&#x0201d; black liquor
from Eucalyptus wood. The final temperature of the pyrolysis reactor
was set at <italic>T</italic> = 550 &#x000b0;C, the ramping rate was
at <italic>T</italic> = 20 &#x000b0;C/s and the catalyst/biomass ratio
(C:B) was 20. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> shows the yields of BTX for the set of catalysts screened. The ZSM-5
series have highest potential for preparation of BTX. As such, the
pore size of this catalyst (5.4&#x02013;5.6 &#x000c5;) is likely the best
for aromatization of small organic fragments originating from the
(oxidized) carbohydrate fraction of black liquor and for the deoxygenation
of phenols, resulting from the lignin fraction, toward BTX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The acidity of the catalyst seems to have an
optimum for H-ZSM-5 (50), as lower yields of BTX are obtained using
a more acidic (H-ZSM-5 (23) and less acidic (H-ZSM-5 (80) and H-ZSM-5
(280)) catalyst. In line with this observation is that the Na salt
of some of the catalysts used were inactive.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>BTX yields for in situ

slightly increased the yield of BTX to 3.25%. The Ga-ZSM-5 (23) afforded
slightly lower yields but also in this case the yield is higher compared
to the H-ZSM-5 (23) catalyst. The yields for the Zn- and Mo-ZSM-5
(23) catalysts are in line with the nonmetal impregnated zeolite and
thus these metals do not seem to have a beneficial effect on BTX formation.
In general the selectivity between the individual aromatics is in
the order xylenes &#x0003e; toluene &#x0003e; benzene.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>In Situ Catalytic Pyrolysis
with Best Catalysts Using Various
Black Liquors</title><p>To investigate the influence of the composition
of the feedstock on BTX yield, black liquors of different sources
(eucalyptus hardwood, soda southern hardwood, Kraft northern hardwood,
Kraft southern hardwood, Kraft northern softwood, Kraft southern softwood)
were used and screened for the in situ pyrolysis with the best catalysts
H-ZSM-5 (50) and Ga-ZSM-5 (50). As commercially used zeolite catalysts
are most often embedded in a matrix we also studied the results for
the pyrolysis of black liquors using a commercially spray-dried catalyst
containing a zeolite (H-ZSM-5) catalyst and H-ZSM-5 (23) coated on
a commercial spray-dried aluminum-based binder (SD binder) for BTX
formation (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>BTX yields for in situ catalytic pyrolysis of several black liquors</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sc-2017-03728b_0004" id="gr4" position="float"/></fig><p>Highest BTX yields for most of
the black liquors are observed for
the Ga-ZSM-5 (50) catalyst. Depending on the feedstock, the yields
of BTX vary between 3.25 and 6.75%, based upon organics in the feed.
The yields of BTX for Eucalyptus hardwood are slightly lower than
for the other black liquors. This may be due to an aging effect as
in this case the feed stock was already stored for &#x0003e;1 year, whereas
the other sources were screened within 1 month after production in
the paper mill. Furthermore, it seems that black liquors originating
from hardwood paper mills give higher yields of BTX compared to black
liquors from softwood paper mills for in situ catalytic pyrolysis.
This finding does not match the trends observed for the in situ catalytic
pyrolysis of purified lignins with H-ZSM-5 catalysts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> where softwood lignins (more guaiacyl units) results in a higher
yield of aromatics than hardwood lignin (more syringyl units). It
is well possible that other factors such as the composition of the
black liquors (amounts of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, sulfur containing
compounds, molecular weight of the lignins/carbohydrates), partly
related to the feed composition and partly to the process conditions
applied in the paper mill, play a role in the catalytic conversion
and have a larger influence than only the guiacyl/syringyl ratio of
the lignin fraction. Extended quantitative studies, beyond the scope
of the current study, will be required to draw definite conclusions.</p><p>In all cases the selectivity toward the individual aromatics is
almost similar and in the range benzene &#x0003c; toluene = xylenes, though
in the case of Ga-ZSM-5 (50) the ratio of benzene is slightly increased.
The yields obtained are in the range with a previous in situ pyrolysis
studies for 4 different lignins as performed by Mullen et al. (5&#x02013;7%).
However, in this case the Al/Si ratio and thus the acidity of the
ZSM-5 catalyst was not reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Ex Situ
Pyrolysis of Black Liquor</title><p>It is well-recognized
that one of the main disadvantages of an in situ catalytic pyrolysis
of biomass is the potential irreversible deactivation of the acidic
zeolite catalyst by inorganic cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) present in the feed stock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> As black liquor, originating from a paper mill, contains
high amounts sodium and potassium, this may lead to a reduction of
the acidity of the zeolite catalyst by H<sup>+</sup>/metal cation
exchange, resulting in a lower conversion toward aromatics. Though
this is not relevant for our experiments performed in the PTV, in
which we use excess catalyst, it strongly becomes an issue if the
process is scaled-up and the amount of catalyst is lowered significantly.
In an ex situ process the pyrolysis is separated from the catalytic
aromatization step, thereby avoiding direct contact between biomass
and the catalyst. Especially using black liquors as a feed stock,
the latter approach has more potential to be of commercial interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Ex Situ Pyrolysis in a Tandem micro-Reactor (TMR)</title><p>A
Tandem micro-Reactor (TMR) is especially suited to study the ex situ
pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks. It consists of two independent reactors
that can be fed with the biomass (reactor 1) and catalyst (reactor
2). Under an inert helium stream (51 mL/min) the organic vapors obtained
during pyrolysis (heating rate = 50&#x02013;70 &#x000b0;C/min.) are transported
to the catalyst (cat: BL ratio = 70) where, depending on the catalyst
and conditions used, aromatization is to occur.</p><p>In an initial
study, the effect of the temperature of the pyrolysis reactor (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) on the BTX yield was studied. For the ex
situ pyrolysis of Eucalyptus hardwood, the effect of T<sub>1</sub> within the range of <italic>T</italic> = 400&#x02013;600 &#x000b0;C
on the BTX yields was negligible. Wang and co-workers reported the
same results for the ex situ catalytic pyrolysis of hybrid poplar
toward aromatics and olefins and described this to two counteracting
processes. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures favor the formation of
small organic oxygen-containing fragments able to enter the pores
of the zeolite catalyst whereas on the other hand higher temperatures
result in an increased formation of small gas phase components and
particularly carbon oxides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup></p><p>The
effect of the temperature of the aromatization reactor (<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>) on the yield of BTX was investigated for
a number of catalysts and black liquor sources. The temperature of
the pyrolysis reactor (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) was set at
500 &#x000b0;C. For Eucalyptus hardwood black liquor, highest yields
of BTX were obtained using Ga-impregnated H-ZSM-5 (50) and H-ZSM-5
(23) at aromatization temperatures of <italic>T</italic> = 550&#x02013;600
&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>).
The yields (about 3.5%) are in line with the values observed for the
in situ catalytic pyrolysis. The impregnation of the catalysts with
gallium not only effects the Bronsted acidity of the catalysts but
it is also known that it positively influences the deoxygenation/decarbonylation
of phenols and is able to aromatize aliphatics/olefins, in our case
originating from remaining carbohydrates and the aliphatic backbone
of the lignin framework of black liquor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> For the nonimpregnated ZSM-5 analogues (23, 50, 80) the yields of
BTX are almost similar (<italic>T</italic> = 600&#x02013;625 &#x000b0;C)
but at lower temperatures higher Si&#x02013;Al ratio&#x02019;s (lower
acidity) result in lower yields of BTX.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>BTX yields for ex situ

advantage of an ex situ process is that it can more easily
be integrated in a paper mill as the residual char obtained after
pyrolysis can be (co)fed to the recovery boiler. In this way the inorganics
present in the char phase can be recycled to the paper mill and the
char may be used for energy generation. The ex situ catalytic pyrolysis
thus seems applicable for implementation in paper mills without a
major disturbance of the overall pulping process.</p><p>To the best
of our knowledge, the catalytic pyrolysis of black
liquor to BTX is not reported in the open literature. This makes it
difficult to compare our results with other research in this field.
Most relevant for our work are studies performed with lignin, as this
is the main organic fractions in black liquor. Recently, Zhou and
co-workers reported the ex situ pyrolysis of lignin over a H-ZSM-5
catalyst.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Though almost full deoxygenation
toward aromatics was observed, the isolated yield of the bio-oil obtained
was rather low (5.7 wt %, based on organics). The authors mentioned
that the low yields partly originate from inefficient condensation
of the low molecular weight aromatics formed. Also the amount of BTX
present in the bio-oil was not determined accurately. The catalytic
upgrading suffered from thermal char and also coke formation on the
catalyst. In their setup, a noncatalytic pyrolysis, afforded an oxygen-rich
bio-oil in a yield of 28 wt %.</p><p>The group of Prins reported the
ex situ pyrolysis of pine wood
with a ZSM-5 catalyst and compared the yield of liquid product formed
for the ex situ pyrolysis (20.2 wt %), the in situ pyrolysis (20.6
wt %) and a noncatalytic reaction (about 38 wt %).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> In both the in situ and ex situ pyrolysis, the liquid phase
mainly consisted of a mixture of phenols and aromatics, showing that
the oxygen removal is not complete. We have also compared the yields
for the in and ex situ catalytic pyrolysis for various black liquor
sources and the best catalyst in the series (H-ZSM-5 (50) and Ga-ZSM-5
(50), see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The results are given in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref> and show that the
BTX yields for in- and ex-situ approach do not differ significantly.
These findings are in line with the results from Prins et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of the BTX yields for the in and ex situ approach

of the phenolics toward aromatics is still under debate. It seems
likely that at first methoxy groups are cleaved by the high temperature
and acidity of the catalyst. As most of the monomers of lignins consist
of syringyl (S) and guaiacyl units (G) and to a lesser extent of <italic>p</italic>-hydroxphenyl units (H), this results in a mixture of mainly
catechols/pyrogallols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> It is well-known
that these intermediates are less stable than phenols and may defragment
under the harsh conditions, via the corresponding quinones, in smaller
units, able to enter the pores of the zeolite catalysts where the
actual aromatization takes place (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> However,
this does not seem to be the end point of the reaction and further

Studies Using H-ZSM-5 (23)</title><p>The lifetime of the zeolite catalysts
is one of the key parameters
in the commercial exploitation of catalytic pyrolysis of black liquors.
Deactivation owing to coke formation is known to be severe, though
reversible as the coke can easily be removed/gasified at high temperatures
in the presence of oxygen. Though the direct contact between biomass
and catalyst is avoided in the ex situ pyrolysis of black liquors
approach, the catalyst still might suffer from irreversible deactivation
owing to the formation of aerosols in the vapor phase after the primary
pyrolysis process containing some of the inorganic salts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> fouling and attrition. To test the irreversible
deactivation of the catalyst, eucalyptus black liquor was repeatedly
ex situ pyrolyzed using one catalyst batch in the TMR. Between each
experiment oxygen was introduced in the system to burn off the coke
formed on the catalyst, to be able to distinguish between reversible
(by coke) and irreversible deactivation. After each run fresh black
liquor was introduced in the pyrolysis chamber. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref> shows that even after 100 experiments the
catalyst is still active and the yield of BTX and the ratio of the
individual aromatics remains similar. This preliminary experiment
indicates that (i) reversible deactivation is not a major issue and
the coke formed during reaction may be burned off easily and (ii)
irreversible deactivation also does not occur to a significant extent.
As such, entrainment of metals from the pyrolysis reactor to the aromatization
reactor, for example, in the form of aerosols, seems not to be a major
issue.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Catalyst stability studies (H-ZSM-5 (23)) for the ex situ pyrolysis

potential for the production of green aromatics from concentrated
black liquors from paper mills was screened using microscale reactors
using both in situ and ex situ catalytic pyrolysis. Our screening
program showed that acidic, preferably gallium impregnated, H-ZSM-5
catalysts afforded BTX in yields of about 5&#x02013;7 wt % based on
the organic fraction present in the black liquor. The yields were
slightly dependent on the source of the black liquors and somewhat
higher yields were obtained for black liquors originating from hardwood
converting paper mills. No significant differences were observed in
the BTX yields for the in situ and ex situ approach. However, from
an industrial point of view the ex situ pyrolysis of black liquor
seems preferred as this prevents catalyst deactivation by inorganics
in the black liquor feed. The attractiveness of an ex situ process
is supported by the observation that significant deactivation of the
catalyst for the ex situ process was not observed (TMR) and after
100 experiments with intermittent oxidative regeneration to burn of
the coke, the catalyst remained the same activity/selectivity.</p><p>In subsequent studies the ex situ pyrolysis of black liquor will
be scaled-up to obtain higher amounts of product for full analyses
and to determine the overall mass balances. This, together with further
investigations regarding the stability of the catalyst during the
process, should provide the information about the commercially attractiveness
of the conversion of black liquor toward green aromatics.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="NOTES-d86e897-autogenerated" notes-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no
