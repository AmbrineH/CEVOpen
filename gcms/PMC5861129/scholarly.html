Abstract</div> <p>Flowers of the hop plant provide both bitterness and "hoppy" flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer. Here, we report that brewer’s yeast can be engineered to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil. Whereas metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways is commonly enlisted to maximize product titers, tuning expression of pathway enzymes to affect target production levels of multiple commercially important metabolites without major collateral metabolic changes represents a unique challenge. By applying state-of-the-art engineering techniques and a framework to guide iterative improvement, strains are generated with target performance characteristics. Beers produced using these strains are perceived as hoppier than traditionally hopped beers by a sensory panel in a double-blind tasting. </p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <p>Production of aromatic monoterpene molecules in hop flowers is affected by genetic, environmental, and processing factors.

Introduction</div> <p>During the brewing process, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> converts the fermentable sugars from grains into ethanol and a host of other flavor-determining by-products. Flowers of the hop plant, <i>Humulus lupulus</i> L., are typically added during the wort boil to impart bitter flavor and immediately before or during the fermentation to impart "hoppy" flavor and fragrance (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>a). Over the past two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries to source (total domestic sales have tripled over the past 10 years due to heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources: ~100 billion L of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops and considerable infrastructure is required to deliver water from its source to the farm <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR2">2</a> </sup>. Further, hops vary considerable in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Engineering brewer’s yeast to express monoterpene biosynthetic pathways thereby replacing flavor hop addition. <b>a</b> During the brewing process, <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> converts wort—a barley extract solution rich in fermentable sugars—into ethanol and other by-products. Hops are added immediately before, during, or after fermentation to impart "hoppy" flavor. Engineered strains produce linalool and geraniol, primary flavor components of hoppy beer, thereby replacing hop additions. <b>b</b> Six full-length plant-derived linalool synthase genes, as well as PTS-truncated variants, were expressed on high-copy plasmids. Full-length genes and PTS-truncated genes predicted by either ChloroP (C) or the RR-heuristic method (RR) are indicated by colored lines. <b>c</b> Error bars correspond to mean ± standard deviation of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant increases in monoterpene production compared with the control strain (Y) as determined by a <i>t</i>-test using <i>p</i>-value &amp;lt;0.025. The LIS from the California wildflower <i>Clarkia breweri</i> has been shown to increase production of linalool when heterologously expressed in plants <sup> <a href="#CR47">47</a> </sup> and in yeast <sup> <a href="#CR48">48</a> </sup>. However, when <i>C</i>. <i>breweri</i> LIS was expressed, either with native codons (n <i>Cb</i>) or "yeast-optimized" codons ( <i>Cb</i>), linalool was not detected. The <i>Mentha citrata</i> LIS ( <i>Mc</i>) truncated at the RR motif was identified as sufficiently active to allow for monoterpene production at levels characteristic of commercial beer and was chosen for integration into brewer’s yeast strains </p>   </div> <p /> <p>Hop flowers are densely covered by glandular trichomes, specialized structures that secrete secondary metabolites into epidermal outgrowths <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. These secretions accumulate as essential oil, which is rich in various terpenes, the class of metabolites that impart hoppy flavor to beer. Considerable research has investigated which of these molecules are primarily responsible for this flavor <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a> </sup>; these studies are complicated by genetic, environmental, and process-level variation <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup> and have suggested that the bouquet of flavor molecules contributed to beer by hops is complex. Nonetheless, the two monoterpene molecules linalool and geraniol have been identified as primary flavor determinants by several sensory analyses of hop extract aroma <sup> <a href="#CR6">6</a>– <a href="#CR8">8</a> </sup> and finished beer taste and aroma <sup> <a href="#CR7">7</a>, <a href="#CR9">9</a>– <a href="#CR11">11</a> </sup>, and together, they are major drivers of the floral aroma of Cascade hops <sup> <a href="#CR9">9</a> </sup>, the most widely used hop in American craft brewing <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Previous metabolic engineering efforts have achieved microbial monoterpene biosynthesis in various microbial hosts. Work in a domesticated wine yeast has demonstrated the feasibility of producing monoterpene compounds by biosynthesis in yeast by overexpression of a geraniol synthase from a high-copy plasmid propagated in selective media <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>. However, engineering genetically stable, controlled, precise production of a combination of specific flavorants in any industrial food-processing agent has remained a formidable challenge. </p> <p>In this work, we create drop-in brewer’s yeast strains capable of biosynthesizing monoterpenes that give rise to hoppy flavor in finished beer, without the addition of flavor hops. To achieve this end, we identify genes suitable for monoterpene biosynthesis in yeast; we develop methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains; we adapt genetic tools to generate a collection of engineered industrial yeast strains on an unprecedented scale; we develop computational methods to affect precise biosynthetic control and leverage them to create a iterative framework towards target production levels. Ultimately, sensory analysis performed with beer brewed in pilot industrial fermentations demonstrates that engineered strains confer hoppy flavor to finished beer. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Identification of yeast-active linalool and geraniol synthases</div> <p>The monoterpene synthases that catalyze the reaction of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) to linalool and geraniol in hops have not yet been identified <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>. However, genes from other plant species have been shown to encode these activities. To identify a linalool synthase (LIS) gene for functional heterologous expression in yeast, we expressed six different plant-derived LIS genes in a lab yeast strain engineered for high GPP precursor supply (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>). However, none of the full-length proteins exhibited sufficient activity to achieve target monoterpene concentrations in finished beer (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1c</a>). In plants, monoterpenes are biosynthesized in chloroplasts; plant monoterpene synthases, therefore, typically contain an N-terminal plastid targeting sequence (PTS) composed of 20–80 polar amino acids, which is cleaved to produce a mature protein. Truncation of the PTS sequence can improve expression and activity of microbially expressed monoterpene synthases <sup> <a href="#CR15">15</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. However, methods for predicting the optimal PTS truncation site, as well as for predicting portability of enzymes from plant species to yeast are imperfect. We therefore screened candidate LIS variants from different sources and with different truncation sites for increased activity (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a> and Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We tested bioinformatically predicted <sup> <a href="#CR17">17</a> </sup> PTS sites and observed a substantial increase in activity for the <i>Lycopersicon esculentum</i> LIS (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1c</a>). We also used a heuristic, structure-based approach for PTS prediction: a conserved double arginine (RR) motif that functions as part of an active-site lid preventing water access to the carbocationic reaction intermediate <sup> <a href="#CR18">18</a> </sup> lies immediately C-terminal to the PTS in several well-characterized terpene synthases <sup> <a href="#CR15">15</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. We observed the highest linalool titer from the truncated <i>M</i>. <i>citrata</i> LIS (t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS, Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1c</a>). An analogous screen of six geraniol synthases revealed that the heterologous expression of the full-length protein from <i>O</i>. <i>basilicum</i> ( <i>Ob</i>GES) leads to geraniol production in yeast (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1d</a>). </p> </div> <div class="strategyforengineeringmonoterpenebiosynthesisinbrewingyeast" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Strategy for engineering monoterpene biosynthesis in brewing yeast</div> <p>Once we identified monoterpene synthases that were sufficiently active in <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i>, we set out to engineer brewer’s yeast strains capable of producing monoterpenes during beer fermentation. Yeast naturally produces the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) through the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, as FPP serves as a precursor for essential metabolites including hemes and sterols. While the flux through this pathway is tightly regulated, extensive metabolic engineering efforts have informed key genetic modifications that obviate regulatory checkpoints <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a> </sup> and increase monoterpene precursor supply <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup> (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">2</a>). HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is one of the key rate-limiting steps of the pathway and is controlled by an inhibitory regulatory domain that responds to product accumulation <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a> </sup>. Overexpression of a truncated form of yeast HMGR lacking the regulatory domain (tHMGR) results in increased flux towards end products <sup> <a href="#CR22">22</a> </sup>. A downstream enzyme, FPP synthase (FPPS), catalyzes the sequential condensation of two isopentyl pyrophosphate molecules with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. GPP, the immediate precursor of monoterpene biosynthesis, is formed as an intermediate of the sequential reactions. While the high processivity of the wild-type FPPS limits the intracellular availability of GPP, a mutant (FPPS*) has been identified that reduces processivity, thereby increasing production of GPP-derived end products <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that modulating the expression of tHMGR, FPPS*, t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS, and <i>Ob</i>GES would result in brewer’s yeast strains capable of producing linalool and geraniol during fermentation at concentrations encompassing those typical of finished beer (~0.2 mg/L) <sup> <a href="#CR9">9</a>, <a href="#CR23">23</a> </sup>. </p> <p>In devising a strategy to modulate pathway activity, two challenges were considered. First, de novo design and generation of a collection of multi-gene constructs is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. To circumvent this challenge, we combined an existing toolkit of yeast genetic parts with a Golden Gate assembly strategy for facile design and rapid pathway construction <sup> <a href="#CR24">24</a> </sup> (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a, d</a> and Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Second, incorporating large (i.e., &amp;gt;10 kb) genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer’s yeast has not been reported, and is complicated by their ploidy as well as concerns regarding the incorporation of selection markers in food-processing agents. We therefore developed a Cas9-mediated methodology for stable and marker-less pathway integration (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a–c</a>, Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">4</a>, and Supplementary Note <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Our method leverages a colorimetric assay to screen for positive transformants and allows for macroscopic visualization of successful integration events. Interestingly, this method also allowed us to visualize the high degree of genetic instability associated with heterozygous integration (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2b, c</a>). By combining the assembly and integration strategies, we were able to generate strains with a diverse set of genetic designs, where each strain contained a unique combination of promoters driving expression of the four modulated genes (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2d</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>Iterative improvement of strain design towards targeted monoterpene production levels. <b>a</b> Schematic of design–build–test–learn cycle.

Iterative design refines target monoterpene levels</div> <p>Without empirical data, it is difficult to predict the relationship between specific genetic designs and metabolic end-product concentrations <sup> <a href="#CR25">25</a>, <a href="#CR26">26</a> </sup>. To improve search efficiency towards desired monoterpene concentrations, we separated our design–build-test process (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a</a>) into two stages, thereby affording us an opportunity to first sample a small subset of design space and then hone subsequent designs towards desired production profiles. An initial set of 18 strains containing promoters predicted to span a wide range of expression strengths were constructed and grown under microaerobic fermentation conditions that mimicked an industrial brewing process (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">5</a>). We found that these first iteration strains produced monoterpenes within the range of commercial concentrations, although were generally lower (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Some strains exhibited a reduced fermentation capacity (Supplementary Figs. <a href="#MOESM1">6</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">7</a> <b>)</b> including the strains closest to commercial concentrations. However, reduced fermentation capacity did not correlate with monoterpene production, suggesting that the fermentation defects were not primarily due to monoterpene toxicity (Supplementary Note <a href="#MOESM1">2</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 3</span> </a> </div>   <p>Production of monoterpenes by engineered strains. Linalool and geraniol production of engineered yeast strains compared to concentrations found in commercial beers, plotted in log <sub>10</sub> space. For relationships between flavor determinant concentration and taste intensity, the logarithm of a stimulus is typically proportional to the logarithm of the perceived intensity, such that the distance between points in log <sub>10</sub> space is expected to be directly proportional to the magnitude of taste difference. First and second iteration points represent the mean of three biological replicates. Standard deviation values are listed in Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">14</a>. In ascending order of monoterpene concentration, commercial beers are Pale Ale, Torpedo Extra IPA, and Hop Hunter IPA, obtained from the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company </p>   </div> <p /> <p>To further explore the relationship between genetic design and monoterpene production, the relative abundance of the four modulated proteins was measured for each strain during the active phase of fermentation. Protein abundance was strongly correlated with previously characterized promoter strength (Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">8</a>), demonstrating that the qualitative relationship between promoter strengths generally extends from a lab strain grown aerobically in rich medium to a brewing strain grown in industrial brewing conditions. Furthermore, total monoterpene production was correlated with tHMGR and FPPS* abundance and linalool production was correlated with t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS abundance, verifying that the selected genes indeed control monoterpene production as anticipated (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2e</a> and Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>). An interesting anomaly was that <i>Ob</i>GES abundance was not correlated with geraniol production. We reasoned that since <i>Ob</i>GES and t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS compete for GPP supply, variation in t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS abundance may obscure the relationship between <i>Ob</i>GES and geraniol production. Indeed, we observed that the fraction of geraniol in total monoterpene composition correlated with the ratio between <i>Ob</i>GES and t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS ( <i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.05; <i>t</i>-test). Together, these findings were encouraging, as they firmly demonstrated that genetic design can be used to control monoterpene production and that the knowledge gained from our initial test set could guide subsequent design. </p> <p>We next set out to generate a second iteration of designs with target production levels defined by three commercially hopped beers that span a wide range of monoterpene concentrations and perceived hop flavor/aroma intensity. The salient trends observed in the test set informed two guiding principles: (1) to shift overall monoterpene production towards higher levels, designs were composed of strong promoters driving tHMGR, FPPS*, and <i>Ob</i>GES and (2) to ensure variation in the ratio of linalool to geraniol, designs encompassed a range of promoter strengths driving expression of t67- <i>Mc</i>LIS. (Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">11</a> and Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">9</a>). We anticipated that applying these design principles towards desired performance characteristics would improve search efficiency. In order to evaluate the extent of improvement, we established a mathematical modeling-based framework to predict the relationship between genetic design and monoterpene production (Online Methods, Supplementary Note <a href="#MOESM1">3</a>, and Supplementary Tables <a href="#MOESM1">2</a>– <a href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Using this framework, we predicted that the selected design principles significantly improved our search efficiency (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">10</a>). Importantly, we observed a consistent improvement in comparing actual distance-from-target monoterpene levels between the first and second iteration strains (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span> </a> </div>   <p>Evaluation of iterative genetic design refinement.

Engineered strains affect consistent hop flavor</div> <p>The anticipated commercial value of generating hop flavor molecules through yeast biosynthesis is predicated on three assumptions: (1) because the conditions inside a fermenter can be precisely controlled, the final concentrations of yeast-biosynthesized monoterpenes in beer are likely to be more consistent compared with those given by conventional hop additions, (2) the biosynthesized monoterpenes linalool and geraniol confer hoppy flavor as perceived through human taste, and (3) the variation in hop flavor molecule concentrations correspond to differences on the order of those discernable by human taste. To test the consistency of yeast-biosynthesized monoterpene levels, replicate fermentations were performed at 8 L scale with a subset of engineered strains. To test the consistency of hop-derived monoterpene levels, Cascade hop preparations originating from five different farms in the Northwestern United States were used to supplement fermentations performed with the parent strain (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a,b</a>). We observed little variation in final monoterpene concentrations between replicate samples fermented with engineered strains, whereas fermentations hopped with different preparations yielded significantly greater variation (linalool <i>p-</i>value &amp;lt;1 × 10 <sup>−5</sup>, geraniol <i>p</i>-value &amp;lt;1 × 10 <sup>−3</sup>; <i>t-</i>test) (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a,b</a>). This result demonstrates that engineered strains biosynthesize monoterpenes more consistently than can be achieved by randomly selecting Cascade hop preparations from different farms. Next, to test whether yeast-biosynthesized monoterpenes conferred hop flavor, beer was produced in an authentic, pilot-scale brewhouse, following a recipe for a classic American Ale, using three engineered strains and the parent strain ( <i>WLP001</i>) as a control (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">11</a> and Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">17</a>). A panel of tasters determined that the finished beers exhibited a range of hop flavor/aroma intensity (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5c</a>). In addition, the apparent difference in hop flavor/aroma intensity between beer fermented with JBEI-16652 and JBEI-16669 was considerable, despite only a ~twofold difference in linalool and geraniol concentrations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that monoterpenes derived from yeast biosynthesis during fermentation give rise to hop flavor/aroma in finished beer and that biosynthesis provides greater consistency than traditional hopping. Finally, in order to compare the intensity of hop flavor conferred by traditional dry hopping with the hop flavor conferred by engineered strains, fermentations were performed both with the parent strain with dry-hop additions as well as with JBEI-16652 without dry-hop additions (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">11</a> and Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">18</a>). Conventionally dry-hopped beers consistently exhibited increased hop flavor/aroma as perceived by a sensory panel; however, these effects were not statistically significant compared to the parental control (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5d</a>). In contrast, beer produced with JBEI-16652 again exhibited significantly higher hop flavor/aroma than the parental control. Similar monoterpene concentrations were observed between the two batches, demonstrating the consistent performance of the engineered strain. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 5</span> </a> </div>   <p>Characteristics of pilot-scale beer fermented with engineered strains. <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> Variation in linalool ( <b>a</b>) and geraniol ( <b>b</b>) concentrations of engineered brewing strain fermentations compared with variation in concentrations generated by traditional dry hopping.

Discussion</div> <p>In this study, we have engineered brewer’s yeast for production of flavor molecules ordinarily derived from hops. We developed new methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains. Unlike classical microbial metabolic engineering efforts that focus on maximizing the titer of a single molecule, we focused on tuning the expression of key genes in a biosynthetic pathway to simultaneously make precise concentrations of multiple flavor molecules. This application promises to generate hop flavors with more consistency than traditional hop additions, as hop preparations are notoriously variable in the content of their essential oil and the flavor they impart to beer <sup> <a href="#CR23">23</a> </sup>. It should be noted that blending hop preparations from different sources can be used to reduce variation. However, blending is ultimately limited by practical constraints: In the best case, large craft breweries create one single hop blend per year, which fails to mitigate year-to-year variation. Our strategy is favored over plant or microbial bioprocess extraction because it avoids the use of non-renewable chemicals typical of industrial extraction. While historic consumer trepidation towards genetically engineered foods is of concern for widespread adoption, the general increase in consumer acceptance of such foods when tied to increased sustainability <sup> <a href="#CR27">27</a> </sup> is encouraging. </p> <p>Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering brewer’s yeast by incorporation of heterologous genes <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR28">28</a>, <a href="#CR29">29</a> </sup>; however, the scope and commercial relevance of these efforts have been limited, in part due to methodological difficulties of incorporating an array of large, genetically stable DNA constructs into industrial yeasts. Recent studies have resorted to alternative methods such as breeding hybrid strains <sup> <a href="#CR30">30</a> </sup>. While this has proven to be a powerful approach for generating diverse aroma phenotypes, it is intrinsically limited to enzymes and aromas associated with native yeast metabolism. Here, we developed a complementary methodology that allows for stable incorporation of plant secondary metabolism genes into industrial brewer’s yeast. We provide evidence that incorporating linalool and geraniol biosynthesis confers hop flavor to beer. We note that the full flavor imparted by traditional hopping is likely to rely on a more diverse bouquet of molecules. The methodologies described herein provide a foundation for generating more complex yeast-derived hop flavors, and broaden the possibilities of yeast-biosynthesized flavor molecules to those throughout the plant kingdom. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The carrier gas was held at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and EMV mode was set to a gain factor of 1. </p> <p>Sampling, oven temperature schedule, and ion monitoring was optimized for each experiment: for quantifying linalool and geraniol production in terpene synthase screens, the samples were spun down and the organic phase (solvent overlay) was collected, diluted 1:10 in ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), transferred to a glass GC vial, and injected into the GC column. For samples corresponding to the LIS screen, the oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 12 min, followed by a ramp of 10 °C/min to a temperature of 190 °C and a ramp of 50 °C/min to a final temperature of 250 °C, and then held at 250 °C for 1 min. The solvent delay was set to 20 min, and the MS was set to SIM mode for acquisition, monitoring <i>m</i>/ <i>z</i> ions 80, 93, and 121. For samples corresponding to the geraniol synthase screen, the oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 5 min, then ramped at 30 °C/min to a temperature of 135 °C, then ramped at 5 °C/min to a temperature of 145 °C, then ramped at 30 °C/min to a temperature of 250 °C, and held at 250 °C for 1 min.

Peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer via a gradient with initial starting condition of 95% Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and 5% Buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Buffer B was held at 5% for 1.5 min, and then increased to 35% Buffer B over 3.5 min. Buffer B was further increased to 80% over 0.5 min where it was held for 1 min, and then ramped back down to 5% Buffer B over 0.3 min where it was held for 0.2 min to re-equilibrate the column to the initial starting condition. The peptides were ionized by an Agilent Jet Stream ESI source operating in positive-ion mode with the following source parameters: gas temperature = 250 °C, gas flow = 13 L/min, nebulizer pressure = 35 psi, sheath gas temperature = 250 °C, sheath gas flow = 11 L/min, VCap = 3500 V.
