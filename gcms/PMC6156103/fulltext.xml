Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) have gained
attention in recent years, there are few cases of their upscaled application
for lactone synthesis. A thermostable cyclohexanone monooxygenase
from <italic>Thermocrispum municipale</italic> (TmCHMO)
was applied to the oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone using
a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) for cofactor regeneration. The reaction
progress was improved by optimizing the biocatalyst loading, with
investigation into oxygen limitations. The product concentration and
productivity were increased by keeping the substrate concentration
below the inhibitory level via continuous substrate feeding (CSF).
This substrate feeding strategy was evaluated against two biphasic
reactions using either toluene or <italic>n</italic>-butyl acetate
as immiscible organic solvents. A product concentration of 38 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and a space-time yield of 1.35 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> were achieved during the gram-scale synthesis
of the two regioisomeric lactones by applying the CSF strategy. These
improvements contribute to the large-scale application of BVMOs in
the synthesis of branched building blocks for polymer applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>op8b00079</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>op-2018-000792</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxidative chemistry
plays a major role in the chemical industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> About one-third of industrial biocatalyzed processes,
half of which are oxidation reactions, involve redox enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> These biocatalysts offer an alternative of lower toxicity by replacing
conventional toxic oxidants with molecular oxygen or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and by operating under mild aqueous conditions rather
than in pure organic solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger
monooxygenases (BVMOs) in particular have gained interest in recent
years, with efforts in enzyme discovery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> enzyme engineering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and development
toward their application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> BVMOs are an
interesting alternative to the classical chemical Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger
reaction thanks to their enantio- and regioselectivity on a wide range
of substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> This differentiating feature
is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical compounds, where chirality
is crucial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> As a consequence, upscaling
efforts at pilot-plant scale using BVMOs have mainly focused on pharmaceutical
applications. For example, the oxidation of <italic>rac</italic>-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-6-one,
whose oxidized product is a chiral building block for the synthesis
of prostaglandins, was performed at a 200 L scale using whole cells
expressing a cyclohexanone monooxygenase from <italic>Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus</italic> NCIMB 9871 (AcCHMO; EC 1.14.13.22).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> BVMOs have also successfully been identified
as relevant industrial biocatalysts for the enantioselective sulfoxidation
of two key intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> The BVMO-catalyzed synthesis of a chiral sulfoxide drug intermediate
at kilogram scale was recently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Moreover, BVMO-catalyzed synthesis of lactones, which are relevant
building blocks for polymers, has been applied at smaller laboratory
scales. For example, poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone) was synthesized from
6-hydroxyhexanoic acid prepared at a multidozen gram scale in a fed-batch
biocatalyzed reactor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> &#x003b5;-Caprolactone,
which is another precursor of this polyester, was prepared from a
convergent cascade in a biphasic system combining AcCHMO with an alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The same lactone
was similarly obtained by using whole cells expressing AcCHMO at a
3 L scale, resulting in a moderate productivity of 0.79 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> At the same
scale, cyclododecanone was oxidized to the corresponding macrolactone
using recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> whole
cells expressing a cyclopentadecanone monooxygenase from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain HI-70 (PsCPDMO; EC 1.14.13).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The multidozen-gram-scale synthesis of a nitrile
&#x003b5;-caprolactone derivative, which is a Nylon-9 precursor, was
performed using PsCPDMO in whole cells with substrate feeding product
removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup></p><p>However, several factors
hinder the application of BVMOs at industrial
scale, namely, poor stability toward organic solvents, poor thermostability,
and regeneration of their NAD(P)H cofactor. Thermostability and resistance
to organic solvents can be improved by careful choice of the biocatalyst.
For example, a cyclohexanone monooxygenase from <italic>Thermocrispum
municipale</italic> DSM 44069 (TmCHMO; EC 1.14.13.22) has recently
been discovered, which outperforms most wild-type CHMOs in terms of
thermostability with a melting temperature of 48 &#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> (see the recent review on protein engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> for a comparison of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values). This enzyme is particularly suitable for the application
of BVMOs to the synthesis of lactone polymeric building blocks given
its broad substrate scope toward branched cyclic ketones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> TmCHMO has already been engineered into a fusion
protein, forming a self-sufficient system for NADPH cofactor regeneration.
For example, a TmCHMO&#x02013;ADH fusion biocatalyst enables the cascade
oxidation of cyclohexanol to &#x003b5;-caprolactone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Recently, we have similarly applied a TmCHMO&#x02013;PTDH
fusion protein as a self-sufficient biocatalyst, in which a phosphite
dehydrogenase (PTDH) uses phosphite as a sacrificial cosubstrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Additionally, we have found that several water-miscible
cosolvents are compatible with this enzyme, with good retention of
substrate conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> This enables increased
product concentration, which is typically achieved in successful biocatalyzed
reactions operating at large scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p><p>In this work, our goal was to optimize the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed
oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (<bold>1</bold>) (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>). This substrate
can be prepared by hydrogenation of isophorone, which is obtained
from the self-condensation of acetone, potentially sourced from renewables
via acetone&#x02013;butanol&#x02013;ethanol (A-B-E) fermentation of
ligno-cellulosic feedstocks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The two regioisomeric lactones

While BVMO-catalyzed oxidations favor the distal lactone, the chemical
Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger oxidation favors the formation of the proximal
lactone (<bold>1a</bold>:<bold>1b</bold> = 55:45 and 45:55, respectively).
With the fused TmCHMO&#x02013;PTDH biocatalyst, a biphasic system in
toluene yielded a maximum product concentration of 11 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. With the same self-sufficient biocatalyst, continuous substrate
feeding (CSF) afforded a maximum productivity of 1.20 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with a limited product concentration of 7
g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. In order to improve the TmCHMO-catalyzed
oxidation of <bold>1</bold> toward upscaling, high productivity and
product concentration were targeted while maintaining a low biocatalyst
loading. To this end, TmCHMO was applied in a two-enzyme system with
a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to regenerate the NADPH cofactor using
(+)-glucose as a cosubstrate (<xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref></xref>b). CSF was selected as the substrate supply method
in order to keep the substrate concentration below the inhibitory
level. The effects of biocatalyst loading and oxygen input on the
reaction progress were evaluated, since they can also increase the
overall productivity. CSF was further optimized by varying the feeding
rate, total amount of added substrate, and total reaction time. The
best reaction conditions were subsequently evaluated against two biphasic
systems using either <italic>n</italic>-butyl acetate or toluene as
the water-immiscible organic phase. Finally, the CSF biocatalyzed
reaction was scaled to a total volume of 500 mL to yield the regioisomeric
lactones at a gram scale.</p><fig id="sch2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><caption><title>Biocatalyzed Oxidation of the Branched Substrate

to increase the productivity of the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed
oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone, several parameters were
investigated, namely, the biocatalyst loading and the oxygen input
via the stirring rate and the air flow rate. For this reaction, control
of the pH is essential since GDH was selected as the coenzyme to regenerate
the NADPH cofactor. In this case, for each molecule of converted substrate,
one molecule of gluconic acid is formed as a result of the spontaneous
hydrolysis of the coproduct <sc>d</sc>-gluconolactone, causing a drop
in the pH throughout the reaction (<xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref></xref>b). The pH of the reaction was therefore
maintained at 8 by autotitration. Because of the limited water solubility
of the substrate (about 4 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in buffer), the
use of a cosolvent is necessary to solubilize it at high concentration.
We have previously shown that the cosolvent influences the reaction
rate, with methanol giving the fastest conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> For this reason, methanol was selected as the cosolvent.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Biocatalyst
Loading</title><p>The stability of the TmCHMO biocatalyst
was evaluated by performing bioconversions with decreasing biocatalyst
loading. These reactions were performed in a fed-batch manner, meaning
that about 10 mM substrate was added stepwise every hour. This time
interval was chosen to give the biocatalyst enough time to fully convert
the substrate, so that no substrate accumulation was observed. Under
these hourly substrate additions, the reaction progress of the bioconversions
was found to be independent of the decrease in the biocatalyst loading
over the range from 10% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 1.25% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> TmCHMO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a&#x02013;d).
For all of the reactions, the substrate was fully converted within
1 h, independent of the TmCHMO concentration. This indicates good
stability of the enzyme, at least within the time frame of the reaction.
Moreover, the product accumulation as measured in the aqueous phase
followed the total amount of substrate fed, indicating good efficiency
of the enzyme. Interestingly, it was observed that the substrate acted
as an antifoaming agent, with foaming observed only when no more substrate
was available in the reaction mixture. As long as substrate was present,
foaming was almost suppressed, preventing the possible air&#x02013;protein
interphase pathway of protein deactivation from taking place.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Concentrations

substrate conversion or product accumulation. The biocatalyst loading
could by consequence be decreased by a factor of 10 for both enzymes
(TmCHMO and GDH) while maintaining full substrate conversion in the
same reaction time. On the basis of the full conversion of 10 mM substrate
observed at all biocatalyst loadings, a substrate feeding rate of
at least 10 mM h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> seems to be appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Oxygen
Mass Transfer Limitations</title><p>In BVMO-catalyzed
oxidations, the oxygen supply is critical since molecular oxygen is
one of the reactants. The solubility of molecular oxygen in aqueous
solutions at atmospheric pressure is very low (about 0.3 mM), while
it is usually higher in organic solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> However, the solubility of oxygen in a mixture of 20% methanol in
water (0.34 mM) is not significantly increased compared with that
in water only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> It is therefore important
to identify oxygen mass transfer limitations since they can limit
the reaction productivity and therefore the overall process performance.
The oxygen transfer rate is influenced by the size of the gas bubbles
in the reaction mixture. The effects of the stirring rate and air
flow rate, which are two factors impacting the amount of dissolved
oxygen, on the progress of the reaction were evaluated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Substrate conversion

8 to 16 mL min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> resulted in the same increase in
conversion as doubling the stirring
rate from 500 to 1000 rpm did. However, the stirring rate of 1000
rpm led to the observation of a significant amount of denatured protein.
This was attributed to the increased air&#x02013;aqueous solution interface,
which is detrimental to the activity of the protein. Increasing the
stirring rate and/or air flow rate resulted in similar mass balance
for all reactions, indicating that there was no removal of substrate
or product from the reaction mixture through the air stream (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). The optimal reaction
conditions for this reaction were thus identified to be an air flow
rate of 16 mL min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and a stirring rate of 500 rpm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Increasing Product Concentration with Continuous Substrate Feeding</title><p>In order for the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation to be competitive
against classical chemical Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger oxidation, it is
necessary to achieve high product concentrations, typically exceeding
10 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Continuous substrate feeding (CSF) was
therefore selected as a suitable substrate supply strategy in order
to keep the substrate concentration low and thus avoid substrate inhibition.
Potential product inhibition was evaluated by performing a reaction
containing the chemically synthesized lactones at an initial concentration
of 30 mM (approximately 4.7 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). While the initial presence
of product at 30 mM did not seem to hamper product accumulation, it
did result in lower substrate accumulation, maybe as a result of better
solubility of the substrate in the aqueous phase due to the presence
of the product. Under these reaction conditions, no product inhibition
was observed at product concentrations lower than 30 mM.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Concentrations

the feeding rate resulted in faster product formation and consequently
higher product concentration because of the higher total substrate

Feeding at such a rate
overnight should allow for a total product concentration of about
37 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. This was not the case, however, as the
reaction suffered from significant substrate accumulation, up to about
95 mM (about 15 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). As expected, increasing
the reaction time increased the amount of protein denaturation observed.
Interestingly, the same overnight CSF resulted in almost no substrate
accumulation when the reactor was loaded with 5% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> biocatalyst instead of 2.5% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, with the conversion
increasing from 42% to 85%. Despite the high substrate conversion,

Systems in Organic
Solvents</title><p>This improved CSF reaction was evaluated against
another substrate supply strategy, namely, a biphasic system using
either toluene or <italic>n</italic>-butyl acetate. The objective
of the water-immiscible organic phase is twofold: first, it acts as
a substrate reservoir and decreases the substrate concentration in
the aqueous phase where the biocatalyst is present, and second, it
serves as a product sink, solubilizing the formed product and ensuring
high product concentration. Toluene was selected because of the favorable
solvent resistance of TmCHMO toward this solvent (no significant decrease
in activity for the oxidation of cyclohexanone at 30 &#x000b0;C in the
presence of 33% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> toluene).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup><italic>n</italic>-Butyl acetate was selected as a low-environmental-impact
alternative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Additionally, both solvents
have a low solubility in water, which should result in clear partitioning
of the substrate and product, and a high boiling point, which should
circumvent any potential evaporation that might occur over time.</p><p>A biphasic system consisting of 25% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> organic
solvent (i.e., 30 mL of aqueous phase with 10 mL of organic phase)
was loaded with 7.2 mmol of substrate (1.138 mL), corresponding to
the same amount of substrate that was converted in the optimized CSF
system. In the biphasic systems, the substrate concentration was 180
mM for the overall reaction mixture (240 mM if all of the substrate
were in the aqueous phase and 720 mM if all of the substrate were
in the organic phase). During the reaction, the substrate was found
almost exclusively in the organic phase along with the formed product
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link> b,d vs a,c). However, it was
difficult to follow the reaction progress of each phase because of
the significant emulsification that occurred. It is therefore probable
that the amounts of substrate and product measured in the (lower)
aqueous phase were overestimated because of contamination with the
(upper) organic phase while the amounts in the organic phase were
probably underestimated because of the emulsification. This is particularly
visible with the sudden drop in the product concentration in the toluene
phase between 23 and 25 h (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S1b</ext-link>),

substrate conversion than the equivalent CSF reaction, with 32% and

about 38 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Increasing the reaction volume resulted
in an increase in isolated yield, with over 12 g of isolated lactone
products for the 500 mL-scale reaction. The STY was therefore also
calculated on the basis of the amount of isolated product. In that
case, increasing the reaction volume doubled the STY as a result of
the higher substrate conversion and higher isolated yield. Analysis
of the denatured protein at the end of the reaction revealed that
it adsorbed both products and substrate, with a mixture consisting
mainly of lactone products (85%) with some substrate (12%) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). The isolated product additionally
contained low amounts of side products that were identified by NMR
analysis as the corresponding methyl ester ring-opened products (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>b and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">S4</ext-link>). A model reaction of chemically synthesized
lactones in a reaction mixture of 50:50 v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> buffer/methanol
confirmed that this side-product formation was induced by the dilution
of the reaction mixture with methanol to deactivate all of the remaining
protein and can be avoided by direct product recovery at the end of
the reaction (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Process Metrics for the Biocatalyzed

was to optimize the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation
of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone at a small scale (30 mL reaction volume),
for which the NADPH cofactor was regenerated by oxidation of (+)-glucose
by a GDH. The use of isolated enzyme allowed control of the progress
of the reaction. In particular, the TmCHMO biocatalyst loading could
be reduced by almost a factor 10, to only 1.25% v v<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> enzyme, without any loss of activity during fed-batch experiments.
Similarly, the GDH concentration could be reduced by a factor 10 during
the same fed-batch experiments. Possible oxygen limitation was investigated
by changing the amount of dissolved oxygen present through altering
the stirring rate and the air flow rate. The fastest reaction progress
was obtained with an increased air flow rate and a reduced stirring
rate, which also resulted in a favorable foaming reduction.</p><p>Continuous substrate feeding (CSF) was applied to keep the substrate
concentration below the inhibitory level. The feeding rate could be
increased to 15 mM h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> without undesirable substrate
accumulation. A substrate conversion of 85% was reached by optimizing
the biocatalyst loading as well as the time of substrate feeding,
yielding a product concentration above 31 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.
Compared with our previous results with the fused TmCHMO&#x02013;PTDH
biocatalyst on this substrate, the product concentration was increased
by a factor 4 using TmCHMO with GDH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The
improved reaction was further evaluated against two biphasic systems,
in toluene and <italic>n</italic>-butyl acetate, in which significant
amounts of unreacted substrate were found. This was attributed to
premature protein denaturation induced by foaming and increased interphase
between the aqueous phase and the organic solvent.</p><p>Finally,
a product concentration of about 38 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was achieved
with the upscaling of the CSF reaction to 500 mL. It
was necessary to increase the biocatalyst loading since unreacted
substrate was observed after feeding of 240 mM substrate. In the future,
this can be circumvented by employing continuous feeding of the biocatalyst
throughout the reaction to ensure a constant enzymatic activity in
the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, a productivity of 1.35 g L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was achieved for the first
gram-scale TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone.
Although improved, the reaction still requires development in terms
of product concentration and space-time yield in order to reach the
performances of large-scale biocatalyzed oxidations. Further work
will investigate this reaction to demonstrate the viability of biocatalyzed
oxidations for the synthesis of branched lactones for polymer applications.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting
