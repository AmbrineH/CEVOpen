Recently, a few of CRISPR/Cas9 systems bearing different types of replicons (pSG5 and pIJ101) were developed to efficiently edit their genomes. Despite wide application in gene editing, their utility in editing challenging DNA regions e.g. high sequence identity has not been compared. In this study, we confirmed that the widely used temperature-sensitive pSG5 replicon is indeed not suitable for editing modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes due to causing unpredicted gene recombination. This problem can be addressed by replacing the pSG5 with the segregationally unstable pIJ101 replicon. By introducing a counter-selection marker CodA, convenient cloning sites in the single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and homologous template scaffolds, we developed a new CRISPR-Cas9 system pMWCas9. This system was successfully used to delete/replace erythromycin PKS and other biosynthetic genes in <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. AL2110. By swapping the promoters of <italic>antB</italic> and <italic>antC</italic> with <italic>ermE</italic> and <italic>kasOp</italic>, we achieved a deacyl-antimycin hyper producer which produces a 9-fold higher yield than the original <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.

Over the past decades, significant efforts have been devoted to understanding the logic of NP biosynthesis [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With this basis, biosynthetic pathways engineering or genome-based NP discovery have been successfully used to identify numerous novel bioactive compounds [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it was revealed that the majority of microbial metabolites repertoire indeed still have not yet been accessed. More than 90% of biosynthetic pathways are silenced under normal laboratory culturing conditions due to the absence of the essential regulatory signals to trigger biosynthesis [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To activate their biosynthesis, gene modification targeting different regulation stages is usually required [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0015"><italic>Actinomycetes</italic> are among of the most prolific producers of diverse NPs, which contribute about 73% of total bacterial NPs and 45% of total microbial NPs [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The diverse genomic contents and relatively low growth rate make genetic manipulation of their genome much more changeling than other model organisms, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The typical approach for genome editing is based on RecA mediated double-crossover [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the efficiency of inducing the second-crossover by this approach is low, which often takes weeks to accumulate a significant number of double-crossover mutants for PCR verification [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the introduction of a double strand break (DSB) at the genomic locus of interest can drastically increase the efficacy of double-crossover, previous approaches, such as using the meganuclease I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, require prior integration of the endonuclease recognition site at the target locus [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overall efficacy of this method is, thus, still very low.</p><p id="p0020">Recently, the more efficient DSB mediated genome editing has been achieved by the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (Cas) system [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. By co-expression with the customized single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 nuclease can mediate a DSB in the sgRNA binding region; efficient double crossover can be achieved when the homologous templates are provided in the same plasmid. Currently, a few CRISPR systems have been developed and applied in editing actinomycetal genomes, among of which pCRISPR-Cas9, pCRISPomyces, pKCcas9dO and pWHU2653 are the four most widely used systems [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. These systems are mainly different in the replicon type as well as the way of expressing Cas9 nuclease. The pCRISPR-Cas9, pCRISPomyces and pKCcas9dO have a temperature sensitive pSG5 replicon, while pWHU2653 bears a segregationally unstable pIJ101 replicon; Cas9 protein in pCRISPR-Cas9 and pKCcas9dO is induced by thiostrepton (Tsr) while the nucleases in other two systems are constitutively expressed. Although all these systems have been successfully applied in genome editing, their efficiency in editing challenging DNA regions, e.g. with high sequence identity, has been not comparatively evaluated. Recently, the result shows that pKC1139 derived (with pSG5) plasmids can cause random recombination of the rapamycin and tylosin modular PKS genes when they were used to gene replacement [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was assumed the pSG5 replicon might be the major reason for causing recombination. As three of the four widely used systems pCRISPR-Cas9, pCRISPomyces and pKCcas9dO are pSG5-based, thus evaluation their utility in editing modular PKS genes is necessary.</p><p id="p0025">In this study, we confirmed that the pSG5 replicon is indeed the major reason for causing non-desired gene recombination, and the Cas9 system with pSG5 is not suitable to edit the modular PKS gene. Substitution the replicon by pIJ101 can overcome this problem. By integration of inducible expression of Cas9, convenient cloning sites in the sgRNAs region and homologous templates and a counter-selection marker <italic>codA</italic>, we further upgraded this Cas9 system. This new system was successfully used to efficiently edit the modular PKS and other genes in erythromycin and antimycin biosynthetic pathways. By engineering the promotor region in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. AL2110, deacyl antimycins was dramatically improved to a 9-fold compared with the wild-type strain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Strains, chemicals, and general materials</title><p id="p0030">Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Tables S1 and S2</xref>. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; was used as cloning host. <italic>E. coli</italic> ET12567/pUZ8002 was used for intergeneric conjugation between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Sac. erythraea</italic> HL3168 E3 or <italic>S.</italic> sp.

As the rate of successful reparation of DSB by gene replacement is low, these kinds of Cas9 systems e.g. pWHU2653 often require a high plasmid transformation efficiency. This could be challenging for bacteria system recalcitrant to be transformed, for instance, many industrial strains. Thus, for getting higher transformation efficiency, the inducible expression is more advantageous over constitutive expression of the Cas9 nuclease. Based on this consideration, we chose pCRISPR-Cas9 for this study.</p><p id="p0090">Erythromycin is an important family of antibiotics. Currently, its natural form and semi-synthetic derivatives, such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, and roxithromycin have been widely utilized to treat Gram-positive pathogen infections [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Engineering its biosynthetic machinery, especially for the PKS genes, is promising to obtain novel bioactive analogues [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, we confirmed that engineering the acyltransferase (EryAT6) domain can enormously broaden its substrate specificity to take highly diverse extender units [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, to complement this engineered AT domain in vivo, we aim to delete the entire PKS gene <italic>eryAIII</italic> from the industrial strain <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> HL3168 E3 [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0095">A sgRNA sequence targeted to the <italic>eryAIII</italic> and a &#x0223c;3&#x0202f;kb homologous template specific to the left and right boundaries of <italic>eryAIII</italic> were sequentially introduced into the pCRISPR-Cas9 to constitute the functional pZW-1 plasmid. This plasmid was transferred into the strain <italic>Sac. erythraea</italic> HL3168 E3 through <italic>E. coli</italic> conjugation with an efficiency of 4&#x0202f;cfu/mL broth. Efficient gene replacement was observed when the exconjugates were inoculated into the TSB media with 2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g&#x0202f;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> Tsr. This strain was further inoculated onto the MS agar plate and grew in 39&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C for losing the delivery plasmid backbone. Isolated colonies (&#x0223c;100) were picked for each time to testify the resistance of apramycin (Am). However, after fifteen rounds of culturing, we still failed to obtain any Am-sensitive colonies. PCR analysis showed that the Am resistant genes of the vector were indeed retained in the strains (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). Isolation of plasmid from these strains was not successful, suggesting the plasmid indeed has been integrated into the genome. More so, the assumed to be eliminated <italic>eryAT6</italic> (within the <italic>eryAIII</italic>) can be still detected by PCR in these colonies, though the expected <italic>eryAIII</italic>-deletion genotype was also observed through PCR analysis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). These results indicated that both gene deletion in the targeted region and unpredicted recombination event occurred.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>pSG5 causes random recombination of PKS gene which can be solved by using pIJ101 replicon</title><p id="p0100">Recently, a similar result was also observed in editing the rapamycin and tylosin PKS genes by the pKC1139-based plasmid [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was assumed that the integrated plasmid (via single crossover) can constitute a replication fork when the culturing temperature was lowered for inducing the second recombination event to lose the plasmid. This pSG5-mediated replication fork collides with the natural fork leading to the temporary arrest and subsequent genome instability and rearrangements. To repair this catastrophic event, flanking PKS genes are forced to exert homologous recombination for removing the pSG5 encoding region, which leads to many unpredicted recombination events. However, pCRISPR-Cas9 system is different from pKC1139 integrated into genome, which exerts double crossover in plasmid form. Thus, the mechanism for causing random recombination should be different as assumed before.</p><p id="p0105">To verify the essential role of pSG5 in this event, the pSG5 replicon was replaced by the segregational instability pIJ101 replicon together with a Tsr resistance gene from the plasmid pYH7 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The generated plasmid pZW-2 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>) was introduced into <italic>Sac. erythraea</italic> HL3168 E3 through the same procedure. Identical to pZW-1, efficient gene replacement was observed when 2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g&#x0202f;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> Tsr was added into the culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). This strain was inoculated onto the MS agar plate to lose the delivery plasmid. Unlike the aforementioned pSG5-derived Cas9 system, all the tested colonies (80) from five-round culture have successfully lost the delivery plasmid. The deletion of <italic>eryAIII</italic> was further verified by both PCR and fermentation analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), which confirms the pIJ101 is effective for editing modular PKS gene. The mechanism for pSG5-induced recombination is currently not clear. We assumed that the elevated temperature (39&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C) to prevent the replication of pSG5 may cause the emergency reaction of bacteria. As such reactions, for instance, SOS response can extensively induce DNA repair systems; and genes with high sequence identity can probably undergo homogeneous recombination. Taken together these results confirmed that the pSG5 replicon indeed is the major factor for causing the recombination even and using pIJ101 replicon can overcome this problem.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Construction of a new Cas9 system and used to edit biosynthetic genes of erythromycin in Sac. erythraea</title><p id="p0110">As the pZW-2 is not convenient for gene cloning, we further set out to construct a new pIJ101-based Cas9 vector (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).
