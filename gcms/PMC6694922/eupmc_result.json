    "Objectives:This study investigated the chemical composition and the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of Citrus aurantifolia L. Methods:Fresh Citrus aurantifolia L. leaves were collected from farms in Sur city, located in the Al-Sharqia (Eastern) region of the Sultanate of Oman, during June-July of 2015. The essential oil was isolated using hydrodistillation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify and quantify the chemical constituents of the oil. An in-vitro 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method was used to determine the antioxidant activity of the isolated oil from the lime leaves while a disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Results:Thirty-three chemical compounds were identified, with d-limonene (63.35%) forming the major constituent. Other prominent constituents include 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol (7.07%), geraniol (6.23%), E-citral (4.35%), Z-citral (3.29%), and β-ocimene (2.25%). The essential oil of Citrus aurantifolia L. leaves showed excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and moderate activity against pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. The oil exhibited promising in-vitro antioxidant activity (IC50 value = 21.57 μg/mL) but showed moderate antibacterial activities. Conclusions:The essential oil from Omani lime leaves is characterized by a high d-limonene content, making it useful for food, pharmaceutical, and perfumery industries."
