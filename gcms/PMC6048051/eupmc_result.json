    "Sow milk contains necessary nutrients for piglets; however, the relationship between the levels of metabolites in sow milk and lactation performance has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we analysed the metabolites in sow milk from Yorkshire sows with high lactation (HL) or low lactation (LL) performance; these categories were assigned based on the weight gain of piglets during the entire lactation period (D1 to D21). The concentration of milk fat in the colostrum tended to be higher in the HL group (P = 0.05), the level of mannitol was significantly lower in the HL group (P < 0.05) and the level of glucuronic acid lactone was significantly higher in the HL group (P < 0.05) compared to those in LL group. In mature milk, the levels of lactose, creatine, glutamine, glutamate, 4-hydroxyproline, alanine, asparagine, and glycine were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the HL group than those in LL group. The level of fatty acids showed no significant difference between the two groups in both the colostrum and mature milk. This study suggested that lactation performance may be associated with the levels of lactose and several amino acids in sow milk, and these results can be used to develop new feed additives to improve lactation performance in sows."
