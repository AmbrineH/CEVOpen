    "The present publication collects the communications presented in the IV Workshop of the Spanish National Network on Mycotoxins and Toxigenic Fungi and their Decontamination Processes (MICOFOOD), held in the School of Pharmacy and Nutrition of the Universidad de Navarra (Pamplona, Spain) from the 29 to the 31 May 2019. More than 70 professionals from academia, the industry and public services have participated. The scientific program included: five sessions: sponsors (presentation and services), toxigenic fungi, toxicology, analysis and control, and reduction and prevention strategies. In total, 18 oral communications and 24 posters were presented. It is worth mentioning the high participation and quality of the communications from PhD students. The invited conference, entitled: \"Mycotoxins within the framework of exposure assessment: past present and future\", was given by Dr. Barbara de Santis (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy). The meeting ended with the roundtable: \"From feed to fork: safe food without mycotoxins\", where representatives of feed and agrofood companies and public administrations discussed about the current situation and problems related with mycotoxins. Different prizes were awarded for the best oral presentation (Effect of Staphylococcus xylosus on the growth of toxigenic moulds in meat substrates, by E. Cebrian et al., University of Extremadura), and the best posters (Combined toxicity of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A: A systematic review by M. Alonso-Jaúregui et al., Universidad de Navarra; and Application of natamycin in products affected by toxigenic fungi by Torrijos et al., Universitat de València). The participants had the opportunity to learn about the history and gastronomy of Pamplona. Situated in the north of Spain, Pamplona is a city of Roman origin featuring a large gothic cathedral complex and a Vauban citadel of the 16th century."
