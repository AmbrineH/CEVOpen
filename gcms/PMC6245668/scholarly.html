Abstract</div> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Summary</div> <p>Fatty acid synthase (FASN) predominantly generates straight-chain fatty acids using acetyl-CoA as the initiating substrate. However, monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are also present in mammals but thought to be primarily diet-derived. Here we demonstrate that mmBCFAs are <i>de novo</i> synthesized via mitochondrial BCAA catabolism, exported to the cytosol by adipose-specific expression of carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), and elongated by FASN. Brown fat exhibits the highest BCAA catabolic and mmBCFA synthesis fluxes, whereas these lipids are largely absent from liver and brain. mmBCFA synthesis is also sustained in the absence of microbiota. We identify hypoxia as a potent suppressor of BCAA catabolism that decreases mmBCFA synthesis in obese adipose tissue, such that mmBCFAs are significantly decreased in obese animals. These results identify adipose tissue mmBCFA synthesis as a novel link between BCAA metabolism and lipogenesis, highlighting roles for CrAT and FASN promiscuity that influence acyl-chain diversity in the lipidome. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Introduction</div> <p>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine are essential amino acids important for protein synthesis, signaling, and bioenergetics. BCAA catabolism is emerging as a prominently dysregulated pathway in metabolic syndrome <sup> <a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a> </sup> and cancer <sup> <a href="#R3">3</a> </sup>; as such, a greater and more quantitative understanding of this pathway in mammalian physiology is needed. BCAA catabolism is initiated by de-amination via branched chain amino acid transferases (BCATs), and these branched-chain keto acids are subsequently metabolized in mitochondria to generate various acyl-CoA species downstream of the branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. This pathway is active in both energetically demanding tissues such as heart and muscle as well as lipogenic tissues <sup> <a href="#R4">4</a> </sup>. Indeed, studies indicate that adipose BCAA catabolism can compensate for whole-body genetic deficiencies in the pathway <sup> <a href="#R5">5</a> </sup>. Furthermore, carbon from leucine and isoleucine contribute significantly to <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis in differentiated adipocytes <sup> <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a> </sup>, suggesting adipose tissue BCAA catabolism may be important for adipocyte function. </p> <p>The predominant product of <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis in mammals is the saturated 16-carbon fatty acid (FA) palmitate, which is further elongated and/or desaturated in a tissue-specific manner. Both odd-chain (OCFAs) and monomethyl branched-chain (mmBCFAs) FAs are also present in mammals, but these species are considered to be predominantly diet-derived outside of the skin <sup> <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a> </sup>. In lower organisms mmBCFAs are important for controlling membrane fluidity <sup> <a href="#R10">10</a> </sup> and contribute to neural development <sup> <a href="#R11">11</a> </sup>. In mammals, mmBCFAs are found in milk <sup> <a href="#R12">12</a> </sup>, sebum <sup> <a href="#R13">13</a> </sup>, and vernix <sup> <a href="#R14">14</a> </sup>, and mmBCFA levels differ in obese and insulin resistant patients <sup> <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a> </sup>. However, little is known about the metabolism of BCFAs in mammals. Here we demonstrate that mmBCFAs are endogenous products of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and their <i>in vivo</i> synthesis is influenced by mitochondrial BCAA catabolism, tissue-specific expression of carnitine acetyltransferase ( <i>Crat</i>), the microbiome, hypoxia, and diet. mmBCFAs are primarily synthesized in adipose depots and decreased in the context of diet-induced obesity, where adipose-specific hypoxia potently suppresses BCAA catabolism and lipogenesis. These results identify a metabolic pathway in mammals connecting BCAA metabolism and lipid biosynthesis to acyl-chain diversity that is coordinated across distinct tissues and potently regulated by hypoxia. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Mammalian adipocytes synthesize mmBCFAs via FASN</div> <p>Adipocytes undergo substantial mitochondrial and cytosolic metabolic reprogramming upon differentiation. We and others have previously shown that a distinct feature of this metabolic reprogramming is upregulation of BCAA catabolism, which becomes a significant source of carbon for both TCA cycle metabolism and lipogenic acetyl-CoA <sup> <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a> </sup>. In cultured adipocytes, odd-chain FAs (C15:0 and C17:0) synthesized from valine and isoleucine-derived propionyl-CoA can also accumulate due to vitamin B12 deficiency and decreased activity of the B12-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase <sup> <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a> </sup>. In addition to the increased BCAA catabolism and OCFA synthesis observed in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes, we detected accumulation of several mass isomers of the FAs C16:0 (palmitate) and C17:0 (heptadecanoate), which eluted before the predominant straight-chain isomers in our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. As compromised B12 metabolism can lead to accumulation of monomethyl branched-chain FAs (mmBCFAs) in the brain <sup> <a href="#R18">18</a> </sup>, we hypothesized that these alternate mass isomers were mmBCFAs and subsequently used analytical standards to confirm their identities. We detected increases in 14-methylpentadecanoate (iso-C16:0), 14-methylhexadecanoate (anteiso-C17:0) and 15-methylhexadecanoate (iso-C17:0) during differentiation of 3T3L1 adipocytes, with iso-C16:0 occurring at the highest abundance ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1a</a>). These FAs have a single branch at either the penultimate or antepenultimate carbon of the acyl chain ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</a>), with the position impacting elution times ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). Interestingly, the relative abundance of anteiso-C17:0 was impacted by B12 availability in this culture system ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1b</a>), suggesting that these species were actively metabolized by adipocytes. </p> <p>To determine whether mmBCFAs were synthesized <i>de novo</i>, we cultured 3T3L1 adipocytes with [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>6</sub>]glucose, which generates <sup>13</sup>C fully labeled acetyl-CoA units and a distinct M+2 isotopologue pattern in newly synthesized FAs ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1c</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</a>). We detected significant enrichment in mmBCFAs ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1d</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c-d</a>), demonstrating that these FAs are synthesized in a similar manner to palmitate via acetyl-CoA incorporation. Additionally, treatment with the ACC inhibitor ND646 <sup> <a href="#R19">19</a> </sup> led to a significant decrease in <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of both straight-chain and mmBCFAs, indicating their synthesis is dependent on malonyl-CoA from ACC ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1e</a>). </p> <p>While cytosolic FASN is the predominant enzyme used for <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis in mammalian cells, mitochondrial FAS II has been proposed as a hypothetical route for mmBCFA synthesis in eukaryotes <sup> <a href="#R20">20</a> </sup>. To determine whether the cellular location of mmBCFA synthesis differed from that of palmitate we traced adipocytes with [3- <sup>2</sup>H]glucose. Deuterium labeling on the third carbon of glucose specifically labels cytosolic NADPH via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway but is lost in glycolysis and does not label citrate, acetyl-CoA or mitochondrial NADPH ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1f</a>) <sup> <a href="#R21">21</a> </sup>. If a significant portion of mmBCFAs were synthesized within mitochondria, decreased <sup>2</sup>H enrichment relative to palmitate would be expected. We found cytosolic NADPH effectively labelled both mmBCFAs and palmitate, suggesting these FAs were primarily synthesized in the cytosol by FASN ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1g</a>), albeit at slower rates than palmitate ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 1e-f</a>). Next, we generated pooled cultures of 3T3L1 adipocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated FASN knockout (KO) prior to differentiation ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a-b</a>). While the abundance of all FAs decreased, mmBCFAs were undetectable in all FASN KO cells but abundant in sgNT cells ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1h</a>). However, differentiation was significantly impaired ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</a>). To further confirm that FASN deficiency rather than impaired differentiation and lack of substrate decreased BCFA synthesis, we supplemented cultures with the short-branched chain FAs isobutyrate, isovalerate, 2-methyl-butyrate, and propionate. Addition of these substrates increased mmBCFA and OCFA abundances in a dose-dependent manner ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1i</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d-f</a>). While iso-C16:0 levels significantly increased in control adipocytes and non-differentiated pre-adipocytes upon addition of isobutyrate, iso-C16:0 levels were still undetectable in FASN KO cells ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 2g</a>), indicating that lack of FASN rather than impaired differentiation was the primary reason for the absence of BCFA synthesis. Furthermore, treatment with the FASN inhibitor TVB3166 significantly decreased synthesis of both iso-C16:0 and palmitate ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 2h</a>). While the mitochondrial FAS II system may also contribute to mmBCFA synthesis, our results demonstrate that cytosolic <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis via FASN promiscuity is the primary driver of mmBCFA production in adipocytes <sup> <a href="#R22">22</a> </sup>. </p> </div> <div class="bcaacatabolicintermediatesdrivemmbcfasynthesis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
BCAA catabolic intermediates drive mmBCFA synthesis</div> <p>The minor impact of B12 availability on iso-C16:0 and iso-C17:0 suggests that these FAs are not synthesized via elongation of methylmalonyl-CoA. Administration of radioisotopes to rats has indicated that BCAAs are precursors for mmBCFAs in skin <sup> <a href="#R23">23</a> </sup>. In addition, provision of isovaleryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA or 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to enzyme extracts from rat epididymal tissue results in the production of mmBCFAs <sup> <a href="#R22">22</a> </sup>. To confirm this pathway architecture exists within intact adipocytes we cultured adipocytes with uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labeled BCAAs and quantified labeling via GC-MS. This resulted in distinct labeling patterns for each of their respective mmBCFAs ( <a href="#F2">Fig 2a-d</a>). Carbon from [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>]valine was only incorporated into iso-C16:0 and resulted in a prominent M+4 peak in the isotopologue distribution, indicating the valine catabolic intermediate isobutyryl-CoA was used to synthesize iso-C16:0 ( <a href="#F2">Fig 2a-b</a>). Similarly, iso-C17:0 from [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>6</sub>]leucine and anteiso-C17:0 from [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>6</sub>]isoleucine exhibited distinct M+5 shifts, indicating that isovaleryl-CoA and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA were used for mmBCFA synthesis ( <a href="#F2">Fig 2a, c-d</a>). Notably, we detected no FA isotopologues of M+8 or M+10, indicating that only a single incorporation of these branched intermediates into the acyl chain was occurring in these cells. This result, combined with the observation that only mmBCFAs with a branch at the penultimate or antepenultimate end were detected, supports a mechanism whereby FASN is promiscuous and can use short acyl-CoAs to initiate synthesis of long chain FAs. </p> <p>Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACAD) are annotated to carry out the dehydrogenations of isovaleryl-CoA, 2-methylbutyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA. To evaluate the specific roles of these enzymes in BCAA catabolism and mmBCFA synthesis, we targeted various ACAD enzymes via shRNA-mediated knockdown and quantified FA abundances after adipocyte differentiation ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a-c</a>). Knockdown of ACAD8, IVD and ACADSB specifically and significantly increased levels of iso-C16:0, iso-C17:0 and anteiso-C17:0, respectively ( <a href="#F2">Fig 2e-g</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 3d-f</a>). Targeting of ACADM and ACADS did not impact mmBCFA levels appreciably. Each mmBCFA accumulated differently, with valine-derived iso-C16:0 having the highest abundance ( <a href="#F1">Fig 1a</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 3d</a>), inversely consistent with the relative expression of each dehydrogenase ( <a href="#F2">Fig 2h</a>). These findings indicate that ACAD enzyme expression influences the metabolic fate of BCAAs and mmBCFA production. </p> </div> <div class="mmbcfasareincorporatedintodistinctlipidspecies" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
mmBCFAs are incorporated into distinct lipid species</div> <p>The above data are representative of total hydrolyzed FA pools in the cell. To further characterize the metabolic fate of mmBCFAs, we next sought to determine whether mmBCFAs were incorporated into distinct lipid species. Distinguishing lipids containing different acyl chain isomers such as iso-C16:0 and C16:0 (palmitate) is challenging with liquid chromatography due to decreased isomer resolution compared to gas chromatography, and there have been limited reports of mmBCFAs in specific, intact lipids <sup> <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a> </sup>. To circumvent this issue we utilized [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>]valine tracing to differentiate lipids containing C16:0 versus iso-C16:0 acyl-chains, since lipids synthesized with the latter would contain distinct M+4 peaks ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a-c</a>). We quantified M+0 and M+4 isotopologue abundances using targeted LC-MS/MS in 46 lipid species containing 16-carbon acyl chains in adipocytes cultured with [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>]valine or [ <sup>12</sup>C]valine. Of those measured species, 11 lipids had significant enrichment of M+4 ions in [U <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>]valine-traced cells over [ <sup>12</sup>C]valine-traced cells ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 4d-e</a>). The highest % total enrichments were observed in species containing alkyl chains, suggesting iso-C16:0 may be selectively incorporated into ether lipids. Notably, some BCFAs (e.g. phytanic acid) must be trafficked to the peroxisome for α-oxidation, and peroxisomes are the site for ether lipid synthesis due to the presence of alkyl DHAP synthase and DHAPAT. As such, mmBCFAs may be similarly directed to the peroxisome, leading to the observed high enrichment in abundant alkyl-lipids. Other significantly enriched lipids included sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and triacylglycerols (TAGs). In fact, induction of lipolysis via isoproterenol treatment resulted in significant mmBCFA secretion into culture medium indicating these FAs are present in lipid droplets ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 4f</a>). </p> </div> <div class="mmbcfasaredenovosynthesizedinvivo" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
mmBCFAs are <i>de novo</i> synthesized <i>in vivo</i> </div> <p>To determine whether mmBCFA synthesis occurs <i>in vivo</i>, we quantified the abundances of each mmBCFA across various tissues in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Consistent with our observation of mmBCFA synthesis in adipocytes, white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) exhibited the highest abundances of all mmBCFAs, including iso-C18:0, an elongated derivative of iso-C16:0 that was not detectable in 3T3L1 cultures ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3a-b</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a-b</a>). Liver and brain exhibited the lowest abundances of mmBCFAs, suggesting FA composition is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, iso-C17:0 abundance differed between males and females, potentially due to hormonal effects on BCAA catabolism <sup> <a href="#R25">25</a> </sup>. With the exception of anteiso-C17:0, total mmBCFAs (free and lipid bound) were present in plasma at μM concentrations ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 5c</a>), and their abundances increased 2–3 fold in plasma upon prolonged fasting ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3c</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 5d</a>). Although these measurements are of total rather than free FAs, these data suggest that iso-BCFAs are released from adipose tissue via lipolysis along with other FAs. </p> <p>As microbial metabolism is a source of both long and short BCFAs <sup> <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a> </sup> ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6a</a>), the gut microbiome could be a significant source of mmBCFAs in animals. In addition, mmBCFAs are present in chow ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6b</a>) and thus diet will also contribute to mmBCFA levels <i>in vivo</i>. To determine the relative contribution of <i>de novo</i> synthesis versus diet and the impact of microbiota on mmBCFA levels, we administered <sup>2</sup>H <sub>2</sub>O to germ free and specific pathogen free (SPF) control mice for 8 days and measured enrichment of FAs in lipogenic tissues <sup> <a href="#R28">28</a> </sup> ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3d</a>). A significant fraction of the mmBCFAs present were newly synthesized in both germ free and SPF mice ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3e-f</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6c-d</a>). Valine-derived iso-C16:0 was the most abundantly synthesized mmBCFA ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3g-h</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6e-f</a>), and the fraction of newly synthesized iso-C16:0 was similar to that for palmitate (C16:0) in eWAT, iWAT and BAT ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3e-f</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6c</a>). Overall, these data indicate that <i>de novo</i> synthesis is a significant source of mmBCFAs <i>in vivo,</i> and their production can occur in the absence of microbiota. However, both levels ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6g-j</a>) and synthesis of mmBCFAs and other FAs differed significantly in the adipose tissues of germ free and SPF mice, indicating that microbiota impacts lipogenesis and FA diversity. </p> <p>To confirm that <i>de novo</i> synthesis of mmBCFAs occurs in humans, we analyzed plasma from NAFLD patients administered <sup>2</sup>H <sub>2</sub>O ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Table 2</a> and <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 6k-l</a>).

BCAA flux to mmBCFAs is decreased by diet-induced obesity</div> <p>Clinical studies have indicated that BCAA metabolism is dysregulated in the context of metabolic syndrome, as plasma BCAAs and some catabolites are elevated in insulin resistant patients <sup> <a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a> </sup>. Additionally, BCAA catabolic enzyme expression is decreased in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD) <sup> <a href="#R17">17</a> </sup>. Conversely, plasma mmBCFAs are decreased in morbidly obese patients <sup> <a href="#R15">15</a> </sup>. To determine if mmBCFA levels change in mouse models of obesity, we quantified total FAs in plasma and WAT of mice fed a HFD or low-fat diet (LFD) for 15 weeks. Although intake of all FAs (including mmBCFAs) was increased in the HFD cohort ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</a>), iso-BCFA abundances were significantly lower ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4a-b</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 7b-c</a>). In terms of fold changes, valine-derived iso-C16:0 and iso-C18:0 were the most differentially abundant FAs in these tissues. Relative abundances of straight-chain FAs increased or remained unchanged, with the exceptions of C16:1 (palmitoleate) and C15:0 ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4a</a>). Similar results were observed in ob/ob mice, where mmBCFAs were significantly decreased in iWAT relative to control mice ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 7d</a>). Notably, anteiso-C17:0 levels increase in the plasma of HFD mice ( <a href="#F4">Figure 4b</a>). Given that synthesis of anteiso-C17:0 was nearly undetectable in <sup>2</sup>H <sub>2</sub>O traced mice ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3g-h</a>), this FA is primarily diet-derived and synthesis from isoleucine is not significant <i>in vivo</i>. These results demonstrate that individual FAs change distinctly with the onset of obesity depending on their origin and metabolism. </p> <p>To directly investigate altered BCAA catabolism in the context of metabolic syndrome, we fed C57BL/6J mice a HFD or LFD for 12 weeks followed by 3 weeks of feeding with identical diets formulated with 25% enriched [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N]valine and [U- <sup>13</sup>C <sub>6</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N]leucine ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8a</a>). Although fasting plasma glucose levels were elevated ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8b</a>), plasma BCAA levels were unchanged ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8c</a>), consistent with recent studies in C57BL/6J mice, <sup> <a href="#R30">30</a> </sup> and we observed no differences in plasma leucine and valine enrichment ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8d</a>). Significant differences were present within tissues, however ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8e-f</a>). We detected significant <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of citrate and palmitate in all tissues measured ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4c-d</a>), indicating leucine catabolism is a significant source of acetyl-CoA <i>in vivo</i>. In the HFD cohort, <sup>13</sup>C enrichment and molar abundance in citrate and palmitate, respectively, were significantly decreased in all tissues, with BAT being the most impacted, demonstrating that diet-induced obesity decreases BCAA catabolism ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4c-d</a>). The leucine and valine-derived mmBCFAs had characteristic M+4 and M+5 mass shifts indicating these FAs were synthesized <i>de novo</i> from BCAAs <i>in vivo</i> ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4e</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8g-h</a>). Importantly, molar enrichment of iso-BCFAs from valine and leucine were decreased in total FA pools from almost all tissues analyzed ( <a href="#F4">Fig 4f</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8i-j</a>). The highest abundances of newly synthesized, long chain iso-BCFAs were present in brown adipose tissue, although cross-tissue transport is likely significant given the high FA enrichments detected in muscle and heart. Collectively, these data indicate that diet-induced obesity significantly decreases BCAA catabolic flux, and a downstream result of this regulation is lower mmBCFA synthesis and abundance throughout the body. </p> <p>In contrast to mmBCFAs, we did not detect a pronounced M+3 shift in OCFAs ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 8k</a>), consistent with the abundance of other propionate sources in animals (e.g. gut microbes, OCFA oxidation, and cholesterol breakdown) or their production via α-oxidation <sup> <a href="#R31">31</a> </sup>. While valine is a source of propionate in cultured adipocytes, this pathway is not a major source of OCFAs <i>in vivo</i> under normal physiological conditions <sup> <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a> </sup>.

Adipose tissue mmBCFA synthesis is facilitated by CrAT</div> <p>The above results demonstrate that BCAA catabolic flux contributes significantly to <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis <i>in vivo</i>, and mmBCFAs are abundant products of this pathway. The large (~10-fold) differences in abundance within liver and adipose tissues ( <a href="#F3">Fig 3a-b</a>) suggest that mmBCFA synthesis is regulated distinctly in these tissues. To assess the impact of diet on tissue-specific mmBCFA synthesis and enable comparison to synthesis of other FAs, we administered <sup>2</sup>H <sub>2</sub>O to HFD and LFD mice and measured enrichment in lipogenic tissues. Newly synthesized iso-C16:0 and iso-C18:0 were decreased in livers of HFD mice more than any other FA in terms of fold-change ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5a</a>). In contrast, straight-chain and monounsaturated FA synthesis in the liver was increased or remained the same ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5a</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a</a>). Within adipose tissues, HFD feeding decreased lipogenesis of all FAs, indicating pathway activity is generally suppressed ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5b</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 9b-d</a>) as previously observed <sup> <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a> </sup>. We next estimated FA synthesis/turnover occurring in each tissue based on the molar abundance of each FA, fraction synthesized, and length of time tracer was administered. mmBCFA turnover was highest in white and brown adipose tissues but substantially lower in liver ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5c</a>, <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 9e-g</a>). While brown adipose tissue exhibited the highest synthesis/turnover for all FAs, these measurements are likely a lower estimate since they do not account for β-oxidation and futile FA cycling, which are likely quite high in brown adipocytes <sup> <a href="#R34">34</a> </sup>. HFD suppressed the synthesis of all FAs in adipose tissues but increased palmitate synthesis/turnover in liver ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5d</a>). These results suggest that subcutaneous and brown adipocytes exhibit a high capacity for mmBCFA synthesis when lipogenesis is active in these depots (i.e. LFD). Indeed, mmBCFA synthesis in brown adipose tissue is significantly increased in cold-exposed mice ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5e</a>), similar to the increased <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis of other FAs <sup> <a href="#R34">34</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Liver exhibited relatively low abundances of newly synthesized mmBCFAs compared to other lipogenic tissues, and these levels decreased further in response to HFD, which contrasts the changes observed for other FAs in the liver. Importantly, this tracing method does not account for lipid efflux and inter-tissue FA transport and thus likely underestimates absolute FA synthesis in liver. Nevertheless, our collective data on abundance and synthesis of all FAs strongly indicates that mmBCFAs are synthesized in adipose tissues but not liver. </p> <p>BCAA catabolism and lipogenesis are highly active in liver, so we next attempted to address why mmBCFA synthesis is specific to adipose tissues. mmBCFA synthesis requires BCAA catabolic intermediates to be exported from the mitochondria into the cytosol for elongation by FASN. Prior studies have demonstrated that carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) but not carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) exhibits enzyme activity towards BCAA-derived, short branched-chain CoAs <sup> <a href="#R35">35</a> </sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that CrAT facilitates mmBCFA synthesis in adipose tissues. <i>Crat</i> mRNA is expressed at low levels in liver but exhibits high expression in muscle and adipose tissues ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5f</a>). Additionally, quantitative proteomics indicates that CrAT is expressed at higher levels in white and brown adipose tissue compared to liver and brain ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a</a>) <sup> <a href="#R36">36</a> </sup>. Thus, tissue-specific CrAT expression may be a driver of the observed differences in mmBCFA abundance and synthesis between liver, brain, and adipose tissues. </p> <p>To more directly determine how CrAT influences mmBCFA synthesis we generated CrAT KO 3T3L1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 10b</a>). In contrast to results with FASN KO, CrAT KO did not appreciably impact adipogenesis ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 10c-d</a>). However, CrAT KO adipocytes had significantly decreased levels of both mmBCFAs and OCFAs ( <a href="#F5">Fig 5g</a>), with minimal differences in the levels of other FAs ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 10e</a>). These data indicate that CrAT is an important component of the mmBCFA synthesis pathway, facilitating cytosolic export of precursor acyl-CoAs ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 10f</a>). Differential expression of this enzyme in liver versus BAT and WAT likely contributes to the tissue specificity of mmBCFA synthesis and abundance. </p> </div> <div class="hypoxiasuppressesbcaacatabolismandmmbcfasynthesis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Hypoxia suppresses BCAA catabolism and mmBCFA synthesis</div> <p>Our data indicate that mmBCFAs are predominantly synthesized in adipose depots, decrease in the context of diet-induced obesity, and increase in plasma during prolonged fasting. Given the adipose origin of mmBCFAs, we sought to determine the physiological factors that drive decreased BCAA catabolism and mmBCFA synthesis in obesity <i>in vivo</i>. Hypoxia has been proposed as a key contributory factor to adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity <sup> <a href="#R37">37</a> </sup>, and increasing adipose vascularization improves insulin sensitivity <sup> <a href="#R38">38</a> </sup>. To test the impact of hypoxia on BCAA metabolism in adipocytes, we incubated differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes in 1% oxygen for 24 hours before switching to hypoxia-equilibrated media containing uniformly <sup>13</sup>C labeled amino acids or glucose for an additional 24 hours. Intracellular BCAAs and α-ketoisocaproate accumulated significantly in hypoxic cultures, along with lactate and 2-hydroxyglutarate ( <a href="#F6">Fig 6a</a>). Media analysis demonstrated that glycolytic flux increased along with net glutamine consumption, while BCAA uptake decreased approximately 3–4 fold ( <a href="#F6">Fig 6b</a>). Consistent with these flux changes, TCA intermediate enrichment from [U- <sup>13</sup>C]BCAAs was decreased under hypoxia ( <a href="#F6">Fig 6c</a>). Isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) demonstrated that the relative contribution of leucine to lipogenic acetyl-CoA decreased significantly, whereas the glutamine contribution to FAs increased ( <a href="#F6">Fig 6d</a>). Notably, hypoxia generally decreased the synthesis of FAs, including OCFAs and mmBCFAs ( <a href="#F6">Fig 6e</a>). Collectively these data indicate that hypoxia strongly decreases BCAA catabolism. These results were recapitulated in primary cells derived from various tissues, including murine brown adipocytes and human skeletal myotubes and white adipocytes ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 11a</a>). </p> <p> <i>Bckdha</i> and <i>Bcat2</i> mRNA and protein product were decreased under hypoxia in 3T3L1 adipocytes ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 11b-d</a>). Additionally, we observed that adipose tissue oxygen tension and arterial blood flow were specifically decreased in HFD mice along with BCKDHA protein levels ( <a href="#SD1">Supplementary Figure 11e-g</a>), corroborating previous findings in obese adipose tissue <sup> <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a> </sup>. Overall, these data indicate that adipose tissue in obese animals exhibits lower oxygen tension, which may contribute to the observed decreases in BCAA catabolism and BCKDHA levels we observed in adipose tissue from HFD mice. In turn, decreased flux through this pathway decreases local and circulating iso-mmBCFA levels in obesity. </p> </div> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>Here, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> metabolic tracing, we define a cross-tissue metabolic pathway where BCAA catabolic flux and the promiscuity of FASN and CrAT within brown and white adipose tissues support mmBCFA synthesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that mmBCFA turnover is suppressed by HFD and obesity-induced adipose hypoxia. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mmBCFAs are endogenous FAs produced by adipocytes that link mitochondrial BCAA catabolism, lipogenesis, and diet to metabolic disease. </p> <p>To date, the primary metabolic role of BCAA catabolism has been attributed to its importance as a nitrogen donor <sup> <a href="#R40">40</a> </sup>, production of HIBA to modulate FA uptake <sup> <a href="#R41">41</a> </sup>, and the generation of branched acyl intermediates that can modulate enzyme function via post-translational modifications <sup> <a href="#R42">42</a> </sup>. Our data adds to this knowledge, linking BCAA catabolism to modulation of FA diversity via enzyme promiscuity. Interestingly, mmBCFAs are synthesized and present at low levels in liver, despite the high abundance of BCKDH and rate of lipogenesis <sup> <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a> </sup>. We provide evidence this difference is driven by differential expression of <i>Crat</i>, an enzyme that has predominantly been studied in muscle, where it is thought to mitigate fatigue by facilitating acetyl-CoA consumption during exercise and preventing acetyl-CoA accumulation during rest <sup> <a href="#R45">45</a> </sup>, thus decreasing macronutrient induced lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins <sup> <a href="#R46">46</a> </sup>. However, its relevance in brown and white adipose tissues has not been explored, despite the high level of expression observed in brown adipose tissue <sup> <a href="#R36">36</a> </sup>. Given recent evidence that branched acyl lysine modifications also alter mitochondrial enzyme function <sup> <a href="#R42">42</a> </sup>, it is possible that diversion of branched CoA intermediates to long chain FAs via CrAT is beneficial for maintaining healthy mitochondrial function. </p> <p>We also highlight an underappreciated aspect of <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis, whereby the <i>de novo</i> FA composition reflects the balance of acyl-CoAs within the body. Thus, FASN promiscuity integrates changes in amino acid metabolism and short chain FAs into the lipidome. Therefore, alterations in SCFA and acyl-CoA abundance driven by the gut microbiome, diet, or inborn errors of metabolism can influence FA diversity and must be considered when studying the pathophysiology of associated diseases. Indeed, elevated levels of mmBCFAs have been detected in the brains of patients with defects in cobalamin metabolism <sup> <a href="#R18">18</a> </sup>. Supraphysiological levels of mmBCFAs could impact neuronal function and play a role in the neurological defects that occur in patients with certain organic acidemias or B12 deficiency. This work also highlights the limited resolution of most lipidomics platforms for resolving mmBCFA-containing lipids. We found that mmBCFAs are incorporated into diverse lipid species by cultured adipocytes, including ether lipids, TAGs, and phospholipids. However, more extensive and focused approaches are needed to fully characterize their fates within different tissues. </p> <p>Using <sup>13</sup>C labeled leucine and valine chow, we observed that HFD feeding suppressed BCAA catabolism, resulting in decreased mmBCFA synthesis. This result is consistent with transcriptional and other flux-based measurements that indicate downregulation of this pathway in mouse models of obesity and diabetic patients <sup> <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a> </sup>. In fact, mmBCFAs correlate negatively with metabolic disease biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and insulin resistance in patients <sup> <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a> </sup>. This contrasts with levels of BCAAs and their downstream catabolic intermediates, which increase in the plasma of insulin resistant patients <sup> <a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a> </sup>. However, BCAA levels did not increase in our model of diet-induced obesity, and thus mmBCFA levels did not correlate with BCAA levels as might be expected. This is presumably due to the adipose specific origin of these FAs, as BCAAs are widely catabolized in energetically demanding tissues such as muscle, liver, heart and brain which are not significant sources of mmBCFAs. Furthermore, BCAA turnover and abundance is much greater than that of mmBCFAs. Therefore, while mmBCFA synthesis is impacted by BCAA catabolic flux, differential mmBCFA production is unlikely to be a primary driver of BCAA accumulation in T2D patients. Nevertheless, mmBCFAs may be a strong biomarker of adipose tissue lipogenesis and BCAA catabolism, and in contrast to circulating BCAA levels, are not overtly influenced by changes in protein turnover and muscle insulin resistance. </p> <p>The functional consequences of decreased mmBCFA levels are unknown. Despite their abundance in tissues and presence at μM levels in plasma, mmBCFAs have been studied minimally in the context of mammalian biology. mmBCFA-containing lipids play critical roles in the postembryonic growth, neuronal development and foraging behavior of <i>C. elegans</i> <sup> <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a> </sup>. In prokaryotes BCFAs influence membrane fluidity, and their abundances change in response to certain stresses <sup> <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a> </sup>. In mammalian biology, previous studies have suggested they influence colon epithelial cell inflammation <sup> <a href="#R49">49</a> </sup> and protect against necrotizing enterocolitis <sup> <a href="#R50">50</a> </sup>. Our insights into the metabolic origins and fates of mmBCFAs suggest other potential functions. Since mmBCFAs are primarily synthesized in adipose tissue, incorporated into TAGs, and increase in plasma during fasting, these lipids may be involved in nutrient sensing and signal to other tissues in the body. However, given the relatively low abundance of mmBCFAs, these FAs are unlikely to contribute significantly to energy storage or substrate oxidation and are more likely to play a role in signaling or membrane structure. Ultimately, understanding the factors that regulate mmBCFA physiology is an essential step in elucidating their function and contribution to the biological importance of the BCAA catabolic pathway. </p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The solution was equilibrated with 95% N <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO <sub>2</sub>, which maintained the superfusate at a pH of 7.4 and minimized O <sub>2</sub> delivery to the tissue from the atmosphere.

Samples were analyzed by GC-MS using a DB-35MS column (30m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 <i>μ</i>m, Agilent J&amp;amp;W Scientific) installed in an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (GC) interfaced with an Agilent 5977B mass spectrometer (MS) using the following temperature program: 50 °C initial with a hold time of 0.8 minutes, followed by an increase of 25 °C/min to 120 °C and then an increase of 100 °C/min to 280 °C. Samples were injected using split mode(25 ml/min split flow) and the mass spectrometer was operated in scan mode between 50 – 150 AMU. Acetate was quantified from the internal acetate isotope standard and all other SCFAs were quantified from a standard curve extracted in parallel. </p> <p>The isotopologue distributions of acetate and isovalerate were obtained via diethyl ether extraction and TBDMS derivatization of cecal water. Briefly, 10 μl concentrated HCL (37%) and 1ml Et <sub>2</sub>O was added to 100 μl cecal water followed by 10 minutes of vortexing and centrifugation at 18,000g at 15°C for 5 minutes. The upper phase was added to a new tube and the Et <sub>2</sub>O extraction step was repeated. 250 μl of the extract was aliquoted in triplicate to GC vials and 25 μls MTBSTFA + 1% tBDMS was added followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 hour prior to GCMS analysis with the following temperature program: 80 °C initial with a hold time of 0.8 minutes, followed by an increase of 15 °C/min to 150 °C with a hold time of 2 minutes, then an increase by 50 °C/min to 280 °C.

Plasma <sup>2</sup>H <sub>2</sub>O enrichment analysis </div> <p>The <sup>2</sup>H labeling of water from samples or standards was determined via deuterium acetone exchange. 5 μl of sample or standard was reacted with 4 μl of 10N NaOH and 4 μl of a 5% (v/v) solution of acetone in acetonitrile for 24 hours. Acetone was extracted by the addition of 600 ul chloroform and 0.5 g Na <sub>2</sub>SO <sub>4</sub> followed by vigorous mixing. 100 μl of the chloroform was then transferred to a GC/MS vial. Acetone was measured using an Agilent DB-35MS column (30 m 3 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm, Agilent J&amp;amp;W Scientific) installed in an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) interfaced with an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer (MS) with the following temperature program: 60 °C initial, increase by 20 °C/min to 100 °C, increase by 50 °C/min to 220 °C, and hold for 1 min. The split ratio was 40:1 with a helium flow of 1 ml/min. Acetone eluted at approximately 1.5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode (70 eV). The mass ions 58 and 59 were integrated and the % M1 (m/z 59) calculated. Known standards were used to generate a standard curve and plasma % enrichment was determined from this.

LC/MS lipidomic analysis</div> <p>Lipid extraction was carried out using a Folch-based methanol/chloroform/saline extraction at a ratio of 1:2:1 with the inclusion of C12:0 dodecylglycerol and hexadecanoic acid-d <sub>31</sub> as internal standards. The methanol phase was washed a second time with chloroform after addition of 1 μl formic acid. Metabolite separation was achieved with a Luna reverse-phase C5 column (50 × 4.6 mm, with 5-μm-diameter particles; Phenomenex). Mobile phase A was composed of a 95:5 ratio of water:methanol, and mobile phase B consisted of isopropanol, methanol, and water in a 60:35:5 ratio. Solvent modifiers 0.1% formic acid with 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% ammonium hydroxide were used to assist ion formation and to improve the LC resolution in both positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. The flow rate for each run started at 0.1 mL/min for 5 min to alleviate backpressure associated with injecting chloroform. The gradient started at 0% B and increased linearly to 100% B over the course of 45 min with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, followed by an isocratic gradient of 100% B for 17 min at 0.5 mL/min, before equilibrating for 8 min at 0% B with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. MS analysis was performed with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source on an Agilent 6430 QQQ LC-MS/MS. The capillary voltage was set to 3.0 kV, and the fragmentor voltage was set to 100 V. The drying gas temperature was 350 °C, the drying gas flow rate was 10 L/min, and the nebulizer pressure was 35 psi. Representative lipids were quantified by SRM of the transition from precursor to product ions at associated optimized collision energies as previously described <sup> <a href="#R58">58</a> </sup>. Briefly, for the SRM transitions where the transition of parent masses to the loss of the headgroup (e.g. loss of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine) is monitored, the acyl chain specificities were determined from previously described procedures <sup> <a href="#R58">58</a> </sup>. For phospholipids such as PCs and PEs, the fatty acid acyl chain composition was determined from phospholipids using a mobile phase containing both ammonium hydroxide and formic acid and monitored the fatty acid fragmentations from [M-H+HCO2H] m/z at 40 V collision energy in negative ionization mode. For other phospholipids such as PAs and PIs, the fatty acid fragmentations from [M-H] m/z at 40 V collision energy in negative ionization mode in mobile phase containing just ammonium hydroxide were monitored. The identifying ion and the M+4(mass increment of 4) ion of each lipid was monitored and relative abundance was determined by integrating the area under the curve followed by normalization to internal standard values. Significant incorporation of U <sup>13</sup>C valine into lipids was determined by comparing the relative abundance of the M+4 ion of each lipid species targeted in [U <sup>13</sup>C <sub>5</sub>]valine traced cells versus cells that had no tracer added (no trace) via fold change differences and students t-test. Percentage enrichment of each lipid species was determined via: </p><div class="disp-formula" title="disp-formula"> <div class="math_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mrow_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mi_UNKNOWN">
