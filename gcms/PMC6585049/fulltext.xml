Most enriched drought-responsive genes are mainly involved in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, plant hormone signal transduction photosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Drought-susceptible genotype was more disturbed by drought stress at both transcriptional and metabolic levels, since more drought-responsive genes/metabolites were identified in DS. Drought-responsive genes associated with stress response, amino acid metabolism, and reactive oxygen species scavenging were more enriched or activated in DT. According to the partial least-squares discriminate analysis, the most important metabolites which were accumulated under drought stress in both genotypes includes ABA, amino acids, and organic acids. Especially, higher levels of ABA, proline, arginine, lysine, aromatic and branched chain amino acids, GABA, saccharopine, 2-aminoadipate, and allantoin were found in DT under stress condition. Combination of transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis highlights the important role of amino acid metabolism (especially saccharopine pathway) and ABA metabolism and signaling pathway for drought tolerance in sesame.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The results of the present study provide valuable information for better understanding the molecular mechanism underlying drought tolerance of sesame, and also provide useful clues for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in sesame.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12870-019-1880-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sesame</kwd><kwd>Drought stress</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Metabolome</kwd><kwd>Abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>Amino acids</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010203</institution-id><institution>Agriculture Research System of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiurong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>CAAS-ASTIP-2013-OCRI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiurong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010909</institution-id><institution>Young Scientists Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31500223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>1610172018007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Sesame (<italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> L), an ancient oil crop, is a popular ingredient in cuisines across the world. Sesame seeds are well known for their high oil content (~&#x02009;58%) and protein content (~&#x02009;25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sesame oil is regarded as superior quality oil due to a high content of unsaturated-fatty acid (~&#x02009;85%) and the presence of antioxidants (such as sesamin, sesamolin and tocopherols) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Sesame is traditionally grown in drought-prone and marginal areas with sub-optimal water and nutrients supply. Although sesame has adapted to semi-arid conditions, it is sensitive to drought stresses at vegetative and reproduction stages, leading to reduce growth and loss in yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, the quality of sesame seed, such as oil and protein content, also reduced by severe water stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the complex mechanisms underlying drought resistance in sesame and apply acquired knowledge for developing drought-resistant sesame cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Drought stress, the most important limiting environmental factors for sustainable agriculture, is responsible for the largest loses of global food productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With the development of molecule biotechnology, the molecular mechanism of drought response in plants has been gradually unveiled through functional genomics approaches. External drought stimuli is perceived by unknown sensors on the membrane, and then the signals are delivered through multiple signaling pathways, resulting in the expression of drought-responsive genes so as to confer drought tolerance in the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A multitude of signaling molecules, such as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, abscisic acid (ABA), inositol phosphate, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), are important for drought signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The ABA signaling pathway is central to drought stress responses in plants, and it has been clearly elucidated by the identification of ABA receptors and other core signaling components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Stress induced ABA perception by the ABA receptor PYR/PYL/RCAR suppresses the phosphatase activities of Group A PP2Cs, results in the activation of SnRK2s, which further phosphorylation or activation of downstream targets such as bZIP transcription factors and ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Transcription factors (TFs) are important components involved in transcriptional regulatory network functioning in drought abiotic stress responses. Members of DREB or CBF, bZIP, MYB, MYC, and NAC families have been characterized with roles in the regulation of plant drought responses through ABA-dependent and/or ABA-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, RNA-seq is extensively used to unravel the molecular basis of drought responses in many plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Transcriptome analysis of most studies revealed that changes occur in photosynthesis, hormone signal transduction, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolites, as well as fatty acid metabolism in response to drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">An obvious example for metabolites involved in plant stress response is the accumulation of sugar (such as trehalose and fructan) or amino acids (such as proline) that serve as osmoprotectant under drought stress. Mass spectrometric based global metabolic profiling, which targets a broader spectrum of metabolites, provides a comprehensive platform for investigating the metabolic reprogramming of plants under environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, metabolic analyses have confirmed that changes in primary and secondary metabolites are associated with drought responses in several plant species. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the levels of most amino acids (such as proline, glutamine, tryptophan, alanine, aspartate, ornithine, isoleucine, leucine, valine), intermediates from TCA cycle (such as 2-oxoglutarate, <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate, and succinate), flavonoids (such as quercetin and cyanidin) and lipids (such as glycosylinositolphosphoceramides and acylated steryl glycosides) were increased under drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar changes in the levels of metabolites including amino acids and organic acid under drought stress were also reported in crop plants, such as rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">High-throughput multi-omics technologies are proving useful to meet the challenges in various research disciplines of crop plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Since the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress resistance in sesame are largely unknown, functional genomics approaches involving transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of the plant subjected to environmental stress including drought are required in sesame. Transcriptomic experiments have been carried out in sesame to study the response to drought and waterlogging stress in root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, there are no studies to date reporting the analysis of drought response in leaves of sesame by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics. In this study, we characterized transcriptional and metabolic profiling in two sesame genotypes with contrasting ability to cope with drought stress, and identified candidate genes and key metabolic pathways involved in drought response in sesame by integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Variation of two sesame genotypes response to drought stress</title><p id="Par19">Two sesame genotypes (ZZM3743 and ZZM3330) were submitted to drought stress, and significant differences in wilting and seedling survival were observed between the two genotypes. In the process of increasing water scarcity, the drought-susceptible genotype (ZZM3743, DS) showed wilting much earlier than the drought-tolerant genotype (ZZM3330, DT) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a). After drought stress for 15&#x02009;days, plants were subjected to a rewatering treatment. After recovery, we found that more than 60% of DT plants were recovered, whereas only 20% of the DS plants were recovered, significantly (<italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) lower than the DT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b). To determine whether ROS level is linked to the different tolerance of these two sesame genotypes, malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of oxidative stress, was measured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The results showed that the MDA level was increased in leaves subjected to drought stress in both genotypes, but its content significantly (<italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) higher in the DS compared to DT under drought stress conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c). To reveal the drought tolerance mechanism of sesame, leaf tissue of two sesame genotypes were collected at five time points (T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4) with different stress intensity (monitored by soil moisture) during the drought stress treatment for transcription or metabolic analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Samples collection and samples correlation of all the samples. <bold>a</bold> Changes of soil moisture during the drought stress.

Over 81.66% of the reads were mapped to the sesame genome (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).

The expression of 17,932 and 17,839 genes was detected at all time points in DS and DT, respectively. Over 96% of the genes (19,597 genes) were detected in both DS and DT genotypes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2b). To investigate the reproducibility of biological replicates and the relationship of different samples (genotype/treatment/time point), a correlation analysis was performed based on the global gene expression pattern. The high reproducibility between the biological replicates was illustrated through spearman correlation analysis. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, all the 30 samples were classed into four main groups. The control sample (T0) of DT and DS was clearly divergent from all the samples under drought stress treatment. Interestingly, samples of the two genotypes from early stress stages (T1) were clustered together. Whereas, when the stress becomes more severe (T2 to T4), the samples from the same genotype were clustered together, supporting the great difference of drought tolerance between DT and DS.</p><p id="Par21">To investigate drought-responsive genes in sesame, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at the criteria of false discovery rate (FDR)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 and |log2FC (fold change)| &#x0003e;&#x02009;1.

Based on Gene ontology analysis, it was indicated that the majority of genes differentially expressed between DT and DS during the drought stress were enriched in biological process related to macromolecule metabolic process, nitrogen compound metabolic process, terpene biosynthetic process, protein modification process and organelle organization (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9b). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in pathway related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cyanoamino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, and alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9d).

More than half of these genes exhibit differential expression between DT and DS even under normal growth conditions. Most of these DEGs were cytochrome P450, DnaJ homolog protein, ABC transporter and UDP-glycosyltransferase.

From a general view, a greater number of genes were either up or down-regulated, and more metabolites were changed in DS than DT in response to drought stress, suggesting the susceptible genotype was more disturbed by drought stress at both transcriptional and metabolic levels.

After extraction from the chromatograms, the data was processed, aligned and filtered using in-house software. The annotation of the content of the sample was accomplished by matching the extracted data from the chromatograms with internal library of reference compounds in terms of accurate mass and retention time. For GC-MS data processing and annotation, NetCDF files that were exported from Leco Pegasus software were imported to &#x0201c;R&#x0201d;. The Bioconductor package TargetSearch was used to transform retention time to retention index (RI), to align the chromatograms, to extract the peaks, and to annotate them by comparing the spectra and the RI to the Fiehn Library and to a user created library. Annotation of peaks was manually confirmed in Leco Pegasus. Analytes were quantified using a unique mass.

Univariate analysis (two-paired <italic>t</italic> test) was applied to calculate the statistical significance and fold change of the metabolites between two time points (drought over control). False discovery rate (FDR) was used for controlling multiple testing. The supervised multivariate method, PLS-DA (partial least squares-discriminant analysis), was used to maximize the metabolome difference between the control and drought treated samples, as well as the difference between two varieties. The relative importance of each metabolite to the PLS-DA model was checked using a parameter called the variable importance in projection (VIP). Metabolite with VIP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.0 was considered as differential metabolites for group discrimination.
