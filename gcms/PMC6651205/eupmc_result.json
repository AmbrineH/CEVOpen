    "The use of innovative systems, such as the heat exchanger, for production of extra virgin olive oil should allow maintenance of the same quality of those oils derived from traditional processes, and presents specific advantages. The performance of this system was evaluated by (i) determining the parameters directly measurable by the olive millers (i.e., end-user validation based on the production yields when the plant is located in different processing lines) and (ii) assessing the product quality through estimation of the content of phenolic and volatile compounds. The phenols were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) before and after acidic hydrolysis while the volatile fraction was studied by Head-Space Solid-Phase-Micro-Extraction Gas-Chromatography with Mass Detector (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The use of the sono-heat-exchanger presents several advantages: it is a flexible machine, able to interface with all devices of the world's leading manufacturers of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) extraction plant, and it guarantees shorter processing times and energy savings. Our results also pointed out its capability to increase the oil yields up to 5.5%, particularly when it extracts oil from unripe fruits, which in traditional processes yield oils with higher phenolic contents, but with lower oil yields. Overall, the quality of virgin olive oils was maintained, avoiding decreases of phenolic content or detrimental effects on the sensory characteristics."
