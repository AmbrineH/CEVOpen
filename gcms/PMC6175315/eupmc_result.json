    "Fungal ferulic acid decarboxylases (FDCs) belong to the UbiD-family of enzymes and catalyse the reversible (de)carboxylation of cinnamic acid derivatives through the use of a prenylated flavin cofactor. The latter is synthesised by the flavin prenyltransferase UbiX. Herein, we demonstrate the applicability of FDC/UbiX expressing cells for both isolated enzyme and whole-cell biocatalysis. FDCs exhibit high activity with total turnover numbers (TTN) of up to 55000 and turnover frequency (TOF) of up to 370 min-1. Co-solvent compatibility studies revealed FDC's tolerance to some organic solvents up 20 % v/v. Using the in-vitro (de)carboxylase activity of holo-FDC as well as whole-cell biocatalysts, we performed a substrate profiling study of three FDCs, providing insights into structural determinants of activity. FDCs display broad substrate tolerance towards a wide range of acrylic acid derivatives bearing (hetero)cyclic or olefinic substituents at C3 affording conversions of up to >99 %. The synthetic utility of FDCs was demonstrated by a preparative-scale decarboxylation."
