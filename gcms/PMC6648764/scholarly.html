Abstract</div> <p> <div class="graphic_UNKNOWN" /> </p> <p>Acetone is the expected ketone product of an acetic acid decarboxylative ketonization reaction with metal oxide catalysts used in the industrial production of ketones and for biofuel upgrade. Decarboxylative cross-ketonization of a mixture of acetic and isobutyric acids yields highly valued unsymmetrical methyl isopropyl ketone (MIPK) along with two less valuable symmetrical ketones, acetone and diisopropyl ketone (DIPK). We describe a side reaction of isobutyric acid with acetone yielding the cross-ketone MIPK with monoclinic zirconia and anatase titania catalysts in the absence of acetic acid. We call it a reketonization reaction because acetone is deconstructed and used for the construction of MIPK. Isotopic labeling of the isobutyric acid’s carboxyl group shows that it is the exclusive supplier of the carbonyl group of MIPK, while acetone provides only methyl group for MIPK construction. More branched ketones, MIPK or DIPK, are less reactive in their reketonization with carboxylic acids. The proposed mechanism of reketonization supported by density functional theory (DFT) computations starts with acetone enolization and proceeds via its condensation with surface isobutyrate to a β-diketone similar to β-keto acid formation in the decarboxylative ketonization of acids. Decomposition of unsymmetrical β-diketones with water (or methanol) by the retrocondensation reaction under the same conditions over metal oxides yields two pairs of ketones and acids (or esters in the case of methanol) and proceeds much faster compared to their formation. The major direction yields thermodynamically more stable products—more substituted ketones. DFT calculations predict even a larger fraction of the thermodynamically preferred pair of products. The difference is explained by some degree of a kinetic control in the opposite direction. Reketonization has lower reaction rates compared to regular ketonization. Still, a high extent of reketonization occurs unnoticeably during the decarboxylative ketonization of acetic acid as the result of the acetone reaction with acetic acid. This degenerate reaction is the major cause of the inhibition by acetone of its own rate of formation from acetic acid at high conversions. </p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="document-id-old-9" value="ao9b01188" /> <meta name="document-id-new-14" value="ao-2019-011887" /> <meta name="ccc-price" value="" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">1</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p>Catalytic conversion of carboxylic acids into methyl ketones is an important industrial process for the preparation of fine chemicals and intermediates. <sup> <a href="#ref1">1</a>− <a href="#ref5">5</a> </sup> The first industrial scale production of acetone was already operating more than a century ago, before World War I, utilizing acetic acid derived from pyrolysis of wood. <sup> <a href="#ref6">6</a> </sup> In recent years, decarboxylative ketonization of carboxylic acids has been also viewed as a promising step for the development of biofuel technology, which has a purpose of reducing the amount of various carboxylic acids in otherwise chemically unstable pyrolysis oil. <sup> <a href="#ref7">7</a> </sup> </p> <p>The mechanism for the catalytic formation of a ketone molecule from two molecules of a carboxylic acid involves a Claisen-like condensation between α-carbon of the enolized carboxylate and the carboxyl group of the second molecule followed by dehydration to the unstable β-keto carboxylate and its subsequent decarboxylation ( <a href="#sch1">Scheme </a><a href="#sch1">1</a> ). The use of acids rather than esters in the heterogeneous catalytic version of the Claisen condensation is made possible because of the trapping of carboxylic protons on the metal oxide surface. <sup> <a href="#ref8">8</a> </sup> </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 1</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Mechanism of the Catalytic Decarboxylative Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids on Zirconia </div>   </div> <p>Despite being studied for over a century, catalytic decarboxylative ketonization is a more complicated reaction relative to how it has been described in the literature so far. <sup> <a href="#ref9">9</a>− <a href="#ref11">11</a> </sup> What has still to be understood is a considerable degree of side reactions going unnoticed and the fact that the major pathway is reversible. First, the reversibility of all of the steps of the reaction mechanism has been only recently proposed in the computational study on a zirconium oxide catalyst. <sup> <a href="#ref8">8</a> </sup> Subsequently, experimental evidence was found supporting the idea that the formation and decomposition of the β-keto acid intermediate in <a href="#sch1">Scheme </a><a href="#sch1">1</a>  are reversible. That is to say, ketones can enolize and condense with carbon dioxide back to β-keto acids—unstable intermediates. <sup> <a href="#ref12">12</a> </sup> </p> <p>The present work extends the above chemistry by adding starting carboxylic acids to the list of electrophiles participating in the condensation with the enolized ketone products. We hope that the current study will draw attention to the kinetic consequences of many side reactions taking place during the catalytic decarboxylative ketonization of carboxylic acids on metal oxides. </p> <p>Condensation between the enolized molecule of a ketone and a molecule of carboxylic acid catalyzed by metal oxides should lead to 1,3-diketones, called β-diketones, but it has not been well documented in the literature. <sup> <a href="#ref13">13</a> </sup> Similarly to the fate of β-keto acids, the reaction does not stop at the formation of the β-diketone on the surface of metal oxides because of the two competing retrocondensation reactions going in opposite directions ( <a href="#sch2">Scheme </a><a href="#sch2">2</a> ). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 2</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methyl Ketone Reketonization via Their Enolization and Claisen-like Condensation with Carboxylic Acids Followed by Retrocondensation to a Different Pair of Acid/Ketone </div>   </div> <p>A similar behavior is known for a noncatalytic condensation in solutions between ketones and esters of trifluoroacetic acid when using a stoichiometric amount of NaH base. The initial condensation transforms an ester function to one of the two keto groups of the 1,3-diketone intermediate. Then, it is followed by a retrocondensation on the other keto group converting it to another ester and yielding trifluoromethyl ketones ( <a href="#sch3">Scheme </a><a href="#sch3">3</a> ). <sup> <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a> </sup> The product mixture contains exclusively the ester of the aromatic acid and trifluoromethyl ketone without starting materials, which makes it a highly selective synthetic method. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 3</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Preparation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones Similar to Reketonization</div>   </div> <p>In a separate experiment, when the intermediate β-diketone is treated by OH <sup>–</sup> or CH <sub>3</sub>O <sup>–</sup>, it decomposes into two pairs of a ketone–acid (or a ketone–ester) via the retrocondensation reaction involving either one of the two keto groups. <sup> <a href="#ref15">15</a> </sup> </p> <p>The equilibrium in <a href="#sch3">Scheme </a><a href="#sch3">3</a>  is shifted to the right, but in view of the results of the above decomposition, it is not because one of the carbonyl groups of the β-diketone is more susceptible to the nucleophilic attack. The observed selectivity is explained by a low nucleophilicity of the α-carbon on the enolate of the trifluoromethyl ketone, which slows down its conversion back to the diketone. Acylation of the trifluoromethyl-substituted enolate proceeds on oxygen rather than on carbon, and the reesterification of the O-acylated enol by R <sup>2</sup>O <sup>–</sup> under the reaction conditions brings back the trifluoromethyl ketone. Such asymmetry of the ketone reactivity is responsible for the selective formation of trifluoromethyl ketones. </p> <p>In the current work, we describe the results of our study of a similar asymmetric effect for the catalytic version of the Claisen-like condensation on metal oxides between methyl ketones and carboxylic acids when two simple alkyl groups with a different degree of branching are used in place of −Ar and −CF <sub>3</sub>. The resulting unsymmetrical β-diketone intermediate decomposes in the opposite direction and yields a coupled pair of an acid and a ketone, which is formally described as the methyl group transfer. We call it the reketonization reaction that occurs when an alkyl group of a ketone prepared from one carboxylic acid is replaced by an alkyl group from another carboxylic acid through a series of condensation and retrocondensation reactions. </p> <p>Recognizing the reketonization reaction and understanding its mechanism will have a significant impact on the industrial technology of asymmetric ketone preparation and on the complete understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of the related reaction, the decarboxylative ketonization of carboxylic acids. </p> </div> <div class="experimentalsection" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Catalytic Condensation of Acetone with Isobutyric Acid </div> <p>Mixtures of acetone and isobutyric acid in molar ratios from 1:9 to 9:1 were converted to a mixture of MIPK and DIPK within the temperature range from 250 to 450 °C in the hot tube reactor filled with anatase titania or zirconia catalysts. The amount of products was measured by GC/FID analysis and used to calculate reaction rates averaged over the conversion range.

Because of the small amount of acetic acid formed and only at some conditions, it was not included in the regression analysis. Conversion of acetic acid to acetone proceeds much faster under the same conditions and with the same catalysts <sup> <a href="#ref4">4</a> </sup> compared to its formation in the above reaction. </p> <p>KOH-treated catalysts, ZK and TK, had slightly higher activity for the production of MIPK from acetone and isobutyric acid compared to the untreated catalyst, ZR. The highest activity for MIPK production was found with the TK catalyst. Surface charts ( <a href="#fig1">Figure </a><a href="#fig1">1</a> ) have a similar shape for all three catalysts. The MIPK rate with all three catalysts had a linear dependence on the fraction of isobutyric acid and a second degree polynomial dependence on temperature ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01188/suppl_file/ao9b01188_si_001.pdf">Table S2</a> in the Supporting Information). </p> <p>Formation of DIPK from two molecules of isobutyric acid was favored at high temperatures and at high molar fraction of isobutyric acid, while MIPK formation from acetone and isobutyric acid was favored at high molar fraction of acetone and started at lower temperatures ( <a href="#fig2">Figure </a><a href="#fig2">2</a> ). The selectivity to MIPK defined as the ratio of the MIPK rate to the sum of MIPK and DIPK rates was the highest with the TK catalyst among all studied catalysts under most conditions. </p> <p>The above data demonstrated that acetone can be used instead of acetic acid to produce the cross-ketone, MIPK, in the reaction with isobutyric acid. Rates of MIPK formation have been also measured for the regular cross-ketonization reaction between acetic and isobutyric acids under the same conditions. When two methods are compared directly ( <a href="#fig3">Figure </a><a href="#fig3">3</a> ), it can be seen that rates of MIPK formation are faster for the isobutyric acid condensation with acetic acid rather than with acetone.

Adsorption of Ketones and Acids on Metal Oxides</div> <p>The difference in the adsorption of ketones versus carboxylic acids was assessed by a pulse titration method using the "inside GC/MS microreactor". A small amount of a catalyst was placed inside the injection port of the GC/MS instrument, and premeasured pulses of organic molecules were added until a full saturation was achieved. The adsorbed amount for each pulse was calculated as the difference between amounts injected and coming out. Coverage was calculated by using the BET surface area and assuming a bidentate bridging mode of adsorption for carboxylic acids and a monodentate adsorption for ketones. For ketones, some bleeding from the surface was noticed only for the exposure time in flowing helium gas measured in hours.

Discussion</div> <p>The data presented above show that methyl ketones, in general, and acetone, in particular, can condense with carboxylic acids in the vapor phase over metal oxide catalysts at temperatures above 300 °C. However, the immediate products of their condensation, β-diketones, are not stable under the reaction condition and decompose by the retrocondensation to a different pair of an acid and ketone. Formally, this reaction results in the transfer of the methyl group from acetone to the acyl group of the second carboxylic acid making methyl ketones. </p> <p>Acetone itself is made from acetic acid under similar conditions by the decarboxylative ketonization reaction. Reusing acetone in the cross-ketonization with another acid makes it possible to prepare unsymmetrical ketones by the mechanism best described as reketonization. This reaction is of considerable importance for the industrial production of methyl ketones. <sup> <a href="#ref5">5</a> </sup> If not utilized, acetone would represent up to 50% loss of acetic acid together with a loss of the second carboxylic acid to the other symmetrical ketone, dramatically reducing cost-effectiveness of the cross-ketonization. On the other hand, reketonization of the desired cross-product, methyl ketone <b>AB</b>, is unwanted, but the main question is whether such a reaction does take place at all. </p> <p>Experiments with isotopically labeled isobutyric acid ( <a href="#sec3.3">Section </a><a href="#sec3.3">3.3</a> ) showed that it is the exclusive source of the carbonyl group of MIPK and that we are dealing with an acid/base-catalyzed condensation of carbonyl compounds rather than with an alkyl group shift by some kind of concerted mechanism. </p> <p>The unsymmetrical ketone <b>AB</b> has α-hydrogens on both sides of the carbonyl group, which allow its enolization and condensation with acids similar to that of acetone <b>AA</b>. If <b>AA</b> can condense with <b>B</b>, similarly, <b>AB</b> may condense with <b>A</b>. </p> <p>Control of the forward reaction in <a href="#sch5">Scheme </a><a href="#sch5">5</a>  could be either of a thermodynamic or kinetic nature or a mixed one. If reactions in <a href="#sch5">Scheme </a><a href="#sch5">5</a>  are reversible in both directions and allowed to equilibrate, it might be shifted to the left, toward more stable mixture, <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b>. Indeed, thermodynamic quantities of the gas phase molecules obtained through vibrational frequency calculations by using the same DFT method as for periodic structures show that the mixture of <b>A</b> and <b>AB</b> is more stable compared to the mixture of <b>AA</b> and <b>B</b>. The DFT-calculated free energy difference in the gas phase at 300 °C is 5.07 kcal/mol, which relates to an equilibrium constant of 0.0118 and to the equilibrium fraction of <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b> equal to 98.8%. By itself, this is a sufficient reason for shifting the equilibrium in <a href="#sch5">Scheme </a><a href="#sch5">5</a>  to the left hand side, providing that the reaction conditions allow for the equilibrium to be established. </p> <p>The same preference in favor of <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b> versus <b>AA</b> + <b>B</b> remains for structures on the surface ( <a href="#fig8">Figure </a><a href="#fig8">8</a> ). The DFT-calculated free energy for structure <b>2</b> representing <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b>, −30.5 kcal/mol, is 1.6 kcal/mol lower compared to that for structure <b>11 (AA</b> + <b>B)</b>, −28.9 kcal/mol ( <a href="#tbl1">Table </a><a href="#tbl1">1</a> ). However, decomposition of the unsymmetrical diketone <b>AAB</b> from the two possible adsorption states <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> ( <a href="#fig9">Figure </a><a href="#fig9">9</a> a,b) has the lower calculated free energy barrier of the hydration step when going to the right hand side, that is, toward <b>AA</b> + <b>B</b>. Condensation steps are not a differentiating factor because the free energy barriers for both directions of the condensation, <b>AA + B</b> or <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b>, are almost the same, 20.6 kcal/mol or 20.1 kcal/mol, respectively ( <a href="#tbl1">Table </a><a href="#tbl1">1</a> ). Therefore, DFT computations predict <b>AA</b> + <b>B</b> to be the major direction for β-diketones decomposition under kinetic control, while <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b> will be favored under thermodynamic control. </p> <p>Experimentally, we have found only a small but persistent preference for the direction of the unsymmetrical diketone <b>AAB</b> decomposition in methanol toward <b>A</b> + <b>AB</b> rather than the <b>AA</b> + <b>B</b> mixture in <a href="#sch4">Scheme </a><a href="#sch4">4</a> . The preference for the formation of a more substituted ketone is about 70% with ZR or 60% with the ZK catalyst ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b01188/suppl_file/ao9b01188_si_001.pdf">Table S6</a>), that is, not as large as the 98.8% value expected under purely thermodynamic control. The use of methanol as a nucleophile instead of water was necessary to reveal the selectivity of the initial decomposition by the retrocondensation reaction while avoiding further reactions between acids such as <b>A</b> + <b>A</b> = <b>AA,</b> which takes place in water ( <a href="#fig5">Figure </a><a href="#fig5">5</a> ). Methyl esters formed in methanol are generally much less reactive in the decarboxylative ketonization reaction compared to acids. <sup> <a href="#ref26">26</a> </sup> </p> <p>Thus, experimental results indicate that β-diketone decomposition is controlled kinetically, but the initial ratio of products changes to some extent by the reverse reaction toward the thermodynamic equilibrium. From the energy profile shown in <a href="#fig8">Figure </a><a href="#fig8">8</a> , it can be seen that both desorption steps, <b>2</b> → <b>1</b> and <b>11</b> → <b>12</b>, have high energy barriers. Hence, surface species <b>2</b>– <b>11</b> located in the energy well become involved in a thermodynamic equilibrium between important steps of the reketonization mechanism, C–C bond breaking and formation. </p> <p>However, the most important factor controlling the direction of the reketonization equilibrium seems to be a higher reactivity of acetic versus isobutyric acid in the decarboxylative self-ketonization reaction, <sup> <a href="#ref4">4</a> </sup> and both acids have much higher rates in the decarboxylative ketonization relative to the reketonization reaction (directly compared in <a href="#fig2">Figures </a><a href="#fig2">2</a>  and <a href="#fig3">3</a>). A faster consumption of acetic acid versus isobutyric leads to its selective removal from the equilibrium in <a href="#sch5">Scheme </a><a href="#sch5">5</a> , shifting it to the left hand side. In addition, a self-condensation of the released acetic acid back to acetone generates more feed for the reketonization of acetone and isobutyric acid into MIPK, <b>AB</b>, so the overall process at its limit is described by <a href="#sch11">Scheme </a><a href="#sch11">11</a> . </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 11</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Balanced Equation for the Reketonization of Acetone into MIPK with Isobutyric Acid </div>   </div> <p>The calculated equilibrium constant for the reaction in <a href="#sch11">Scheme </a><a href="#sch11">11</a>  at the temperature 300 °C is 4.9 × 10 <sup>7</sup> leading to the equilibrium concentration of <b>AA</b> + <b>B</b> less than 2.0 × 10 <sup>–6</sup>%, which explains reketonization of acetone <b>AA</b> into MIPK <b>AB</b>. </p> <p>In a similar fashion, the reaction between ketone <b>AC</b> and acid <b>B</b>, going to the edges from the middle of the equation in <a href="#sch8">Scheme </a><a href="#sch8">8</a> , is able to proceed because it releases two acids, <b>A</b> and <b>C</b>, both of which are consumed faster on metal oxide surfaces compared to acid <b>B</b> and are removed from the equilibrium. It is due to the well-known fact that less sterically hindered acids are more reactive in the decarboxylative ketonization. </p> <p>Interestingly, ketone <b>AC</b> (2-butanone) was believed to be inert and used as a solvent for that reason in a number of decarboxylative ketonization studies, for example, in a mixture with butyric, pentanoic, and hexanoic acids using a ceria–zirconia catalyst. <sup> <a href="#ref26">26</a> </sup> However, the temperature in those studies did not exceed 350 °C, and products of reketonization were not noticed. </p> <p>We may now conclude that the reaction between <b>A</b> and <b>AB</b> in <a href="#sch4">Schemes </a><a href="#sch4">4</a>  and <a href="#sch5">5</a>, most likely, does take place, but it is masked and hard to detect. The exact kinetic consequence of all reketonization reactions has yet to be determined. It is clear that a number of side reactions may inhibit the rate of the decarboxylative ketonization of carboxylic acids. Conceivably, the major contributor to such inhibition is the degenerate reaction in <a href="#sch12">Scheme </a><a href="#sch12">12</a>  between acetone and acetic acid, a pair of the least substituted and sterically less hindered ketone and acid. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 12</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Degenerate Reaction between Acetone and Acetic Acid</div>   </div> <p>As the conversion of acids is increasing and more ketones are produced, a larger portion of catalytic sites becomes occupied with the reketonization reaction slowing down the overall rate of ketone production. The reason for the inhibition of the rate of decarboxylative ketonization of acetic acid by the acetone product was previously thought to be its accumulation on the surface. <sup> <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a> </sup> However, acetone adsorption on the surface is much weaker compared to that of acids ( <a href="#fig7">Figure </a><a href="#fig7">7</a> ). A comparable amount of acetic and isobutyric acids adsorbed on zirconia at the temperature range of 200–400 °C was found previously. <sup> <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a> </sup> Therefore, the most likely reason for the above inhibition is the reketonization reaction according to <a href="#sch12">Scheme </a><a href="#sch12">12</a> , which is more prevalent compared to the recently reported condensation between acetone and carbon dioxide. <sup> <a href="#ref12">12</a> </sup> </p> <p>The apparent rate of MIPK formation was found to be lower when starting from acetone versus acetic acid in the reaction with isobutyric acid ( <a href="#fig3">Figure </a><a href="#fig3">3</a> a–b). Because the ratio of surface concentrations of ketones to acids is approximately equal to the ratio of their apparent rates in the reaction with isobutyric acid ( <a href="#fig7">Figure </a><a href="#fig7">7</a> ), we may conclude that the rate constants of the rate limiting step, condensation, in the decarboxylative ketonization versus reketonization reaction are of a comparable order of magnitude. </p> <p>The heterogeneous version of the retrocondensation reaction of diketones catalyzed by zirconium and titanium metal oxides in our study is closely related to the two mechanisms of β-diketones and β-keto esters decomposition known in the literature. The first one is the retrocondensation through a preliminary chelate complexation in the solution by many other transition metals, such as Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pd, Mn, Pt, and Rh. <sup> <a href="#ref29">29</a> </sup> The second one is a direct attack by strong nucleophiles such as NaOH and NaOC <sub>2</sub>H <sub>5</sub>, both in the solution and in the solid state. <sup> <a href="#ref30">30</a> </sup> Zirconium and titanium oxides in our study can provide conditions for both types of the retrocondensation mechanism through complexation of dicarbonyls on the surface and by hosting water and methanol nucleophiles ( <a href="#fig9">Figure </a><a href="#fig9">9</a> a,b). In that regard, the untreated zirconia catalyst, ZR, showed higher activity for retrocondensation because of its known ability to hold more of dissociatively adsorbed water on the surface compared to KOH-treated catalysts, <sup> <a href="#ref18">18</a> </sup> and a similar difference can be expected for methanol adsorption. Both nucleophiles, hydroxy and methoxy groups, play a critical role in the decomposition of diketones by attacking a carbonyl group of β-diketones. </p> <p>An important factor, which may slow down the retrocondensation step, is the enolization of β-diketones proceeding with a large energy of stabilization according to the DFT calculations. The position of the enolized diketone structures <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> on the energy diagram is the lowest among all intermediates on the surface ( <a href="#fig8">Figure </a><a href="#fig8">8</a> ). Quantitative enolization of the condensation product in the classic Claisen reaction in solutions is an essential step, which makes that reaction possible. <sup> <a href="#ref31">31</a> </sup> Likewise, due to a high C–H acidity, enolizable β-diketones are taken out of the condensation equilibrium by reacting with basic centers on the catalyst surface, which helps to advance the condensation step forward. In contrast, non-enolizable β-diketones with alkylated methylene groups, such as diketone <b>ABA</b>, are difficult to synthesize using nucleophilic bases because the equilibrium of the Claisen condensation may shift back as the result of the nucleophilic attack by such bases on the keto form. <sup> <a href="#ref32">32</a> </sup> It was the reason, for which we had to use a non-nucleophilic base, NaH, for the preparation of <b>AAB</b> in our work to increase its yield ( <a href="#sec2.4">Section </a><a href="#sec2.4">2.4</a> ). <sup> <a href="#ref33">33</a> </sup> Because a higher activity was found for the non-enolizable diketone <b>ABA</b> relative to enolizable diketones in the retrocondensation reaction with all catalysts ( <a href="#fig6">Figure </a><a href="#fig6">6</a> ), enolization of diketones and β-keto carboxylates may take place and be an important part of the catalytic decarboxylative ketonization mechanism and for all concomitant steps discussed in our study. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>Decarboxylative cross-ketonization of carboxylic acids is surrounded by rich chemistry driven by a sequence of condensation and retrocondensation steps including decarboxylation. We have disclosed additional side reactions in the decarboxylative ketonization mechanism in which not only carboxylic acids but also ketones can enolize on the surface of metal oxides and participate in the condensation reactions as nucleophiles. Their electrophilic partners for condensations are surface carboxylates and carbon dioxide molecules. Only in the absence of carboxylic acids and carbon dioxide, ketones are able to go through a usual aldol condensation with another ketone molecule. </p> <p>All reactions are reversible and affected to a various degree by the thermodynamic stability of products. The equilibrium in the catalytic condensation between ketones and carboxylic acids leading to β-diketone intermediates is shifted away from the β-diketones. In the case of unsymmetrical diketones, the preferred direction of their decomposition is toward formation of a more reactive carboxylic acid due to its faster disappearance in the decarboxylative homoketonization. The reketonization effect is observed in the reaction between a less reactive acid and a ketone derived from a more reactive acid, typically, acetone. </p> <p>A catalyst activity in such chemistry depends on its acid–base properties and the surface structure. Because there are no redox steps involved in the reaction mechanism, possession of a redox function by metal oxide catalysts is unnecessary for the decarboxylative ketonization and for the reketonization reactions. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
