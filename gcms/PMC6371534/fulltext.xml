Morphological results indicated that under salt stress, the salt-tolerant (ST) genotype has enhanced capacity to withstand salinity stress, higher seed germination rate and plant survival rate, as well as better growth rate than the salt-sensitive genotype. Transcriptome analysis revealed strongly induced salt-responsive genes in sesame mainly related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, and oxidation-reduction process. Especially, several pathways were preferably enriched with differentially expressed genes in ST genotype, including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.

Compared with most of the oilseed crops, sesame is rated relatively salt and drought tolerant crop which should be spread into more coastal and arid/semi-arid areas to increase global sesame production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. At present, sesame salt tolerance varieties are urgently needed in these salt-affected zones to overcome salinity effects, especially in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia regions of China and several African countries.

However, there is a lack of scientific studies on the salt tolerance molecular mechanisms and the relationship between the transcriptomic responses and the metabolomic responses to salt stress which are needed to facilitate the developing salt-tolerant sesame varieties. For this study, the transcriptome and metabolome profiles in the seedlings of salt-tolerant and sensitive sesame genotypes were performed in the early phase of salt stress. This study revealed crucial metabolic pathways and metabolites in response to salt stress between the two contrasting genotypes, providing important insights into the mechanisms underlying sesame salt adaptation and tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phenotypic differences between WZM3063 and ZZM4028 in response to salinity stress</title><p id="Par24">Seed germination rates of WZM3063 (salt-tolerant, ST) and ZZM4028 (salt-sensitive, SS) genotypes under control and salt conditions were primarily measured and were found to be more severely affected for SS genotype than ST genotype at 150&#x02009;mM NaCl concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b). Similarly, the capacity to withstand salinity stress was significantly weaker in SS genotype seedlings than ST. ST and SS seedlings exposure to salt stress (100&#x02009;mM NaCl) led to leaf chlorosis, leaf tip burning, severe wilting, stunted growth and even to death, but the injury degree was lesser for ST than SS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Although differences were observed between ST and SS for shoot length and shoot weight under the control condition, the values of plant survival rate, shoot length and shoot dry weight of SS genotype were reduced much more strongly in SS than ST under salt condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Leaf electrolyte leakage, as indicator of membrane damage, was significantly higher in the SS than in ST under salt stress, suggesting more membrane damage during salt stress in the SS genotype.

Many salt-responsive genes detected at the different sampling times under salt stress were genotype specific and time specific, which may have contributed to the phenotypic differences in salt tolerance between ST and SS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and c). Gene enrichment analysis of the DEGs based on the KEGG revealed that these genes were mainly involved in several categories, including &#x0201c;amino acid metabolism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;carbohydrate metabolism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;global and overview maps&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;lipid metabolism&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides&#x0201d; (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Under salt stress, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormone signal transduction were enriched significantly in both genotypes at all salt stress time points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In particular, several pathways were preferably enriched with DEGs in ST genotype at different time points, including galactose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, etc. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that a large number of DEGs were involved in some important GO terms which are known to be associated with salt tolerance in plants, such as oxidation-reduction process, response to hormone, response to abiotic stimulus, oxidoreductase activity, and protein kinase activity (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4). Moreover, GO analysis also showed apparent genotype- and time-specific results, revealing that some important biological processes, cellular processes and metabolic activities occurred in differently in the 2 genotypes under salt stress (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4). For instance, apoplast, cellular polysaccharide metabolic process, glucan metabolic process, monooxygenase activity, regulation of cellular protein metabolic process, regulation of protein metabolic process, and response to abiotic stimulus were highly or uniquely enriched in ST genotype at different sampling times under salt stress (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Heatmap of enriched KEGG pathways of the DEGs in ST and SS at different salt stress time points</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2019_1665_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Constitutively active genes of ST and SS genotypes in responses to salt stress</title><p id="Par27">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, there were 1275 and 1946 DEGs that were commonly identified in four treatment groups of ST and SS, respectively, while 374 and 1045 DEGs were exclusively found in ST and SS under salt stress, respectively. It is worth noting that 59 genes which were exclusively and highly up-regulated (FPKM &#x0003e;&#x02009;10 during at least one time point) in ST at all time points after salt treatment were identified as candidate genes for improved salt tolerance in ST (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Of these, several genes of regulatory function were notable, such as ABC transporter (LOC105170264), &#x003b2;-glucosidase (LOC105173929), cytochrome P450 (LOC105161642), dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (LOC105157670), UDP-glycosyltransferase (LOC105171082) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Although different sets and numbers of genes were expressed by the two genotypes, a total of 901 genes (206 up- and 695 down-regulated) were constitutively active in both genotypes and represent the core genes associated with response to salt stress despite tolerance levels in sesame, including a lot of heat-shock proteins, heat-shock transcription factors, late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs), probable protein phosphatase 2C (PP2Cs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Especially, among these core genes, a total of 101 transcription factors were identified which grouped into 31 families, including AP2-EREBP, bHLH, bZIP, HB, MYB, NAC, and their diverse expression patterns indicate their important regulatory roles in salt stress responses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S5). Alterations in their expression could significantly affect translation of other proteins under salt stress. Based on the GO enrichment analysis, the 901 core genes were found to participate in some important biological processes, including response to auxin, response to hormone, cellular glucan metabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, polysaccharide metabolic process, protein phosphorylation, and glutamine biosynthetic process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).

The content of most free amino acids considered as osmotic regulatory substances, was significantly increased in one or both genotypes, implying that the accumulation of free amino acids is crucial in sesame response to salt stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Obviously, the induction rate of accumulation of many free amino acids (including alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and valine) was more higher in ST than in SS, which may be a positive feature for withstanding salinity stress in ST genotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The expression patterns of the genes involved in the amino acid metabolic pathways were presented in detail in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. In the pathways leading to the strong salt-induced accumulation of arginine, glutamine, glycine, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, most of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these amino acids were up-regulated in both genotypes under salt stress, although there was a trend of down-regulation among some enzymes of these pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In particular, several genes involved in the biosynthesis of aspartate, threonine, methionine, tyrosine and phenylalanine, showed higher changes in ST than in SS at 12&#x02009;h or 24&#x02009;h after exposure to salt, such as aspartate aminotransferase (LOC105167001), threonine synthase 1 (LOC105161896), 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methyltransferase (LOC105170961), homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1-like (LOC105160993), probable aminotransferase TAT2 (LOC105178558). LOC105162194 encoding a branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase 2 which is involved in the different pathways leading to the synthesis of isoleucine, leucine and valine, was significantly and continuously up-regulated in both genotypes after salt stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). This adjustment of genes may be important to maintain the biosynthesis of some amino acids under stress. Some genes encoding enzymes of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, tryptophan synthase, and glutamine synthetase tended to be down-regulated in both genotypes at almost all time points after salt treatment, so the greatly increased accumulation of serine, tryptophan, and glutamine could be mainly due to greatly reduced degradation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Moreover, 4-Aminobutanoic acid (GABA) as an important derivative from glutamate was observed strongly salt-induced in ST genotype, while the expressions of genes for glutamate decarboxylase involved in GABA biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated remarkably in ST under salt stress, especially at 24&#x02009;h.

Interestingly, most of metabolites accumulation involved in sucrose and RFOs metabolism including galactinol, myo-inositol, raffinose, stachyose, sucrose, melibiose, fructose, glucose, were significantly increased in the two genotypes under salt stress, but their fold changes were consistently higher in ST than in SS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). The expression patterns of most genes involved in the same pathway were similar in the two contrasting genotypes in response to salt stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Three genes encoding galactinol synthase 2 (EC 2.4.1.123) that plays a key regulatory role in the synthesis of galactinol were up-regulated in both genotypes under salt stress, but the expression of gene (LOC105168975) was increased more higher in ST compared with SS under salt treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Galactinol-sucrose galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.82) and stachyose synthase (EC 2.4.1.67) catalyze the key steps for the synthesis of raffinose and stachyose. The accumulation of raffinose and stachyose which were strong salt-induced both in ST and SS genotypes could be primarily attributed to strong salt-induced expression of a galactinol-sucrose galactosyltransferase gene (LOC105162538) and a stachyose synthase gene (LOC105178881) by salt stress. In addition, most of genes involved in the pathways leading to the accumulation of sucrose, melibiose, fructose and glucose were also up-regulated in both genotypes in response to salt stress.

Specifically, the glutamate content in ST increased over 17.9-fold under salt stress, implying that glutamate may serve as a key player in salt tolerance in sesame.

The samples were measured with a Waters ACQUITY Reversed Phase Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled to a Thermo-Fisher Exactive mass spectrometer (MS) which consists of an ElectroSpray Ionization source and an Orbitrap mass analyzer as well as with an Agilent Technologies Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled to a Leco Pegasus HT MS which consists of an Electron Impact ionization source and a Time of Flight mass analyzer (metaSysX GmbH, Germany). LC-MS measurements of the aqueous phase permitted the analyses of the secondary metabolites and GC-MS measurements allowed the analyses of the primary metabolites. After alignment and filtration of LC-MS data, annotation was accomplished by matching the extracted data from the chromatograms with library of reference compounds in terms of accurate mass and retention time. For GC-MS data processing and annotation, the Bioconductor package TargetSearch was used to transform retention time to retention index, to align the chromatograms, to extract the peaks, and to annotate them by comparing the spectra and the retention index to the Fiehn Library and to a user created library. The filtered data from all platforms was normalized first to the weight of samples used for extraction and according to sample median intensity group-wise and further combined to a final data matrix.
