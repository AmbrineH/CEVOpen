    "This study investigates an aqueous salt process (ASP) combined with microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) for the seed oil extraction from yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge). The NaCl concentration in the oil extraction process affected the oil extraction yield. Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to optimize the extraction process. The optimal operating parameters were: 24 g/L NaCl, 300 W microwave power, 4:1 water to material ratio, an 80 min extraction time, and 45 °C extraction temperature. The chemical composition of the extracted seed oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This extraction technique for yellow horn seed oil provided high throughput and high-quality oil. The present research offers a kind of green extraction method for edible oil in the food industry."
