Abstract</div> <p>The genome of the thermophilic bacterium, <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> 8, encodes the bacteriocin pallidocin. It belongs to the small class of glycocins and is posttranslationally modified, containing an <i>S</i>-linked glucose on a specific Cys residue. In this study, the pallidocin biosynthetic machinery is cloned and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to achieve its full biosynthesis and modification. It targets other thermophilic bacteria with potent activity, demonstrated by a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. Moreover, the characterized biosynthetic machinery is employed to produce two other glycopeptides Hyp1 and Hyp2. Pallidocin and Hyp1 exhibit antibacterial activity against closely related thermophilic bacteria and some <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strains. Thus, heterologous expression of a glycocin biosynthetic gene cluster including an <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase provides a good tool for production of hypothetical glycocins encoded by various bacterial genomes and allows rapid in vivo screening. </p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <p>Heterologous production of the glycocins, posttranslationally modified peptide bacteriocins containing a sugar moiety, has not been achieved.

Introduction</div> <p>Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are produced in all three domains of life. Part of the RiPPs overlap with a group of antibacterial peptides produced by bacteria, and this group historically is designated as bacteriocins <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>– <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. They are active against other bacteria that are mostly closely related to the producer. These peptides exhibit considerable diversity with respect to their size, structure, mechanism of action, inhibitory spectrum, immunity mechanisms, and targeted receptors <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a> </sup>. In the era of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup>, bacteriocins have been suggested as a potential alternative to antibiotics in clinics and veterinary settings, but also as food preservatives against spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms <sup> <a href="#CR2">2</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR7">7</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Thermophilic bacteria have shown a great potential in biofuel production because of their higher metabolic rate and enzyme stability at elevated temperatures. Moreover, growth at high temperature facilitates recovery of volatile products, like ethanol <sup> <a href="#CR8">8</a> </sup>, and reduces requirement for cooling. Thermophilic fermentations are less prone to contaminations by mesophiles, although there are still risks that bioreactors will be contaminated by other thermophiles <sup> <a href="#CR9">9</a>, <a href="#CR10">10</a> </sup>. In addition, contamination by thermophiles is also a problem in production of dairy products <sup> <a href="#CR11">11</a> </sup>. This shows the need of discovery of new natural compounds that have activity against thermophilic bacteria. </p> <p>Glycocins are posttranslationally glycosylated bacteriocins. The sugar moieties are linked to the side chains of either Cys, Ser, or Thr residues. A glycocin can be regarded as being "glycoactive" when sugar moieties are essential for the antimicrobial activity <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Only a few glycocins have been identified and reported to date: sublancin 168, produced by <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>; glycocin F, produced by <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>; ASM1 (homologous to glycocin F), produced by <i>Lb. plantarum</i> <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR15">15</a> </sup>; enterocin F4-9, produced by <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup> and thurandacin, encoded by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> and identified by genomic data mining and chemo-enzymatical synthesis in vitro <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. </p> <p>The understanding of their mechanism of growth inhibition of target bacteria is far from complete. It is known that a specific phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a factor affecting glycocin F and sublancin antibacterial activities <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a> </sup> and that sublancin does not affect the integrity of the cell membrane and acts bacteriocidal <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a> </sup>. In contrast, glycocin F and enterocin F4-9 have been reported to be bacteriostatic <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. </p> <p>The synthetic machinery of the best-studied glycocin, sublancin, is encoded by a gene cluster containing <i>sunA, sunS, sunT, bdbA</i>, and <i>bdbB</i> genes. The precursor peptide, SunA, is modified by the <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase SunS, which forms a very unusual <i>S</i>-linkage between the Cys residue and glucose. SunA glycosylation in vitro by SunS has been confirmed by chemo-enzymatical synthesis of mature sublancin <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>. Based on the SunT sequence similarity to bacteriocin ABC- transporters/peptidases, it is assumed that SunT cleaves the leader sequence and transports the core peptide to the outside of the cell. Two thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, BdbA and BdbB, might be responsible for disulfide bond formation in the peptide <sup> <a href="#CR18">18</a>, <a href="#CR19">19</a> </sup>. In addition, it has been confirmed that the same gene cluster encodes the immunity protein SunI <sup> <a href="#CR20">20</a> </sup>. A similar genetic organization was found in gene clusters encoding the putative synthetic machineries of glycocin F <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>, thurandacin <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup> and enterocin F4-9 <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. </p> <p>To date only two bacteriocins, i.e. geobacillin I and geobacillin II, produced by the thermophilic bacteria <i>Geobacillus thermodenitrificans</i> NG80-2, are well characterized <sup> <a href="#CR22">22</a>– <a href="#CR24">24</a> </sup>. Other bacteriocin-like antibacterial compounds from thermophilic microorganisms have been described in much less detail <sup> <a href="#CR25">25</a>– <a href="#CR31">31</a> </sup>. These reasons prompted us to find and to study new bacteriocins of this group. Thus, we have chosen the thermophilic <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> 8 strain that was previously isolated from soil above oil wells in Lithuania <sup> <a href="#CR32">32</a> </sup>. Previous studies have shown that this strain secretes an antibacterial compound that is active against other thermophilic bacteria. Unfortunately purification of this compound and identification of its amino acid sequence were not successful <sup> <a href="#CR32">32</a>, <a href="#CR33">33</a> </sup>. </p> <p>In this study we have identified genes in the genome of <i>A. pallidus</i> 8 that encode a biosynthetic machinery for a hypothetical bacteriocin (i.e. pallidocin), which belongs to the small class of glycocins. We also demonstrate the functional expression of the whole biosynthetic gene cluster of a glycocin in Gram-negative <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which facilitates further engineering and mechanistic studies. </p> <p>Following characterization of pallidocin demonstrated that it exhibits extremely strong activity against specific thermophilic bacteria, such as <i>(Para)Geobacillus</i> sp. and <i>Caldibacillus</i> sp. In addition, we identified and synthesized a variety of hypothetical glycopeptides and determined their properties by employing heterologous expression system of pallidocin. The characterized pallidocin <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase PalS could be used not only for biosynthesis of hypothetical glycocins, but also for introduction of unique posttranslational modifications into other peptides with the aim to improve their bioactivities. Pallidocin is a good candidate to prevent bacterial contaminations in industrial fermentations operating under elevated temperatures. </p> <p>Previously, full maturation of recombinant glycocins was only reported in vitro for thurandacin and sublancin. Glycosylation and leader cleavage were performed enzymatically, followed by chemical oxidative folding <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. The in vitro experiments limit the yield of the final product, are time consuming and expensive. Recently, a system was developed for the heterologous expression of sublancin in <i>E. coli</i> SHuffle T7 Express cells that in vivo installs the glycosylation and oxidative folding following a single in vitro step of proteolytic leader cleavage <sup> <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. The SHuffle T7 Express strain expresses the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, aiding oxidative folding of proteins in the cytoplasm <sup> <a href="#CR35">35</a> </sup>. Here, we demonstrate a different in vivo heterologous expression system to produce completely mature glycocins in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), evading the in vitro chemical and enzymatic steps. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Identification and heterologous biosynthesis of pallidocin</div> <p>The pallidocin producer strain was identified as <i>A</i>. <i>pallidus</i> 8 (previously referred to as <i>Geobacillus</i> sp. 8 <sup> <a href="#CR32">32</a> </sup>) by a Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) using a digital DNA−DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis tool <sup> <a href="#CR36">36</a> </sup>. The <i>A. pallidus</i> 8 genome <sup> <a href="#CR37">37</a> </sup> was processed with the BAGEL4 bioinformatics tool <sup> <a href="#CR38">38</a> </sup> for the identification of gene clusters for bacteriocins biosynthesis. An operon coding for a putative glycocin was identified (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>). It contains five genes which were named <i>palA</i>, <i>palS</i>, <i>palT</i>, <i>paldbA</i>, and <i>paldbB</i>. Proteins encoded by these genes display between 38 and 53% sequence similarity with proteins of known functions, encoded in other bacteria. Based on this analysis we presumed that <i>palA</i> encodes the 61 amino acid precursor peptide (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>), <i>palS</i> encodes the SunS-like family peptide <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase, <i>palT</i> encodes the SunT-like superfamily peptidase/ABC transporter protein, <i>paldbA</i> encodes the thioredoxin-like enzyme, and <i>paldbB</i> encodes the DsbB-like disulfide bond formation protein B. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Gene cluster and precursor peptides of glycocins. <b>a</b> Pallidocin biosynthetic gene cluster (4805 bp) <i>pal</i> identified by BAGEL4 in <i>A. pallidus</i> 8 genome. <b>b</b> Alignment of glycocin precursor peptides.

Structural and functional characterization of pallidocin</div> <p>The predicted monoisotopic mass [M + H] <sup>+</sup> of the unmodified pallidocin core peptide is 4061.76. The monoisotopic mass [M + H] <sup>+</sup> of purified native pallidocin observed by LC-ESI-MS was 4219.79 (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). The monoisotopic mass [M + H] <sup>+</sup> of the peptide, after treatment with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-hydrochloride (TCEP), was 4223.82 (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">3b</a>). This suggests that the peptide has a posttranslational modification with a mass of +162 and two disulfide bonds (−4). To identify the modified residue, pallidocin was fragmented with chymotrypsin and further analyzed by LC-ESI-Q-MS/MS mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. <a href="#MOESM1">4</a>- <a href="#MOESM1">9</a>). This showed that Cys25 of the core peptide has a modification with a mass of +162.05, which might be a hexose moiety.

In vitro leader peptide cleavage of pallidocin precursor</div> <p>To develop a more efficient way for pallidocin production, the genes <i>his-Xa-palA</i> and <i>palS</i> were coexpressed in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3).

Pallidocin alignment with other glycocins</div> <p>BLAST analysis of PalA identified two hypothetical peptides (Hyp1 and Hyp2) which have low sequence similarity to PalA (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>).

All glycocins have a double-glycine type motif (a proteolytic cleavage site at the end of the leader sequence). GccF and EnfA49 precursors have leader cleavage sites following the Gly-Gly motif. SunA, ThuA, and PalA precursors have a Gly-Ser-Gly motif, where the leader sequence is cleaved between the Ser and second Gly residue.

Heterologous biosynthesis of hypothetical glycocins</div> <p>To determine whether PalS and PalT are able to modify and process different heterologous glycocin precursors in a heterologous Gram-negative host, they were coexpressed with genes coding for glycocin precursor peptides with leaders and His6-tags (Supplementary Figs. <a href="#MOESM1">13</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">19</a>), i.e. pre-SunA-His, pre-GccF-His, pre-EnfA49-His, pre-Hyp1-His and pre-Hyp2-His. As before, the highest yield of peptides was observed in the insoluble fraction of cell lysate. After coexpression, the peptides were purified from the insoluble fraction and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The analysis could not confirm that PalT cleaved off the leaders. However, it demonstrated that in addition to pre-PalA-His, the PalS glycosyltransferase does modify pre-SunA-His (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">20</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">21</a>), pre-Hyp1-His (Supplementary Figs. <a href="#MOESM1">22</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">23</a>), and pre-Hyp2-His (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">24</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">25</a>), with a mass of +162 consistently pointing to monoglycosylation. The antibacterial activity analysis of the peptides showed that only pre-SunA-His-Glc and pre-Hyp1-His-Glc (glycosylated precursors with leaders) but not the pre-Hyp2-His-Glc were active against indicator strain <i>P. genomospecies</i> 1 NUB36187 (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> and Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). </p> <p>We designed the genes <i>core_hyp1-his</i> and <i>core_hyp2-his</i> encoding the leaderless Hyp1 and Hyp2 core peptides with a His6-tag sequence at the C-terminus (Supplementary Figs. <a href="#MOESM1">13</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">19</a>).

Discussion</div> <p>We identified and characterized a posttranslationally modified bacteriocin (pallidocin). The gene cluster of the pallidocin biosynthetic machinery is encoded on the chromosome of the thermophilic bacterium <i>A. pallidus</i> 8, which is unprecedented. The characterized bacteriocin belongs to the small class of glycocins and shares genetic and structural similarities with sublancin 168 <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>, glycocin F <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>, thurandacin <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup> and enterocin F4-9 <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Here, we show that the whole glycocin biosynthetic gene cluster, derived from a thermophilic bacterium, can be cloned and functionally expressed in a heterologous host <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3). Surprisingly, mature bacteriocin (glycosylated, oxidatively folded and leaderless) from Gram-positive bacteria could be synthesized and secreted by this Gram-negative host. Structural characterization of the purified recombinant pallidocin revealed posttranslational modifications: glycosylation and two disulfide bonds within two predicted α-helices. These two features appear to be specific for the class of glycocins <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Pallidocin has an <i>S</i>-linked glucose moiety to the Cys25, which is very uncommon among bacteria. Only a few cases of <i>S</i>-linked glycopeptides have been described and confirmed to date, i.e. for glycocin F, sublancin 168 and thurandacin <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR14">14</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Pallidocin exhibits high stability after exposure to high temperatures and a wide range of pH values. To our knowledge, only sublancin and enterocin F4-9 have been properly characterized for their stability. The stability of sublancin is decreased by 50% after 30 min incubation at 70 °C temperature. Sublancin is not very stable at acidic conditions; after incubation at pH 2 and 3 for 30 min, it retains only 20 and 40% of its activity, respectively <sup> <a href="#CR40">40</a> </sup>, while enterocin F4-9 after incubation at 80 °C for 15 min retains its full activity only at pH values from 2 to 8. After incubation at 100 °C for 15 min, enterocin F4-9 retains its full activity only at pH 4. Its activity is completely lost after incubation at 121 °C as well as at pH 10 <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. Compared to sublancin and enterocin F4-9, pallidocin is much more stable at high temperatures. Its activity decreases 50% only after 15 min incubation at 121 °C and is completely stable at 90 °C for 3 h. In contrast to sublancin and enterocin F4-9, pallidocin retains its full activity at acidic and basic conditions (pH 2−10). </p> <p>In vitro studies on the glycosylation of the sublancin precursor showed that <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase has relaxed substrate specificity. It is able to attach other sugars: xylose, mannose, <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine or galactose, as well. The native glycopeptide sublancin purified from <i>B. subtilis</i> contains glucose <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>. We do not know which sugar would be present in native pallidocin if the peptide was derived from <i>A. pallidus</i> 8. We can assume that native pallidocin has an <i>S</i>-linked glucose as well, as this sugar was found in recombinant pallidocin produced by <i>E. coli</i>. </p> <p>Experiments in which only two or three genes were coexpressed revealed that <i>palS</i> codes for an <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase, which introduces glucose to the Cys25 residue in pallidocin. When <i>palA-his</i> was coexpressed with <i>palS</i> and <i>palT</i>, the mature pallidocin (PalA-His-Glc core peptide) was purified also. Additionally, the PalT protein shares sequence similarity to other bacteriocin ABC transporters, which leads to the conclusion that PalT has a dual, i.e. peptidase and transport, function. </p> <p>Oxidative folding of the peptide in the cytoplasm is unlikely. The formation of structural disulfide bonds in <i>E. coli</i> appears to be strictly segregated according to subcellular compartmentalization <sup> <a href="#CR45">45</a> </sup>. Because a reducing environment is necessary for enzymatic activity of glycosyltransferases <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup> most probably PalS glycosylates peptides in the cytoplasm. When the whole gene cluster <i>pal</i> is expressed, the synthesized glycosylated precursor peptide should be transported to the periplasm by PalT, where the oxidative folding could take place. Following the precursor peptide coexpression with PalS, these bonds could be formed spontaneously by air oxidation <sup> <a href="#CR46">46</a>, <a href="#CR47">47</a> </sup> during peptide extraction and/or the purification process. In case of precursor peptide coexpression with PalST, disulfide bonds in the glycosylated core peptide could be formed in the periplasm or spontaneously by air oxidation <sup> <a href="#CR46">46</a>, <a href="#CR47">47</a> </sup> during the peptide extraction and purification process. </p> <p>We applied PalS for possible modifications of other glycocins and produced two glycosylated peptides: Hyp1 and Hyp2. PalS specifically monoglycosylated a certain group of glycocin precursors (pre-PalA-His, pre-SunA-His, pre-Hyp1-His, and pre-Hyp2-His), but it was not able to modify pre-GccF-His and pre-EnfA4-9-His. Interestingly, the 42%, 50% and 53% sequence similarities of Hyp1S, Hyp2S and SunS, respectively, to the PalS <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase show quite surprisingly that this similarity is enough to allow modification of heterologous substrates. </p> <p>The distinctive feature of the glucosylated peptides is a Cys residue flanked by glycines (Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly/Ser) in the interhelical loop. PalS, ThuS, and SunS form a sugar <i>S</i>-linkage with a Cys residue in Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly/Ser motif of interhelical loop, and this motif is present only in SunA, ThuA, PalA, Hyp1, and Hyp2. Therefore, we can assign PalA, Hyp1, and Hyp2 to the <i>sublancin-</i>type glycocins, which is composed of SunA and ThrA <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Previous research on the sublancin <i>S</i>-glycosyltransferase, SunS, suggested that this enzyme recognizes an α-helical segment of the substrate and glycosylates only a Cys residue in the flexible loop following this helix <sup> <a href="#CR48">48</a> </sup>. Studies on thurandacin glycosyltransferase, ThuS, showed that it glycosylates ThuA at Cys28 or both Ser19 and Cys28. ThuS represents glycosyltransferase that catalyzes both <i>O</i>- and <i>S</i>-glycosylation of proteins. Earlier studies also demonstrated that SunS is not able to modify ThuA, although ThuS is able to modify SunA generating its bisglucosylated product. Moreover, SunA and ThuA with changed short sequences in their interhelical loops were also glucosylated by ThuS in these regions. On basis of this knowledge, it was suggested that the peptide sequence selectivity of ThuS is much more relaxed than that of SunS <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. Here, we demonstrate that PalS has quite flexible substrate selectivity too and that it may monoglycosylate various precursor peptides: pre-PalA-His, pre-SunA-His, pre-Hyp1-His, and pre-Hyp2-His. In addition, we show that leaderless Hyp1-His and Hyp2-His core peptides can be modified by PalS, resulting in highly active antibacterial peptide Hyp1-His-Glc but not Hyp2-His-Glc. </p> <p>All sublancin-type glycocins, including the pallidocin, Hyp1 and glycosylated core peptide Hyp2, have a relatively rich content of hydrophobic residues at the N-terminus, and charged residues at the C-terminus. Comparing the core peptides of glycocins, Hyp2 has a relatively long C-terminus "tail", not characteristic to other sublancin-type glycocins, and is relatively rich in charged residues (Glu20, Arg21, Arg22) in the interhelical loop (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). These two features or one of them might be the reason why glycosylated Hyp2 core peptide and precursor did not have antibacterial activity against the strains tested. This could be the subject for future research on glycocin variability. </p> <p>In contrast to previous work on sublancin <sup> <a href="#CR48">48</a> </sup>, a newly published study showed that nonglycosylated and oxidatively folded core peptide of sublancin has the same topology of disulfide bonds as the native sublancin <sup> <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. In fact, the previous assumptions that the free thiol of unmodified Cys disrupts the formation of the correct disulfide bridges by thiol-disulfide exchange and the blocked Cys residue can aid to form correct disulfide bonds between four free Cys residues <sup> <a href="#CR48">48</a> </sup> were proven wrong. </p> <p>We show that the disruption of disulfide bonds in the glycosylated precursor peptides pre-PalA-His-Glc, pre-Hyp1-His-Glc or the PalA-His-Glc and Hyp1-His-Glc core peptides leads to the loss of antibacterial activity. These data support observations of earlier investigations on sublancin. It confirms that disulfide bonds are crucial for antibacterial activity of glycocins as well as glycosylation <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Earlier studies on sublancin and thurandacin showed that the leader must be cleaved off to gain antibacterial activity <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. In contrast, our synthesized glycosylated precursors with leaders (pre-PalA-His-Glc, pre-SunA-His-Glc and pre-Hyp1-His-Glc) still showed activity against a sensitive strain, suggesting that the leader removal from the glycosylated glycocin precursor is not essential for activity. In fact, glycocins with a leader attached exhibit substantial antibacterial activity. However, the absence of the leader increases the activity. It should be noted that in contrast to previous studies on glycocins, we have used a thermophilic indicator strain, which, as we show, exhibits extreme susceptibility, even to a leader-containing glycocin. </p> <p>Previously, only full maturation of recombinant glycocins was reported in vitro for thurandacin and sublancin. Glycosylation and leader cleavage was performed enzymatically, followed by chemical oxidative folding <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. The in vitro experiments limit the yield of the end product, are time consuming and expensive. Recently, a system was developed for the heterologous expression of sublancin in <i>E. coli</i> SHuffle T7 Express cells that in vivo installs the glycosylation and oxidative folding following a single in vitro step of proteolytic leader cleavage <sup> <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. SHuffle T7 Express strain expresses the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, aiding oxidative folding of proteins in the cytoplasm <sup> <a href="#CR35">35</a> </sup>. Here, we demonstrate a different in vivo heterologous expression system for completely mature glycocins in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), evading the in vitro chemical and enzymatic steps. </p> <p>With the aid of PalS and PalT we can synthesize completely mature and active pallidocin, which is glycosylated, oxidatively folded and leaderless. Because pallidocin glycosyltransferase has flexible substrate selectivity, we propose that PalS could be a good tool for in vivo biosynthesis and screening of hypothetical glycocins, as we showed with Hyp1 and Hyp2. This approach demonstrates that after in vivo peptide glycosylation the disulfide bonds most probably are formed spontaneously during the purification process. It means that the in vitro chemical oxidative folding is not absolutely necessary. Moreover, the in vivo glycosylation of core peptides evades the enzymatic leader cleavage. </p> <p>Pallidocin exhibits antimicrobial activity against specific Gram-positive bacteria. Most of the tested thermophilic bacteria were susceptible to pallidocin. Among <i>Bacillus</i> sp. only <i>B. megaterium</i> DSM319 and <i>B. cereus</i> ATCC14579 strains were susceptible. It indicates a rather narrow activity spectrum restricted to closely related bacteria. Enterocin F4-9 exhibits antimicrobial activity against <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>E. coli</i> JM109 <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. Glycocin F has narrow activity spectrum also that is restricted to the <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>. Notably, sublancin is active against several Gram-positive bacteria, like <i>Staphylococcus</i> and, especially <i>Bacillus</i> species <sup> <a href="#CR20">20</a> </sup>. Pallidocin MIC values for thermophilic bacteria are extremely low when compared to the values for <i>B. megaterium</i> DSM319 and <i>B. cereus</i> ATCC14579. Notably, glycosylated leaderless Hyp1 core peptide demonstrated a different activity spectrum against thermophilic bacteria as compared to pallidocin. As in case of sublancin, the susceptible strains relatively easily develop resistance to pallidocin. The mechanism of resistance development will be the subject of our future study. </p> <p>******Studies on sublancin and thurandacin have generally been focused on in vitro analysis and on the glycosyltransferase as potential tool for antibody generation and other purposes. <i>S</i>-linked glycopeptides have been highlighted to be more chemically and biologically stable compounds than <i>O</i>-linked glycopeptides <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. Here, we identified and characterized antibacterial peptide pallidocin and expanded the currently small glycocin family. In addition, we demonstrated that glycosyltransferase PalS can be used as a tool for the biosynthesis of glycosylated antibacterial peptides in vivo. We have developed a system for heterologous expression and screening for hypothetical sublancin-type precursors with a minimal number of genes required. Pallidocin or Hyp1 could be applied in industrial processes facing thermophilic bacterial contaminations. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The estimate of secondary structure content was made using spectra from 193 nm to 260 nm by the method of Raussens et al. <sup> <a href="#CR42">42</a> </sup> at <a href="http://perry.freeshell.org/raussens.html">http://perry.freeshell.org/raussens.html</a>. </p> </div> <div class="codeavailability" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
