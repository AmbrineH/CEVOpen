Next-generation sequencing was used to generate the transcriptome of the curry leaf to detect changes in gene expression during leaf development, such as those genes involved in the production of oils which lend the leaf its characteristic taste, aroma, and medicinal properties. Using abundance estimation (RSEM) and differential expression analysis, genes that were significantly differentially expressed were identified. The transcriptome was annotated with BLASTx using the non-redundant (nr) protein database, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned based on the top BLAST hit using Blast2GO. Lastly, functional enrichment of the assigned GO terms was analyzed for genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of the most enriched GO categories, pathways involved in cell wall, membrane, and lignin synthesis were found to be most upregulated in immature leaf tissue, possibly due to the growth and expansion of the leaf tissue. Terpene synthases, which synthesize monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which comprise much of the curry essential oil, were found to be significantly upregulated in mature leaf tissue, suggesting that oil production increases later in leaf development. Enzymes involved in pigment production were also significantly upregulated in mature leaves. The findings were based on computational estimates of gene expression from RNA-seq data, and further study is warranted to validate these results using targeted techniques, such as quantitative PCR.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Rutaceae, a family of angiosperms within the order Sapindales, contains around 1730 species among 158 genera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Morton and Telmer (2014) characterized the family into four subfamilies, the Amyridoideae, Aurantioideae, Cneoroideae, and Rutoideae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Many of the medicinal properties are attributed to the oil composition of the leaves, which yields the pungent, bitter taste, and aroma favored in South Asian cooking.</p><p id="Par5">The oil composition of the curry leaf has been well characterized in previous studies. Using GC (Gas chromatography) and GC/MS (Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) with trichlorofluoromethane as a solvent, MacLeod and Pieris (1982) found four main constituents of the curry essential oil: &#x003b2;-phellandrene, caryophyllene, &#x003b2;-gurjunene, and &#x003b2;-elemene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Studies have also found anti-inflammatory properties in the oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, similar to the properties found in curry leaves by Darvekar <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Verma <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) found that the distinct aroma profile of the curry tree consists of Pinene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, and other monoterpenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. &#x003b2;-phellandrene, a common oil found in various <italic>Citrus</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, as well as in the essential oil of <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, may also contribute to this aroma along with Pinenes, which are notable for their pine aroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The majority of the essential oils of the curry leaf are classified as terpenes, which act mainly to defend against insects and microbes, as well as to attract pollinators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Aside from the monoterpene and sesquiterpenes found in the essential oil of the curry leaf, another terpene commonly found in plants is gibberellin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which has been found to hormonally regulate leaf development and senescence in various plant organs and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, the transcriptome of the curry leaf was sequenced to understand the changes in mRNA expression during development to discover the genetic regulation of leaf growth and the pathways that are involved in essential oil production. Due to its widespread cultivation, as well as its medicinal and culinary use, further study into the leaf development of this species will provide valuable data for horticultural applications as well as further elucidate the basic molecular regulation of leaf cell differentiation.</p><p id="Par9">We hypothesize that increased expression will be most apparent among leaf ontogeny genes as the leaf matures, as well as metabolic pathway genes expressed during leaf expansion and cell maturation. We also propose that there would be an increase in the expression of genes involved in the anabolism of secondary metabolites, oils, and pigments as the leaf grows. An increase in pigment producing enzymes is also expected as the larger mature leaves require more chlorophyll for photosynthesis necessary to sustain a greater tissue size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue Collection</title><p id="Par10">Both immature and mature leaf tissue (differentiated by size and proximity to the apical meristem, with immature leaves ranging from 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02009;cm, and mature leaflets from 1.5&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;cm) were collected from the curry tree growing in the United States Botanic Gardens in Washington, D.C.

These have been shown to be constituents of the essential oil in the curry leaf and contribute significantly to the aroma and flavor of the plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Recently, several of the secondary metabolites produced by enzymes in this polyketide synthase gene family have been identified via cloning of transcripts in an expression vector and subsequent GC-MS chromatography. Many terpene synthase genes were also identified using transcriptomic sequencing in the curry leaf and were compared with those of other species in a phylogenetic context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Unlike in the present study, however, differential expression of these genes was not studied during leaf development and oil gland morphogenesis. During our study, the expression of these terpene synthase family genes was compared during leaf development, and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows a significant trend of upregulation of terpene synthase activity after leaf maturation. Another upregulated class of sesquiterpene synthases are those which produce caryophyllene (sequence homology E-value &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;110</sup>), a sesquiterpene oil that has been found to be the main constituent of curry essential oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, yielding the various medicinal properties of the leaf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This supports anatomical studies which show that oil gland counts continue to increase late into leaf development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The upregulation of this class of enzymes indicates an increase in the production of these oils during leaf development. This corroborates with previous research that describes correlations between slower growing plants and an increased metabolic investment in antiherbivory compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The upregulation in terpene synthases may also reflect an increase in gibberellin production.

The transcriptome was assembled using read overlap from the original RNA-seq dataset, and gene expression was estimated using read alignment to the assembled transcriptome. Using reads aligned to a transcript as a proxy for the abundance of the transcript only provides a computational estimate, which, in order to make valid claims about differential expression, must be validated by various approaches. The sequence data is provided to assist in future studies aimed at validating these results, using methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), or repeating the study with multiple biological replicates. Thus, the results presented will aid in the further study of the gene expression profile of the curry species.</p><p id="Par30">Another opportunity for future study is to investigate the change in the metabolic profile of the leaves through development, correlating the changes in gene expression of relevant enzymes involved in metabolic synthesis to the changes in metabolites. By analyzing the change in compounds such as terpenes and other products in the essential oil, the results of differential gene expression studies can be further validated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">The transcriptome pattern of the curry leaf was a useful tool in the analysis of the differential expression of genes and pathways in immature and mature tissue. Until this study, only a few nuclear genes, complete chloroplast genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and a transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> in mature leaves had been sequenced for the curry tree; this study adds 57,383 newly sequenced transcripts (including multiple transcriptional isoforms of the same gene), contributing to a new understanding of the molecular genetics of the curry leaf development. The upregulated pathways identified in immature leaves can now be studied in this species, as well as offer molecular resources for studying the antiherbivory mechanisms of vulnerable meristematic tissues in the absence of mature oil glands. Lastly, the classes of enzymes involved in the synthesis of terpenes were characterized in curry leaves, and the differential expression of these terpene synthase genes was studied, with results showing a significant increase in terpene biosynthesis after leaf maturation. This will enable future studies to investigate the role of these enzymes and metabolites in the ecology and physiology of this species as well as its application in food and medicine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank M.
