    "Babchi (Psoralea corylifolia) oil is an important essential oil used in several traditional medicines to cure various disorders. This phytotherapeutic agent possesses a number of pharmacological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antitumor factors. However, volatile nature, poor stability, and solubility of babchi oil (BO) restrict its pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to encapsulate this oil in β-cyclodextrin nanosponges (NS) in order to overcome the above limitations. To fabricate nanosponges, β-cyclodextrin was cross-linked with diphenyl carbonate in different molar ratios viz. 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and 1:10. The blank nanosponges were loaded with BO using the freeze-drying method. The particle size of the BO loaded nanosponges was found to lie between 200 and 500 nm with low polydispersity index. Furthermore, the zeta potential, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and electron microscopy were carried out for characterization of BO nanosponges. Results obtained from spectral analysis ascertained the formation of inclusion complexes. Additionally, solubilisation efficiency of BO was checked in distilled water and found enhanced by 4.95 times with optimized β-cyclodextrin nanosponges. The cytotoxicity study was carried out by the MTT assay using HaCaT cell lines. A significant improvement in photo-stability of essential oil was also observed by inclusion innanosponges. Lastly, the optimized formulation was tested for antibacterial activity using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Therefore, encapsulation of BO in nanosponges resulted in efficacious carrier system in terms of solubility, photo-stability, and safety of this oil along with handling benefits."
