    "This study was conducted to characterize the volatile components of Korean fermented tea and blended tea with Korean fermented tea and several herbs. A total of 161 volatile components in 4 samples of FT (fermented tea), BT (blended tea) 1, BT2, and BT3 were analyzed in this study. A total of 61 volatile compounds were identified in the FT sample, which contained the most abundant hydrocarbons. The major compounds were 3-methyldecane (10.48%), 2,2,4, 6,6-pentamethylheptane (10.00%), and 2,3,6-trimethyloctane (7.90%). A total of 75 volatile compounds were identified in the BT1 sample, which consisted of fermented tea, orange cosmos, lemon grass, chamomile, and peppermint. L-(-)-menthol (36.79%), menthone (24.92%), and isomenthone (8.70%) were the highest compounds. A total of 76 volatile compounds were identified in the BT2 sample, which was composed of fermented tea, rose hip, lemongrass, lavender, and peppermint. Alcohols were identified as the most abundant, and linalool (26.32%), linalyl acetate (18.45%), and L-(-)-menthol (11.99%) were the major components. A total of 85 volatile compounds were identified in the BT3 sample composed of fermented tea, citrus peel, chamomile, hibiscus, and beet. Sesquiterpenes were identified as the most abundant including L-limonene (74.45%), β-myrcene (3.06%), and γ-terpinene (7.47%)."
