    "Gas mixture quantification is essential for the recording and reproducing odors, because an odor consists of multiple chemical compounds. Gas mixture quantification using field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) was studied. Acetone, ethanol, and diethyl ether were selected as components of a ternary gas mixture sample as representatives of the ketone, alcohol, and ether chemical classes, respectively. One hundred and twenty-five points with different concentrations were measured. The results were evaluated by error hypersurface, variance, and the coefficient of variation. The error hypersurface showed that it is possible to reach the target composition by following the error-hypersurface gradient. Successful convergence was achieved with the gradient descent method in a simulation based on the measurement data. This result verified the feasibility of the quantification of a gas mixture using FAIMS."
