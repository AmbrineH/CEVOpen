    "Rainbow trout bone proteins were prepared by heating at 121°C for 30 min, followed by filtration, concentration, and lyophilization. Nutritional properties and flavor analyses of hydrolysates digested by five different enzymes were investigated, respectively. Results showed that the crude protein content of rainbow trout bone was 15.90% and had a well-balanced nutritional value. The content of total amino acids was 983.64 mg/g. The amount of free amino acids of hydrolysates digested by alkaline protease, neutral protease, flavourzyme, papain, and trypsin for 3 hr was 207.83, 224.13, 1,001.59, 283.26, and 303.64 mg/g, respectively. During the hydrolysis, the main flavor compounds were identified by GC-MS to be alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, and alkanes. After hydrolysis, the main molecular weight of peptides was focused on the range of 1,000-3,000 Da in all enzymatic hydrolysates. This study provided a theoretical basis to comprehensive utilization of rainbow trout bone in food industry."
