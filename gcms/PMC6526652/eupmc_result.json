    "To prevent oxidation and maintain the quality of meat products, it is essential to add antioxidants. The aim of this work was to investigate the antioxidant activity of vine tea (Ampelopsis grossedentata) extract (VTE) and evaluate the effects of VTE on the quality characteristics and lipid and protein oxidation of cooked mixed pork patties during refrigerated storage. VTE had a significant DPPH radical scavenging activity, and its IC50 was 15.35 µg/ml. VTE-treated mixed pork patties had a better texture than that of the control group (p < 0.05). VTE could significantly inhibit an increase in the TBARS value and the formation of carbonyl compounds (p < 0.05), and the inhibition was stronger than that of the butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) group (p < 0.05), while the amount of sulfhydryl groups significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The color of VTE itself made the mixed pork patties darker (p < 0.05), but this did not affect the sensory scores and overall acceptability of the VTE-treated patties, indicating the VTE can be incorporated into mixed pork patties. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the VTE inhibited the oxidation of the cooked mixed pork patties during refrigerated storage. These findings may be significant to helping extend the shelf life of meat products."
