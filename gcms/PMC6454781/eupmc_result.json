    "Background:Recent studies have shown that the risks of chronic diseases resulting from high-risk alleles, such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome (MetS), can be affected by various dietary patterns. Among the genes affected by environmental factors are those associated with vitamin D binding protein (DBP). Methods:This cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 265 apparently healthy adults aged 18-50. MetS was defined according to the adult treatment panel III criteria. Major dietary patterns were determined using factor analysis on 24 food groups, using a valid and reliable 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). DBP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reactions-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results:After adjustment for confounder factors, results demonstrated strong interactions between, on the one hand, a high intake of healthy pattern and DBP haplotype (rs7041/rs4588 major alleles) and on the other, low MetS odds (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.87, P ≤ 0.001), serum triglyceride levels (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.93, P = 0.01) and fasting blood glucose (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.96, P = 0.04). Also, individuals with a higher adherence to traditional dietary patterns demonstrated reduced odds of high waist circumference among the major allele (low-risk allele) carriers of rs7041/rs4588 (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.88, P = 0. 003). Interactions were also seen between high traditional pattern intake and DBP haplotype elevated blood pressure odds (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.68, P = 0.02). Conclusions:The present evidence indicates that interactions between healthy dietary patterns with DBP haplotypes (Gc 1F, Gc 1S and Gc 2) and traditional dietary patterns with DBP haplotypes may be effective in reducing the odds of MetS and some of its components through consuming healthy food groups and inherited low risk alleles."
