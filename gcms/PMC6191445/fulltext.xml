One of the few known endogenous platelet inhibitors is nitric oxide (NO).

Correlative profiling of cGMP dynamics and thrombus formation in vivo indicates that high cGMP concentrations in shear-exposed platelets at the thrombus periphery limit thrombosis, primarily through facilitation of thrombus dissolution.

Drugs that inhibit platelet activation and aggregation are commonly used in the management of acute coronary syndromes, but can also cause life-threatening bleeding. An optimal hemostatic response is defined as one sufficient to stop bleeding without unwarranted vascular thrombotic occlusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The importance of local hemodynamic conditions for platelet accumulation at sites of injury is well known and the molecular players that promote platelet activation and thrombus formation under high flow/shear have been studied in great detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, mechanisms that suppress thrombosis are less well understood. One of the few known endogenous platelet inhibitors is nitric oxide (NO). It is generally accepted that NO is supplied by the endothelium and then binds to and activates NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) in platelets, resulting in an increase of intraplatelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of NO-cGMP signaling in cardiovascular health and disease in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. It is long known that platelets express high levels of NO-GC and cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI), and that the intraplatelet cGMP concentration can be increased in vitro by incubation with NO, or with drugs that stimulate NO-GC or inhibit cGMP degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the (patho-)physiological and therapeutic relevance of platelet cGMP signaling for hemostasis and thrombosis is not clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While it is well established that the NO-cGMP pathway is a major mechanism for platelet inhibition, it is increasingly recognized that this pathway may in fact play a biphasic role in both platelet activation and inhibition. An increase in platelet cGMP has been linked to platelet activation induced by several receptor signaling pathways, including recently discovered platelet pattern-recognition receptor signaling pathways that are triggered by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules such as high mobility group box 1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The uncertainty as to the function of cGMP in platelets is in part related to the fact that it was not possible to monitor dynamic changes of the cGMP concentration in living platelets. Furthermore, many experiments have been performed with isolated platelets in vitro under conditions that do not completely represent the in vivo situation with regard to platelet interactions with immobilized substrates, other cell types, blood flow, and shear forces that affect platelet activity under in vivo conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, the potential influence of shear stress on the activity of the cGMP cascade in platelets has not been considered until now. To study the role of flow/shear stress for NO-cGMP signaling in platelets, we have generated cGMP sensor mice that enable real-time visualization of cGMP signals during thrombus formation. We find that NO-induced cGMP production in pre-activated platelets is strongly shear-dependent both in a flow chamber assay as well as in two mouse models of arterial injury and thrombosis. The mechanosensitive NO-cGMP-cGKI pathway identified in this study acts as an auto-regulatory brake to prevent vessel occlusion under high shear, while preserving wound closure under low shear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Visualization of cGMP signals in platelets under flow</title><p id="Par6">We first examined the effect of NO on thrombus formation on a collagen-coated surface ex vivo using a flow chamber system.

In these mice, a Cre-activatable loxP-modified cGi500 construct is integrated into the Rosa26 locus and driven by the CAG promoter. In the present study, we used mice with either ubiquitous sensor expression (cGi500-L1 mice) or Pf4-Cre-activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> sensor expression specifically in megakaryocytes/platelets (<italic>cGi500-L2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic><sup>tg/+</sup> mice) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). The cGi500 sensor contains a cGMP-binding domain flanked by CFP and YFP. Upon excitation of CFP, part of the emitted energy is transferred via FRET to YFP, which is then also excited. When cGMP binds to the sensor, its FRET efficiency is decreased. Thus, the ratio of CFP over YFP emission (F480/F535) indicates the intracellular cGMP concentration (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Initially, we have established cGMP imaging in cGi500-expressing platelets adhered to collagen in a flow chamber (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Indeed, strong YFP fluorescence was observed in aggregated thrombi as well as single platelets (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a, b</xref>). Note that YFP fluorescence indicates the expression level of cGi500, but not the intracellular cGMP concentration. The thrombi in the flow chamber stained positive for the platelet activation marker P-selectin (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>) confirming that the platelets were indeed activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To validate the system for cGMP imaging, thrombi were continuously superfused with buffer in the absence and presence of test compounds. While application of CNP and ANP (ligands of guanylyl cyclases not known to be expressed in platelets) did not evoke any FRET/cGMP changes, superfusion with DEA/NO triggered fast, robust, reversible, and concentration-dependent FRET changes reflecting an increase in cGMP in platelet thrombi under flow (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d, e</xref>). Pre-incubation with pharmacological inhibitors of PDE2 (BAY 60-7550), PDE3 (milrinone), or PDE5 (tadalafil) potentiated NO-induced cGMP transients demonstrating that these PDEs degrade cGMP in platelets (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3f&#x02013;h</xref>). These data are in line with previous studies of cGMP signaling in platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>NO-cGMP signaling in pre-activated platelets is shear-dependent</title><p id="Par9">Surprisingly, flow chamber experiments in which we switched the superfusion off and on revealed that NO-triggered cGMP signals in platelet thrombi are dependent on fluid shear stress. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>, application of 100&#x02009;nM DEA/NO at a shear rate of 500&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> led to sustained cGMP elevation, but switching off the fluid flow led to a rapid decrease of the intracellular cGMP concentration to the basal level within ~20&#x02009;s, although DEA/NO was still present. In the presence of DEA/NO, repeated initiation and cessation of flow (flow on/off) led to repeated cGMP increases and decreases, respectively. Based on a calibration scale of the cGi500 sensor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, upper right)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the flow-induced cGMP elevations were robust, reaching a concentration of &#x02265;3&#x02009;&#x000b5;M cGMP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Note that the apparent plateau of the cGMP signal (ratio R, black trace) was most likely due to sensor saturation above 3&#x02009;&#x000b5;M cGMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The possibility that the flow-dependent FRET/cGMP changes were artifacts was excluded by several control experiments. First, the individual emission intensities for CFP (cyan) and YFP (yellow) changed into opposite directions indicating that a proper FRET change was observed with our ratiometric sensor rather than quenching or fluorescence artifacts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Second, the flow-dependent FRET/cGMP signals correlated well with phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), a well-known substrate of cGMP-activated cGKI in platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Third, the magnitude of the cGMP signals could be titrated by increasing shear rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Fourth, application of flow alone in the absence of NO did not evoke cGMP signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, left). Fifth, flow-induced cGMP signals in the presence of NO were almost absent in cGi500-expressing platelets with a conditional NO-GC knockout (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The corresponding mice were obtained by crossing platelet-specific cGi500 mice with mice carrying a loxP-flanked allele of the NO-GC &#x003b2;1 subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> resulting in mice with platelet-specific cGi500 expression and platelet-specific NO-GC deletion (<italic>cGi500-L2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic><sup>tg/+</sup>; <italic>NO-GC &#x003b2;1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>). Although the efficiency of Pf4-Cre driven knockouts is very high in platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we cannot exclude a low level of residual NO-GC expression in some platelets of our conditional NO-GC knockout mice. This might also explain the weak FRET changes triggered by flow and NO in thrombi derived from these mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). We observed flow-sensitive cGMP responses also in the presence of higher concentrations of DEA/NO (250&#x02009;nM, 500&#x02009;nM) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, stimulation with high concentrations of DEA/NO, in particular with 500&#x02009;nM, induced fast desensitization of the mechanosensitive cGMP response.</p><p id="Par10">Since the results described above were obtained with preformed thrombi consisting of hundreds of aggregated platelets, we tested how individual platelets would respond to shear stress and NO. Indeed, NO-dependent cGMP increases in single adherent platelets were also highly sensitive to flow, both on a collagen- and fibrinogen-coated surface (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a, b</xref>). We further tested the effect of mechanical stress on NO-induced cGMP responses in platelets in suspension. Because our FRET imaging setup is not suitable for cGMP imaging in floating cells, we measured cGMP by a conventional immunoassay. Platelet suspensions were exposed to DEA/NO (50&#x02009;nM) under static conditions or during mild shaking. Although the shear stress generated under our shaking conditions was not well defined, we detected in these platelets a higher cGMP level than in platelets kept under static conditions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). However, the NO/shear-induced cGMP increase in floating platelets appeared to be weaker than in adherent platelets in a flow chamber. Taken together, our results indicated that shear stress potentiates NO-cGMP signaling in platelets. This mechanosensory system is apparently more efficient in adherent versus floating platelets, but does not require platelet-platelet interactions present in thrombi nor interactions of platelets with specific immobilized substrates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>NO-GC activity is regulated by fluid shear stress</title><p id="Par11">Next, we investigated which component(s) of the cGMP pathway is/are regulated by fluid shear stress. The intracellular cGMP concentration in platelets depends on the rates of cGMP synthesis via NO-GC, cGMP degradation via PDEs, and cGMP efflux via cGMP transporters. Thus, the cGMP increase elicited by flow in the presence of NO could be caused by sensitization of NO-GC for NO, inactivation of PDEs and/or inhibition of cGMP efflux. Application of the NO-GC inhibitor ODQ to thrombi in the presence of flow and DEA/NO led to a fast decrease of the intracellular cGMP concentration to basal levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, right). If PDEs were the shear stress-sensitive components, then one would expect that their activity is relatively low under flow and consequently, the fall of cGMP in the presence of NO, ODQ and flow should also be slow. However, we observed a rapid cGMP decrease after acute NO-GC inhibition with ODQ in the presence of flow, with kinetics similar to the decrease of cGMP after flow cessation in the absence of ODQ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These data indicated that shear stress increases NO sensitivity of NO-GC rather than decreases cGMP degradation by PDEs. Similar results were obtained with two alternative NO-donors, SPER/NO and DETA/NO, in the presence and absence of flow and ODQ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). Flow-dependent cGMP signals were also observed in the presence of BAY 41-2272 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and riociguat (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), so-called NO-GC stimulators that are able to activate NO-GC in the absence of NO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Compared to flow-regulated cGMP transients in the presence of NO, these cGMP signals showed slower off-rates. The relatively slow decline of the cGMP signal after cessation of flow in the presence of BAY 41-2272 might at least in part be due to the fact that this compound also inhibits PDE5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Interestingly, cGMP elevations induced by cinaciguat, a so-called NO-GC activator, were not regulated by flow (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The differential effects of NO, NO-GC stimulators and NO-GC activators on mechanosensitive cGMP signals are likely related to their different binding sites on NO-GC and modes of action. In contrast to NO and NO-GC stimulators, NO-GC activators activate the enzyme even if it has been oxidized or rendered heme-deficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Inhibition of cGMP efflux with MK-571 did not affect flow-dependent cGMP increases in the presence of NO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>).

Primary VSMCs isolated from mouse aorta express several types of guanylyl cyclases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. When we studied these VSMCs in flow chamber experiments similar to those performed with platelets, we also observed shear-sensitive cGMP transients in the presence of NO, but not in the presence of CNP, which activates a different type of guanylyl cyclase, GC-B (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Considering that PDE5 inhibition augments both NO-induced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and CNP-induced cGMP pools in VSMCs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), but only the NO-induced cGMP pool was sensitive to flow, it is likely that, similar to platelets, NO-GC but not PDE activity, is the major mechanosensitive component shaping cGMP signals in VSMCs. Indeed, we detected high amounts of the NO-GC &#x003b2;1 subunit as well as cGKI associated with the platelet membrane fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>).

To test if NO-GC activity is regulated by known mechanotransducers, we performed FRET/cGMP imaging in the presence of Pyr3 (a selective TRPC3 blocker), GsMTx4 (a nonselective blocker of TRPC1, TRPC6, Piezo1, and stretch-activated cation channels), or a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>3</sub> integrin-blocking antibody. However, none of these compounds affected the flow-regulated cGMP signals in the presence of NO (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

In the presence of NO, initiation of flow induced an increase of cGMP and a decrease of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, while cessation of flow resulted in inverse changes of cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). cGMP changes preceded Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in each case (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). This finding, together with the fact that measurements were performed in EGTA-containing imaging buffer, indicated that mechanosensitive cGMP signals do not require extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that activation of shear-dependent cGMP signaling lowers the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, presumably by inhibition of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via cGKI and phosphorylation of IRAG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In line with this mechanism, flow-dependent regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of NO was abolished in cGKI-deficient mouse platelets (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a, b</xref>). Moreover, the mechanosensitive NO-cGMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway also exists in human platelets (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>). Thus, in the presence of NO, fluid shear stress increases intraplatelet cGMP resulting in suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and inhibition of platelet activity, presumably via inhibition of ligand-integrin interaction. The mechanosensitive crosstalk of cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling likely underlies the anti-thrombotic effect of the NO-cGMP-cGKI cascade under flow ex vivo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Platelet cGMP changes during thrombus growth in vivo</title><p id="Par14">To demonstrate that the shear stress-dependent NO-cGMP pathway in platelets exists in vivo and inhibits thrombosis in the presence of blood flow, we analyzed cGMP signals and thrombus growth by intravital FRET microscopy in platelet-specific cGMP sensor mice. Thrombus formation is a highly dynamic process with cycles of platelet aggregation and disaggregation, resulting in sequential increases and decreases of thrombus size and shear rates acting on the platelets in the thrombus until the thrombus has stabilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We first performed mechanical injury of arterioles of the cremaster muscle with a micropipette and imaged the developing thrombi using an epifluorescence microscope. YFP fluorescence was detected selectively in thrombi indicating platelet-specific expression of the cGi500 sensor in our mouse model (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>). Superfusion of the cremaster tissue with the NO-releasing drug sodium nitroprusside (SNP) evoked robust FRET/cGMP signals in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>). After this proof-of-principle experiment, we switched to confocal spinning disk FRET microscopy that enables precise mapping of cGMP signals to selected thrombus regions. Thrombus formation was induced by mechanical injury, and after the thrombus stabilized, DEA/NO was applied. Again, administration of an NO donor in the presence of blood flow induced strong increases of the FRET/cGMP signals, which were validated by the fact that individual CFP and YFP traces split into opposite directions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;c</xref>). Importantly, cGMP signals were also observed in growing thrombi in the absence of exogenous NO, and these cGMP signals were stronger in the periphery of the thrombus than in its core region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d&#x02013;f</xref>) (Supplementary Movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The latter finding is consistent with shear-sensitized NO-GC in platelets at the thrombus periphery exposed to flow. In addition, limited diffusion of endogenous NO into the thrombus core may also contribute to the cGMP gradient from the periphery to the core region. Interestingly, the magnitude of the cGMP signals correlated well with the area of the developing thrombus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).

While our study did not specifically examine the role of cGMP during initial phases of platelet activation, we found that NO-induced cGMP generation in already pre-activated platelets is dramatically potentiated by shear stress and results in platelet inhibition at later stages of thrombus formation. Intravital studies performed in the mouse microcirculation showed that thrombi formed after vascular injury develop a characteristic architecture with a core of fully activated, densely packed platelets that is overlaid with a shell of less activated platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a recent study showed that during the propagation phase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was increased in platelets detaching from the downstream side of the aggregate, suggesting that high activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is associated with thrombus resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Considering the similarities between cAMP and cGMP signaling, this finding is consistent with our data indicating that high cGMP concentrations in shear-exposed platelets at the thrombus periphery limit thrombosis primarily through facilitation of thrombus dissolution.</p><p id="Par18">Taken together, our data support a concept of shear-dependent inhibition of thrombosis via the NO-cGMP-cGKI cascade (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>) and also provide a mechanistic explanation for the finding that human gene mutations leading to impaired cGMP generation in platelets are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Platelets that are recruited to the periphery of a growing thrombus are exposed to increasing shear stress as the thrombus becomes bigger. With increased thrombus size, shear-dependent cGMP synthesis in platelets at the periphery of a thrombus increases resulting in activation of cGKI and suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent platelet activity. NO that activates shear-sensitized NO-GC in platelets is likely generated by the vascular endothelium, presumably also in a shear stress-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Thus, NO generation in endothelial cells as well as cGMP synthesis in platelets appears to require shear stress. In this way, the mechanosensitive NO-cGMP cascade provides a negative feedback control of shear stress-induced platelet activation. It acts as an auto-regulatory brake to achieve a balance between activating and inhibiting mechanisms until a thrombus is eventually stabilized. The cGMP brake mechanism is well designed to enable an optimal hemostatic response. It should be most active to limit arterial thrombosis and vascular occlusion under high shear conditions, which are also known to lead to strong platelet activation, while it should not promote bleeding from injured vessels under low shear. Indeed, in a tail vein bleeding assay, in which platelets are exposed to shear rates ten times lower than in arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, the bleeding time of mutant mice lacking cGKI in platelets was not significantly different from controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>).

For epifluorescence-based FRET/cGMP imaging, the mean intensity from selected regions of interest of the CFP and YFP channel images was corrected for background fluorescence and is referred to as F480 and F535, respectively. The cGMP-representing fluorescence ratio R was calculated as F480/F535. &#x00394;F480/F480, &#x00394;F535/F535, and &#x00394;R/R traces were generated by normalization to the respective baseline. Since the emission spectrum of Fura-2 overlaps with emission of CFP and YFP, emission of Fura-2 can be collected with the same filters used for the CFP/YFP FRET pair. The images from the 535&#x02009;nm channel excited at 340&#x02009;nm and 380&#x02009;nm were used to analyze Fura-2 emission, processed analogously to F480 and F535 and are referred to as F340 and F380, respectively.

To evaluate FRET/cGMP signals in a dynamic thrombus recorded during intravital imaging, masks were applied to select different regions of interest, i.e. the whole thrombus, its core, or its periphery. Image segmentation was applied based on thrombus brightness using a similar approach as described for the analysis of FRET/cGMP signals in the vessel wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Measurements with a signal-to-noise ratio below 2.5 were excluded from analysis. The sum of CFP and YFP fluorescence intensities was used to define a dynamic binary mask. Gaussian blur filtering (sigma radius&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 pixels) was applied to the sum image of CFP and YFP when generating the binary mask. An intensity threshold was manually set to segment the whole thrombus from the background. To further segment the core and periphery of the thrombus, the original thresholded mask for the whole thrombus was divided into two portions, i.e. the mask was further eroded by a user-defined distance (defined as ~20% higher than original threshold intensity). The portion remaining after erosion was taken as thrombus core. The portion removed by erosion was taken as the thrombus periphery. The dynamic masks were multiplied with the original CFP and YFP images to generate new CFP and YFP time lapse images, respectively. A region of interest was selected to cover the whole thrombus during the time lapse recording. Background was selected in a region without thrombus in the original CFP or YFP image without mask applied. Background corrected F480 and F535 signals were used for FRET evaluation. The profile of thrombus growth was analyzed by measuring thrombus area as a function of time. The area under the curve reflecting thrombosis over time was determined by analyzing peak area of the thrombus growth profile using the Peak Analyzer Module of Origin. In addition, thrombus formation was characterized by the following parameters: time to maximal thrombus size, the magnitude of maximal thrombus size, thrombus half dissolution time, defined as the time from maximal thrombus size to 50% of maximal thrombus size, and size of stabilized thrombus at the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Tail bleeding assay</title><p id="Par28">Litter-matched control and mutant mice were anesthetized without reawakening by intraperitoneal injection of fentanyl (0.05&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), midazolam (5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and medetomidin (0.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).
