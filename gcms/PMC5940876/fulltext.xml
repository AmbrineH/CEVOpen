Current first-line standard of care is the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), but this treatment strategy adds only ~4 months to median survival due to the rapid development of resistance. While some mechanisms of TMZ resistance have been identified, they are not fully understood. There are few effective strategies to manage therapy resistant GBM, and we lack diverse preclinical models of acquired TMZ resistance in which to test therapeutic strategies on TMZ resistant GBM. In this study, we create and characterize two new GBM cell lines resistant to TMZ <italic>in vitro</italic>, based on the 8MGBA and 42MGBA cell lines. Analysis of the TMZ resistant (TMZres) variants in conjunction with their parental, sensitive cell lines shows that acquisition of TMZ resistance is accompanied by broad phenotypic changes, including increased proliferation, migration, chromosomal aberrations, and secretion of cytosolic lipids. Importantly, each TMZ resistant model captures a different facet of the &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; (8MGBA-TMZres) or &#x0201c;grow&#x0201d; (42MGBA-TMZres) hypothesis of GBM behavior. These <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems will be important additions to the available tools for investigators seeking to define molecular mechanisms of acquired TMZ resistance.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common glioma among adults and confers an abysmally low overall survival with only 5% of patients surviving at the 5-year mark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Over the past 33 years &#x02013; 1980&#x02013;2013 &#x02013; 570 clinical trials were conducted where almost 33,000 patients were treated with different novel therapeutics to better understand and treat GBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. From these extensive studies one chemotherapeutic agent &#x02013; temozolomide (TMZ) &#x02013; was found to moderately improve overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the last decade there has been little advancement in treatment, with the standard of care being radiotherapy and surgery, followed by TMZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, resistance to TMZ is rapid, and a broadly effective second line of treatment has not yet been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For these reasons, we need better models to understand mechanisms of TMZ resistance and how to develop improved therapies for the future.</p><p id="Par3">Cell line models have been invaluable in elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. As resistance to TMZ is rapid in clinical models, cell lines were used to better understand the mechanism behind the initial efficacy of TMZ sensitivity. TMZ is a prodrug that is preferentially activated in a more alkaline environment, which the brain provides, that spontaneously breaks down to highly reactive methyldiazonium cations. These byproducts preferentially methylate DNA bases at the <italic>N7</italic>-guanine, <italic>N3-</italic>adenine, and <italic>O6</italic>-guanine positions. The cytotoxic effect was shown to be mainly through the <italic>O6</italic>-guanine adduct, which can be reversed by the O6-methylguanine methyl transferase (MGMT). MGMT is a suicide repair protein which removes the <italic>O6-</italic>guanine adduct and allows for proper DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Even with this information, targeting MGMT with both small molecule drugs and mimetics has been unsuccessful, and its expression does not always correlate with resistance to TMZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, new models of resistance need to be developed in order to better define molecular mechanisms of GBM resistance to TMZ.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we present two unique TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines derived from the 42MGBA and 8MGBA parental lines which were first characterized in 1997. The 42MGBA line was derived from a temporal lobe tumor resected from a 63-year old male. The 8MGBA line was derived from a frontal lobe tumor resected from a 54-year old female<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. After continual exposure to TMZ in culture, both cell lines no longer undergo TMZ-mediated G2/M arrest. As the cell lines acquired resistance to TMZ both cell lines gained expression of MGMT, showed an increase in nuclear size and chromosome number, and an increase of early endosomes and extracellular lipids. However, as they differed in their growth and migratory capacity, these cell lines may give us insight into the &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d; model for GBM recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The 42MGBA-TMZ resistant cell line had an increase in growth capturing the &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; of the &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d; model for resistance. By contrast, the 8MBGA-TMZ resistant cell line had an increase in migration, encompassing the &#x0201c;grow&#x0201d; aspect of resistance. These models will be useful tools for the field to better define essential drug resistance mechanisms in GBM. These two TMZ-resistant (TMZres) models from both a male and female patient have evolved distinct resistant phenotypes and therefore serve as valuable resources to investigate the heterogeneity of TMZ-resistant GBM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Acquired temozolomide resistance decreases sensitivity to BCNU</title><p id="Par5">To better recapitulate acute temozolomide (TMZ) resistance models, we created cell lines that were resistant to 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;M TMZ and were challenged in 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M TMZ for all experiments. The overall time to acquired resistance varied from approximately 2 months for the 8MBGA cell line to ~3 months for the 42MBGA cell line. Cells were defined as resistant when each no longer showed a G2/M arrest or apoptosis in response to TMZ treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;d</xref>).

However, the shape of the SubG1 curves differed between the two cell lines &#x02013; 8MGBA-WT cells treated with TMZ showed a defined SubG1 peak typically associated with apoptosis, while 42MGBA-WT cells did not (Supp Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a,b</xref>).

Since the resistant cell lines are populations selected from the wild type cell lines they have a more reproducible phenotype as the variability or heterogeneity of the cell line has decreased. Therefore, the TMZres cells still showed a statistically significant G2/M arrest upon BCNU treatment.

As cells have already copied their DNA at this point in the cell cycle, if a cell is to survive TMZ-treatment they may also be retaining the extra copies of chromosomes that have already been duplicated. The 42MGBA-WT cell line has a hypertetraploid karyotype (88&#x02013;95 chromosomes) with 8% polyploidy, while the 8MGBA-WT cell line has a hyperdiploid karyotype with 15% polyploidy and contains 47&#x02013;52 chromosomes (DSMZ, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/">https://www.dsmz.de/</ext-link>). 42MGBA-TMZres cells showed a significant increase in total nuclear area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and their nuclear morphology became multi-lobed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

We observed an increase in overall chromosome number in the majority of the 42MBGA-TMZres cells in contrast to the 8MBGA-TMZres cells where only a small subpopulation of cells had an increase in overall chromosome number (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). We also assessed the change in copy number of a representative chromosome in each cell line pair (chromosome 17 in the 8MGBA pair and X in the 42MGBA pair), in interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads (200/cell line) using fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The choice of the two representative chromosomes was made based on reported karyotype analysis of the 2 parental cell lines showing a mostly diploid count for chromosome 17 in the 8MGBA line and X in 42MGBA (DSMZ, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/">https://www.dsmz.de/</ext-link>). We observed that 96% of the 42MBGA-TMZres cells had three or more copies of the X chromosome compared to only 7% of the 42MBGA-WT cells (93% of those cells had 2 copies). In contrast, this dramatic shift was not observed in 8MBGA-TMZres cells, where only a small subpopulation of cells showed an increase in the number of chromosomes 17 (18% had 3 or more copies) compared to the parental cells (6% had 3 or more copies). Taken together, these findings tracked with the stability of TMZ-resistance, with the 42MBGA-TMZres cells showing a more stable phenotype compared to 8MBGA-TMZres cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Acquired TMZ resistance is associated with chromosomal copy number increase.

One observation was the number of intracellular puncta and extracellular vesicles that were expelled into the media as the cells became resistant to TMZ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). As there was no longer a dramatic increase in the SubG1 fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), or cleaved PARP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>) upon resistance, we were able to rule out general apoptotic bodies. We therefore wanted to test if there was an increase in overall vesicle production in the TMZres vs WT cell lines. To accomplish this, we stained for the endosomal marker early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1). After analysis, we saw that there was a significant increase in the total number of endosomes in both TMZres cell lines compared to their parental lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a&#x02013;c</xref>). Interestingly in two independent datasets &#x02013; the Chinese Cancer Genomics Consortium (CCGC) and REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) &#x02013; EEA1 expression increases from normal brain to GBM, and survival is significantly better for patients with tumors having lower expression of EEA1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d&#x02013;f</xref>). However, it was not only intracellular, or early endosome, vesicles that we observed to be different, but extracellular vesicles as well. We therefore performed untargeted liquid chromatography and gas chromatography time-of-flight-based mass spectrometry (LC-MS, GC-TOF-MS) on cell culture media from the 8MGBA-WT and 8MBGA-TMZres cell line to identify differences in metabolites that may be associated with this phenotype. Putative results from the LC-MS showed an increase in the extracellular lipids LysoPC(16:0) and LysoPE(16:0) (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Interestingly, indoleacetaldehyde, a product of tryptophan metabolism, was also shown to be putatively increased in the 8MGBA-TMZres media. Tryptophan metabolism disruption has been shown previously as a feature of treatment adaptation in GBM cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Consistent with our observation of increased extracellular vesicles, there was an increase in palmitic acid and stearic acid lipids in the GC-TOF-MS metabolites from the 8MBGA-TMZres cell line conditioned media (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x02013;c</xref>). The top hit from GC-TOF-MS was the non-aminogenic amino&#x000a0;acid aminomalonate, an inhibitor of aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step of the protoporphyrin IX (PpI IX)/heme synthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

True to the heterogeneous nature of clinical GBM, the phenotypes displayed by these resistant cells were similar, but not identical. TMZ treatment no longer induced G2/M arrest in either of these cell lines, and both were markedly less responsive to BCNU, the previous standard of care for GBM. Both resistant cell lines also gained expression of the MGMT protein, which is responsible for removing one of the DNA adducts caused by TMZ treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">An important finding of the present study is that both TMZres models have severely impaired response to BCNU. For decades BCNU was the standard of care for GBM, and it is still a component of some second-line regimens. Findings from clinical studies examining the efficacy of BCNU in recurrent GBM post-TMZ treatment are inconsistent, with some suggesting BCNU remains active while others demonstrate no benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These TMZres cell line pairs may therefore also prove to be valuable resources for defining contexts in which BCNU is or is not appropriate second-line treatment, and for identifying other, more appropriate therapies for TMZ-resistant GBM.</p><p id="Par14">A key advantage provided by creating these resistant cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> as opposed to isolation from a resistant tumor is the ability to directly compare them to their respective sensitive parental lines. There was an increase in nuclear size in both resistant cell lines when compared with their parental cell lines. In the 42MGBA-TMZres cell line there was also a change in nuclear morphology which has been described in other GBM cell lines that have acquired resistance to TMZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This may be associated with stability of the resistant phenotype, as we observed that the 42MBGA-TMZres cell line resistant phenotype can be maintained without continuous TMZ treatment. However, the 8MGBA-TMZres cell line, which has not undergone nuclear structure reorganization, and showed two distinct populations with respect to metaphase spreads, regained partial sensitivity when cultured in the absence of TMZ.</p><p id="Par15">Increases in nuclear size can be driven by increased chromosome numbers or impaired transport of mRNA or proteins out of the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In these novel TMZ resistant models, we hypothesized that the increase in nuclear size was a function of retained chromosomes. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of TMZ, which induces a G2/M arrest in cells. Cells which escape TMZ-mediated cell cycle arrest and death have already replicated their DNA, and may therefore retain sister chromatids that were not able to separate during anaphase. Because both parental GBM cell lines were initially polyploid with distinct karyotypes, we assessed two different chromosomes &#x02013; 17 for the 8MBGA-WT and &#x02013;TMZres cell lines, and X for the 42MBGA-WT and &#x02013;TMZres cell lines &#x02013; as an indicator for chromosomal copy number alterations. Both TMZ resistant variants showed significant copy number gains. Of note, our chromosome 17 locus specific probe targets the <italic>STAT5</italic> gene, which has already been implicated as a pro-tumorigenic factor in GBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The increased copy number of the <italic>STAT5</italic> locus in the 8MBGA-TMZres cell line is consistent with previous work and suggests that the observed increase in nuclear size is at least partially attributable to an increase in chromosome number. Because chromosome 17 existed in multiple copies in the 42MBGA-WT cell line, we chose an X-centromeric probe to test chromosomal copy number changes in the 42MBGA-TMZres line. Again, we saw an increase in X-chromosome copy number in the 42MBGA-TMZres line, and an overall increase in the total number of chromosomes. While it can be energetically disadvantageous to increase ploidy, we hypothesize that, as for STAT5, there may be X chromosome genes that when duplicated give a proliferative advantage to these cells.</p><p id="Par16">Two major challenges in the clinical management of GBM, particularly after TMZ resistance has developed, are rapid tumor cell proliferation and widespread local migration or invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, these phenotypes are rarely displayed by the same cells, giving rise to the &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d; hypothesis to explain aggressive behavior and drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our novel <italic>in vitro</italic> models of TMZ-resistant GBM provide examples of both phenotypes. The 42MBGA-TMZres cell line did not exhibit any significant changes in migration, cytoskeletal structure, or cell size when compared to its parental cell line, but it did proliferate significantly faster. In contrast, the 8MBGA-TMZres cell line had a significantly increased migratory capacity, F-actin thickness, and overall cell size relative to 8MGBA-WT cells, but no accompanying increase in proliferation. These divergent alterations in basal growth rate and migratory capacity provide two unique models &#x02013; one adapting the &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; (8MGBA-TMZres) and the other the &#x0201c;grow&#x0201d; (42MBGA-TMZres) strategy of TMZ resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. There have been many hypotheses as to what determines the switch between &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d;, including mutational status, hypoxia, and influences of the surrounding cell secretome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Activation of the FAK and MAPK/ERK pathways have been shown to be differentially regulated between a &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;grow&#x0201d; phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, respectively. Others have also hypothesized that remaining cells from the &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; population lead to recurrence of GBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, more insight needs to be gained into potential common pathways between the &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d; phenotypes that could be used as therapeutic targets for both cell populations. Candidate strategies to revert &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; phenotypes could include inhibition of the integrin signaling axis, either through blockade of integrin engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or inhibition of FAK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, while MEK inhibition could suppress the &#x0201c;grow&#x0201d; phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These four cell lines are therefore valuable tools that can be used to provide important insight into the differential mechanisms of TMZ resistance.</p><p id="Par17">Acquisition of TMZ resistance was associated with a marked increase in the number of intracellular and extracellular vesicles in our models. While there are always potential limitations to studying metabolism in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting, Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the <italic>in vitro</italic> secretome can affect the &#x0201c;go or grow&#x0201d; phenotype of murine GBM cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore is it important to identify potential <italic>in vitro</italic> mechanisms that can be further extrapolated to <italic>in vivo</italic> models in the future. The increase in early endosome marker EEA1 expression is interesting, as others have shown EEA1 to interact directly with RRAD, STAT3, and EGFR to regulate EGFR&#x02019;s subcellular localization and resistance to TMZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Clinically, higher EEA1 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival. EGFR and its structural variants have been targeted extensively in GBM, but with limited success. We suggest further study of the mechanisms by which EEA1 contributes to the TMZ resistant phenotype could provide a new way to target EGFR by modifying its subcellular localization rather than activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In addition to an accumulation of early endosomes, we observed vesicles expelled into the media of the resistant cell lines. Others have shown that TMZ-resistant glioma stem cells release more exosomes than their sensitive counterparts, which was consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> created models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This was reflected in the putative increase of lipids from the LC-MS analysis. Another hit, indoleacetaldehyde, is a product of tryptophan metabolism, hyperactivation of which occurs in GBM and is thought to suppress anti-tumor immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Extracellular lipids, stearic and palmitic acid, were also found and validated in the GC-TOF-MS analysis along with citric acid. Citric acid is a key regulator of metabolism, and when increased in the cerebral spinal fluid of GBM patients confers a lower overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The top hit from GC-TOF-MS was the non-aminogenic amino acid aminomalonate. Aminomalonate inhibits aminolevulinic acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the protophorphyrin IX (PpI IX)/heme synthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. PpI IX pathway activity is exploited for intra-operative imaging in GBM, and has more recently been used for potential therapeutic gain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Defining the drivers of aminomalonate secretion in our TMZ-resistant models may be an important future strategy to identify when PpI IX pathway-based imaging and therapeutic approaches may be warranted.</p><p id="Par18">In conclusion, we present two novel TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines from both a male and female patient that have distinct proliferative and migratory capacities while sharing certain GBM resistance characteristics such as increased chromosome number, nuclear size, and vesicle formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
