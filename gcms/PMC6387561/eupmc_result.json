    "BACKGROUND:Evidence suggests that fatty acid receptor FFAR4 plays a tumor-promoting role in adipose tissue-adjacent malignancies, but its clinical relevance remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the clinical significance and underlying mechanisms of FFAR4 in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRPBC). METHODS:FFAR4 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in an exploration cohort of 307 breast cancer cases collected from two independent institutes. Two public breast cancer microarray datasets served as validation cohorts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to identify FFAR4 ligands in normal and cancerous breast tissues. Survival analyses were performed in all cohorts and designated molecular subgroups. Mechanistic studies were performed in vitro in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D. RESULTS:Aberrant FFAR4 expression and endogenous FFAR4 ligands were identified in breast cancer tissues, five FFAR4 ligands showed significantly elevated proportions in cancerous versus normal tissues. In the exploration cohort, FFAR4 was demonstrated as an independent prognostic factor for recurrences (HR: 2.183, 95% CI: 1.360-3.504, P = 0.001) and breast cancer-specific deaths (HR: 2.102, 95% CI: 1.173-3.766, P = 0.013) in HRPBC cases. In contrast, FFAR4 expression was not associated with prognosis in hormone receptor-negative cases. In the validation cohorts, FFAR4 mRNA levels were also observed to be associated with disease recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive cases, but not so in estrogen receptor-negative cases. FFAR4 activation by endogenous ligands and a synthetic ligand TUG891 significantly dampened tamoxifen's efficacy on HRPBC cells, whereas FFAR4 knockdown or antagonist AH7614 abrogated this effect. Furthermore, FFAR4-induced tamoxifen resistance was dependent on ERK and AKT pathways in HRPBC. CONCLUSIONS:Our results establish a novel role of FFAR4 and its ligands in the complicated interactions between tissue lipid profile and cancer biology. FFAR4 signaling confers tamoxifen resistance in HRPBC cell line and FFAR4 expression can serve as a prognostic biomarker for tamoxifen-treated HRPBC patients. FFAR4 may serve as a potential target for anti-breast cancer therapies, especially in endocrine resistant cases."
