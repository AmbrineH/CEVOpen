    "Aromatic ginger (Kaempferia galanga L) is native to India and believed to be originated in Burma. Despite substantial uses in a pickle and south-east Asian cuisines, aromatic ginger is chemically less studied than white and red ginger. Multi-directional investigations have been performed to evaluate chemical composition, nutritional values, ameliorative and protective potential of aromatic ginger (Kaempferia galanga) rhizome (KGR). Macro and micro components analysis confirmed that KGR contains protein, fiber, and high amount of essential minerals (potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium) along with appreciable amounts of iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, and nickel. The anti-proliferative potential of KGR evaluated nine human cell lines. We have evaluated the anti-proliferative potential of hydrodistillate, extract, and key compound isolated from KGR on nine human cancer cell line and also reporting the safety to normal peritoneal macrophage cells. The current study demonstrates the anticancer potential of the KGR on MDA-MB-231 and WRL-68 cells. Very likely, results can be extrapolated to an animal or human system. Ethyl p-methoxy cinnamate (EPMC) was responsible for inhibiting the proliferation action which varied in a tested cell by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The present study demonstrates KGR as safe and high energy value medicinal spices with chemo-preventive action, without toxic phytochemicals, and tolerable other anti-nutritional factors."
