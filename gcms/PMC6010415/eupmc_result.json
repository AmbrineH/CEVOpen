    "We examined the repellent, insecticidal, and anti-oviposition activities of the ethanol-extracted essential oil of Gardenia jasminoides against Bemisia tabaci and Tetranychus urticae adult and nymph stages under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. We used GC-MS to identify the main chemicals in the essential oil and selected four compounds, squalene, ethyl linoleate, n-hexadecanoic acid and 9-12-octadecadienoic, to evaluate their activity on whiteflies and mites. In the laboratory experiments, the essential oil of G. jasminoides showed maximum effects in fumigation against whitefly adults (81.48%) and contact toxicity against whitefly nymphs (46.44%), adult mites (49.81%), and mite nymphs (66.46%). In the greenhouse experiments, squalene showed maximum repellency against whitefly adults at 24 (89.59%) and 48 h (84.76%), whitefly nymphal toxicity at 24 (80.08%) and 48 h (77.28%), and mite toxicity at 24 (78.74%) and 48 h (73.86%). The essential oil showed maximum anti-oviposition activity against whiteflies at 24 (63.58%) and 48 h (59.56%) and toxicity to mite nymphs at 24 (82.45%) and 48 h (57.14%) in the bioassay. The essential oil had LC50 values of 2396.457, 2844.958, 56,990.975 and 21,468.619 against whitefly adults, whitefly nymphs, mite adults and mite nymphs, respectively. G. jasminoides and its major chemicals may effectively control the whiteflies and mites."
