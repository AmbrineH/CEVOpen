Whether n-6 and n-3 PUFA oppositely contribute to the development of chronic disease remains controversial. By using transgenic mice capable of synthesizing PUFA to eliminate confounding factors of diet, we show here that alteration of the tissue n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio leads to correlated changes in the gut microbiome and fecal and serum metabolites. Transgenic mice able to overproduce n-6 PUFA and achieve a high tissue n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio exhibit an increased risk for metabolic diseases and cancer, whereas mice able to convert n-6 to n-3 PUFA, and that have a lower n-6/n-3 ratio, show healthy phenotypes. Our study demonstrates that n-6 PUFA may be harmful in excess and suggests the importance of a low tissue n-6/n-3 ratio in reducing the risk for chronic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Kanakaraju Kaliannan et al. show that converting omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA) to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) improves overall metabolism in mice, lowering risks for liver cancer.

These diseases are multi-factorial in nature, but their prevalence coincides with the unbalanced increase in dietary omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and decrease in omega-3 (n-3) PUFA in today&#x02019;s diets, suggesting that&#x000a0;there may be differential effects of n-6 and n-3 PUFA on the development of chronic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recent research has focused mainly on overall PUFA levels or on the level of n-3 PUFA alone, ignoring the important interplay between n-6 and n-3 PUFA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. It is challenging to clarify the differential effects of n-6 and n-3 PUFA or varying n-6/n-3 PUFA&#x000a0;ratios due to the confounding factors of diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As a result, studies on PUFA show inconsistent results about the role of PUFA in health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is critical to establish a model that allows us to accurately study the importance of the n-6/n-3 ratio and the potential dangers of excess n-6 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Chronic low-grade inflammation, often caused by metabolic endotoxemia, is considered to be a critical contributor to the development of many modern chronic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Metabolic endotoxemia can often result from gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown that diet is an important modulating factor for both metabolic endotoxemia and chronic low-grade inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, identifying dietary components that can optimize the gut microbiome is important for research into chronic disease prevention and treatment.</p><p id="Par5">The transgenic FAT-1 mouse model was previously developed in our lab to understand the importance of the PUFA ratio in health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This mouse model contains the <italic>FAT-1</italic> gene from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, encoding an enzyme that can endogenously convert n-6 to n-3 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This conversion enables FAT-1 mice to markedly increase their tissue levels of n-3 PUFA and decrease the levels of n-6 PUFA correspondently, resulting in a significant reduction of tissue ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA, close to 1:1, with no need for additional supplementation of PUFA in the diet. This unique feature allows for studies to be performed without the confounding factors of diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and these mice have been widely used over the last decade to study the beneficial effects of increased tissue levels of n-3 PUFA and balanced (reduced or low) tissue ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA (i.e. changing a ratio from a high to a relatively lower one) on various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently, we have also developed another mouse model (FAT-2) to evaluate the effects of increased tissue levels of n-6 PUFA and a high tissue ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA on the development of chronic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. FAT-2 mice were engineered to expresses the <italic>FAT-2</italic> gene from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are capable of converting monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) into n-6 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, FAT-2 mice have increased tissue levels of n-6 PUFA and a high tissue ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. With the availability of FAT-1 and FAT-2 mice and crossbreeding, we were able to create a compound transgenic mouse model, namely the FAT-1+2 mouse, carrying both <italic>FAT-1</italic> and <italic>FAT-2</italic> genes that can endogenously synthesize both n-6 and n-3 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, FAT-1+2 mice exhibit high tissue levels of both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, with a balanced ratio of close to 1:1. Consequently, we have four genotypes of mice for use: wild type (incapable of producing essential fatty acids), FAT-1 (producing n-3 fatty acids), FAT-2 (producing only n-6 fatty acids), and FAT-1+2 (producing both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These mice exhibit four distinct PUFA phenotypes varying in the quantity of PUFA and n-6/n-3 ratio, even though they are all fed an identical diet with no need for dietary supplementation with corresponding PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, use of these transgenic mice allows us to evaluate the authentic effects of different quantities and ratios of PUFA without the confounding factors of diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, we used these unique transgenic mouse models in combination with multi-omics technologies to determine the impact of varying amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA and their ratio on metabolic conditions and chronic disease development. We found that mice with varying n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios resulted in distinct gut microbiota, fecal and serum metabolites, and susceptibilities to cancer and certain metabolic disorders. FAT-2 transgenic mice with elevated n-6 PUFA levels and the highest n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios showed the most unfavorable metabolic conditions and the highest rate of liver cancer. These adverse health outcomes were largely prevented in FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice, which can convert n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA and have a balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. Our multi-omics study of host&#x02013;microbiome interactions therefore uncovers differential health impacts of n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA and suggests an important role for a low tissue n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in reducing the risk&#x000a0;of chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>n-6/n-3 ratio influences the development of chronic disease</title><p id="Par7">The PUFA phenotypes of the four groups of mice used in this study (wild type, FAT-2, FAT-1, and FAT-1+2 mice) have been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The tissue n-6 and n-3 PUFA content in these mice was further validated and shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Although the levels of total PUFA in the tissues are the same between wild type and FAT-1 and between FAT-2 and FAT-1+2, the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio is higher in the wild type and FAT-2 groups compared to FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>, e, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">l</xref>). Specifically, the FAT-2 mice had the highest tissue n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">p</xref>), followed by the wild type mice, with the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice having the lowest and most balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">p</xref>). The FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups had a similar n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, while the FAT-1+2 group had a higher quantity of PUFA compared to the FAT-1 group (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>, e, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">l</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">We examined whether the four genotypes differed in the development of metabolic disorders, including metabolic endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, obesity, fatty liver, glucose intolerance, and cancer. The body weight of adult mice at the age of 8 months differed between the genotypes, with the highest body weights for the FAT-2 group and the lowest body weights for the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), while the food intake was not different between the groups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Usually, the difference in fat mass observed during the young age would diminish when they become older. We thus followed up the phenotype of these mice for a prolonged Western diet exposure. Even after 16 months, the FAT-2 group maintained the highest body weight and the FAT-1+2 maintained the lowest body weight (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). Increased body weight was correlated with increases in body fat mass, especially abdominal fat (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>) in the 16-month-old mice. To assess the cause of this persisting body weight difference between groups, especially between FAT-2 and FAT-1+2, we investigated energy metabolism at the age of 16 months. As shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, FAT-2 mice spent less energy than FAT-1+2 and FAT-1 mice in the dark and light phases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d, e</xref>), together with lower CO<sub>2</sub> production (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f, g</xref>) and O<sub>2</sub> consumption (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2h, i</xref>). The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was unaltered (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2j, k</xref>). Moreover, it is notable that this difference in the energy expenditure was not due to a difference in physical activity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2l, m</xref>). Furthermore, morphological analyses of the adipose tissue showed that the size of adipocytes was much larger in white adipose tissue from the FAT-2 and wild type groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), and whitening of brown fat (an increase in large adipocytes) was observed in the brown adipose tissue of the FAT-2 and wild type mice, compared to the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Likewise, glucose tolerance testing showed that FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice exhibited better glucose tolerance than the wild type and FAT-2 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Oil red O staining revealed striking differences in lipid accumulation among the four groups; specifically, the FAT-2 mice exhibited more lipid accumulation (5+ grade based on the number and size of stained fat droplets) and fatty liver development compared to their wild-type littermates (3+ grade), while lipid accumulation was markedly reduced in the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice (1+ grade) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Furthermore, estimation of hepatic fibrosis showed a dramatically higher collagen deposition (cirrhosis) in the FAT-2 liver specimens compared to the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Strikingly, when the animals were sacrificed at the age of 16 months, we discovered that most of the FAT-2 mice (86%) had developed liver tumors (nodules and irregularities), while only very few mice from each of the other groups had liver tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i, j</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate an increased risk for metabolic disorders and cancer in the groups with a high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, especially the FAT-2 mice that have the highest tissue level of n-6 PUFA, compared to the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups with a balanced (lower) n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Tissue omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio influences the development of metabolic disorders and cancer.

Notably, we found that there was a striking difference in the Enterobacteriacea and Bifidobacteriacea between wild type and FAT-2 mice versus FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f,&#x000a0;g</xref>). Relative quantification of bacterial groups by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was in accordance with these findings (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d, e</xref>). There were no differences between groups in the &#x003b1;-diversity measures (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f&#x02013;j</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio can affect gut microbiota composition. In particular, FAT-2 mice with an increased n-6/n-3 ratio exhibit greater abundance of Enterobacteriacea and depleted Bifidobacteriacea; in contrast, FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice with a balanced (lower) n-6/n-3 ratio exhibit enriched Bifidobacteriacea and reduced Enterobacteriacea.

The relative abundance of fecal metabolites was distinctly clustered by the four genotypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Abundance analysis of fecal metabolites linked with specific metabolic and pathological pathways showed distinct patterns among the four genotypes, as shown by the heat map in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. In particular, a number of metabolite markers of gut dysbiosis, inflammation and chronic disease (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) were elevated in FAT-2 mice and depleted in FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c&#x02013;n</xref>). For example, levels of 1-methylnicotinamide (a marker of gut dysbiosis), cysteine and histidine (markers of increased intestinal permeability), lactate and spermidine (markers of intestinal inflammation), choline and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (markers of atherosclerosis), and gamma-glutymyl peptides (markers of liver injury) were relatively higher and indolepropionate (IPA) (which can reduce intestinal permeability) was lower in FAT-2 mice compared to the other genotypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c&#x02013;n</xref>).

This challenges many current dietary guidelines issued by governmental or health organizations, including the United States Dietary Guidelines (2015&#x02013;2020), which recommends increasing intake of PUFA in general (mainly n-6 PUFA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">We present a unique model for nutritional intervention studies to reliably elucidate the relationship between n-6/n-3 ratio and chronic disease by integrated multi-omics measurements of a series of inter-related biomarkers. Biomarkers including lipidome (profiles of fatty acids and their metabolites), gut microbiota, and metabolic endotoxemia (elevated Enterobacteriacea to <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> ratio, serum LPS/LBP/gut permeability markers), inflammatory markers (e.g. TNF-a, IL-6, CRP), microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g. TMAO), host metabolomics, and pathological parameters can be accurately used for this model. Our unique genetic approach using transgenic mice allowed us to eliminate the confounding factors of diet (e.g. different types of diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and the choice of control diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>) affecting gut microbiota composition and metabolite production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Dietary modification is conventionally used to investigate the effects of different fatty acid profiles on gut microbiota and chronic disease development. However, this method is problematic since the diets used between study groups may contain not only different fatty acids but also variations in impurities, flavor, calories, or other components, as confounding factors that complicate interpretation of results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Our model demonstrates the authentic effects of absolute amounts of n-6 and n-3 PUFA, total PUFA, and n-6/n-3 PUFA&#x000a0;ratios in a single study. Given the fact that the Western diet consumption is associated with the imbalanced tissue n-6/n-3 ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, our preclinical results provide evidence that balancing the n-6/n-3 ratio would be more important for better health outcomes. Whereas increasing the total PUFA consumption by only increasing the intake of n-6 PUFA resulted in adverse health outcomes with FAT-2 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), this was not the case for FAT-1+2 mice because of their lower n-6/n-3 ratio, although both groups showed similar total PUFA. Likewise, increasing the total PUFA intake might not provide additional benefits when a balanced n-6/n-3 ratio is achieved because FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice showed similar healthy outcomes even though the FAT-1 mice have lower total PUFA than FAT-1+2. Similarly, although the total PUFA was the same between wild type and FAT-1 mice, lowering the n-6/n-3 ratio by elevating the n-3 PUFA (FAT-1 mice) resulted in better health outcomes. Overall, our results provide evidence that a balance between n-6 and n-3 PUFA is critical for good health and suggest that tissue n-6/n-3 ratio may be an important health biomarker. In this context, excessive intake of n-6 PUFA might be associated with adverse health outcomes and a simultaneous increase in n-3 PUFA consumption to balance the n-6/n-3 ratio is needed for good health.</p><p id="Par19">In addition to the uniqueness of the mouse model, the other strengths of our study are highlighted as follows. Firstly, integrated multi-omic analyses is a powerful tool because the true power of our study design comes from the ability to examine results across the different omics levels to provide an integrated systems picture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Secondly, network-based analytical approaches have the potential to help disentangle complex higher-order microbe&#x02013;microbe, microbe&#x02013;metabolite and microbe&#x02013;host interactions, thereby broadening the applicability of microbiome research to personalized medicine and public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, understanding host&#x02013;microbe interactions is critical during times of disease, and balanced host&#x02013;microbe interactions are necessary for maintaining homeostasis.</p><p id="Par20">Our results showed a marked increase in LPS-producing and/or pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g. Proteobacteria) and reductions in LPS-suppressing and/or anti-inflammatory bacteria (e.g. <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>) observed in FAT-2 mice result in elevation of endotoxemia and inflammation. In support of this key observation, we found elevated microbial functions related to LPS biosynthesis and related proteins in the FAT-2 mice. Chronically altered changes in the gut&#x02013;liver axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and its role in the development of metabolic endotoxemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and chronic low-grade inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> have been shown central to the development of chronic disease such as obesity, metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Increased LPS production due to alterations in LPS-related gut bacteria and/or gut barrier function lead to the development of metabolic endotoxemia and associated chronic low-grade inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Recent studies have shown associations between markers of metabolic endotoxemia (LBP and sCD14) and systemic inflammation (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) in subjects with obesity and metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Likewise, increasing evidence suggests that the presence of endotoxemia is of substantial clinical relevance to patients with HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In this context, decreasing the abundance of LPS-producing bacteria is a key mechanism for the reduction of metabolic endotoxemia, chronic low-grade inflammation, and the occurrence of chronic disease in the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice with a balanced n-6/n-3 ratio. A recent study has shown that male FAT-1 mice fed high-fat diet for 6 weeks at young age showed a lean phenotype associated with higher energy expenditure than wild-type counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In the present study, the sustained increase in fat mass and eventually body weight observed in FAT-2 mice could be partially due to their lower energy expenditure, which may be another mechanism underlying the body weight gain in FAT-2 mice. The altered energy homeostasis (lower energy expenditure, CO<sub>2</sub> production and O<sub>2</sub> consumption) in the FAT-2 mice with elevated tissue n-6/n-3 ratio could be associated with impaired browning process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and altered intestinal endocannabinoid system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, this assumption warrants further investigation.</p><p id="Par21">The altered gut microbiota-derived metabolites (GM-DMs) and their translocation to the liver and systemic circulation have been shown to have a role in metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In our study, several fecal (e.g. indolepropionate) and serum (e.g. ursodeoxycholate) GM-DMs, which have been shown in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), were altered in the FAT-2 mice and these alterations were prevented in the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 groups. Notably, increased abundance of TMAO-producing bacteria (e.g. Erysipelotrichaceae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and Enterobacteriacea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>) was associated with elevated levels of fecal and serum TMAO (associated with insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and modified by fat inatke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>) were observed in FAT-2 mice. In addition to LPS and GM-DMs, alterations in the non-microbiota host-derived metabolites may also play a role in the disease phenotypes of FAT-2 mice. A recent study identified 40 serum metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> that were elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis subjects. Interestingly, the same 40 metabolites (e.g. UDCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and 12-HETE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>) were higher in the FAT-2 mice and lower in the FAT-1+2 mice. Taken together, unfavorable host&#x02013;microbe interactions played a major role in the development of metabolic phenotypes and liver cancer due to imbalanced tissue n-6/n-3 ratios in the FAT-2 mice with the exact opposite situation occurring in the FAT-1 and FAT-1+2 mice. This conclusion is further supported by our high-throughput integrated multi-omic and host&#x02013;microbiome interaction analyses. Modules derived from these analyses clearly showed a microbe&#x02013;microbe, microbe&#x02013;metabolite, and metabolite&#x02013;metabolite interactions, and a strong association between tissue n-6/n-3 ratio with LPS-related bacterial groups, several fecal and serum metabolites involved in chronic disease and markers of metabolic endotoxemia and chronic low-grade inflammation. This is important because a &#x0201c;module&#x0201d; in the network is an elementary unit of any biological network and biologically important when considered in isolation. Overall, our results indicate the necessity of having a balanced tissue n-6/n-3 ratio to create the balanced microbiome essential for the management of chronic disease.</p><p id="Par22">The Western human diet has shifted dramatically in the last few decades from the diets that were consumed during most of human evolution. Key changes include increases in saturated fat, carbohydrates, and n-6 PUFA, and a decrease in n-3 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. As a result, many people today have an n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio that favors n-6 PUFA by as much as 20:1. Historically, this ratio would have been closer to 1:1, and the discrepancy may contribute to modern health problems, including chronic diseases such as cancer. Our discovery that elevating tissue n-3 PUFA status and lowering the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio can improve the gut microbiome profile, create a balanced host&#x02013;microbiome interaction landscape, and suppress metabolic endotoxemia, and chronic low-grade inflammation provides two major implications for dealing with modern health problems. First, it supports the hypothesis that an excess of n-6 PUFA and deficiency of n-3 PUFA in the Western diet can contribute to modern chronic&#x000a0;diseases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Second, it provides a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases by reducing the tissue n-6/n-3 ratio through n-3 PUFA supplementation and reducing n-6 PUFA intake. Further, the methodologies and results of our preclinical study emphasize the potential importance of reducing n-6 PUFA intake and/or increasing n-3 PUFA intake, rather than just increasing the total PUFA intake mainly through foods rich in n-6 PUFA.</p><p id="Par23">In order to bridge the gap to clinical implementation, our results should be validated with future large-scale multi-omic analyses of the human gastrointestinal microbiome through nutritional intervention studies. Our work suggests that nutritional policies should be established that emphasize the differential effects of n-6 and n-3 PUFA rather than simply replacing saturated fatty acids with PUFA for the prevention of chronic disease. Finally, we acknowledge that a limitation of our study is the use of only male mice; future research in female mice is necessary because our findings obtained with male mice may not be translational to females.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, integrated multi-omic analyses of our unique transgenic animal models uncover the tissue omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid imbalance as a critical risk factor for chronic disease. Decreased tissue n-6/n-3 ratio leads to beneficial changes in gut microbiota and gut microbial functional pathways. Subsequently, the positive alterations in fecal metabolite production and microbiota-derived and non-microbiota-derived serum metabolites suppress the development of metabolic endotoxemia and chronic low-grade inflammation and thereby reduce the risks for chronic diseases and cancer. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of a low tissue omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio for maintaining good health and for the management of chronic diseases and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Generation of transgenic mice</title><p id="Par25">As we described previousy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that can endogenously synthesize all essential fatty acids.

Tissue samples were ground to powder under liquid nitrogen and total lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Fatty acids were then methylated by heating them at 100&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;h under 14% boron trifluoride (BF3)-methanol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and hexane (Sigma-Aldrich).

Fatty acid standards (Nuchek Prep, Elysian, MN) were used to identify peaks of resolved fatty acids, and area percentages for all resolved peaks were analyzed using GC ChemStation Software (Agilent). The fatty acid C23:0 (20&#x02009;mg per sample) was used as an internal standard to calculate the amount of each fatty acid measured. After identifying the genotype and phenotype, the FAT-2 mice were mated with wild-type C57BL6 mice to create the F1 generation. The F1 generation was then backcrossed with wild-type C57BL6 mice at least five times in order to verify that the gene is transmittable as well as to establish a pure background, so that FAT-2 lines could be maintained with a significant phenotype.

Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers. Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e., non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled matrix samples.

In this method, the extract was gradient eluted from the same afore mentioned C18 column using methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA, and 0.01% formic acid and was operated at an overall higher organic content. Another aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion optimized conditions using a separate dedicated C18 column.

The hardware and software foundations for these informatics components were the LAN backbone and a database server running Oracle 10.2.0.1 Enterprise Edition.</p><p id="Par50"><italic>Data extraction and compound identification:</italic> Raw data were extracted, peak-identified, and QC processed using Metabolon&#x02019;s hardware and software. These systems are built on a web-service platform utilizing Microsoft&#x02019;s.NET technologies, which run on high-performance application servers and fiber-channel storage arrays in clusters to provide active failover and load-balancing. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. Metabolon maintains a library based on authenticated standards that contains the retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (<italic>m/z)</italic>, and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) on all molecules present in the library. Furthermore, biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library &#x000b1;10&#x02009;ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The MS/MS scores are based on a comparison of the ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. While there may be similarities between these molecules based on one of these factors, the use of all three data points can be used to distinguish and differentiate biochemicals. More than 3300 commercially available purified standard compounds have been acquired and registered into LIMS for analysis on all platforms for determination of their analytical characteristics. Additional mass spectral entries have been created for structurally unnamed biochemicals, which have been identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). These compounds have the potential to be identified by future acquisition of a matching purified standard or by classical structural analysis.</p><p id="Par51"><italic>Curation:</italic> A variety of curation procedures were carried out to ensure that a high quality data set was made available for statistical analysis and data interpretation. The QC and curation processes were designed to ensure accurate and consistent identification of true chemical entities, and to remove those representing system artifacts, mis-assignments, and background noise. Metabolon data analysts use proprietary visualization and interpretation software to confirm the consistency of peak identification among the various samples. Library matches for each compound were checked for each sample and corrected if necessary.</p><p id="Par52"><italic>Metabolite quantification and data normalization:</italic> Peaks were quantified using area under the curve. For studies spanning multiple days, a data normalization step was performed to correct variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Essentially, each compound was corrected in run-day blocks by registering the medians to equal one (1.00) and normalizing each data point proportionately. For studies that did not require more than one day of analysis, no normalization was necessary other than for purposes of data visualization. In certain instances, biochemical data may have been normalized to an additional factor (e.g. cell counts, total protein as determined by Bradford assay, osmolality, etc.) to account for differences in metabolite levels due to differences in the amount of material present in each sample. The analysis yielded a dataset comprising compounds of known identity (referred to as biochemicals) with 557 named biochemicals in serum and 553 named biochemicals in feces. Metabolic pathways were visualized using the Cytoscape plugin in the Metabolync Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.metabolon.com">https://portal.metabolon.com</ext-link>).

The primary advantage of PCA and PLS-DA models is that the leading sources of variability in the data are modeled by new variables that explain most of the variance in the data and, consequently, in their associated scores and loadings, allowing the visualization and understanding of different patterns and relations in the data. PCA is able to find low-dimensional embedding of multivariate data in a manner that optimally preserves the structure of the data. PCA transforms variables in a data set into a smaller number of new latent variables called principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated to each other and which account for decreasing proportions of the total variance of the original variables. Each new PC is a linear combination of the original variation such that a compact description of the variation within the data set is generated. Observations are assigned scores according to the variation measured by the PC with those having similar scores being clustered together.</p><p id="Par53">PLS-DA is a classification technique that encompasses the properties of partial leastsquares regression with the power of discriminant analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.
