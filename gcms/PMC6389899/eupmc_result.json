    "WRINKLED1 (WRI1), an APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor, has been shown to be required for the regulation of carbon partitioning into fatty acid (FA) synthesis in plant seeds. To our knowledge, the regulatory network of WRI1 remains unknown in Prunus sibirica kernel (PSK), a novel woody biodiesel feedstock in China. In this study, based on the transcriptional data from developing oilseeds of multiple plant species, we identified 161 WRI1-coexpressed genes using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The major portion of WRI1-coexpressed genes was characterized to be involved in carbon partitioning and FA biosynthesis. Additionally, we detected the temporal patterns for oil content and FA compositions in developing PSK from two different germplasms (AS-85 and AS-86). The major differences between the two germplasms are higher contents of oil and C18:1 in AS-85 than in AS-86 at a mature stage. Thus, AS-85 and AS-86 are desirable materials to explore the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of oil accumulation in Siberian apricot. Expression analysis in developing PSK of AS-85 and AS-86 indicated that the expression level of P. sibirica WRI1 (PsWRI1) was closely correlated to accumulative rate of oil. Also, the comparison of expression profiles in developing PSK of AS-85 and AS-86 displayed that the pPK, E1-Î±, E2, TAL, BC, MCMT, BS, SAD and FAD2 have a high correlation with PsWRI1. Transient expression showed that ProSAD- and ProBS-driving GUS expression showed no substantial difference between AS-85 and AS-86, while the expression level of ProPEPCK-AS-85 driving GUS was significantly higher than that of ProPEPCK-AS-86 driving GUS. Additionally, transient co-transformation with PsWRI1 revealed that ProSAD, ProPEPCK and ProBS activity could be specifically up-regulated by PsWRI1. This regulatory mechanism of PsWRI1 may create a steep concentration difference, thereby facilitating carbon flux into C18:1 accumulation in developing PSK. Overall, all our findings imply a versatile mechanism of WRI1 to optimize carbon allocation for oil accumulation, which can provide reference for researching the woody biodiesel plants."
