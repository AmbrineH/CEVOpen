    "Current methods for the authentication of essential oils focus on analyzing their chemical composition. This study describes the use of nanofluidic protein post-translational modification (PTM) profiling to differentiate essential oils by analyzing their biochemical effects. Protein PTM profiling was used to measure the effects of four essential oils, copaiba, mandarin, Melissa, and turmeric, on the phosphorylation of MEK1, MEK2, and ERK1/2 in the MAPK signaling pathway; Akt and 4EBP1 in the pI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; and STAT3 in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in cultured HepG2 cells. The gain or loss of the phosphorylation of these proteins served as direct read-outs for the positive or negative regulatory effects of essential oils on their respective signaling pathways. Furthermore, protein PTM profiling and GC-MS were employed side-by-side to assess the quality of the essential oils. In general, protein PTM profiling data concurred with GC-MS data on the identification of adulterated mandarin, Melissa, and turmeric essential oils. Most interestingly, protein PTM profiling data identified the differences in biochemical effects between copaiba essential oils, which were indistinguishable with GC-MS data on their chemical composition. Taken together, nanofluidic protein PTM profiling represents a robust method for the assessment of the quality and therapeutic potential of essential oils."
