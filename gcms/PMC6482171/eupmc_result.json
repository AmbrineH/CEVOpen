    "The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century for the researchers to combat and in turn search for novel targets which could lead to the development of effective and sustainable therapies. Inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence of bacterial pathogens is an emerging approach to address the challenges related to bacterial infections. To suppress the virulence and biofilm formation by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECOH), we developed stable nanoemulsion (NE) of Gaultheria fragrantissima Wall. essential oil's (EO) bioactive compounds, viz., eugenol (E-NE) and methyl salicylate (MS-NE) that showed significantly higher anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate without affecting ECOH planktonic cell growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that E-NE and MS-NE reduced the expression of genes, including curli, type I fimbriae, Shiga-like toxins, quorum sensing, and ler-controlled toxins, which are needed for biofilm formation, pathogenicity, and attachment. E-NE and MS-NE loaded hydrogel coatings showed superior anti-biofilm activity against ECOH on glass, plastic and meat surfaces as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate loaded coatings. Conclusively, NE-loaded hydrogel coatings could be used in combating ECOH infection on solid surfaces through anti-biofilm and anti-virulence strategies."
