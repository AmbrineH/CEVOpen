is a natural product that serves as the starting material
for antimalarial active pharmaceutical ingredients in artemisinin
combination therapy treatments. As an agricultural product, its supply
and price may be subject to disruptive price fluctuations. In response
to these concerns about the impact of price fluctuations on efforts
to treat and even eradicate malaria, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
funded a cooperative effort to develop an alternate source of artemisinin.
The results of the research toward semisynthetic artemisinin (SSA)
represent a technical tour de force encompassing development of fermentation
processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> to produce artemisinic acid
(AA, <bold>1</bold>) and a chemical conversion to artemisinin developed
by Sanofi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> (<bold>3</bold>). In the semisynthetic
approach (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>),
AA produced by fermentation is reduced selectively to dihydroartemisinic
acid (<bold>2</bold>) (DHAA), which is then converted to artemisinin
via a chemical conversion which mimics the synthetic pathway used
by the plant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup></p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2018-00974e_0003" id="gr3" position="float"/></fig><p>Despite the technical
merit of SSA, it has not been widely adopted,
as the market for plant-derived artemisinin has stabilized at prices
lower than those attainable by this approach. There are several reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> of alternative approaches to the chemical conversion of AA to artemisinin
that may provide savings relative to the process described by Sanofi.
Current estimates put fermentation-derived AA cost at $50&#x02013;75/kg.
Conversion to DHAA results in costs for this intermediate in the $100&#x02013;150/kg
range. For the SSA approach to be competitive with plant-based artemisinin,
the cost of these inputs needs to be much lower. Current prices for
natural artemisinin average around $150/kg. With current conversion
methods, this means that DHAA needs to be at most $75/kg. Because
this does not seem to be possible from current fermentation routes,
alternative sources should be explored.</p><p>There are numerous claims
of high levels of AA and DHAA in <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> leaves giving rise to suggestions
that the plant could be a viable source for these starting materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> These claims largely trace back to unpublished
observations by Haynes &#x00026; Vonwiller,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> who claimed that AA was present at levels as high as 2.6%, 10-fold
higher than artemisinin. They did not provide data to support this
assertion. This claim of high levels of AA has often been cited but
never substantiated. In more recent reports, Ferreira<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> showed levels of &#x0223c;0.2% DHAA and &#x0223c;0.02% AA in leaves
containing 1&#x02013;1.2% artemisinin. These results are consistent
with most unpublished observations, including our own. The discussion
was reignited by a report by Suberu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> suggesting that DHAA is present at 5% by weight in leaves. Larson
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> countered this with their survey
of a large number of <italic>A. annua</italic> varieties
and found levels of artemisinin, DHAA, and AA consistent with those
reported by Ferreira. Although there may be points in the plant life
cycle where AA and DHAA concentrations exceed those of artemisinin,
these points occur before maturation when the total mass of leaves
is low. The DHAA and AA levels never exceed the final concentration
of artemisinin at maturity. Given the low levels of artemisinin precursors
in leaves, it would be counter-productive to modify current extraction
procedures to recover these compounds at the expense of artemisinin.</p><p>It may however be useful to consider recovering DHAA and AA from
waste streams from the existing extraction processes. Given that DHAA
and AA are not observed in isolated artemisinin, it is likely that
they will appear in the waste from the extraction process. The objective
of this work was to ascertain if sufficient levels of DHAA and AA
are available for recovery from the extraction process of <italic>A. annua</italic>. If this were found to be true, an economically
feasible recovery process would be sought.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Analysis
of Leaves and Waste Process Streams</title><p>Details
of artemisinin extraction processes are often proprietary but most
follow a general approach of extraction with a nonpolar solvent such
as hexane or petroleum distillate, use of an inert solid such as silica
to remove waxy materials, rudimentary chromatography to remove baseline
materials, and isolation by crystallization. The order of these operations
may vary along with the solvents and solid supports used. These variations
might affect the amounts of DHAA and AA present in the process streams
and impact their isolation.</p><p>Botanical Extracts-EPZ Ltd (Athi
River, Kenya) kindly provided samples of leaves and their artemisinin
extraction process stream for analysis. Using higher performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), it was found that leaves from three different
batches contained artemisinin between 1.0 and 1.4 wt %, together with
0.24 to 0.36 wt % of DHAA and 0.04 to 0.09 wt % of AA. Similar results
were obtained for these samples using analysis conditions described
by Suberu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The levels of DHAA,
AA, and artemisinin are in general agreement with those reported by
Ferreira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p><p>Analysis of the supplied
spent leaf demonstrated that the extraction
protocol used by Botanical Extracts-EPZ Ltd effectively extracts &#x0003e;95%
of the available acids and artemisinin. Samples from various points
in the extraction process were analyzed with the goal of determining
if there is an optimal point in the process for the isolation of DHAA
and AA. Although DHAA and AA were observed at a few points in the
extraction process, it was found that mother liquors from the final
artemisinin crystallization steps contained the highest levels of
both DHAA and AA (5.0 and 0.9%, respectively). This represents an
opportunity to recover these acids without altering the current artemisinin
extraction process. Mother liquor concentrates are typically discarded
after solvent recovery.</p><p>The corresponding materials obtained
from Guilin Pharmaceutical
Company represent a different geographic source of <italic>A. annua</italic>, as well as a different extraction process.
It should be expected to contain different impurities as well. Characterized
only as &#x0201c;final waste,&#x0201d; its precise stage in the extraction
process is less clear. It was denser than the Botanical Extracts-EPZ
material, possibly because of a more thorough solvent removal prior
to shipment. The process waste from Guilin contained 8.0 wt % DHAA
and 0.88 wt % AA.</p><p>Bionexx in Madagascar provided two distinct
samples of &#x0201c;extraction
waste&#x0201d;. The extraction protocol used by this firm reportedly
differs from most extractors because it is described in general terms
as using a supercritical fluid. The two samples, identified as polar
and nonpolar wastes, were indeed thin oils rather than the gummy solids
presented by other extractions. The Bionexx nonpolar waste was found
to contain 6.4 wt % DHAA and 1.4 wt % AA.</p><p>Differences in DHAA
and AA content may derive from differences
in extraction processes or from differences in <italic>Artemisia</italic> strains extracted. The levels are however high enough to justify
efforts to develop a straightforward procedure to recover these acids
from waste material.</p><p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> shows an
HPLC chromatogram of a methanol extraction of waste material from

Peaks eluting at 6.4 and 7.2 min were verified to be DHAA and AA,
respectively, by coinjection of the reference material and liquid
chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS). Note that
the response factor for AA is 2.5&#x000d7; that of DHAA; therefore, its

at 5.4 min. A similar profile was observed in other waste samples.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>HPLC chromatogram

observation of the unknown component eluting at RT 5.4 min by HPLC

reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> that this compound can be converted into
artemisinin. The impurity is fairly cleanly extracted into heptane
and might provide an additional source of starting material for artemisinin
synthesis if these reports are correct. A sample of a heptane extraction
was concentrated to an oil for further identification work. Gas chromatography&#x02013;mass

Precursors from Process Waste</title><p>Our work toward recovering
DHAA and AA from the extraction process
waste material initially focused on solubilizing all material in water-immiscible
solvents, with the intent to take advantage of the ionizable nature
of the target compounds through acid/base partitioning. In attempts
to completely dissolve the process waste, heptane and toluene gave
emulsions or incomplete dissolution, whereas tetrahydrofuran (THF),
2-methyl-THF, and methyl <italic>t</italic>-butyl ether gave clear
solutions at 0.5 g in 10 mL concentration.</p><p>Efforts to apply
acid/base partitioning from solvents able to effect complete dissolution
were not successful, as the acids would not partition cleanly into
aqueous base (0.1 N NaOH). There were problems with getting clean-phase
splits, and considerable rag layers were observed. Heptane partition
experiments with pure DHAA and AA dissolved in aqueous acid or base
also showed appreciable losses to an interfacial layer. Losses because
of rag layers were even greater with the provided extraction samples.
We subsequently discovered that adding methanol to the aqueous layer
(1:1 by volume) eliminated the rag layer without sacrificing extraction
efficiency.</p><p>We had previously observed that methanol extracted
most of the
available DHAA and AA while leaving behind large amounts of waxy material.
In hopes that cleaner phase splits would result by not solubilizing
this waxy material, extraction into methanol was further pursued.
Using 100 mL methanol per 5 g waste it was found that stirring at
55&#x02013;60 &#x000b0;C enhances extraction efficiency, and further,
that subsequent chilling of this extract precipitates remaining waxy
solids without loss of solubilized DHAA and AA.</p><p>Addition of
aqueous sodium hydroxide (1:1 by volume) to the filtered
methanol extract gives the desired mixture for partitioning against
heptane. This results in clear phase cuts, with DHAA and AA retained
in the lower aqueous layer as carboxylates. Subsequent acidification
of the aqueous phase with HCl then allows clean extraction of DHAA
and AA into heptane.</p><p>When this approach was applied to a sample
of Guilin process waste,
HPLC assay of the methanol filtrate indicated the bulk of the available
DHAA, and AA was solubilized from the initial waxy material. Chilling
of the methanol extract allowed the filtration of solubilized waxy
material to give a clear solution.</p><p>The methanolic filtrate was
diluted with an equal volume of aqueous
0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution, and the resultant mixture was extracted
with an equal volume of heptane to remove nonacidic components. The
peak identified as dihydro-<italic>epi</italic>-deoxyarteannuin B
extracts cleanly into this initial heptane phase (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.8b00974/suppl_file/ao8b00974_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>). The pH of the remaining
aqueous phase was then adjusted to &#x0223c;2 with 6 N hydrochloric
acid, followed by extraction twice with equal volumes of heptane.
Both DHAA and AA are effectively extracted into the heptane phase.
These heptane phases were combined and concentrated to a clear, light-yellow
oil.</p><p>The HPLC analysis of process streams samples (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.8b00974/suppl_file/ao8b00974_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>) showed excellent recovery
through this recovery procedure. The initial methanol filtrate contained
essentially all of the available DHAA and AA. No acid was lost to
the first heptane extraction of the basic aqueous methanol solution.
The first heptane extraction of the acidified aqueous layer showed
80&#x02013;90% of the available acids with the second heptane extraction
increasing this to recovery levels seen in the final oil. Recovery
from the Guilin process waste was quantitative for DHAA and AA. Similar
recoveries were observed from the Botanical Extracts-EPZ waste material.
Recovery values for AA were more variable because of the low levels
of this acid. Recoveries from the Bionexx extracts material was lower
at around 80%.</p><p>This recovery procedure provides excellent recovery
of DHAA and
AA from artemisinin extraction wastes in a straightforward process
that could be economical to perform at scale. Crystalline DHAA with
&#x0003e;99.0% purity was obtained by concentrating the second heptane
phase
to an oil followed by crystallization from cold acetonitrile. About
34% of the DHAA was lost to the mother liquors. Crystallization from
other solvents gave DHAA with lower purity and similar losses in the
mother liquors. Such losses would likely make this approach economically
untenable.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that high-purity DHAA might
not be required
for conversion to artemisinin. Kopetzki et al. reported that their
flow photochemistry approach is capable of converting DHAA in a similar
extract to artemisinin in good yield.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Salvaging AA may be more problematic, as most reduction processes
use metal catalysts that are likely to be poisoned by impurities present
in the final oil. Feth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> reported
the reduction of AA to DHAA using diimide, thus avoiding the need
for a catalyst. When we applied this chemistry to AA in the presence
of DHAA, we observed over-reduction of the DHAA resulting in a negative
yield. There is a promising recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> using this diimide in flow chemistry with controlled addition to
prevent over-reduction of formed DHAA. Despite this, it is unclear
whether it is worthwhile converting the low levels of AA present in
the waste material.</p><p>If the DHAA contained in a filtered methanol
extract of waste material
could be converted to artemisinin without further isolation, this
approach might be economically feasible. This assumes that coextracted
impurities do not interfere with the transformation and that this
could be accomplished on the site of the extraction facility. If additional
purification is required, it is unlikely to be worthwhile. It is not
unexpected that these impurities would not interfere in the transformation
to artemisinin as they are formed in the same transformation in the
plant.</p><p>It is worth noting that the side-products formed in the
conversion
of DHAA to artemisinin are similar in both the plant and chemical
reactors. This suggests that no enzyme is involved in the final biosynthetic
step of artemisinin synthesis. Artemisinin may just be the byproduct
of in vivo scavenging of singlet oxygen generated during photosynthesis.
Recent work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> demonstrated that chlorophylls
extracted from <italic>Artemisia</italic> leaves function
at least as well as other photosensitizers in ex vivo flow photochemical
conversion of DHAA to artemisinin. DHAA reacts with singlet oxygen
ultimately giving artemisinin and other related compounds. DHAA and
other sesquiterpenes act as antioxidants and defensive agents in the
plant. It is just fortuitous that artemisinin is useful to humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Procedures were developed to recover DHAA from
the waste from extraction
of artemisinin from plant sources. With the goal of providing DHAA
as a starting material for conversion to artemisinin, it is essential
to consider the conversion costs making for a maximum target price
of $75/kg DHAA. Although waste material may be considered free of
cost, the processing costs to isolate DHAA must be considered. This
can be carried out by using a rough estimate of facility usage coupled
with an estimate of a charge rate for this usage. Under described
conditions a kilogram of waste may be extracted into 20 L methanol,
chilled and filtered in 3 h. A typical usage rate for a pharmaceutical
plant is roughly $0.10 per hour per liter. Applying this rate gives
$6 to process 1 kg of waste material to this point. If the waste material
contains 8% DHAA processing to this point costs $75/kg DHAA. Clearly,
further purification of DHAA beyond this point is not economically
viable.</p><p>Conversion of DHAA from artemisinin extraction waste
material needs
to be able to utilize it in the presence of coextracted impurities.
Thus far, this has not been demonstrated. The described extraction
process was designed with the goal of obtaining purified DHAA, and
it is likely that the process can be modified to reduce processing
costs if the subsequent conversion of DHAA in the raw extract can
be demonstrated.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title><italic>A. annua</italic> Leaves and Extraction

temperature was set at 300 &#x000b0;C with an ESI voltage of 3000. Two
different HPLC conditions were used. A mobile phase of 25:75 acetonitrile/0.1%
ammonium hydroxide provided typical negative ionization, whereas 80:20
methanol/0.1% phosphoric acid allowed &#x0201c;wrong-way around&#x0201d;
ionization. In both cases, an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (2.1
