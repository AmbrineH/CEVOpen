Using a strain blocked in the enzymatic pathway downstream to adenine, we observed a non-linear dose-dependent growth inhibition. Both the staining with an indicative amyloid dye and anti-adenine assemblies antibodies demonstrated the accumulation of adenine amyloid-like structures, which were eliminated by lowering the supplied adenine levels.

However, a paradigm for the pathophysiology of inborn error of metabolism disorders significantly extended the original hypothesis, showing that at millimolar pathological concentrations, the single phenylalanine amino acid can form nanofibrillar structures in aqueous solution and neutral pH in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These nonproteinaceous assemblies exhibit typical apple-green birefringence and clear fluorescence signal upon Congo red staining when examined under cross-polarized light and fluorescent microscopy, intense fluorescence following thioflavin T staining, and cell culture cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Using electron microscopy, a fibrillar morphology of the phenylalanine assemblies was observed, showing physical properties characteristic of protein amyloids. As opposed to single crystals that show regular geometrical shapes consisting of flat faces, amyloid structures have a fibrillar morphology. Based on the similar characteristics to amyloid proteins, these nonproteinaceous assemblies were suggested to display &#x02018;amyloid-like&#x02019; properties.</p><p id="Par4">The notable toxicity of the assemblies was suggested to be associated with the neurological damage observed in non-treated patients suffering from the phenylketonuria (PKU) error of metabolism disorder, in which phenylalanine accumulates due to metabolic pathway alteration. Histological post-mortem staining of brain tissues of human PKU patients, as well as of PKU model mice, using specific antibodies raised against phenylalanine fibrils, demonstrated the specificity of the antibodies and the formation of metabolite amyloid-like assemblies in the disease state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Follow-up studies supported the notion that the single phenylalanine amino acid can form amyloid-like nanofibrillar structures, established the mechanism of oligomerization, and determined the ability of the phenylalanine assemblies to interact with phospholipid membranes, similar to protein amyloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, doxycycline, epigallocatechin gallate, and tannic acid (TA), known inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation, were shown to counteract both phenylalanine aggregation and cytotoxicity of the assemblies in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, the amyloid hypothesis was significantly extended by demonstrating that several other metabolites, including additional amino acids and nucleobases, could form such archetypical nanofibrils in vitro, displaying amyloid-like properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The alanine amino acid shows none of the above characterizations, as well as no toxic effect when added to cultured cells at high concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, differential flexibility properties might explain the resistance of alpha-phenylglycine, that differs from phenylalanine by the absence of an additional flexible carbon extension, to fibril formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, fibril formation and toxic effect are believed to occur due to structures formed by only certain metabolites.</p><p id="Par5">Inborn errors of metabolism, stemming from mutations resulting in enzymatic deficiencies in various metabolic pathways, can lead to the accumulation of substrates. Thus, for example, the required daily allowance (RDA) of phenylalanine for the general population may actually be toxic to individuals with PKU. Therefore, in the absence of strict dietary restrictions, PKU can lead to mental retardation and other developmental abnormalities. The recent extension of the amyloid hypothesis offers opportunities for both diagnostics, as well as therapy of these disorders. Specifically, inborn mutations in genes involved in the adenine salvage pathway in humans can lead to the development of several metabolic disorders as a result of the accumulation of adenine and its derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We have previously shown the formation of adenine amyloid-like structures in vitro. These assemblies displayed amyloidogenic properties, including the appearance of typical amyloid fibrils as demonstrated by electron microscopy, positive staining with amyloid-specific dyes, and notable cytotoxicity in cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, formation of the adenine structures was shown to be inhibited by amyloid-specific inhibitors in vitro and adenine assemblies could interact with a membrane model, similar to their proteinaceous counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Yet, analysis of the formation of amyloid-like assemblies by metabolites has so far been limited to in vitro studies. Thus, there is a genuine need for in vivo models for the formation of such assemblies in order to understand the biological relevance and the consequences of metabolite molecular self-assembly. Yeast can assist in revealing the core abnormal processes underlying multiple aspects of biomolecular aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The pioneering work of Susan Lindquist and coworkers, as well as follow-up studies, had established yeast as an excellent model for several amyloid-associated disorders, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, Huntington&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and prion disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and recently also type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, supporting the high relevance of this approach for further establishing the extended amyloid hypothesis. Expression of mutated genes involved in amyloid diseases in yeast was previously shown to result in a decrease in yeast growth rate, suggesting a toxic effect, similar to that observed in neurons. Furthermore, yeast offer an attractive platform by virtue of their genetic tractability, known homeostasis mechanisms, ease of manipulation and short generation time, facilitating screens and the development of agents for disease-modifying therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we established an in vivo model for the study of the self-assembly of adenine into amyloid-like structures. Our study provides a methodology for establishing additional yeast models that could most reliably mimic the metabolic state in inborn error of metabolism disorders, as the native metabolic pathways may be manipulated with no artificial introduction of genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>In vivo model for adenine accumulation and toxicity</title><p id="Par6">Purine biosynthesis pathways are crucial for the normal function of cells and are conserved between yeast and humans. Both the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzymes take part in adenine salvage in humans and mutations in their encoding genes can lead to the accumulation of adenine and its derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Mutation in APRT leads to the APRT deficiency and mutation in ADA leads to ADA deficiency. In budding yeast, the APRT and ADA orthologs (<italic>APT1</italic> and <italic>AAH1</italic>, respectively) are similarly involved in adenine salvage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Apt1 catalyzes the formation of AMP from adenine and Aah1 converts adenine to hypoxanthine. To reveal the importance of these two enzymes for cell growth, we generated an adenine salvage mutant by disruption of both <italic>APT1</italic> and <italic>AAH1</italic> genes. The double mutant showed a slow growth phenotype on synthetic defined (SD) medium containing a specific mixture of amino acids and nucleobases (SD complete), compared to the growth of the wild-type and both single mutants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Interestingly, removal of adenine from the medium dramatically improved cell growth of the metabolite salvage mutant and had no significant effect on any of the other strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). The double mutant showed a slow growth phenotype also when using a minimal medium containing glycerol as a nonfermentable carbon source (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thus, the reduced growth of the salvage mutant depended only on the presence of adenine, regardless of the carbon source, ruling out the possibility that the salvage mutant had lost respiratory competence due to mitochondrial mutations. To verify that the toxic effect observed for the salvage mutant is indeed due to disruption of the <italic>AAH1</italic> and <italic>APT1</italic> genes, single copy plasmids carrying both genes were introduced to the mutant cells by transformation. As shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, the restoration of the genes indeed rescued the growth phenotype.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sensitivity of the salvage mutant to adenine feeding. <bold>a</bold> Wild-type (WT), <italic>aah1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>apt1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>aah1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apt1</italic>&#x00394; strains were serially diluted and spotted on SD complete medium containing 20&#x02009;mg/L adenine (SD-com) or on SD medium without adenine (&#x02212;ADE). <bold>b</bold> Growth curves of WT and <italic>aah1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>apt1</italic>&#x00394; cells in SD media with or without adenine (ADE).

This is indeed an unusual phenomenon as in most cases (excluding mutations in transport systems) the absence of a given metabolite, rather than its presence in the physiological concentration needed for normal yeast growth, serves as a limiting factor of wild-type yeast growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This is analogous to the toxicity of normal metabolite concentrations observed in some inborn error of metabolism disorders, such as PKU and tyrosinemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, where the RDA for the general population is actually toxic to the affected individuals, due to accumulation of the metabolites in the absence of salvage. The effect indeed appears to reflect toxicity, as increasing adenine levels in the medium led to decreased cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>), similar to the toxic effect previously observed in in vitro cell culture studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the toxic effect on cell growth due to adenine accumulation is very similar to the outcome of protein amyloid expression in yeast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Non-linear response to adenine feeding</title><p id="Par8">The dose&#x02013;response curve of cell growth as a function of adenine concentration was fitted using a four-parameter logistic equation (4PL), producing a typical-sigmoidal shaped&#x000a0;curve, with no effect at lower concentrations and a sharp increase in the inhibitory effect upon reaching a critical concentration threshold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Thus, cell growth appears to be affected by adenine levels in a non-linear cooperative manner. This is consistent with the mechanism of nucleation-growth as observed in micelle formation (assembly above a critical micelle concentration, CMC) or the formation of amyloids by the assembly of protein monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Indeed, in vitro studies also showed non-linear self-assembly of adenine at different concentrations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Thus, we present in vitro as well as in vivo data regarding adenine accumulation at different concentrations and the possible correlation between the assembly mechanism of fibril formation and cellular growth. Our results imply that above a critical concentration, the favorable energetic state dictates the formation of the toxic assemblies, while at lower concentrations the metabolites are most likely at the normal physiological state.</p><p id="Par9">To quantify the intracellular concentrations of adenine, gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS) was used. Analysis of the cellular adenine concentrations under different conditions indicated that on SD media in the presence of the metabolite, adenine levels were indeed significantly higher in the salvage mutant as compared to the wild-type strain (&#x000d7;45 fold; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), suggesting a clear correlation between the feeding amounts of adenine and growth inhibition. Similarly, when not following a very strict diet, inborn error of metabolism patients have 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude higher concentrations of metabolites, as compared to the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Visualization of adenine accumulation by Raman imaging</title><p id="Par10">To detect the accumulation of adenine in vivo, we utilized Raman microspectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy coupled with microscopy has recently emerged as a promising tool to trace intracellular processes in vivo and was successfully used in yeast to follow glucose assimilation into intracellular components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Raman spectrum provides rich and highly specific chemical information and&#x000a0;thus intracellular molecular distribution can&#x000a0;be visualized at a sub-&#x003bc;m spatial resolution&#x000a0;by Raman microspectroscopy. Moreover, being a vibrational spectroscopic technique, label-free imaging could be performed, as it requires no exogenous dye probe. Space-resolved Raman spectra obtained at three different points in salvage mutant single cells (<italic>aah1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>apt1</italic>&#x00394;) in the presence of adenine showed Raman bands characteristic to proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>).

Additionally, we also observed a band at 724&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> corresponding to adenine ring breathing modes (Raman band of adenine in solid and solution forms are shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).
