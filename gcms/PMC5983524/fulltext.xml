Agarwood is one of the famous traditional medicine for sedative, carminative, and anti-emetic effects in China, produced from <italic>Aquilaria sinensis</italic>. The wild resources of <italic>Aquilaria</italic> spp. <italic>and Gyrinops</italic> spp. are coming to be endangered and has been placed in the Appendix II list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The natural formation of agarwood with high quality needs a few years or even decades after the tree is damaged by certain external factors, such as lightning strike, animal grazing, insect attack, or microbial invasion [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Along with the continuously decreasing supply of wild agarwood and in order to meet market demand, much effort has been devoted to agarwood production. In 2010, an effective technique called the whole-tree agarwood-inducing technique (Agar-Wit) was developed in our laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When Agar-Wit is used, Agarwood formation is mainly inside the trunk, but the surface of the trunk wood is not fully utilized. Of note, fungi have been found to play a certain role in promoting agarwood formation. Back in 1935, Burkill recognized that fungal infections to trees were the cause of agarwood formation [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 1952, Bhattacharya et al. reaffirmed there was a relationship between agarwood formation and fungal infections [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 1976, the researchers from Guangdong Institute of Botany reported for the first time that fungi infection back to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> led to the agarwood formation [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In 1998, Qi et al. reported that <italic>Menanotus flavolives</italic> can accelerate agarwood formation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2005, Subeham et al. inoculated <italic>Fusarium laseritum</italic> into the holes on the trunk of <italic>Aquilaria</italic> spp. trees and obtained agarwood one year later [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2011, Xu reported that <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. promoted agarwood formation one year after fungi inoculation [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 2017, the fungi of <italic>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</italic> which can promote agarwood formation was reported by the research [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Fungi above mentioned can induce agarwood formation, but a suitable process to inject the fungi into the trunk or branches of an <italic>Aquilaria</italic> tree to induce agarwood formation with high efficiency is to be identified. The most popular method that has been used is to punch holes into the trunk and then to subsequently inject fungi into the trunk. For example, Huang et al. punched holes of 0.4&#x02013;0.9 cm in diameter and 4 cm in depth, and agarwood formed six months after inoculation of <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic> suspension into these holes [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Guo et al. punched holes of 1 cm in diameter and 3 cm in depth into the trunk, inoculated the strains of <italic>Microsphaeropsis</italic> sp., <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp., and <italic>Lasiodiplodia</italic> sp. into the holes, and observed agarwood formation two months later [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Blanchette et al. drilled holes in the tree trunk and kept the wound open by putting a small piece of plastic pipe in the hole, and then inoculated natural fungus growing with CA-Kits [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Until now, all the fungi being tested for promoting agarwood formation have not been used widely in the agarwood production. The underlined causes may partially lie in the low efficiency and hard application, as well as the poor yield and quality of agarwood, thus produced. Here, the study reports a fungus with strong infection ability that accelerates the agarwood formation. Using the fungus, an efficient agarwood production method called Trunk Surface Agarwood-Inducing Technique (Agar-Sit) was also invented which realized agarwood formation on the trunk surface. This technique avoids severe damage to trees, and also allows for easy agarwood collection. Meanwhile, a considerably high yield and good quality of agarwood were available, along with the feasibility of repeated agarwood formation from the same tree.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials for fungi isolation</title><p>A 5 cm-diameter branch sprouting from the base of the trunk was cut off from an eight-year-old <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> tree for agarwood production in Yanfeng town, Hainan Provinces of China (N19&#x000b0;57.843&#x02032;, E110&#x000b0;34.134&#x02032; and 37 m above sea level). Three years later, a thick agarwood layer formed beneath the wounded interface. In order to harvest agarwood and isolate potential agarwood-promoting fungi, the agarwood-bearing branch was cut down. Five layers were spliced downstream the original cutting site, 1 cm thick each. For each layer, a rectangular chunk of 1.5 cm &#x000d7;1 cm was used for fungal isolation.

The sterilized samples were cut into small pieces using a cork borer, which were placed in 90 mm-diameter Petri dishes that contained potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (potato 200 g, glucose 20 g and agar 15 g in one liter) with 100 mg ampicillin l-1 to suppress bacterium contamination. Next, all the Petri dishes were placed in a light chamber at 12 h light/dark cycles at 28&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C. Five days later, new fungal colonies were monitored or picked out onto new PDA media every day, and this process lasted at least 2 weeks until all the fungi were separated as single colonies. Individual fungal colonies were picked from the edge with a sterile fine tipped needle and transferred onto PDA media.

For those fungi that did not sporulate, pore production by light culture had to be induced for about one month. The fresh Mycelia were inoculated into a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL liquid potato dextrose (PD) medium and cultured in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm/min for 7 days in darkness at 28&#x000b0;C.

invaded deeply into the trunk of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> was first reported and was capable of promoting agarwood formation. The fungus was applied to the originally invented Agar-Sit method which induced high-quality agarwood. The discovery of the isolate of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> was due to the observation that some wild fungi could enter the inner of wood and induce agarwood formation. So the study isolated the fungi from different layers from a special sample with microbial infection characteristics. The purpose of this study was to find suspicious fungi from different layers and confirm suspicious fungi can promote agarwood formation. Fortunately, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> were isolated and confirmed that it possesses strong infection ability to induce agarwood formation. <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> is a kind of wood-degrading microorganism belonging to white rot fungus, which often causes the death of crops [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As already reported, white rot fungus degrades cellulose and lignin of plant cells mainly through its highly efficient enzymatic system, including the activities of lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As agarwood formation is considered as a result of defense response when trees confront wounding, it may be assumed that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> wounds trees by biodegrading lignin, thus inducing defense responses of these trees. This agrees with the hypothesis that agarwood formation results from a tree&#x02019;s defense response to diverse damages, including mechanical wound, microbial invasion, and chemical stresses [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In order to induce agarwood formation, a quite number of agarwood-inducing fungi had been reported and many methods for the fungi had been used [<xref rid="pone.0198111.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198111.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Maybe because of the weak infectivity of those fungi, it was very difficult to penetrate thick wood to induce agarwood formation. When such fungi alike were inoculated into the holes drilled in the trunk of trees, the agarwood could only form in a very thin layer near the surface of holes. In addition, much wood was not efficiently used for agarwood formation when the method of drilling holes was used. Therefore, the prominent problem in innovating agarwood production is to find high-infectivity agarwood-promoting fungus and to explore corresponding high-efficiency fungi application method. Here, it was reported that the successful isolation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> spread not only in the agarwood layer but also in the healthy white wood layer beneath the agarwood layer. Therefore inducing agarwood formation when it was applied, it displayed high infectivity and could invade past the deep wood of the trunk. According to the characteristics of the isolate of fungus the research obtained, the novel fungus application method, Agar-Sit was invented. It could be used with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic>, as well as any other agarwood-promoting fungi. However, with respect to the available information, Agar-Sit is the best method for applying the fungi in agarwood induction. The major advantages of Agar-Sit are reflected in its promoting agarwood formation in the trunk surface so that it is very easy to collect agarwood also with the non-obligation to destroy the whole tree. Comparatively, high-quality agarwood could be efficiently obtained by using Agar-Sit and the high infectious isolate of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic>. In addition, Agar-Sit could be combined and used with Agar-Wit, the whole-tree agarwood-inducing technique, which the laboratory developed. It is now widely used in agarwood production. When the two methods were combined, agarwood formed both inside and on the surface of the trunk, increasing the yield.</p><p>Previous reports on agarwood production using fungus usually adopted digging holes method to load fungi cultures, fungi fermentation liquid or fungi powder. Due to the prominent invasive capability of the isolate of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic>, the study considered whether it could be used directly from the trunk surface of the wood because Agar-wit cannot use the trunk surface. Based on this the Agar-sit method was designed. The vital issue was regarding the method to maintain the fungus staying on the surface of the wood for certain time so as to ensure the fungus had enough time for propagation and invasion. First, a wound is placed on the surface of the trunk to facilitate fungal attachment. Then the medium is sprayed on the trunk which helps the growth of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic>. Finally, fungi is sprayed, fungi fermentation liquid or fungi powder.</p><p>The Agar-wit method that was invented earlier is being successfully and widely used presently. But a problem still exists, large parts of healthy woods are not efficiently used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198111.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The yield of agarwood can further be elevated, by combining Agar-Sit method with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> and Agar-Wit method. This way the wood can be used fully and the yield of agarwood can be elevated significantly. Although Agar-Sit can promote high-quality agarwood formation, the method of Agar-Sit with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>vinctus</italic> still can be improved, such as the shortening of setting time of the wound surface on the trunk, so that the fungi are easy to carry and so on.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198111.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Illustration of the Agar-Sit method.</title><p>Panel A: A bark was uncovered; Panel B: the vertical lines of grids (2 cm spacing) were made; Panel C: more than one piece of bark were uncovered in a single tree; Panel D: the horizontal lines of grids (2cm&#x000d7;2cm) were made with a knife.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198111.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198111.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The whole-tree agarwood-inducing technique (Agar-Wit).</title><p>Panel A: Agarwood induced by agarwood inducer; Panel B: Health wood.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198111.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers. 81673549, 81303312 and 81403055); Major Science And Technology Plan Project of Hainan Province (grant number ZDKJ2016004); Medical and Health Science and Technology Innovation Project (Major Collaborative Innovation Project) (grant number 2016-I2M-2-003); Science &#x00026; Technology Program of Hainan Province (grant number ZDXM2015059); &#x0201c;Ten Thousand Plan&#x0201d; -National High Level Talents Special Support Plan (grant number 99950534) and Natural Science Foundation of Hainan province (grant number 20168369).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0198111.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Taxonomical identification of agarwood-producing species</article-title>. <source>Nat Med</source>. <year>2005</year>; <volume>59</volume>: <fpage>104</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>112</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0198111.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Persoon</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Van Beek</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Growing &#x02018;the wood of the gods&#x02019;: agarwood production in southeast Asia</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Snelder</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lasco</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name>, editors. <source>Smallholder tree growing for rural development and environmental services: lessons from Asia</source>. <publisher-loc>Dordrecht</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Springer Netherlands</publisher-name>; <year>2008</year> pp. <fpage>245</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>262</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0198111.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Yagura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shibayama</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kiuchi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Three novel diepoxy tetrahydrochromones from agarwood artificially produced by intentional wounding</article-title>. <source>Tetrahedron Lett</source>. <year>2005</year>; <volume>46</volume>: <fpage>4395</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>4398</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0198111.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>ZH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name>. <article-title>Identification of conserved and novel microRNAs in <italic>Aquilaria sinensis</italic> based on small RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequence data</article-title>. <source>Gene</source>. <year>2012</year>; <volume>505</volume>: <fpage>167</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>175</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.072">10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.072</ext-link></comment>
