Here, we demonstrate that hydroxylated-PQ metabolites (OH-PQm) are responsible for efficacy against liver and sexual transmission stages of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The antimalarial activity of PQ against liver stages depends on host CYP2D6 status, whilst OH-PQm display direct, CYP2D6-independent, activity. PQ requires hepatic metabolism to exert activity against gametocyte stages. OH-PQm exert modest antimalarial efficacy against parasite gametocytes; however, potency is enhanced ca.1000 fold in the presence of cytochrome P450 NADPH:oxidoreductase (CPR) from the liver and bone marrow. Enhancement of OH-PQm efficacy is due to the direct reduction of quinoneimine metabolites by CPR with the concomitant and excessive generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to parasite killing. This detailed understanding of the mechanism paves the way to rationally re-designed 8-aminoquinolines with improved pharmacological profiles.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Primaquine (PQ) is a widely used anti-malaria drug, but its mechanism of action is unclear.

Research into the elusive PQ mode of action has mainly focused on the identification of the biochemical basis for its side effect of hemolytic toxicity in patients with G6PD deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Earlier studies led to the identification of OH-PQm, generated from hepatic phase I metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, as potential culprits for toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The most relevant species in this context include the 5-hydroxy (5-HPQ) and 5,6-dihydroxy (5,6-DPQ) primaquine metabolites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These species are unstable, undergoing spontaneous oxidation and producing the corresponding quinoneimine forms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, PQQI, 5-quinoneimine, and 6OHPQQI, 6-hydroxy-5-quinoneimine) with concomitant generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>; quinoneimine metabolites can then be reduced back to the hydroxylated form, leading to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation. However, their reduction potential is likely to be very negative, limiting the pool of possible intracellular reductants with a sufficiently low reduction potential to donate electrons. In proof-of-concept studies using the strong reducing enzyme, ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) from spinach (note the <italic>E</italic><sub>m,7</sub> known for the ferredoxin oxidised/reduced couple is ca. &#x02212;430&#x02009;mV), PQ quinoneimines were shown to be enzymatically reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>&#x02014;but despite intensive research efforts the exact enzyme(s) and metabolic pathway(s) involved in the process remain to be fully elucidated.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Structures of PQ and OH-PQm and their activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> liver stages and gametocytes. <bold>a</bold> Structures of compounds used in this study. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Dose dependent reduction in exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) numbers at day 3.5 post infection with NF54 sporozoites in YEM (poor metaboliser, black line) and NON (extensive metaboliser, dashed blue line) hepatocyte lots. <bold>b</bold> Primaquine (PQ). <bold>c</bold> 5-hydroxy-primaquine (5-HPQ). <bold>d</bold> 5-quinoneimine (PQQI). <bold>e</bold> 5,6-dihydroxy-primaquine (5,6-DPQ). <bold>f</bold> 6-hydroxy-5-quinoneimine (6OHPQQI).

The need for CYP2D6 metabolism to generate key OH-PQm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> supports the assumption that these metabolites contribute to drug efficacy; however, hitherto there has been no direct demonstration of the link between these metabolites and anti-parasitic activity. Any explanation of PQ action needs to address the exquisite selectivity against dormant and active liver stage parasites and the ability of very low drug doses and subsequent low systemic exposures to kill gametocyte stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

By assessing parasite viability in the presence or absence of metabolic conversion we show that OH-PQm full cidal potential requires further enzymatic catalysis. We identify the CYP2D6 redox partner, cytochrome P450 NADPH:oxidoreductase (CPR), as required for OH-PQm to exert full gametocytocidal activity, independently of CYP2D6 status. We also show that OH-PQm activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> liver stage development is comparable or better than PQ and confirm a dispensable role for CYP2D6 activity. Finally, we substantiate the critical role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in anti-parasitic activity and propose a CPR-mediated biochemical model to account for PQ and OH-PQm mechanism of action. These data answer long-held questions of why PQ displays parasite stage-specific activity and why PQ displays transmission blocking activity at such low doses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Influence of CYP2D6 on PQ antimalarial liver-stage activity</title><p id="Par6">To explore the activity of PQ and OH-PQm against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> liver stage development, we used an advanced in vitro model that consistently mimics liver physiology and supports complete maturation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> extra-erythrocyte forms (EEFs) in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this in vitro system, human primary hepatocytes are organised into colonies surrounded by supportive stromal cells (Micropatterned coculture, MPCC) and infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (NF54 strain) sporozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To evaluate the role of CYP2D6 in PQ and OH-PQm activity, we selected two hepatocyte lots, NON and YEM. YEM is a low metaboliser based on genotype analysis, it has a variation in the CYP2D6 allele (*4/*4); this was confirmed by incubation with the CYP2D6 probe debrisoquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and measuring the metabolite 4-hydroxidebrisoquine by mass spectrometry (MS) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), confirming that the NON hepatocyte lot had twofold higher CYP2D6 activity than the YEM lot.</p><p id="Par7">OH-PQm were synthesised and used alongside PQ to directly assess the inhibition of EEFs development in dose-response experiments in the two hepatocyte lots. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, PQ activity against EEFs development strictly depended on hepatocyte CYP2D6 status, with&#x02009;&#x0003e;14-fold increase in the IC<sub>50</sub> measured in the YEM background (low metaboliser, PQ IC<sub>50</sub> 5.87&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) as compared to NON hepatocytes (extensive metaboliser PQ IC<sub>50</sub> 0.40&#x02009;&#x003bc;M). Conversely, all OH-PQm showed comparable IC<sub>50</sub> values in the two hepatocyte lots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c&#x02013;f</xref>), indicating that they act independently of CYP2D6 activity. It is interesting to note that all OH-PQm show similar potency against liver stages, comparable to that seen for PQ in the presence of extensive metaboliser hepatocytes. Taken together these results confirm that OH-PQm have direct killing activity against liver stages, supporting the hypothesis that they act downstream of CY2D6 activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PQ gametocytocidal activity requires hepatic metabolism</title><p id="Par8">We next explored the anti-gametocyte activity of OH-PQm and parental PQ through coupled in vitro metabolism-gametocytocidal assays. In these assays, we first incubated PQ and OH-PQm with human liver microsomes (HLM) to mimic bioactivation and then tested for gametocytocidal activity against a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7A transgenic strain, expressing luciferase specifically in the gametocyte stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, in an improved gametocyte viability assay GC-LUC (gametocyte luciferase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, PQ at 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, as expected, has minimal activity in the absence of any metabolic conversion (red histograms, (&#x02212;)HLM). When gametocytes were treated with OH-PQm, we observed little to moderate gametocytocidal activity, with only demethoxylated species, 5,6-DPQ and 6OHPQQI, able to reduce gametocyte viability to less than 50 % of solvent control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, (&#x02212;)HLM). After HLM metabolism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, blue histograms, (+)HLM), PQ gametocytocidal activity significantly increased, confirming that metabolic transformation is also required for gametocyte killing activity. Interestingly, a significant increase in potency was also observed for all OH-PQm after microsomal incubation (<italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for all pairs by Mann Whitney test, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In both the presence and absence of metabolic conversion, 5,6-DPQ showed the highest gametocytocidal potency (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These results confirm that PQ requires metabolic activation to elicit activity against both liver stage parasites and gametocytes; gametocytocidal activity of OH-PQm in the in vitro gametocyte setting is also shown to be HLM metabolism-dependent.</p><p id="Par9">To gain further insight, we directly assessed the role of CYP2D6 in OH-PQm activity against gametocytes by performing coupled in vitro metabolism-GC-LUC assays using CYP2D6-expressing baculosomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). As with HLM, CYP2D6 treatment potentiated OH-PQm gametocytocidal activity, with <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for 5,6-DPQ and 6OHPQQI, and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for all other compounds (Mann Whitney, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, OH-PQm are believed to be the terminal products of primaquine metabolism, so we further investigated these results by blocking CYP2D6 activity with the specific inhibitor paroxetine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) prior to drug in vitro metabolism and GC-LUC assays. Interestingly, CYP2D6 inhibition did not significantly affect OH-PQm gametocytocidal activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>, compare (+)2D6 and (+)2D6&#x02009;+&#x02009;Paroxetine); conversely, PQ activity decreased (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) as expected, reverting towards the levels observed in control samples without CYP2D6 (Mann Whitney, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Overall, these results show that OH-PQm activity is greatly enhanced by baculosome metabolic component(s), however, the observed potentiation is independent of CYP2D6 activity.</p><p id="Par10">These results prompted us to hypothesise that OH-PQm might be direct substrates of CPR, the CYPs redox partner required for electron transfer from NAPDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, an intrinsic (and required) component of HLM and CYP2D6 baculosome preparations. We therefore measured initial reaction rates of human recombinant CPR (huCPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> with PQ and OH-PQm (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and generated the apparent steady-state kinetics for each compound (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These analyses revealed that OH-PQm are indeed CPR substrates; conversely, kinetic parameters showed parental PQ to be a poor CPR substrate, as predictable from its structure, and hence it was not included in the subsequent analysis. We then tested the gametocytocidal ability of OH-PQm following incubation with huCPR and observed that, akin to HLM and the baculosome treatment, in the presence of huCPR only, the gametocytocidal activity of all metabolites was significantly increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for all compounds, Mann Whitney, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).
