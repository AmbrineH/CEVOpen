    "With obesity, the consumption of phenolic-enriched food additives as a part of traditional nutrition avoids the negative implications of eating high-calorie products. This study investigated the new herbal food additive, Phlojodicarpus sibiricus roots and herb, ubiquitously used in Siberia as a spice. Chromatographic techniques such as HPLC-DAD-ESI-QQQ-MS/MS and microcolumn HPLC-UV were the basic instruments for component profiling and quantification, and antiobesity potential was investigated using a differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes assay. We found that the roots and herb of P. sibiricus were high-coumarin-containing additives inhibiting triacylglycerol accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Forty-one phenolics were detected in P. sibiricus extracts, and 35 were coumarins, including 27 khellactone derivatives present as esters and glucosides. Total coumarin content varied from 36.16 mg/g of herb to 98.24 mg/g of roots, and from 0.32 mg/mL to 52.91 mg/mL in P. sibiricus preparations. Moreover, Siberian populations of P. sibiricus were characterised by a different HPLC-based coumarin profile. The most pronounced inhibiting effect on triacylglycerol accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was shown for dihydrosamidin (khellactone 3'-O-isovaleroyl-4'-O-acetyl ester), which was more active than other khellactone esters and glucosides. The results demonstrated that if used as a food additive Phlojodicarpus sibiricus could be a source of bioactive coumarins of the khellactone group with high antiobesity potential."
