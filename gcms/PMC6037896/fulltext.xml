Different microorganisms are associated with the disease. The capacity of pathogens to adhere to bovine mammary epithelial cells is associated with biofilm production which leads to antibiotic resistance. Research is now leading to search alternative control methods and medicinal plants constitute a natural, safe, effective and inexpensive option. <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> is an autochthonous medicinal plant of Argentina with multiple ethnobotanical properties. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of mastitis pathogens. The objective of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil of <italic>M. verticillata</italic> and limonene, on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm produced by pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis. Time kill assay and bacterial lysis were also determined. Furthermore, RAPD-PCR assays were performed to determine changes in bacterial DNA after EO and limonene exposition. Bacterial isolates were identified as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EC3 and EC9), <italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic> (BP5, BP6, and BP7) and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (EF1) by rRNA 16S sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS. All the strains were able to form biofilm. Addition of both lactose and sucrose did not affect biofilm production. MIC values for EO were 3.6 mg/ml for <italic>E. faecium</italic>; 0.9 mg/ml for <italic>E. coli</italic> (EC3), 14.5 mg/ml for <italic>E. coli</italic> (EC9), 1.8 mg/ml for <italic>B. pumilus</italic> (BP7), 3.63 mg/ml for <italic>B. pumilus</italic> (BP6) and 29.0 mg/ml for <italic>B. pumilus</italic> (BP7). MIC values for limonene were 6.6 mg/ml for <italic>B. pumilus</italic> (BP6) and 105 mg/ml for <italic>B. pumilus</italic> (BP5). These results demonstrated that EO was more effective than limonene, showing also bactericidal action against <italic>E. faecium</italic> (minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) = 29.0 mg/ml). This result was corroborated by time of death assay, observing a cell decrease after at 6 h, and then by bacterial lysis assay. Both EO and limonene affected mature biofilm of isolated strains. The results contribute to the study of EO and limonene which may serve as a therapy against bovine mastitis pathogens inhibiting the development of pathogenic bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>essential oil</kwd><kwd>limonene</kwd><kwd><italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic></kwd><kwd>inhibitory effect</kwd><kwd>bovine mastitis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100006668</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">PICT 2268/13</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5106"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine mastitis is a disease that causes large annual economic losses around the world. Different pathogens, classified as environmental and contagious, are associated with the disease as their ability to form biofilm leads to the advance of the infection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Reports showed that mastitis pathogens are able to form biofilms (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The establishment of the biofilm depends on the ability of the pathogen to adhere to bovine mammary epithelial cells. Biofilm is composed of a matrix that protects the cells from unfavorable conditions. Mastitis agents growing on biofilm are more resistant to antimicrobial agents (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Whereas antibiotic therapy has a positive impact on the udder health and milk production, it is not always effective and leaves residues with implications for human health. In addition, the ability of pathogens to live in the mammary gland forming biofilm, would be a potential source of persistent or chronic infection (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The ability to invade mammary epithelial cells and the intracellular survival of bacterial agents also has a role in the pathogenesis of persistent mastitis. Generally, these infections are difficult to treat (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). New approaches aim to generate and to increase immune protection in the sick udder during immunosuppressive periods, leading to a significant effect on resistance to infection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Alternative control methods are currently being sought, and medicinal plants can be a natural, safe, effective and inexpensive option for the treatment of this disease. <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> is an aromatic and autochthonous medicinal plant, native of Cordoba province, Argentina. It is one of the most used in folk medicine due to multiple ethnobotanical therapeutic properties (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In a previous study, we demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic> causing bovine mastitis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, we showed that EO and limonene also have antimicrobial effect on major mastitis pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli</italic> and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CNS) by disk diffusion assay (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The objective of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil of <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> and limonene, on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm produced by pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis. For this, minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericide concentration (MCB) were evaluated. Time kill assay and bacterial lysis were also determined. Furthermore, Random Amplified of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) assay was performed to determine changes in bacterial DNA after EO and limonene exposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Essential oil extraction</title><p>The EO (&#x003b4; = 0.929 g/ml) was obtained from the aerial parts of the plant by hydrodistillation according to Montironi et al.

Serial dilutions (1/2) were performed resulting in concentrations from 929 to 0.45 mg/ml and 840 to 0.41 mg/ml for EO and limonene, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial isolates</title><p>Fifteen milk samples were collected from cows, with subclinical mastitis, belonging to a dairy herd located in the central dairy region of Argentina 130 km away from Rio Cuarto city. The dairy herd was visited once during August 2016. The average herd size was 130 milking cows.</p><p>Samples were immediately refrigerated at 4&#x000b0;C and subjected to bacteriological analysis within 24 h of isolation. The isolates were cultured on blood agar plates with 5% bovine blood. Nine of them showed to have more than three different colony types, for which they were considered as contaminated according to Hogan et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Six samples, which had only one type of colony, were used in the present study. Then, isolates were cultured on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) (Britania) for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C and were presumptively identified based on colonial appearance, Gram stain reaction and catalase test. Isolates were maintained frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) (Britania) containing 20% glycerol.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial identification</title><p>Bacterial isolates were identified by conventional bacteriological methods and then confirmed by 16 rRNA -sequencing and additionally by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization&#x02014;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS system&#x02014;Bruker Daltonik MALDI Biotyper). 16 rRNA -sequencing was carried out by CERELA-CONICET sequencing service. DNA sequence information was searched with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) using the NCBI database. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed by Microbiology Laboratory of the Hospital Privado Universitario de C&#x000f3;rdoba service. In brief, a score of &#x0003c;1.700 was interpreted as no identification, 1.700&#x02013;1.999 indicated an identification to genus level, 2.000&#x02013;2.299 indicated a reliable identification of the genus and a probable species identification, and 2.300&#x02013;3.000 represented a high probability of species identification.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericide concentration assay</title><p>The microdilution method was employed to determine the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and MCB for EO and limonene against bacterial isolates according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards as described by Montironi et al.

A positive and a negative control were used in each run. Each isolate was assayed twice. Amplified products were determined by electrophoresis in 1.5% of agarose gel (Promega) in 0.5 X TBE at 90 V for 50 min. Gels stained with GelGreenTM were observed under UV light with MiniBisPRO gel documentation (BioAmerica, USA) and recorded. A 100 bp DNA marker (Promega) was used as a DNA molecular size standard. Band profiles were compared for similarity by visual inspection.</p></sec><sec><title>Biofilm assays</title><p>The ability of the bacterial isolates to form biofilm <italic>in vitro</italic> on an abiotic surface was determined using a sterile 96-well flat bottom polystyrene plate as previously described (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Previously, we have demonstrated the antibacterial activity of both EO and limonene on pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and coagulase negative staphylococci (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the present work, the inhibitory effect of the <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO and limonene was determined on mastitis pathogens able to form biofilm <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The chromatographic profile of EO was similar to a previously one reported by Montironi et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), with a predominantly pulegone-menthone chemotype.</p><p>All bacterial isolates identified in the present work correspond to environmental pathogens. Methods to control these bacteria sometimes are inadequate (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. are part of the normal flora of urogenital and gastrointestinal systems of mammals. They live in different niches as soil, natural waters and plants. <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> are cause of bovine mastitis (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Enterococcus group is important due to their ability to transfer conjugative plasmids (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) increasing the virulence by antibiotic resistance and leading to an important problem in the therapeutic treatment.</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> is found in organic materials as dung and bedding. The contact with organic matter and the milking process favor the infection of the udder. The proportion of E. coli as a causative agent in bovine clinical mastitis varies between countries. Bovine mastitis caused by <italic>E. coli</italic> can range from mild to moderate clinical signs and usually have a natural cure (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although, sometimes can produced a severe systemic disease.</p><p>However, <italic>E. coli</italic> strains may turn into chronic or recurrent infections and antimicrobial therapy with the use of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins becomes necessary. Nevertheless, both antibiotics should be used in animals destined for food under specific indications and after a microbiological diagnosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p><italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. comprise a varied group of bacteria disseminated in soil and water environment. They could infect the mammary gland when cows have access to pasture or through dirty infusions prior to intramammary treatment or dry cow therapy. Reports have showed that different <italic>Bacillus</italic> species including <italic>B. pumilus</italic> are able to cause infections (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nieminen et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) could identify <italic>Bacillus</italic> as the major organism in 23 mastitic milk samples where four of them were <italic>B. pumilus</italic>. Similarly, Amer et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) found <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. in 22.1% of isolates. The presence of <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. may risk the quality guarantee of milk products.</p><p>The results of MIC and MBC values showed that EO has antibacterial activity against clinical isolate bovine mastitis pathogens. MIC results showed that EO was able to inhibit the growth of all isolates tested in lower concentrations than limonene, demonstrating that EO was the most effective. Furthermore, in this study it was observed that concentrations of EO required to inhibit most of the Gram-positive bacteria were lower than those required to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, except for BP5 and EC9. On the other hand, limonene only had inhibitory action on Gram-positive bacteria tested. The results obtained were similar to those reported by other authors. Klancnik et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) determined MIC and MBC values of four extracts of rosemary (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) soluble in oil and water, against Gram positive (<italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp.) and Gram negative bacteria (<italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. and <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp.) showing that Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>Results of time of death assays are according to those observed in the MBC test, in which the bactericidal action of EO was observed on EF1 isolate. On the other hand, it was found that limonene, which had not shown bactericidal action in EF1 isolate, also failed significantly to decrease the bacterial population.</p><p>No difference was observed in bacterial count at different times assayed after the addition of EO and limonene in isolates where these compounds did not show bactericidal action.</p><p>Results of lysis production are in agreement with those of El Kolli et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) who reported that the absorbance relative values decreased significantly to 35.3% for <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 40% for <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> when the essential oil of <italic>Daucus gracilis</italic> was studied.</p><p>Variations in RAPD profiles were reported by Hamedo (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) who studied the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>. The authors found that differences in RAPD profiles could be due to DNA damage after essential oils addition, although the differences could also be attributed to the oligonucleotide used (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Changes in bands intensity were found in this study, suggesting no DNA damage.</p><p>In the present study, all the isolates were able to form biofilm, although the addition of carbohydrates did not affect biofilm production. Similar results were obtained by Moliva et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), who reported that addition of lactose (0.5 and 5%) in the culture medium did not promote biofilm formation in <italic>S. uberis</italic> isolates. However, results are in contrast to those reported by Abureema (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) who informed that that addition of lactose decreased biofilm formation and the addition of fructose, glucose, or sucrose increased biofilm formation by <italic>S. uberis</italic>.</p><p>Results obtained after addition of skim milk or &#x003b1;-casein are in accordance with those reported by Tasi et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), who demonstrated that <italic>S. uberis</italic> isolates grown in BME-UV1 complete medium with the addition of casein did not increase biofilm production. Likewise, Atulya et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) showed milk components did not affect biofilm formation in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates. According to the literature, several factors and additives can influence the formation of biofilm in the different genera of bacteria.</p><p>The effects of EO in inhibiting biofilm formation was determined. Addition of both EO and limonene significantly reduced the production of biofilm in all isolates tested as mature biofilm. Our results agree with other reports. Montironi et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) informed that EO and limonene were able to decrease biofilm production in <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic> isolates. Similarly, Aiemsaard et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) showed that limonene was able to inhibit biofilm formation as mature biofilm in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolates. Findings of the present study showed that higher inhibition percentages were obtained during biofilm formation, suggesting that both compounds were more effective at this stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results obtained in the present work contribute to the study of <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> EO and limonene.
