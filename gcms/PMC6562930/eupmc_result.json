    "Recent evidence supports the role of menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, in enhanced energy expenditure, thermogenesis and BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots in a TRPM8 dependent and independent manner. The present study was designed to analyse whether oral and topical administration of menthol is bioavailable at subcutaneous adipose tissue and is sufficient to directlyinduce desired energy expenditure effects. GC-FID was performed to study menthol bioavailability in serum and subcutaneous white adipose tissue following oral and topical administration. Further, 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with bioavailable menthol doses and different parameters (lipid accumulation, \"browning/brite\" and energy expenditure gene expression, metal analysis, mitochondrial complex's gene expression) were studied. No difference was observed in serum levels but significant difference was seen in the menthol concentration on subcutaneous adipose tissues after oral and topical application. Menthol administration at bioavailable doses significantly increased \"browning/brite\" and energy expenditure phenotype, enhanced mitochondrial activity related gene expression, increased metal concentration during adipogenesis but did not alter the lipid accumulation as well as acute experiments were performed with lower dose of menthol on mature adipocytes In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that bioavailable menthol after single oral and topical administration is sufficient to induce \"brite\" phenotype in subcutaneous adipose tissue However, critical dose characterization for its clinical utility is required."
