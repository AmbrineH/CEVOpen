The present study was designed to analyse whether oral and topical administration of menthol is bioavailable at subcutaneous adipose tissue and is sufficient to directlyinduce desired energy expenditure effects. GC-FID was performed to study menthol bioavailability in serum and subcutaneous white adipose tissue following oral and topical administration. Further, 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with bioavailable menthol doses and different parameters (lipid accumulation, &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>/<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; and energy expenditure gene expression, metal analysis, mitochondrial complex&#x02019;s gene expression) were studied. No difference was observed in serum levels but significant difference was seen in the menthol concentration on subcutaneous adipose tissues after oral and topical application. Menthol administration at bioavailable doses significantly increased &#x0201c;<italic>browning/brite</italic>&#x0201d; and energy expenditure phenotype, enhanced mitochondrial activity related gene expression, increased metal concentration during adipogenesis but did not alter the lipid accumulation as well as acute experiments were performed with lower dose of menthol on mature adipocytes In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that bioavailable menthol after single oral and topical administration is sufficient to induce &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype in subcutaneous adipose tissue However, critical dose characterization for its clinical utility is required. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>bioavailable</kwd><kwd>menthol</kwd><kwd>topical</kwd><kwd>TRPM8</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cells-08-00383"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure is a well-known aspect of the escalating prevalence of obesity throughout the world as a major nutritional challenge [<xref rid="B1-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Multiple factors like physical activity, dietary energy intake, basal metabolic rate, variation in environmental and body temperature are reported to influence energy expenditure [<xref rid="B3-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Enhancement of energy expenditure is one of the cardinal approach toward prevention of body weight gain and obesity [<xref rid="B5-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Numerous studies have reported the direct relation of cold exposure with non-shivering thermogenesis, followed by reduction in body fat [<xref rid="B6-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, clinical studies have also reported a vital link between cold-exposure and elevated energy expenditure through adaptive thermogenesis [<xref rid="B9-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies on adipocytes have also reported a relationship between cold receptor, TRPM8 and energy expenditure showing upregulated expression of UCP-1 and PGC-1&#x003b1; owing to TRPM8 activation [<xref rid="B10-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Complex physiology of the body makes it difficult to understand the exact mechanisms involved in energy expenditure. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily Melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) is a thermoreceptor present on the sensory nerve endings innervating the gut and skin [<xref rid="B11-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that senses non-noxious cold stimuli ranging from 18&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C, hence making it attractive target for cold mimicking. Involvement of TRPM8 dependent and independent pathways in mediating cold-induced energy expenditure is well reported. Recently we have published that anti-obesity effect of menthol, a TRPM8 agonist is mediated through glucagon dependent mechanisms particularly in adipose tissues [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Activation of TRPM8 receptors in the gut and skin by oral and topical administration of menthol leads to increase in serum glucagon levels, thus activating several downstream catabolic processes like glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, <italic>browning</italic> of white adipose tissue (WAT) and activation of energy expenditure markers in WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is supposedly an indirect action of menthol on adipose tissue wherein presence of TRPM8 is not essential. On the other hand, studies from our laboratory provide a strong evidence of significant expression of TRPM8 in undifferentiated (pre-adipocytes) and differentiated (adipocytes) 3T3-L1 cells suggesting its significance in adipogenesis [<xref rid="B15-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, TRPM8 is functionally expressed in rodent WAT [<xref rid="B16-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and BAT [<xref rid="B17-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as human WAT [<xref rid="B18-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alternatively, Ma et al. showed that the mouse BAT expresses TRPM8 receptor which upon activation by menthol, significantly increased the levels of p-PKA that further phosphorylates the transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), ultimately leading to enhanced UCP1 expression [<xref rid="B17-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, chronic dietary menthol increased thermogenesis, core body temperature, prevented diet-induced obesity and the abnormal glucose homeostasis in wild-type mice but not in UCP1<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> and TRPM8<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> mice [<xref rid="B17-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting TRPM8 receptor presence on adipose tissue is essential. Other studies also demonstrated the induction of white-to-brown-like phenotype through TRPM8 activation on human WAT [<xref rid="B18-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], summarizing the importance of the presence of TRPM8 on adipose tissue. </p><p>We hypothesize that different TRPM8 dependent and independent actions are contributing to the anti-obesity effect of menthol. The present study is an attempt to reveal whether topical (10% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) or oral (200 mg/kg, p.o.) administration of menthol used during acute studies in our previous work is bioavailable at subcutaneous adipose tissue (direct or through serum). Further, using in-vitro 3T3L1 cell line model, we attempted to study that whether bioavailable menthol at subcutaneous adipose tissue is sufficient to induce direct effect on &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>&#x0201d; and mitochondrial energy metabolism followed by enhanced energy expenditure effects. Furthermore, this manuscript endeavours to elucidate the presence of metal ions and their role in mitochondrial electron transport chain for significant elevation in energy expenditure owing to the menthol treatment. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-cells-08-00383"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>In our recently published manuscript, we have shown that the oral and topical administration of menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, has anti-obesity potential through a TRPM8 mediated glucagon dependent mechanism [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We provided evidence that TRPM8 mediated increase in serum glucagon and resultant increase in &#x0201c;glucagon machinery&#x0201d; in liver and adipose tissue is the signature of global shift from &#x0201c;fat storing state&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;fat burning state&#x0201d; in response to menthol administration [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During this work, we could suggest that the presence of TRPM8 receptor on adipose tissue is not required and the effect is selective to the glucagon receptor present on adipose tissue, hence we may say that it is an indirect action of menthol on adipose tissue. Also, recent paper by Clemmemsen and colleagues suggested that icilin, a TRPM8 agonist, effect on BAT energy expenditure cannot be explained by direct effects of icilin on adipocytes suggesting indirect actions to increase thermogenesis, likely through induction of sympathetic tone [<xref rid="B25-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the literature provide evidence for the presence of functional TRPM8 receptors on mouse and human adipose tissue, both white and brown [<xref rid="B16-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B26-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and adipocyte cell lines [<xref rid="B15-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These studies have mentioned that menthol induced increase in calcium influx in adipose tissue, mitochondrial activation and enhanced gene expression is mediated by TRPM8 receptors present on adipose tissue. The doses used in these studies are not based on the bioavailability profile of menthol, hence to establish a link between bioavailable doses of menthol and its functional effects on adipocytes is warranted. In this work, we tend to answer the question that at the acute doses showing anti-obesity effect [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], how much of menthol was bioavailable in serum and subcutaneous WAT. Also, whether this bioavailable menthol has any direct action on adipose tissue mediated through TRPM8 or others to induce energy expenditure. </p><p>Menthol was bioavailable to adipose tissues via both routes, oral and topical, through serum and direct absorption, respectively. Serum concentration of menthol reached a maximum at 30 min and 60 min respectively in the case of oral and topical administration; however, the total area reached under the curve/peak concentration was similar over a period of 2 h. The concentration of menthol in subcutaneous WAT reached a maximum at 30 min in the case of both oral and topical administration, with a maximum peak concentration significantly higher in the case of topical administration. We can easily argue that due to proximity of subcutaneous WAT to the site of application (topical), we see a significantly higher concentration. Menthol is lipophilic in nature and its partitioning in adipose tissue through topical application is significantly higher as compared to oral administration. We understand that partitioning in rodent adipose tissue is positively predictive of partitioning in human adipose tissue [<xref rid="B27-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], hence we suggest that this data has clinical utility through the direct effect of menthol on adipose tissue [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous literature also supports that L-menthol administration increases metabolic rate and thermogenesis in humans [<xref rid="B27-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the same study, authors have concluded that these effects are minor in oral administration as compared to topical administration due to faster metabolism of menthol (glucoronidation) and higher values of menthol glucuronides levels in blood [<xref rid="B27-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Summarizing, route of administration is important for the action of menthol on subcutaneous adipose tissue whereas in serum both oral and topical are similarly bioavailable. </p><p>Now, the question is whether bioavailable menthol after topical administration is enough to show the desired effects in adipose tissue, may be directly. We used pharmacokinetic based mathematical calculations to convert the bioavailable concentration of menthol in &#x000b5;M concentrations. We calculated that there is a range of concentration that is, 1 &#x000b5;M to 200 &#x000b5;M which will sufficiently cover the bioavailable amount of menthol on adipose tissues after topical administration. At these concentrations of menthol, 3T3L1 cells were viable as assessed by MTT assay. Also, at these doses there was no significant change in the accumulation of fat in differentiating adipose cells as shown by ORO staining. There was minor observation that some of cells were of smaller sizes. </p><p>There is lot of recent literature linking adipose tissue metal concentration with adipose tissue health, differentiation and &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>&#x0201d; of white adipose tissue. Specifically, in this regard, iron and copper has major significance [<xref rid="B28-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Iron and copper are essential components of the mitochondrial inner membrane complexes constituting the electron transport chain, therefore, the involvement of copper and iron in energy metabolism via their involvement in mitochondrial function (brown adipose tissue activation) is not surprising [<xref rid="B29-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].We performed metal analysis in differentiated adipocytes after treating cells with 1, 50 and 200 &#x000b5;M of menthol during differentiation. We selected few important one based on their importance to adipose tissue health (calcium and cobalt), adipose tissue inflammation (zinc, calcium and iron), mitochondrial activation (iron and copper), cell toxicity (cobalt), glucose utilization and transport (zinc and magnesium), initiation of &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype in white adipose tissue (iron and copper) for analysis [<xref rid="B28-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Menthol administration during differentiation significantly increased the levels of iron and copper at 1 &#x000b5;M whereas there was no significant change in the levels of magnesium, calcium and zinc. Cobalt concentration was significantly decreased in menthol treated differentiated adipocytes. However, at higher doses, 50 and 200 &#x000b5;M (data not shown) there was significant increase in the levels of iron, copper, zinc and magnesium whereas significant decrease in cobalt concentration with no change in calcium concentration. Looking into the metal concentration profile after menthol administration during differentiation of pre-adipocyte to adipocytes, we could suggest that menthol caused mitochondrial activation and increase in &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype. This data further supports our previous finding where we linked HFD, metal concentration in adipose tissue and menthol administration in an in-vivo model of obesity [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Based on metal concentration changes, we selected 1 and 50 &#x000b5;M (both 50 and 200 &#x000b5;M had similar metal concentration profile) for further gene expression studies. We studied the change in expression of energy expenditure and &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>&#x0201d; related genes in differentiating adipose tissue. By critically looking into the gene expression data we could understand that (a) at 1 &#x000b5;M, menthol administration significantly modulated these genes which is very well corroborated with the existing literature [<xref rid="B16-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], (b) these changes are not dose dependent, as at higher doses 10, 30 and 50 &#x000b5;M of the effect was reversed, although not dose dependently in some of the genes. Although we have not done these experiments but we may speculate that it may be due to desensitization of TRPM8 at this dose due to chronic presence of menthol during the process of adipogenesis. Further, we suggest that menthol at higher concentration might be acting through either TRPM8 dependent or independent mechanisms. There are numerous other actions of menthol which has link with energy expenditure phenomenon like its action of other excitatory or inhibitory channels, its role in TRPM8 independent increase in intracellular calcium, its role in oxidative effects [<xref rid="B36-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Importantly at higher doses menthol acts on TRPV3 [<xref rid="B37-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and TRPA1 channels [<xref rid="B38-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] which are closely related to adipogenesis, glucose utilization, hormone release and &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>.&#x0201d; This should be further explored to understand numerous actions of menthol. Based on these effects, we studied the effect of menthol on the mitochondrial activity complexes genes using PCR arrays (84 gene array). The effect on mitochondrial activation genes (approx. 40/84 genes) was positively correlated with energy expenditure genes, significantly higher at 1 &#x000b5;M and at 50 &#x000b5;M, it was decreased, which can be attributed to possible desensitization. In our previous study with TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, we did see the same phenomenon increase in &#x0201c;<italic>browning</italic>&#x0201d; at 1 &#x000b5;M and decrease at 50 &#x000b5;M, which was correlated to the combination of desensitization and increase in the levels of PPAR-&#x003b3; at higher doses [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We cannot rule out this kind of mechanism with menthol given that both these channels are calcium permeable and in homogenous matrix their agonists can show similar effects. At 1 &#x000b5;M, the changes in metal concentration, especially iron and copper, energy expenditure genes and mitochondrial complex genes are positively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00383-f006">Figure 6</xref>). We may say that at 1 &#x000b5;M menthol induces energy expenditure and mitochondrial activation, hence &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype in differentiating adipocytes. Linking our bioavailable menthol with &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype induction in differentiating adipocytes, we can suggest that even the topical dose less than 10%, may be 2% or 5% will be sufficient to induce this effect. </p><p>There are some limitations of this study. We could have included further experiments to have a clear picture of desensitization or any other mechanisms responsible for the decrease in effect at 50 &#x000b5;M. We are planning extensive studies along these lines to establish the role of TRPM8 (using pharmacological antagonism), other TRP channels (TRPV3 or TRPA1) or non-TRP channels (calcium channels, GABA/glycine receptors) in menthol&#x02019;s action. Further about the toxicity of menthol, there are number of human studies both as oral administration as well as topical application (patch) [<xref rid="B39-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Orally LD50 of menthol for rodents was observed approx. 3000 mg/kg of body weight and in canine it is approx. 1 g/kg in cats. The dose which we have used is quite less as compared to these [<xref rid="B42-cells-08-00383" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, further characterization will enable us to finalize the dose both topically and orally. Also, topical administration at multiple doses should be done to clearly establish cause and effect relationship. These studies will help us to develop topical menthol application as a therapeutic/preventive strategy against obesity and related co-morbidities. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-cells-08-00383"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Over all, summarizing this study, we have provided evidence that a single dose of menthol is sufficiently bioavailable to induce energy expanding &#x0201c;<italic>brite</italic>&#x0201d; phenotype in differentiating adipocytes which is dependent on TRPM8 at a lower concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00383-f007">Figure 7</xref>).
