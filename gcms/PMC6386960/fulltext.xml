These compounds are generally soluble in fats and poorly soluble in water. The major reason for the poor bioavailability of lipophilic natural compounds after oral uptake in humans is related to their reduced solubility in enteric water-based fluids, leading to an ineffective contact with absorbing epithelium. The main goal to ensure efficacy of such compounds is then creating technological conditions to deliver them into the first enteric tract as hydro-dispersible forms to maximize epithelial absorption. The present work describes and characterizes a new technological matrix (Lipomatrix, Labomar Research, Istrana, TV, Italy) based on a molten fats core in which Ascorbyl Palmitate is embedded, able to deliver lipophilic compounds in a well-dispersed and emulsified form once exposed to duodenal fluids.

Introduction</title><p>Natural compounds with specific reference to plant-derived active ingredients are raising interest as coadjuvant treatment of human diseases. In recent years, this trend has consolidated and many natural products have been introduced into the market under the label of nutritional supplements (NS) or foods with special medical purposes (SMPF). Despite the effective and charming marketing efforts of companies in selling these products following medical routes, the real efficacy of nutraceuticals is still a challenging issue because of the inadequate technological framework for enhancing and testing their bioavailability.</p><p>Lipophilic active ingredients belonging to the families of terpens, saponins, and vegetal oils are poorly absorbed by intestine mainly because of their low water solubility [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The interaction of active compounds with intestinal epithelium depends on the dissolution of molecules in water-based intestinal fluids [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A viscous mucopolysaccharides rich layer strictly adhering to the enteric epithelium and synthesized by specialized Goblet cells, called unstirred water phase (UWP), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f001">Figure 1</xref>) plays a pivotal role in regulating the absorption rate of active ingredients. Mucins, indeed, can interact with poorly-soluble molecules preventing their penetration [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Only water-soluble molecules or intimately water-dispersed molecules can readily diffuse through this layer, favoring an effective intestinal absorption [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to this premise, lipophilic terpens, such as boswellic acids (BA) extracted from the resin of <italic>boswellia</italic> genus trees, vegetal oils such as ginger oil (GO), <italic>Serenoa repens</italic> (Bartram) Small oil (SRO) and many others structurally similar compounds, are not effectively absorbed through the intestine even in the presence of bile salts [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Advanced technological matrices and delivery systems able of emulsifying lipophilic compounds or making them hydro-dispersible in the duodenal tract represent promising and effective strategies to improve their bioavailability.</p><p>Over the last decades, many companies and research institutes all over the world, tried to discover new performing technologies for enhancing natural compounds bioavailability, in some cases with great success as the patented technology Phytosome<sup>TM</sup>. Phytosome<sup>TM</sup> consists in a physical complexation of the active ingredient with a phospholipid enabling it to overcoming the enteric barrier, through an enterocyte membrane partitioning mechanism [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Many lipophilic plant-derived active principles have shown several biological relevant actions such as anti-inflammatory activity, enteric physiology restoring activity, and osteoarticular health promoting activity. However, their positive impact on human health is often limited by their poor solubility in aqueous systems, such as digestive fluids, so leading to low enteric bio-accessibility and bioavailability. Among them, SRO is a vegetal oil largely used in clinical practice to reduce symptoms of human prostatic hyperplasia (HPH). This oil that mainly works by inhibiting 5-&#x003b1;-reductase enzyme in prostatic cells and other androgen-sensible cells (sebaceous glands, hair follicles etc.) and by modulating expression of PSA and inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] is mainly composed of free fatty acids (80&#x02013;90% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>) and several phytosterols of which &#x003b2;-Sitosterol is the most represented. SRO has shown to be effective in reducing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as normalizing urine flow and reducing gland volume [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] at dosage of 320 mg of oil titrated at 80&#x02013;90% in fatty acids per day. Despite this efficacy and the ascertained prostatic tropism [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], not many data are available about its overall bioavailability in humans [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in particular no data are available about the role of peculiar delivery systems in improving it in humans.</p><p>Several technological forms such as nanoemulsions (NE), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) have been developed over the years to deliver insoluble or poorly bio-accessible molecules. On the other side, it must be pointed out, that the most part of natural compounds in form of oils and lipids-based formulations (LF) are mainly composed of triglycerides (TG) in form of emulsion, NE and SLN and for this reason they are partially digested by gastric lipase (GL) that cleaves TG generating free fatty acids (FFA) and diacylglycerols (DAG) [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This underestimated physiological phenomenon can dramatically affect the strategy of delivery of the molecules entrapped into these technological systems [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], partially or totally compromising their overall bioavailability.</p><p>To design a platform for increasing enteric absorption of lipophilic molecules, some requirements should be considered pivotal to achieve a good pharmaceutical delivery tool: (i) delivery systems able of retaining active ingredients in the stomach and releasing them in the duodenum; (ii) systems able of enforcing bile salts effect in forming fine emulsions or micellar dispersions of lipophilic molecules in the first duodenum; (iii) systems stable to enzymes and peculiar environment of the gastro-enteric tract (iii) systems able of entrapping lipophilic compounds, even in oily form, in a hydro-dispersible solid matrix powder to be easily transformed in capsules or tablets. Taking into consideration the aforementioned requirements, a new technological matrix has been designed and developed to enhance lipophilic compounds enteric absorption. This technological platform, named Lipomatrix (Labomar Research, Istrana, TV, Italy), contains a molten fats core aimed to entrapping lipophilic compounds into a gastric-refractory environment and to emulsify them once exposed to duodenal fluids. This technology is based on a peculiar association of low melting point fats such as mono and diglycerides of fatty acids (MDGFA) commonly used in food industry (E471), and ascorbyl palmitate (ASP), an ester of L-ascorbic acid (AA) and palmitic acid (PA) widely employed in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as antioxidant agent (E304) [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The precise chemical features of ASP and its peculiar mechanism of action as emulsifying agent and drugs absorption enhancer are fully described in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00669">Supplementary file section</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we present for the first time, the technology Lipomatrix and its efficacy in favoring apparent absorption and improving biological activities of SRO through human cell lines models. Beside this main goal, the apparent enteric permeability rate of an extract of Cranberry (Flowens<sup>TM</sup>) and Lycopene vehiculated in the mentioned technological matrix with SRO was assessed. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-00669"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis</title><p>DSC analysis was performed on MDGFA, mannitol, ASP, SRO, and Lipomatrix as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot1dot2-ijms-20-00669">Section 3.2.1.2</xref>, in order to evaluate possible changes in the crystallinity structure of the single raw material once embedded into the matrix and thereby speculate on its prevalent amorphous or crystalline state. In <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00669">Supplementary file</xref> DSC thermograms for the single substances are reported.</p><p>From the analysis of the Lipomatrix thermogram achieved in the range temperature of 25&#x02013;125 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00669">Supplementary file</xref>) it is possible to recognize a melting pick between 47 and 55 &#x000b0;C coherent with the melting point of MDGFA even though there is a significant decrease in the melting temperature pick of about 10 &#x000b0;C in respect to MDGFA alone. This could mean that some interaction phenomena of MDGFA with the other matrix components occurs during Lipomatrix preparation, with an overall increase of the amorphous structure respect to the pure raw material [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, comparing the overlapping thermograms of single components and Lipomatrix one in the range 30&#x02013;300 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it is possible to ascertain that both endothermic and exothermic picks of ASP completely disappear, while the only distinctive endothermic pick seems to coincide to Mannitol one. This fact could be explained considering the effective dissolution of ASP into the warmed lipidic matrix, according to the method of production, taking place to a prevalent amorphous or disordered crystalline phase molecular dispersion in the lipid matrix after cooling [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finally, the appearing of a well-shaped exothermic pick in the Lipomatrix sample around 220 &#x000b0;C, not recognized in none of the single components thermograms, could means that a sort of crystallization phenomenon occurs during the warming of the mix of lipophilic components and its further rapid cooling onto the Mannitol to get the final matrix. This phenomenon could be a further proof of an occurring structural change.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.2. In Vitro Assessment of Lipomatrix Containing <italic>SRO</italic> Gastric Resistance</title><p>One of the three aliquots (triplicate) coming from the gastric-resistance experiment with Lipomatrix powder containing SRO described in Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot4-ijms-20-00669">Section 3.2.4</xref>) and the one coming from the same experiment assessed on equivalent amount of not formulated SRO contained in two common gelatin soft-gel capsules have been collected and visually compared each other. An oily layer on the GSF surface is appreciable only in the beaker containing SRO from the soft-gel capsules, while no oily separation is appreciable in the beaker containing Lipomatrix powder. This provides a significant evidence that no SRO release occurred throughout the GSF during the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f003">Figure 3</xref>). </p><p>GC-MS analysis confirmed the absence of SRO derived fatty acids in GSF with Lipomatrix, suggesting that the technology guarantees a complete gastric resistance of SRO at full therapeutic dosage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The major explanation of this observed behavior is that ASP remains unionized in the stomach since low pH does not permit its enediolic ionization (pH &#x0003c; pKa) and this phenomenon contributes, in synergy with MDGFA, to the overall gastric-resistance of the powder (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00669">supplemental file section</xref> for more detailed explanation).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.3. In Vitro Emulsification </title><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.3.1. Emulsifying Behavior in FaSSIF-V2</title><p>The amount of Lipomatrix powder containing 640 mg of SRO has been dispersed in FaSSIF-V2 at 37 &#x000b0;C under moderate stirring conditions for 1 h, according to the method described in Materials and Methods section (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot1dot2-ijms-20-00669">Section 3.2.1.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot3-ijms-20-00669">Section 3.2.3</xref>). The same experiment has been conducted testing two soft-gel capsules containing the same amount of unformulated SRO. Lipomatrix, in force of the auto-emulsifying profile awarded by the association of MDGFA and ASP at the duodenal simulated conditions, allows a much better emulsification of SRO in FaSSIF-V2, creating the postulated synergy with bile salts that prelude to a better bio-accessibility of the oil to the absorbing epithelium. On the contrary, the soft-gel containing unformulated SRO does not take place to any significant emulsion or micellar dispersion that could be visually recognizable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This experimental evidence confirms the hypothesis of reduced and incomplete emulsifying property of sole bile towards oily active ingredients. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.3.2. DLS Analysis of Emulsified Dispersion of Lipomatrix in FaSSIF-V2 </title><p>The DLS analysis of the sample containing SRO entrapped in Lipomatrix and dispersed in FaSSIF-V2 produced the size distribution curve reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f006">Figure 6</xref> (red line) whose descriptive parameters are reported in <xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. </p><p>The FaSSIF-V2 sample shows a high polydispersity index (0.703) with three well-defined particles populations (769, 161 and 5468 nm) of which the first one is the most abundant and the third the least one. The sample of Lipomatrix dispersed in FaSSIF-V2 shows an elevated polydispersity index (0.529) as well, even though lower than FaSSIF-V2 alone and is composed of three groups of particles (528, 27, and 4511 nm), of which the first one is largely the most represented. The DLS evaluation seems to consolidate the visual hypothesis that Lipomatrix can effectively disperse SRO in FaSSIF-V2, giving rise to an even more finely dispersed system than FaSSIF-V2 alone (lower polydispersion index and presence of a prevalent population around 500 nm). Lipomatrix seems therefore to create a more uniform micellar dispersion in force of the presence of both ionized ASP and MDGFA. ASP becomes partially ionized in the presence of enteric fluids (pH &#x0003e; pKa) and in force of this ionization it behaves as hydro-soluble surfacting agent, capable of emulsifying SRO in synergy with MDGFA and bile salts, generating mixed micellar structures [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f007">Figure 7</xref>). This data gives an analytical confirmation of the visual macroscopic difference of emulsification capability of SRO entrapped in Lipomatrix compared to the same unformulated oil dispersed in FaSSIF-V2 as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3dot1-ijms-20-00669">Section 2.3.1</xref>. Finally, the comparison of the two specimens shows that a new population ascribable to Lipomatrix, with average hydrodynamic diameter of 27 &#x000b1; 6 nm, was generated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.4. <italic>SRO</italic>, PCA, and LYC Bioaccessibility</title><p>As previously mentioned, therapeutic applications of active principles from plants, such as SRO oil or curcumine, are hindered by their poor solubility in aqueous medium like the digestive fluids. Although their solubility during the digestive process is slightly improved by the emulsifying activity of bile salts, new technologies aimed at improving lipophilic active principle bioaccessibility are needed. To investigate Lipomatrix-based formulation (LBF) performance compared to the commercial formulations, we exposed a single dose of each formulation to in vitro digestion procedure mimicking human adulthood and evaluated the total amount of active principles and the apparent bioaccessible fraction released from its matrix. The apparent bioaccessible fraction includes the portion available to be absorbed. LBF has similar SRO apparent bioaccessibility of CF1 and CF2 formulations, with a good emulsifying effect of Lipomatrix technology (<xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Lipomatrix emulsifying efficiency is similar to CF2, which contains soy lecithin emulsifier. CF1 has a lower emulsifying efficiency than the others do since it does not contain any specific emulsifier in the formulation. CF1 emulsion is only due to the presence of bile salts in the intestinal compartment. Bile acts, to some extent, as a surfactant, helping to emulsify lipids and lipophilic molecules and increasing their absorption.</p><p>In addition to SRO, LBF contains PCA and LYC as active principles. As expected from the gastric resistance test, Lipomatrix technology preserves PCA from degradation, as indicated from their total amount and apparent bioaccessible fraction after digestion (<xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Protective effect was also observed on LYC, which is preserved from digestion (<xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.5.

Before measuring apparent permeability of the three formulations, the impact of digested formulations on intestinal epithelium viability and integrity was assessed. To this aim, intestinal monolayers were exposed to increasing concentrations of the three formulations, and dose-response curves were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f009">Figure 9</xref>).

Prostate-Specific Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Permeable Fractions</title><p>In recent years, inflammation has been recognized as the main phenomenon responsible for the onset of HPH, a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate, leading to the appearance of bothersome symptoms, such as frequent urination, difficult urination, weak stream, inability to urinate, and loss of bladder control. Prostatic-specific anti-inflammatory activity of bioaccessible fractions was evaluated on the in vitro prostatic epithelium model based on LNCaP cells, by measuring expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f015">Figure 15</xref>, bioaccessible fractions significantly reduce the production of IL-1&#x003b2; compared to the control.

Silvestri and colleagues [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] demonstrated that SRO extract induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the pro-apoptotic effect of SRO absorbable fractions on the prostatic epithelium model in both uninflamed and inflamed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f017">Figure 17</xref>).</p><p>As expected, pro-apoptotic activity induced by bioaccessible fractions well correlates with TNF-&#x003b1; expression, meaning a role of SRO in inducing apoptosis against inflamed and tumor prostatic cells. The apparent contrast between LNCaP prostatic cells vitality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f014">Figure 14</xref>) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f017">Figure 17</xref>) results could be explained by an early-apoptosis phenomenon. During early apoptosis phenomenon, indeed, cells retain their vitality. Activation of early apoptosis cascade leads to cell dead at later times, suggesting a decrease in LNCaP prostatic cells viability following prolonged exposure to SRO. While no effects were observed after 6 h incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f018">Figure 18</xref>A), cell viability significantly decreases after 24 h exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00669-f018">Figure 18</xref>B). </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot10-ijms-20-00669"><title>2.10.

FaSSIF-V2 was chosen as model of enteric fluid to assess the real capability of Lipomatrix to create soluble micellar forms in the duodenum without any interfering molecules coming from ingested foods such as higher Lecithin concentration than FaSSIF-V2 and oleic acid (OA) esters and salts (FeSSIF-V2) [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The solvent gradient elution program was as follows: 10% to 26% B (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) in 10 min, to 70% B at 20 min and finally to 90% B at 25 to 31 min. The injection volume for all samples was 100 &#x003bc;L. The phenolic compounds were analyzed by matching the retention time and their spectral characteristics against those of standards PAC A, B1, or B2 (20 to 400 ppm).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot8-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.8. In Vitro Model of Human Intestinal Epithelium</title><p>Permeability and absorption rate of SRO (i.e., fatty acids), PAC and LYC were determined using an in vitro model of human intestinal epithelium based on Caco-2 cells. Briefly, Caco-2 cells are seeded on Transwell<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> polytetrafluoroethylene inserts (1 &#x000b5;m pore size) at an initial density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and allowed to mature and differentiate for 21 days. Indeed, thanks to the compartmentalized nature of the Transwell<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system (apical (or lumen) and basolateral (or serosal) compartment), Caco-2 cells differentiate, acquiring morphological and functional feature typical of enterocytes, as the presence of microvilli, tight junctions and P-glycoprotein. Absorption experiment were performed between 21 and 28 days post seeding.</p><sec id="sec3dot2dot8dot1-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.8.1. Evaluation of the Impact of Digested Formulations on Intestinal Epithelium Viability</title><p>To evaluate the impact of digested formulations on intestinal epithelium viability, digested formulations were serially diluted in digestive fluids (from 1:2 up to 1:32 dilution) and added to the apical side of the in vitro intestinal epithelia, while HBSS buffer was placed in the basolateral compartment. Digestive fluids (without formulations) were added to the apical side of the in vitro intestinal epithelia as a negative control. After 3 h incubation, monolayers were washed twice with pre-warmed HBSS and viability of intestinal epithelia was evaluated with MTS assay, according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. This assay is based on MTS tetrazolium compound reduction by viable cells to generate a colored formazan product that can be quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. The color intensity at 490 nm was determined with a microplate reader (Synergy4, Biotek, Colonia Santo Domingo Azcapotzalco Distrito Federal, M&#x000e9;xico). Cell viability (%) was expressed as the ratio of the color intensity in the treated groups to that in the control (untreated) group. Absorption rate experiments were performed using non-toxic concentrations determined by dose-response curves.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot8dot2-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.8.2. Evaluation of SRO (Fatty Acids), PCA, and LYC Enteric Absorption Rate</title><p>Based on dose-response curve information and their posology, digested formulations were added to the apical side of the in vitro intestinal epithelium, while HBSS buffer supplemented with 1% BSA was placed in the basolateral compartment. Due to the lipophilicity of formulation active components, 1% BSA was added to the basolateral compartment for improving their absorption rate. According to the literature (Fossati et al., 2008) [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] the addition of BSA improves the correlation between absorption occurring in Caco-2 cell monolayer and humans. After 3 h incubation, apical and basolateral solutions were collected and fatty acids, proanthocyanidin and lycopene content was determined by GC/MS and HPLC respectively. Absorption rate of SRO fatty acids, PCA and LYC is expressed as percentage of absorption, derived from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot8dot3-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.8.3. Barrier Integrity and Cell Viability</title><p>After exposure to digested formulations, cell viability and barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium model were evaluated. Briefly, at the end of the incubation with the digested formulations, the in vitro intestinal epithelia were washed twice with pre-warmed HBSS and equilibrated in the same buffer for 30 min. Once equilibrated, epithelia barrier integrity was evaluated by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the cell monolayer with an ERS2 Voltohmmeter (Millipore), equipped with a chopstick electrode. Intestinal epithelium model paracellular permeability was determined with Lucifer Yellow (LY), a fluorescent polar tracer unable to pass through intact tight junctions. Paracellular permeability was measured by adding 0.5 mL of 100 &#x000b5;g/mL LY in HBSS in the apical compartment and 1.5 mL of HBSS in the basolateral compartment. After 1-h incubation, the basolateral fractions were collected and their fluorescence measured with a spectrofluorometer (Synergy 4, Biotek). Apparent permeability coefficient (P<sub>app</sub>, cm/s) was calculated with the following formula:<disp-formula>P<sub>app</sub> = (&#x00394;C &#x000b7; V)/(&#x00394;t &#x000b7; A &#x000b7; C<sub>0</sub>)<label>(1)</label></disp-formula>
where &#x00394;C/&#x00394;t is the flow of the molecule being transported across the monolayer during the incubation time (mM/s), V is the volume of the basolateral compartment (cm<sup>3</sup>), A is the area of the membrane (cm<sup>2</sup>), C<sub>0</sub> is the initial concentration of the molecule in the apical compartment. Finally, cell viability was evaluated by using MTS assay as described above. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot9-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.9. Prostate-Specific Anti-Inflammatory Activity</title><p>The prostate-specific anti-inflammatory activity of the bioaccessible fraction of tested formulations was evaluated in a prostatic epithelium in vitro model, based on tumoral prostatic cells (LNCaP). The prostate-specific anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated pre-treating the in vitro model for 2 h with the bioaccessible fractions corresponding to SRO concentrations reported in <xref rid="ijms-20-00669-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, and then exposing the model to inflamed conditions for 4 h. In particular, prostatic epithelium in vitro model was exposed either to normal monocytic/macrophage cell culture medium (uninflamed condition) or THP-1 cell culture conditioned medium (CM, inflamed condition).</p><p>CM was obtained by stimulating overnight PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells with the pro-inflammatory compound LPS (1 ng/mL). LNCaP cells in normal monocytic/macrophage cell culture medium and CM were used as negative and positive controls of inflammation respectively. Diclofenac, a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, was used as a positive control of anti-inflammatory activity. A dose-response curve was performed with MTS assay to determine Diclofenac highest non-lethal concentration on prostatic epithelium in vitro model after 6 h exposure. Similarly, the impact of bioaccessible fractions on LNCaP viability was checked by using MTS assay and morphology. At the end of the treatment, in vitro prostate epithelia were washed with pre-warmed DPBS and detached in ice-cold PBS with a cell scraper. Following centrifugation (1000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 5 min), LNCaP cells were resuspendend in lysis buffer (protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1% Triton X-100 in deionized water) and sonicated (5 s pulse-on at 10% amplitude and 25 sec pulse-off, total time 1.5 min) (Sonicator Q700, QSonica, Newtown, CT, USA). Finally, cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> and the surnatants recovered. Anti-inflammatory activity was determined by measuring the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) present in cell lysates. IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; were quantified by commercial ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kits, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>Anti-inflammatory effect of bioaccessible fractions was also evaluated in cell lysate by measuring cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme 1 and 2 activity. Total COX and COX-2 activities were assessed with a commercial COX activity assay kit, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><sec id="sec3dot2dot9dot1-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.9.1. SRO Pro-Apoptotic Activity</title><p>To evaluate the pro-apoptotic activity of the bioaccessible fractions of SRO, a fluorimetric assay, based on caspases 3/7 activation, was performed (Apo-ONE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay). This assay is based on the ability of activated caspases 3 and 7 to selectively cleave a specific substrate, making it fluorescent (excitation wavelenght 499 nm, emission wavelength 521 nm). Consequently, the produced fluorescence intensity is linked to the activation of the apoptotic process by cells. To correlate anti-inflammatory with pro-apoptotic activity, the same experimental setup described above for the anti-inflammatory activity was applied. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the assay conducted following manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot9dot2-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.9.2. Smooth Muscle Myorelaxing Activity</title><p>The myorelaxing activity of the bioaccessible fraction of tested formulations was evaluated in an in vitro model of smooth muscles, based on WPMY-1 human myofibroblast stromal cell. The myorelaxing effect was analyzed by means of a two-step gel-contraction assay, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The gel contraction assay is characterized by two phases: mechanical stress-generating phase and floating phase. During the first phase, a mix of myofibroblast and collagen is seeded and left to develop mechanical stress for two days while, during the floating phase, gels are released and allowed to freely contract, dissipating the mechanical stress generated during the first phase. Fibroblast-containing gels were exposed to the bioaccessible fraction of the formulations for the duration of the experiment (24 h). The myorelaxation activity was calculated with the following formula:<disp-formula>Myorelaxing Activity (%) = 100 &#x02212; ((C<sub>exposed</sub>/C<sub>control</sub>) &#x000d7; 100)<label>(2)</label></disp-formula>
where C<sub>fibroblast</sub> is the contraction of the fibroblast-containing gels exposed to the bioaccessible fraction of the different formulations and C<sub>control</sub> the contraction of the untreated fibroblast-containing gel (positive control of contraction).</p><p>Gel contraction is calculated as follows:<disp-formula>Contraction (%) = 100 &#x02212; ((D<sub>fibroblast</sub>/D<sub>collagen</sub>) &#x000d7; 100)<label>(3)</label></disp-formula>
where D<sub>fibroblast</sub> represents the diameter of the fibroblast-containing gel and D<sub>collagen</sub> the diameter of the collagen gel in which fibroblast were not seeded (negative control of contraction). Experimental and control cells were plated in triplicate and the diameter of each collagen gel was photographed and measurement via images analysis, performed with ImageJ (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot9dot3-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.2.9.3. Measurement of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Secretion by LNCaP Prostatic Cells</title><p>The effect of the different formulation bioaccessible fraction on the secretion of the androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen (PSA), commonly used as a marker for prostate tumors, was evaluated in LNCaP prostatic cells. After seeding and adhesion (48 h), normal cell culture medium was replaced with a medium containing low hormone level for 24 h (10% charcoal-stripped FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin mix in RPMI without phenol red). The pre-treatment medium was then removed and cells were incubated with the bioaccessible fraction of each formulation. A control was included in the assay by treating cells with low-hormones cell culture medium. Additionally, control and cells treated with LBF bioaccessible fraction were stimulated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (10 nM), known to stimulate the release of PSA [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-00669" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. After 24 h exposure, media were collected for measurement of secreted PSA using a commercial ELISA kit (Abcam), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Results were expressed as percentage of secreted PSA in cells treated with different formulations compared to control.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-ijms-20-00669"><title>3.3.

Conclusions</title><p>In the present paper, we demonstrated the successful application of a new technological lipid-based delivery matrix (Lipomatrix) able to protect lipophilic plant-derived active principles from the gastric compartment and favoring the formation of hydro-dispersible forms in the duodenum, thanks to the pH-dependent ionization of ASP. Lipomatrix-based formulation, despite the not improved apparent bioaccessibility data, seems to enhance overall enteric absorption of SRO in a CACO-2 cells model and this data well correlates with an overall improvement of its biologic effects on in vitro prostatic tissue model, compared to not formulated commercial SRO. Indeed, we showed that the Lipomatrix-associated fraction of SRO reduced inflammation and modulated cytokines pattern expression, enhanced pro-apoptotic caspases-mediated activity and improved myo-relaxation significantly better than not formulated SRO contained in the mentioned commercial products. Lipomatrix-associated SRO shoved furthermore to significantly reduce PSA expression in <italic>LNCaP</italic> prostatic cells but not better than one of the two SRO-containing commercial formulations tested. Moreover, even though as preliminary evidence, SRO formulated in Lipomatrix seems to ensure a higher safety profile on in vitro intestinal model in terms of overall cell vitality, compared to the tested commercial formulations. </p><p>To conclude, taken together the data collected in this work, it is possible to consider Lipomatrix as a promising, next generation technological platform for improving enteric delivery of SRO and as consequence its efficacy on human prostatic gland, so confirming the potential significant role of delivery systems in bioavailability of natural lipophilic compounds. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was mainly funded and supported by PHF SA, Lugano, Swiss.
