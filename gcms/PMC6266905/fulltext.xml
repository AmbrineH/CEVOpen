It remains unclear how the total amount of dietary fat, representing one of the main confounding factors in these biomarker investigations, affects C15:0 and C17:0 circulating concentrations independent of their relative intake. Additionally, it is not clear how changes in the dietary total-fat affects other fatty acids in circulation. Through two dietary studies with different total-fat levels but maintaining identical fatty acid compositions, we were able to see how the dietary total-fat affects the fatty acids in circulation. We saw that there was a statistically significant, proportionate, and robust decrease in the endogenous C15:0 levels with an increase in dietary total-fat. However, there was no significant change in the circulating C17:0 concentrations as the total-fat increased. To conclude, the dietary total-fat content and fat-type have a very complex influence on the relative compositions of circulating fatty acids, which are independent of the actual dietary fatty acid composition. Knowing how to manipulate circulating C15:0 and C17:0 concentrations is far-reaching in nutritional/pathological research as they highlight a dietary route to attenuate the development of metabolic disease (both by reducing risk and improving prognosis).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>dietary total-fat</kwd><kwd>pentadecanoic acid</kwd><kwd>15:0</kwd><kwd>heptadecanoic acid</kwd><kwd>17:0</kwd><kwd>odd chain fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-01646"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Odd chain fatty acids, specifically pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), have been described as biomarkers of dairy consumption [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, there are varying degrees of reliability for each fatty acid [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within large observational human studies, both of these fatty acids correlate moderately with their individual intake; which is usually attributed to the intake of dairy fat containing products, such as milk and butter [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, within strictly controlled animal models, there are significant differences in the correlation for the individual odd chain fatty acid between dietary intake and their circulating levels. Within animal models, C15:0 behaves as a direct concentration biomarker of intake, with no notable variation caused by metabolism or endogenous lipogenesis. In contrast, there is convincing evidence showing that C17:0 does not directly relate to dietary intake. Instead, C17:0 endogenous biosynthesis has a significant influence on its circulating levels [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the literature suggests that C17:0 may have a significant pathophysiological relevance and could be subject to in vivo homeostasis. Whether or not these fatty acids relate to dairy intake, their circulating levels show a significant association with a reduced risk of cardiometabolic diseases [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Investigating biomarkers within human populations is difficult due to many confounding factors. One typical dietary factor, such as the participant&#x02019;s total-fat intake, can vary hugely across a study population [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; it remains unclear if this independently affects the circulating fatty acid levels. For instance, the effect of the total-fat intake in relation to the total energy intake on circulating odd chain fatty acids (C15:0 and C17:0) biomarkers has not been investigated.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the total-fat intake (relative to total energy intake (% total-fat)) on the circulating C15:0 and C17:0 concentrations, independent of the dietary C15:0 and C17:0 composition. The current thought is that both C15:0 and C17:0 are homologous dietary biomarkers (supposed to be independent of endogenous metabolic processes). Therefore, both C15:0 and C17:0 in vivo should reliably correlate with their dietary compositions irrespective of any other dietary factors, such as the dietary total-fat content.</p><p>For this project, we decided to make use of samples from existing studies that could provide evidence to achieve the aim of this work. In our opinion, this is a more ethical approach than to start new a study demanding the use of more animals. The two studies we selected included a three-tier-diet dose-response-type study [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to investigate whether there is a linear effect on C15:0 and C17:0 by changing the total-fat content, and a two-tier-diet with different fat sources [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to investigate if any change in C15:0 or C17:0 due to the total-fat levels is consistent across different fat sources (i.e., whether there sources of fat that may promote optimal C15:0 or C17:0 levels). The fact that these studies use different lines of rats, different diet formulations, and different time points contributes to the robustness of any reproduced results.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-01646"><title>2.

In short, male Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>n</italic> = 6&#x02013;7 per group) were housed under standard conditions. Rats had an intragastric cannula surgically inserted seven days before being separated into three groups, with each group receiving an experimental diet with either 5%, 35%, or 70% total-fat content (% energy); fat was isocalorically substituted for carbohydrate calories, and protein, vitamin, and mineral contents were identical in all diets.

All samples were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until being analysed. Animals were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) approved animal facility. Animal maintenance and experimental treatments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-10-01646"><title>2.2.

The samples were then vortexed and sonicated for 15 min. Water (400 &#x000b5;L) was added to each sample, followed by further vortexing, sonication (15 min), and additional vortexing to ensure complete recovery. Samples were centrifuged (~20,000 rpm, 5 min) and the resulting aqueous and organic layers were separated and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. For the analysis of total fatty acids, the samples were derivatised as described previously [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To the dried organic extracts, boron trifluoride in methanol (14%, 125 &#x000b5;L), chloroform: methanol (1:1, 100 &#x000b5;L), and internal standard tridecanoic acid-<sub>d25</sub> in chloroform (100 &#x000b5;L, 200 &#x000b5;mol) were added. The mixture was thoroughly vortexed, sonicated (30 min), and vortexed a further time to ensure that there was no undissolved material. Samples were heated to 80 &#x000b0;C for 90 min to commence the derivatisation process. After the samples had cooled, water (300 &#x000b5;L) and hexane (600 &#x000b5;L) were added.

Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows the effects of varying the dietary total-fat (as a percentage of total energy) on the circulating C15:0 and C17:0 fatty acids concentrations whilst maintaining the actual dietary C15:0 and C17:0 fatty acid composition (mol %).</p><p>As shown in study one (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01646-f001">Figure 1</xref>), there was a statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), proportionate, and robust decrease in the endogenous C15:0 levels with an increase in dietary total-fat content from 5% to 35% to 70% (% energy). However, there was no statistically significant change in the endogenous C17:0 concentrations. The inverse correlation seen in C15:0 suggests there could be a decrease in the efficiency of intestinal absorption as the dietary total-fat content increases. The correlations with the dietary total-fat content show that C15:0 and C17:0 are not homologous with each other and that they must be discriminated from one another when being studied; either because they originate from different sources or because they could be biologically compartmentalised. These absolute concentration relationships show that C15:0 and C17:0 are changing with varying dietary total-fat contents and are not artificially created due to changes in endogenous lipogenesis (as seen in relative compositions; mol %).</p><p>In the literature, it is shown that C15:0 and C17:0 may originate from different sources; C15:0 appears to come directly from the diet, while C17:0 is also significantly endogenously biosynthesized [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The results presented here support a dietary origin for C15:0, since the in vivo C15:0 compositions decrease with an increase in dietary total-fat. This data was supported by our second study comparing circulating fatty acids across two total-fat levels (11% and 51%) and three different diet formulations (basal fat-, lard fat-, and fish oil-based) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>). For C17:0, the basal fat and lard fat diets each saw no statistically significant change in the in vivo C17:0 concentrations with an increase in the dietary total-fat content. However, the fish oil-based diet resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the in vivo C17:0 concentrations (~16%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which further suggests C17:0 endogenous biosynthesis since it has been shown that n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids significantly decrease <italic>Hacl1</italic> gene expression [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; shown to be involved in C17:0 biosynthesis [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Many epidemiological studies have shown that there is an inverse association between the relative compositions/concentration of odd chain fatty acids and metabolic disease risk [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. From work in animal models, we showed that this relationship could be causal, at least for C17:0; a reduction in C17:0 could be significant in the development of pathology [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is therefore essential to understand how diet will affect the relative compositions of these two odd chain fatty acids; C15:0 and C17:0. The findings from these studies highlight the need for strictly controlled confirmation of biomarkers, especially when they originate from large human studies, due to the inherent complexity of the data sets involved. The effects of the dietary total-fat can be further complicated by processes like de novo lipogenesis [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (influenced by non-fat dietary components, such as carbohydrates or ethanol [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01646" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-10-01646">Table S3</xref>: The circulating fatty acid compositions (mol %) changes between an ethanol treated group and their associated control group)).</p><p>Limitations of this study: The work presented in this manuscript shows that C15:0 and C17:0 are not homologous to one another; however, further work is needed to comprehensively investigate all the contributions to the circulating levels, including different mechanisms of endogenous biosynthesis along with direct dietary contributions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-10-01646"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>From our results, we conclude that the dietary total-fat content and fat-type composition have a very complex influence on the relative concentration of odd chain fatty acids in the circulation, which behaves profoundly differently between C15:0 and C17:0. It is seen that an increase in dietary total-fat significantly independently reduces the circulating levels of C15:0. Furthermore, a fish oil-based diet proves to be noteworthy as it appears to decrease both C15:0 and C17:0. The importance of these findings are far-reaching in nutrition and pathophysiology research as they highlight a possible dietary/nutritional route to attenuate the development of metabolic disease; the impact of these results in humans still needs to be further investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the NIHR BRC Core Metabolomics and Lipidomics Laboratory, University of Cambridge.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-10-01646"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1646/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1646/s1</uri>, Figure S1: The circulating fatty acid relative composition (mol %) change in response to the three experimental diets.
