    "Satureja hortensis L. presents an increased interest due to its chemical composition, abundant in monoterpenes, aglyconic and glycosylates flavonoids, and phenolic acids, leading to important biological activity. The present study compared the biological activity of volatile oil (VO) and total hydro-alcoholic extract (TE) of Satureja hortensis L. in terms of: i) antioxidant activity; ii) antimicrobial activity; and iii) viability, migration and proliferation on two healthy cell lines (keratinocytes-HaCaT and fibroblasts-1BR3) and two melanoma cell lines (human-A375 and murine-B164A5). Antioxidant activity of VO and TE showed maximal values around 72%. Antimicrobial screening highlighted the inhibitory capacity of VO against all seven tested bacteria strains, with the most pronounced effect against S. aureus and C. albicans, while TE exerted only a slight activity against three bacteria strains. VO showed greater efficacy than TE on both tumor cell lines (A375 and B164A5), the activity of the compounds was higher when low concentrations were used (5, 10 and 25 µM) while at high concentrations (50 and 100 µM) the percentages of viability were increased."
