    "Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) have been associated with several health benefits. With the increased interest in n-3 FA both scientifically and societally, the accurate detection of such analytes has become increasingly important. Recently, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization interface (ESI), hyphenated to both gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC), has become a valuable tool in the detection of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization interface-tandem mass spectrometry methods have been developed for the determination of DHA in canine and poultry species. The objective of this article is to investigate whether LC-ESI-MS/MS is fit for purpose for the determination of DHA in laying hen serum. The disclosure of this work will be beneficial for researchers investigating poultry enrichment for regulatory and toxicological studies. The method was found to be linear over the range. Precision and accuracy results met acceptance criteria and the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) was established as 1 µg/mL. Recoveries of DHA were obtained for quality control samples and stability studies were performed. The results of the verification study complimented those of the validation study. In summation, the method was established as fit for purpose for measuring total DHA in laying hen serum."
