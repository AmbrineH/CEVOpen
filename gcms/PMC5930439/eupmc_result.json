    "Accumulation of storage compounds during seed development plays an important role in the life cycle of oilseed plants; these compounds provide carbon and energy resources to support the establishment of seedlings.In this study, we show that BnCIPK9 has a broad expression pattern in Brassica napus L. tissues and that wounding stress strongly induces its expression. The overexpression of BnCIPK9 during seed development reduced oil synthesis in transgenic B. napus compared to that observed in wild-type (WT) plants. Functional analysis revealed that seed oil content (OC) of complementation lines was similar to that of WT plants, whereas OC in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Atcipk9 knockout mutants (cipk9) was higher than that of WT plants. Seedling of cipk9 mutants failed to establish roots on a sugar-free medium, but root establishment could be rescued by supplementation of sucrose or glucose. The phenotype of complementation transgenic lines was similar to that of WT plants when grown on sugar-free medium. Mutants, cipk9, cbl2, and cbl3 presented similar phenotypes, suggesting that CIPK9, CBL2, and CBL3 might work together and play similar roles in root establishment under sugar-free condition.This study showed that BnCIPK9 and AtCIPK9 encode a protein kinase that is involved in sugar-related response and plays important roles in the regulation of energy reserves. Our results suggest that AtCIPK9 negatively regulates lipid accumulation and has a significant effect on early seedling establishment in A. thaliana. The functional characterization of CIPK9 provides insights into the regulation of OC, and might be used for improving OC in B. napus. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it provides information on how CIPKs coordinate stress regulation and energy signaling."
