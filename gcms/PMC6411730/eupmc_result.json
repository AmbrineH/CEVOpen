    "The high altitude trans-Himalayan region indeed is hostile domain for survival. Algae inhabiting  this  hostile terrain have evolutionarily developed mechanisms to produce unique adaptogenic molecules against climatic stressors. The present study has focused on the high altitude alga Spirogyra porticalis (Muell.) Cleve- a filamentous Charophyte, and reports the estimation of amino acids (AAs), fatty acids (FAs), vitamins and their efficacy against oxidative stress. Reverse phase-HPLC, GC-FID and rapid resolution-LC/tandem mass spectrometry were used for analysis of AAs, FAs and vitamins. Analysis of the alga  revealed the presence of 19 AAs (239.51 ± 8.57 to 13102.40 ± 11.08 µg/g), dominated by alanine, proline and lysine. Enriched phenylalanine, cysteine-HCl and high lysine:arginine ratio could also have beneficial impact against hypoxia -induced cognitive impairment. A total of 9 FAs were detected (0.43 ± 0.00% to 34.76 ± 0.52%). Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated FAs were found to be dominant. The alga showed the presence of 8 vitamins within the range of 39.654 ± 3.198 to 5468.184 ± 106.859 µg/Kg, wherein Vitamin B5, B3 and B2 were dominant. 600 µg/ml of methanolic extract showed recovery of GSH and trolox equivalent antioxidants in rat blood/hemolysate, while 400 µg/ml of extract showed revival in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The present study concludes that the alga S. porticalis has immense potential to counter oxidative stress as a nutraceutical supplement."
