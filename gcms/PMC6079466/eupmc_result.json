    "A simple and fast method for the determination of PAHs in smoked meat samples was described. The QuEChERS (Z-Sep) procedure was used for sample preparation. Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer with electron ionization (EI) was used to separate and detect the PAHs. All 16 common PAHs were analyzed successfully. Matrix-matched calibration was applied. Spiked samples were performed at 1 ng/g (n=10) and 10 ng/g (n=10) for two days. Overall recoveries of PAHs were within 74 to 117%, with RSDs within 1.15 to 37.57% and 1 and 10 ng/g wet weight for first and second day, respectively. In most of the analyzed smoked meat samples, there were no exceeded levels compared to the maximum levels declared by Commission Regulation (EU) number 835/2011. The method can be recommended for routine analysis for laboratories having a large number of samples."
