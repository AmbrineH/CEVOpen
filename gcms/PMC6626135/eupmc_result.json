    "Fatty liver haemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) is a widespread metabolic disease in laying hens that causes a decrease in egg production and even death. Insulin resistance is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the relationship between FLHS and the insulin resistance mechanisms underlying FLHS is not well elucidated. Therefore, we established an FLHS model induced by feeding a high-energy low-protein diet. In the current study, we found that the fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were elevated in the FLHS group compared with the control group during the experimental period. The results of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin sensitivity test (IST) showed a high level of insulin resistance in the FLHS model. InsR, 4EBP-1, Glut-1 and Glut-3 mRNA expression were decreased, and TOR, S6K1, and FOXO1 were elevated (P < 0.05). Metabolomic analysis with GC/MS identified 46 differentially expressed metabolites between these two groups, and of these, 14 kinds of metabolism molecules and 32 kinds of small metabolism molecules were decreased (P < 0.05). Further investigation showed that glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism blocks in the progression of FLHS by GO functional and pathway analysis. Overall, these results suggest that insulin resistance participated in FLHS; comprehensively, metabolites participated in the dysregulated biological process."
