Introduction</title><p>The wound dressing market has grown significantly over last 10 years; however fewer dressings have all the required properties for the purpose of wound protection and healing. Natural polymers are of special interest due to low toxicity, high absorption, and swelling capacities; moreover, various active compounds can be incorporated into these polymers [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is considered the most abundant natural polymer, renewable, soluble in water, with low toxicity, film-forming, with good stability from pH 2 and pH 12, is relatively inexpensive, and is widely used in various types of dressings to have hemostatic property [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prevalence of chronic wounds in the general population is relatively high; improving wound healing, severe burns, and postoperative remains a challenge due to the high cost of existing therapies [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The use of opioids is widely used as anesthetics for postoperative and deep wounds, but there are disadvantages as possible side effects (respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and urinary retention) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and antibiotics are generally used to prevent and treat infections; nonetheless their activity is gradually diminishing due to the rise of resistance to these drugs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Topical formulations are noninvasive and with few side effects; a good example is patches, a topical adhesive that have constant and prolonged release, avoiding peak plasma levels, and may reduce the duration of pain [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The patch with plant extracts has been used to reduce inflammation and aid in healing [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Brazilian biome contains more than 20% of the biodiversity of world [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with a wide variety of available molecules for human therapy in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and veterinary fields [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Two species that are used in popular culture and native of Brazil and South America were used for this study,<italic> Achyrocline satureioides</italic> Lam. (DC) (<italic>Asteraceae</italic>) known as macela or marcela, used in folk medicine as an analgesic, sedative, and abdominal cramping. There is scientific evidence of anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and antioxidant action [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The essential oil compounds have been identified as <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-pinene, copaene, and the isomers <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-caryophyllene and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-caryophyllene (or <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-humulene); the last two are the major compounds present in essential oil of plants in Brazil [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Its main component of interest is the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-humulene, responsible for anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].<italic> Acmella oleracea</italic> (L.) RK Jansen (<italic>Asteraceae</italic>), popularly known in Brazil as jambu, is widely used in cooking and also popularly used to treat toothaches, tuberculosis, and anemia and as appetite stimulant [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; these activities are attributed to bioactive compounds, coumarins (scopoletin), triterpenoids, essential oils (limonene and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-caryophyllene) amino acids, phytosterols, phenolic compounds (vanillic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and trans-isoferulic acid), and N-alkylamides; its main component is spilanthol responsible for anesthetic activity [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The use of an anesthetic and anti-inflammatory is important to reduce pain and have good wound healing, for reducing the risk of infection and further complications. It is also reported that inflammatory mediators such as histamine and prostaglandin E2 may be related to the inhibition of collagen synthesis and fibroblast proliferation, important components for wound healing [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this work was to develop and to evaluate an anesthetic and anti-inflammatory bioadhesive film containing jambu extract and macela essential oil, by studying its mechanical properties,<italic> in vitro</italic> skin permeation characteristics, and<italic> in vivo</italic> performance, in comparison with commercial formulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The polymer used was the HEC, by the aforementioned properties, for being compatible with the adjuvants, jambu's extract and macela's essential oil; it remained homogeneous after drying. Other polymers were tested in different concentrations, such as chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol. Also other ingredients like adjuvants were exhausted tested, but none of them remained homogeneous (data not shown).</p><p>To determine the physical properties of the films these were evaluated with respect to perforation, relaxation, and resilience. The mechanical properties of the films are mainly related with the polymer's ability to form bonds in polymer chains, making their separation difficult when subject to mechanical forces. The placebo film (FIII film) exhibited a higher resistance than the films with extract and essential oil; it presented higher values relative to perforation, resilience, and relaxation, as expected since there is no addition of extract and oil; consequently the film is more rigid. Hence, it may be concluded that the presence of jambu's extract and macela's essential oil improved their viscoelastic characteristics of deformation and molecular relaxation. Compared with another study of polyvinyl alcohol films, the films containing extract and essential oil are more malleable and easiest to cover the wound [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Wound healing is the process of repair following injury to the skin and other soft tissues. It is a complex and dynamic process of restoring cellular structures and tissue layers in damaged tissue as closely as possible to its normal and original state [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The formulations containing jambu's extract and macela's essential oil improved wound contraction and closure by the absorptive capacity of fluids. The formulation FII had the highest percentage of wound contraction and formulation FIII was better than the control, proving that the HEC is a great polymer for wound healing. Spilanthol and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-humulene already have anti-inflammatory action proven [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but their healing activity has not been studied. The histopathological analysis showed that, in just 10 days of treatment, the treatments with the FI and FII films were beneficial for the regeneration and reorganization of structures of the skin when compared with placebo film and allantoin; this is confirmed by the regular arrangement of collagen fibers and thickening epidermis in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>. This result suggests that the jambu's extract and macela's essential oil helped in collagen deposition and decrease the time of the healing process. Moreover, it was not possible to find any evidence of tissue damage, inflammation, or fibrosis in the rat skin.</p><p>In a study with another species but still natural product, the authors employed<italic> Hibiscus rosa </italic>extract in an ointment base and demonstrated that in 10 days the wound contracted about 75.0%, while the positive control, nitrofurazone ointment, contracted on average 45.0% [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One study from Asian medicine with ethanol extract and essential oil of<italic> Murraya koenigii</italic> proved that the administered essential oil helped with the wound contraction at 36.0%, the treatment with ethanol extract at 67.0%, and the ointment standard used at 37.0%, at the tenth day of treatment, but it was possible to observe the presence of collagen in the histological slides only on the 14th day [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These results demonstrate that the use of essential oils and extracts is important in wound healing; therapeutic and wound healing test corroborates this statement.</p><p>The antinociceptive activity was dose-dependent with only 5&#x02009;min of application; formulation FII had a longer time of anesthesia than the EMLA cream, but formulation FI obtained a shorter time than EMLA The topical EMLA cream was chosen as a positive control because it is the topical anesthetic most used clinically and has an average duration of anesthesia 90&#x02009;min after application [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the antinociceptive activity of jambu's extract is due to the presence of spilanthol, an alkylamine in a high percentage in the extract. Other authors demonstrate the efficacy of jambu in antinociceptive test intraperitoneally [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; this demonstrates the safety of jambu's extract.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The FII film with 15.0% of jambu extract treated with activated charcoal and 1.5% macela's essential oil had the best results. The mechanical resistance tests displayed that films with extract and essential oil are more malleable, making it easier to cover wounds when compared with other films, indicating that the films may be utilized in different locations of the human body with skin lesions. It had better healing activity and collagen deposition compared with the positive control, allantoin. It also had the best result in the antinociceptive activity test compared with EMLA, a topical anesthetic most commonly used clinically. These results demonstrate the great potential of films as wound dressing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for financial support (2016/13776-5).</p></ack><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gustaite</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazlauske</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bobokalonov</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Characterization of cellulose based sponges for wound dressings</article-title><source><italic>Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects</italic></source><year>2015</year><volume>480</volume><fpage>336</fpage><lpage>342</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.08.022</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-84937915507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pawar</surname><given-names>R.
