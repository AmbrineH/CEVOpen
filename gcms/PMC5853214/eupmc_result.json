    "Leaf senescence is a long developmental process important for nutrient management and for source to sink remobilization. Constituents of the mesophyll cells are progressively degraded to provide nutrients to the rest of the plant. Up to now, studies on leaf senescence have not paid much attention to the role of the different leaf tissues. In the present study, we dissected leaf laminae from the midvein to perform metabolite profiling. The laminae mesophyll cells are the source of nutrients, and in C3 plants they contain Rubisco as the most important nitrogen storage pool. Veins, rich in vasculature, are the place where all the nutrients are translocated, and sometimes interconverted, before being exported through the phloem or the xylem. The different metabolic changes we observed in laminae and midvein with ageing support the idea that the senescence programme in these two tissues is different. Important accumulations of metabolites in the midvein suggest that nutrient translocations from source leaves to sinks are mainly controlled at this level. Carbon and nitrogen long-distance molecules such as fructose, glucose, aspartate, and asparagine were more abundant in the midvein than in laminae. In contrast, sucrose, glutamate, and aspartate were more abundant in laminae. The concentrations of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) compounds were also lower in the midvein than in laminae. Since nitrogen remobilization increased under low nitrate supply, plants were grown under two nitrate concentrations. The results revealed that the senescence-related differences were mostly similar under low and high nitrate conditions except for some pathways such as the TCA cycle."
