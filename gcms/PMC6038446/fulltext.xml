The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of XHP on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in glioblastoma U-87 MG cells. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed for constituent analysis of XHP. Cell viability, cell cycle arrest, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay, PI/RNase staining, DCFH-DA assay, TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, and JC-1 assay, respectively. The role of XHP in the regulation of Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 interaction was clarified by using Western Blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), pharmacological inhibitor or antioxidant, and siRNA silencing. The results suggested that XHP could inhibit U-87 MG cells growth and arrest cells in S-phase cell cycle significantly and that the generation of ROS, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancement of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, and reduction of the precursor forms of caspase-9 and caspase-3 caused by XHP prompted that a ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis was possibly involved. Furthermore, XHP affected the Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 and increasing both prototype and nuclear translocation of FOXO1. Inhibition of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 by specific inhibitors or siRNA could interpose the apoptotic induction. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that XHP may regulate glioblastoma U-87 MG cell apoptosis via ROS-mediated Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province</funding-source><award-id>2017A030313772</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China</funding-source><award-id>20181167</award-id><award-id>20181169</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Technology Research and Development Project of Guangdong Province</funding-source><award-id>2017A020215036</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Gliomas, a type of highly heterogeneous tumor, have been the leading lethal causes in primary central nerve system (CNS) tumors. According to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumors, gliomas in adults are mainly included astrocytoma (Grades I-IV), oligodendroglioma (Grades II-III), oligoastrocytoma (Grades II-III), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Grade IV) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. GBM, the most aggressive and malignant form of gliomas, is distinguished by highly invasive behaviors with tentacle-like projections, making complete surgical removal difficult. Median overall survival of GBM patients is less than 18 months despite the adoption of optimized therapeutic scheme in combination of neurosurgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In consideration of the significant toxicity and chemotherapy resistance in treatment, it is necessary to develop other effective strategies, for example, the exploration of potential benefits from traditional herbal formulas for glioblastoma treatment.</p><p>Xihuang pill (XHP, also called Xihuang Wan), a formula composed by four traditional Chinese medicines,<italic> Olibanum</italic>,<italic> Myrrh</italic>,<italic> Moschus</italic>, and<italic> Calculus bovis</italic>, has been used as a complementary and alternative medicine for tumor treatment in China since 18th century [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In modern clinical application, XHP has been proved effectively on various solid tumors including breast cancer [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], cervical cancer [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], glioma [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The experimental research showed that its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) was possibly attributed to the mitochondrial-related B-cell lymphoma- (Bcl-) 2 regulation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or Wnt [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The invasion and metastasis inhibition were relevant to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factor, Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and its downstream target genes ERK1/2, E-Cadherin, Occludin, matrix metalloprotein- (MMP-) 2, MMP-9, and junctional adhesion molecule- (JAM-) 1 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, XHP could inhibit vasculogenic mimicry formation to reduce angiogenesis by downregulating expression of VE-Cadherin, MMP-2, and phosphorylated eph-receptor tyrosine kinase-type A2 (p-EphA2) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, XHP exhibited the capability of converting tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by reducing proportion of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Treg cells [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or by downregulating expression of cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-10, and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or by increasing IL-2, Interferon- (IFN-) <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, and the ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite the above widely described antitumor properties of XHP, little research has been devoted to GBM. On account of XHP's definite clinical efficacy on GBM and its unclear molecular mechanisms, additional studies on this subject are necessary. In this study, we investigated the effects of XHP on human U-87 MG glioblastoma cell growth and its underlying mechanisms related to ROS-mediated Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway, so as to provide some experimental data to the further research and development on antiglioblastoma application of XHP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

It is revealed that total thirty-nine chromatographic peaks were separated well and thirty-two constituents were identified from them (the identified chemical compounds were presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table S1</xref>). Six compounds, 24-norursa-3,12-diene (17.72%), 24-norursa-3,12-dien-11-one (16.28%), 3,14,15-trihydroxypregn-16-en-20-one (11.77%), isopropyl-1,5,9-trimethyl-15-oxabicyclo[10.2.1] pentadeca-5,9-dien-2-ol (11.40%), 24-noroleana-3,12-diene (8.45%), and 24-norursa-3,9(11),12-triene (5.98%), corresponding to peaks 38, 39, 21, 22, 37, and 36 in the chromatographic spectrum, comprised 71.60% of total amount and could be regarded as the major constituents of XHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

No obvious change was observed in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. The results indicated that XHP could arrest U-87 MG cells in S-phase cell cycle and subsequently block cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. XHP-Induced Apoptosis of U-87 MG Cells</title><p>TUNEL, FACS, and western blot assay were used to detect the apoptosis induced by XHP on U-87 MG cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, the increased DNA fragmentation accompanied with the increase of XHP concentrations was observed after the treatment for 24h with FITC-dUTP and DAPI double staining in the TUNEL assay. Moreover, the proapoptotic ability of XHP was evaluated by FACS. We found that the apoptotic ratio was increased in the XHP-treated group versus the control group in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>), and both of the early-period and late-period apoptotic percentage were improved. In particular, the percentage of early-period apoptotic cells with 30 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL of XHP was significantly higher than the untreated control cells from 3.11% to 24.30% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). To confirm the association between XHP treatment and apoptosis, the effects of XHP on the modulation of apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(d)</xref>, the proapoptotic protein Bax was upregulated and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. In other words, Bax/Bcl-xL ratio was increased by XHP treatment. In addition, their downstream proteins procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 were also activated by XHP. These findings suggested that XHP might induce apoptosis of U-87 MG cells by upregulating the expression of proapoptotic protein Bax and then subsequently activate its downstream proteins caspase-9 and caspase-3. From results above, it indicated that XHP could decrease the viability of U-87 MG cells, induce cell apoptotic death, and affect apoptotic associated proteins expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. XHP-Induced Apoptosis via the ROS-Mediated Mitochondrial-Dependent Pathway</title><p>Collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) was regarded as a key factor of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. The changes of &#x00394;&#x003a8;m were detected by JC-1 analysis. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>, the accumulation of monomer improved remarkably in the XHP-treated cells, and J-aggregates decreased at the same time, which suggested that XHP could affect early apoptosis of U-87 MG cells. Furthermore, to investigate whether ROS was involved in the mitochondrial damage, the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level was detected by the fluorescent probe DCFH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>, XHP triggered intracellular ROS release significantly. After using the ROS scavenger NAC, the ROS generation, cell apoptosis, and the oxidative stress induced by XHP were all reversed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref>). Taken together with the above findings, the results suggested that XHP-induced apoptosis might be related to the ROS-mediated mitochondrial-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6. XHP Activated the Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 Signaling Pathway</title><p>Accumulating evidence suggested that Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 played important roles in the proliferation of U-87 MG cells. To investigate the mechanism of the apoptosis induced by XHP, Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 signaling pathway deserved to be evaluated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>, the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 was downregulated after treatment with different concentrations of XHP, while FOXO1 expression was significantly increased under the same manner. As a transcription factor, the nuclear localization of FOXO1 defined its role in the regulation of downstream targets. In this experiment, the distribution of FOXO1 between nuclear and cytosolic compartments was studied by immunofluorescent imaging. It was observed that FOXO1 accumulation and p-FOXO1 reduction in nuclei were synchronous in XHP-stressed U-87 MG cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>). Besides, it was also found that the proapoptotic effect of XHP on Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 signaling pathway could be reversed by NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Moreover, Akt inhibitor LY294002, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and FOXO1-specific siRNA were adopted to verify the roles of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 in the apoptotic process. After being treated with LY294002 or rapamycin, the sensitivity of U-87 MG cells to XHP and the apoptotic cells were all increased, yet the inactivation of FOXO1 by siRNA attenuated the sensitivity of U-87 MG cells to XHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(g)</xref>). Consequently, it is suggested that XHP could inhibit the Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway to exert its antiglioblastoma effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>XHP, a representative traditional Chinese medicine formula for clearing heat and relieving toxin, shows remarkable antineoplastic properties against several cancers including glioma in clinical practice. However, its pharmacological activity and underlying mechanism on glioblastoma have not been well studied until now. Herein, human U-87 MG cells were used as an experimental model to examine its antiglioma effects. Our findings preliminary demonstrated that XHP could inhibit U-87 MG cells proliferation and induce apoptosis via mitochondrial damage and inhibition of ROS-mediated Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 signal pathway.</p><p>Apoptosis is a vital mechanism to balance cell proliferation and death. In our study, after being treated with XHP, apoptosis-related morphology changes in cells, such as cell shrinkage, chromatic agglutination, and nuclear fragmentation, were observed. Many reports showed that apoptosis often occurred with cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub>/M phase via interfering with the particular cyclins [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, cells were found to be blocked from G<sub>1</sub> to S-phase in our study. This result was in agreement with the previous reports on XHP treatments in human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7404 cells and human ovary carcinoma Sk-OV-3 cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It could be presumed that XHP might impact DNA synthesis and/or a certain cyclin that regulated S-phase [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Bcl-2 family proteins regulate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial permeability and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt<italic> c</italic>) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with the balance of anti- and proapoptotic members arbitrating cell fate. Antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL reside in the outer mitochondrial wall and inhibit Cyt<italic> c</italic> release. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bad (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 associated death promoter), Bid (BH3 interacting agonist), Bax and Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) reside in the cytosol but translocate to mitochondria following death signaling, where they could promote the release of Cyt<italic> c</italic>. Activated Bad, an essential initiator of the apoptotic cascade, translocates to mitochondria and forms a proapoptotic complex with the antiapoptotic mitochondrial proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, as well as to antagonize their antiapoptotic activity and promote the proapoptotic activity of Bax [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Bax and Bim translocate to mitochondria in response to death stimuli including survival factor withdrawal, activated following DNA damage, inducing transcription of Bax. Bax translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane through BH3 and multimerizates, which forms membrane channels to stimulate the release of mitochondrial Cyt<italic> c</italic> and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Released Cyt<italic> c</italic> binds apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf1) and forms activated apoptotic bodies with caspase-9, leading to a cascade of downstream caspase reaction [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although the mechanism(s) regulating mitochondrial permeability and the release of Cyt<italic> c</italic> during apoptosis are not totally understood, Bcl-xL and Bax apparently influence the release of Cyt<italic> c</italic> [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, we observed that XHP-induced apoptosis in U-87 MG cells from Annexin V/PI staining and DNA fragmentation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The appeared mitochondrial dysfunction detected by JC-1 assay confirmed that the U-87 MG cell apoptosis occurred via mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, oxidative imbalance was accompanied with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. As is well known, increased intracellular ROS level plays a critical role in mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Excessive ROS could cause dysfunction of the mitochondrial membrane proteins and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Application of NAC, the ROS inhibitor, could usually alleviate oxidative stress and reduce ROS generation, as well as the ratio of apoptosis. In our study, after being pretreated with XHP, rapid ROS generation and relief by NAC were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is implied that XHP-induced apoptosis was at least partly depending on ROS generation. Furthermore, it was found that XHP significantly alter Bax and Bcl-xL levels in U-87 MG cells, increase the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, and decline of the precursor forms of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Further investigation might be needed to clarify whether XHP affects other Bcl-2 family members such as Bim, Bad, and BH3-only proteins in U-87 MG cells.</p><p>It is clear that the clinical significance of Akt and mTOR are crucial in GBM. Both of them can be used as markers to predict prognosis and target candidates for personalized medicine [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Their activation promotes cell proliferation, regulates cellular energy metabolism, and provides protection from apoptosis. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway emerges as a potential treatment for GBM patients. FOXOs, comprising FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6, are the focus of cancer research recently [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. FOXOs have emerged as tumor suppressors via inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which can be phosphorylated at various serine and threonine residues (S253, S315 and Thr32) by activated Akt. Once phosphorylation accomplished, FOXOs are exported from nucleus to cytoplasm and become inactive, which leads to inhibition of transcriptional activity [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, nuclear localization of FOXOs is required for their transcriptional regulatory functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle regulation, protection from oxidative stress, and apoptosis [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether XHP exerted U-87 MG cells apoptosis by regulating the above-mentioned signaling pathways.</p><p>From western blot results, we found that XHP could inhibit the phosphorylation of the key protein members in PI3K/Akt pathway, including p-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), and p-FOXO1 (Thr24), and upregulate total FOXO1 expression in U-87 MG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This result coincided well with the enhancement in nuclear localization and the potentiated cytoplasmic degradation of FOXO1 observed in immunofluorescence images. Activation of FOXO1 subsequently led to transcriptional activation of genes controlling cell cycle arrest or cell apoptosis, such as proapoptotic proteins [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We verified in this study that their ability of permeabilizing mitochondrial membrane could result in activation of executioner caspases such as caspase-9, caspase-3, and pinnacle of cell death [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, we found that synergetic effects occurred when XHP was combined with either Akt or mTOR inhibitors. Inhibition of Akt or mTOR can increase the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of XHP, while FOXO1 knockdown could rescue U-87 MG cells from XHP-induced apoptosis. From above, it was obvious that the PI3K pathway proteins including Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 are involved in XHP-induced apoptosis followed by the enhanced downstream proapoptotic target FOXO1's nuclear import. The activation of the dephosphorylated FOXO1 potentiated proapoptotic protein Bax expression and oxidative stress generation, which induced mitochondria-mediated activation of apoptotic cascade. Therefore, based on literature and our preliminary results, we hypothesized that XHP might inhibit glioblastoma cells apoptosis resistance by inducing Akt and mTOR dephosphorylation, decreasing phosphorylation of FOXO1, causing FOXO1 nuclear transport and enhancing its transcriptional activity, and finally triggering U-87 MG cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
