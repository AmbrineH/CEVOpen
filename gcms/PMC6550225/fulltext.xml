Since TGOOH and its subsequent oxidation products cause not only the deterioration of oil quality but also various toxicities, preventing the oxidation of edible oils is essential. Therefore understanding oxidation mechanisms that cause the formation of TGOOH is necessary. Since isomeric information of lipid hydroperoxide provides insights about oil oxidation mechanisms, we focused on dioleoyl-(hydroperoxy octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-HpODE-TG) isomers, which are the primary oxidation products of the most abundant TG molecular species (dioleoyl-linoleoyl-TG) in canola oil. To secure highly selective and sensitive analysis, authentic OO-HpODE-TG isomer references (i.e., hydroperoxide positional/geometrical isomers) were synthesized and analyzed with HPLC-MS/MS. With the use of the method, photo- or thermal- oxidized edible oils were analyzed. While dioleoyl-(10-hydroperoxy-8<italic>E</italic>,12<italic>Z</italic>-octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-(10-HpODE)-TG) and dioleoyl-(12-hydroperoxy-9<italic>Z</italic>,13<italic>E</italic>-octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-(12-HpODE)-TG) were characteristically detected in photo-oxidized oils, dioleoyl-(9-hydroperoxy-10<italic>E</italic>,12<italic>E</italic>-octadecadienoyl)-TG and dioleoyl-(13-hydroperoxy-9<italic>E</italic>,11<italic>E</italic>-octadecadienoyl)-TG were found to increase depending on temperature in thermal-oxidized oils. These results prove that our methods not only evaluate oil oxidation in levels that are unquantifiable with peroxide value, but also allows for the determination of oil oxidation mechanisms. From the analysis of marketed canola oils, photo-oxidized products (i.e., OO-(10-HpODE)-TG and OO-(12-HpODE)-TG) were characteristically accumulated compared to the oil analyzed immediately after production. The method described in this paper is valuable in the understanding of oil and food oxidation mechanisms, and may be applied to the development of preventive methods against food deterioration.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Food chemistry: new method probes how oils go rancid</title><p id="Par2">Edible oils become rancid when reacting with oxygen under light or heat, degrading into different products depending on the pathway. Kiyotaka Nakagawa at Tohoku University, Japan, and co-workers used instruments that can separate and identify by weight components in mixtures to study light- and heat-induced oxidation of canola oil. Using authentic samples of possible oxidation products as references, the team found that each process generated two unique species from triacylglycerol, the main ingredient in edible oils. These signature compounds allowed the researchers to reveal that heat-oxidation sped up as temperature increased and that light-oxidized products gradually accumulated in off-the-shelf canola oil after production. This method is more sensitive than conventional protocols and can tell exactly how oils are oxidized, useful for developing techniques for food preservation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Industry</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Edible oil is an essential food ingredient that is mainly composed of triacylglycerol (TG), and is widely used in various food products.

And this is the reason why the determination/quantification of edible oil oxidation is very difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Hence, we first determined the most suitable TGOOH molecular species for the evaluation of canola oil oxidation mechanisms. Based on GC analysis, it was identified that the main fatty acids that compose canola oil TG were OA (59.7%), LA (20.0%), and linolenic acid (LnA) (8.9%) (Data not shown).
