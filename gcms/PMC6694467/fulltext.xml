Red blood cells can regulate NO bioavailability through an intrinsic nitrite (NO<sub>2&#x02212;</sub>) reductase mechanism that generates NO during physiological and pathological hypoxia. In contrast, red blood cell hemolysis releases hemoglobin into plasma, where can react with and scavenge NO. In this context, hemoglobin functions as an oxido-reductase: A nitrite-reductase and NO synthase when it deoxygenates and an NO oxidase when it is oxygenated, particularly in the setting of hemolysis. The mechanistic linkage between hemolytic anemia and vasculopathy has been the subject of extensive study in pre-clinical animal models, in vascular studies in patients, and in large human cohort studies. Intravascular hemolysis releases cell-free hemoglobin into the plasma, which can scavenge NO and generate reactive oxygen species, impairing redox balance and leading to proliferative systemic and pulmonary vasculopathy. Pre-clinical studies also suggest that sGC may be oxidized in sickle cell disease, and responsive to sGC activator therapy. It has also been recently appreciated that products released from the red cell during hemolysis, including heme released from hemoglobin, can be considered danger associated molecular pattern molecules or erythrocyte &#x0201c;DAMPs&#x0201d; (eDAMPs). Large screening studies of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) for the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) have been performed using non-invasive Doppler-echocardiography, screening biomarkers such as N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide and right heart catheterization. These studies have reported a high prevalence of PH in this population, a significant association of increasing pulmonary pressures with more severe hemolytic anemia, cutaneous leg ulcerations, systemic systolic hypertension and renal dysfunction, and a high prospective associated risk of death. These studies support a more general pathological role for intravascular hemolysis and cell-free hemoglobin in various human diseases and in transfusion medicine.<list list-type="order"><title>References</title><list-item><p id="Par3">Ataga KI, Moore CG, Jones S, Olajide O, Strayhorn D, Hinderliter A, Orringer EP.

As such, sGC stimulators may provide therapeutic benefits in diseases with impaired NO signaling. Many neurodegenerative diseases have associated neurovascular impairment and inflammation that could be modulated with a CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator.</p><p id="Par19"><bold>Methods:</bold> Despite the promise of this mechanism in the treatment of CNS diseases, there have been limited pharmacological tools available to modulate this pathway in the CNS. To evaluate the effects of a CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator (IW-6463), we conducted a series of nonclinical studies.</p><p id="Par20"><bold>Results:</bold> IW-6463 suppressed markers of neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro, enhanced fMRI-BOLD signals in brain regions associated with cognition, and increased qEEG gamma band signals in rodents.

These nonclinical data support the hypothesis that CNS-penetrant sGC stimulators could potentially afford therapeutic benefit for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="Par21"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the association of impaired NO/sGC signalling with neurodegenerative diseases and the thorough nonclinical evaluation of IW-6463, we recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of IW-6463 in single- and multiple-ascending dose studies in healthy human volunteers.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>S 1-03 Efficacy and safety of riociguat in patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis: results from the RISE-SSc study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Melanie Hemmrich<sup>1</sup>, Oliver Distler<sup>2</sup>, Yannick Allanore<sup>3</sup>, Christopher P Denton<sup>4</sup>, Masataka Kuwana<sup>5</sup>, Marco Matucci-Cerinic<sup>6</sup>, Janet E Pope<sup>7</sup>, Janethe de Oliveira Pena<sup>8</sup>, Kaisa Laapas<sup>9</sup>, Zhen Yao<sup>10</sup>, Dinesh Khanna<sup>11</sup></title><sec id="Sec11"><title><sup>1</sup>Bayer AG, Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; <sup>3</sup>Rheumatology A Department, Cochin Hospital, Paris Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris Cit&#x000e9;, Paris, France; <sup>4</sup>UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom; <sup>5</sup>Department of Allergy and Rheumatology, Nippon Medical School Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; <sup>6</sup>Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy; <sup>7</sup>Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of Western Ontario, St. Joseph&#x02019;s Health Care, London, Ontario, Canada; <sup>8</sup>Bayer US LLC, Whippany, New Jersey, United States of America; <sup>9</sup>StatFinn Oy, Espoo, Finland; <sup>10</sup>Bayer Healthcare Co.

The sGC stimulator rio showed vasodilatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling properties in animal models and efficacy in patients (pts) with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. It was therefore hypothesized that rio might provide benefit in pts with dcSSc. We present results from the RISE-SSc study (NCT02283762) of rio in pts with early dcSSc.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Methods:</bold> Inclusion criteria were: dcSSc (by 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria; LeRoy criteria), disease duration &#x02264;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;months, modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) &#x02265;&#x02009;10 and &#x02264;&#x02009;22 units (range 0&#x02013;51, higher score is worse), forced vital capacity (FVC)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;45% of predicted (%pred), and diffusing capacity of the lung for CO&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40% pred at screening. Pts were randomized to pbo or rio (0.5&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;mg 3 times daily). The primary endpoint was change in mRSS from baseline (BL) to Week 52 (Wk52). Secondary endpoints included ACR Combined Response Index SSc (ACR CRISS), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and change in FVC%pred. A prespecified exploratory analysis of mRSS progression rate (increase of &#x0003e;&#x02009;5 units and &#x02265;&#x02009;25% from BL) and a post hoc analysis of lung function decline (FVC %pred decline&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10% absolute) were performed. Further exploratory efficacy endpoints included changes in Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon (RP) and digital ulcer (DU) burden.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 121 pts (rio n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60, pbo n&#x02009;=&#x02009;61) were randomized (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD age 51&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;years; 76% female). BL mRSS was comparable between rio and pbo (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD 16.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.4 and 16.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1). At Wk52, mRSS was 14.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6 (rio) vs 15.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.5 (pbo) (difference of least squares means [95% CI] &#x02212;&#x02009;2.3 [&#x02212;&#x02009;5.0, 0.3], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08). mRSS progression rate favored rio (&#x02212;&#x02009;18% [&#x02212;&#x02009;33.6, &#x02212;&#x02009;2.4], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 [Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel method]). ACR CRISS, HAQ DI, and FVC%pred showed no significant difference between the arms. At Wk52, lung function declined in 11% of rio pts vs 20% of pbo pts. Numeric trends of improvement of RP attacks/symptoms and prevention of new DU were seen with rio vs with pbo. Fewer serious adverse events occurred with rio vs pbo (15% vs 25% of pts, respectively). No new safety signals were observed.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The primary efficacy endpoint of mean change in mRSS did not reach statistical significance. Exploratory data showed signals for reduction of skin disease progression, and less decline of lung function, with rio in this early dcSSc population. There was a numeric trend toward reduced RP symptoms with rio compared with pbo, and vascular outcomes suggest that rio may reduce development of new DU recurrence in early dcSSc.</p><p id="Par27"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> Funding for this study was provided by Bayer and Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>S 2-01 Targeting the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase to combat malaria</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>David Baker</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London, UK</title><sec id="Sec16"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> David Baker - david.baker@lshtm.ac.uk</title><p id="Par28"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>S 2-01</p><p id="Par29"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Large-scale investment in malaria control programmes prior to the turn of the millennium led to very impressive reductions in the global numbers of cases of malaria and associated mortality. However, since 2015 the numbers have reached a plateau with more than 400,000 deaths each year, mainly amongst young children and pregnant women in developing countries. One of the reasons for this halt in progress is widespread drug resistance which makes it urgent to find new drugs that target alternative biochemical pathways in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. One promising target under investigation is the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) which is essential in all the key stages of the complex parasite life cycle [1]. It was observed firstly in related apicomplexan parasites (<italic>Eimeria</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>) by a team at Merck that the parasite PKG has a key difference to mammalian PKG in the ATP binding site- it has a relatively small gatekeeper residue (a threonine) that was hypothesised to allow selective binding of certain inhibitor scaffolds [2].</p><p id="Par30"><bold>Methods:</bold> A UK Medical Research Council-funded medicinal chemistry programme led by the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine and LifeArc, focused on optimisation of an imidazopyridine scaffold (developed by Merck to treat <italic>Eimeria</italic> infections in chickens) against the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>.</p><p id="Par31"><bold>Results:</bold> The most potent compound (ML10) from our programme [3] inhibited the kinase activity of recombinant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PKG with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 160&#x000a0;pM and importantly blocked blood stage malaria parasite development (which causes all the symptoms of malaria) in vitro with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 2.1&#x000a0;nM. Furthermore ML10 has potent activity against sexual development (EC<sub>50</sub> 41.3&#x000a0;nM) which is prerequisite for malaria transmission to mosquitoes. In vivo proof of concept for PKG as an antimalarial target was achieved with ML10 using an immunodeficient <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mouse model through partnership with GSK scientists in Tres Cantos. In collaboration with a team at the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, a co-crystal structure of a malaria parasite PKG with ML10 was obtained revealing the intimate contacts that underlie the observed exquisite potency and selectivity and also confirming the necessity of the interaction with the small hydrophobic pocket conferred by the small gatekeeper residue that is unique to the apicomplexan parasite PKGs.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Further work will be needed to optimise this promising series.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> We are grateful to the UK Medical Research Council, The Wellcome Trust, The Structural Genomics Consortium and the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation for funding this work.</p><p id="Par34">

However, function and regulation of <italic>Pf</italic>PKG are largely unknown. Previous studies showed that the domain organization of PfPKG significantly differs from human PKG (<italic>h</italic>PKG) and indicated a critical role of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain D (CNB-D) (Kim et al. PLoS Pathog 2015).</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Methods:</bold>
<italic>Pf</italic>PKG was recombinantly expressed lacking the putative pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory sequence (IS) and containing only the CNB-D and the catalytic domain. Kinase activity was determined using a coupled spectrophotometric assay. Activation constants&#x000a0;(Kact) were determined using a micro-fluidic mobility-shift assay. cGMP-bding was quantified using Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence polarization (FP).</p><p id="Par41"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified a novel mechanism, where the CNB-D controls activation and regulation of the parasite specific protein kinase (Franz et al.&#x000a0;ACS Infect Dis. 2018). <italic>Pf</italic>PKG, lacking the IS and containing only the CNB-D is catalytically inactive in the absence of cGMP and be can efficiently activated with cGMP. These observations indicate that kinase regulation is not dependent on an IS, as reported for human PKG. On the basis of structural evidence of the isolated CNB-D (Kim et al. PLoS Pathog 2015) and full length <italic>Pf</italic>PKG (PDB 5DYK), we describe a regulatory mechanism, whereby cGMP binding to the CNB-D induces a conformational change involving the &#x003b1;C-helix of the CNB-D. The inactive state is defined by a unique interaction between Asp597 of the catalytic domain and Arg528 of the &#x003b1;C-helix. The same arginine (Arg528), however, stabilizes cGMP binding by interacting with Tyr480 of the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) in the active state of <italic>Pf</italic>PKG. Consequently, deletion constructs of <italic>h</italic>PKG were generated, lacking the IS and CNB-A. Both, type I and II <italic>h</italic>PKG proteins were constitutively active in the presence or absence of cAMP indicating a different regulatory mechanism than <italic>Pf</italic>PKG, where the IS seems to be required for regulation.</p><p id="Par42"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results unveil fundamental differences in the activation mechanism between <italic>Pf</italic>PKG and <italic>h</italic>PKG, building the basis for the development of strategies for targeted drug design in order to fight malaria.</p><p id="Par43"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> F.W.H. is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG HE 1818/10).</p><p id="Par44">

Host cell entry and egress are key steps in the lytic cycle of this obligate intracellular parasite that ensure its survival and dissemination. Egress is temporally orchestrated, underpinned by the exocytosis of secretory organelles called micronemes. At any point during intracellular replication, deleterious environmental changes like loss of host cell integrity can trigger egress (1) via the activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) (2).</p><p id="Par49">Intriguingly, we have known for years that even in the absence of alerting, extrinsic signals triggering egress, the number of divisions of the parasite in a single host cell is limited. Egress occurs after 5 to 6 cycles of asexual multiplication. This programmed egress could be due to a mechanical breakage of the host cell plasma membrane containing enlarged vacuole resulting in leak out of potassium and induction of egress. Alternatively, an intrinsic signal produced by the parasite could control and govern the maximum number of cycles before egress.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Methods:</bold> We combined the genetic tractability of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> with biological and biochemical approaches to unravel the nature of the intrinsic signal and the associated signaling cascade that govern egress.</p><p id="Par51"><bold>Results:</bold> We could show that diacylglycerol kinase 2 (DGK2) is secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole where it produces phosphatidic acid (PA). PA acts as an intrinsic signal eliciting natural egress upstream of an atypical guanylate cyclase (GC) uniquely conserved in alveolates and ciliates and composed of a P4-ATPase and two GC catalytic domains (3&#x02013;5). The GC produces cytosolic cGMP that serves as initiator of the entire signalling cascade leading to egress. Assembly of GC at the plasma membrane depends on two associated cofactors, cell division control 50.1 (CDC50.1) and unique GC organizer (UGO) (5).</p><p id="Par52"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study reveals the existence of a signaling platform responding to an intrinsic lipid mediator and extrinsic alarming signals to control programmed and induced egress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Toxoplasma gondii and Egress.

It has been demonstrated that the type I&#x003b1; isoform can be constitutively activated by oxidizing conditions. However, the amino acid residues implicated in this phenomenon are not fully elucidated. To investigate the molecular basis for this mechanism, we studied the effects of oxidation using recombinant WT, truncated, and mutant constructs of PKG I.</p><p id="Par62"><bold>Methods:</bold> PKG I constructs were expressed in <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system. Mutants of PKG I were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Constructs were purified by Ni-IMAC, and the N-terminal hexahistide tag was cleaved with TEV protease. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dilutions were freshly prepared before experiments, and concentrations were determined by adsorption spectroscopy. Interprotomer disulfide formation was visualized by 4&#x02013;12% SDS-PAGE. Activities of reduced and oxidized PKG I constructs were determined by an in vitro phosphotransferase assay using a synthetic peptide substrate. PKG-dependent activation of K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1 was measured by inside-out patch clamp using murine&#x000a0;vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from anterior and posterior pial and superior cerebellar arteries. Cysteine oxidation states were determined by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="Par63"><bold>Results:</bold> Using an in vitro assay, we observed that oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) resulted in constitutive, cGMP-independent activation of PKG I&#x003b1;. PKG I&#x003b1; C42S and a truncation construct that does not contain Cys-42 (&#x00394;53 PKG I) were both constitutively activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, oxidation of PKG I&#x003b1; C117S maintained its cGMP-dependent activation characteristics, although oxidized PKG I&#x003b1; C195S did not. To corroborate these results, we also tested the effects of our constructs on the PKG I&#x003b1;-specific substrate, the large conductance potassium channel (K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1). Application of WT PKG I&#x003b1; activated by either cGMP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the open probabilities of the channel. Neither cGMP nor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activation of PKG I&#x003b1; C42S significantly increased channel open probabilities. Moreover, cGMP-stimulated PKG I&#x003b1; C117S increased K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1 activity, but this effect was not observed under oxidizing conditions. Finally, we observed that PKG I&#x003b1;&#x000a0;C42S caused channel flickers, indicating dramatically altered K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1 channel characteristics compared with channels exposed to WT PKG I&#x003b1;.</p><p id="Par64"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cumulatively, these results indicate that constitutive activation of PKG I&#x003b1; proceeds through oxidation of Cys-117 and further suggest that the formation of a sulfur acid is necessary for this phenotype.</p><p id="Par65"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> We would like to thank Werner Tegge (Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI), Braunschweig, Germany) for synthesizing the W15 peptide substrate used in the phosphotransferase assays.

The lack of structural information on the PKG holoenzyme has hindered a detailed understanding of its regulation, though the holoenzyme structure for cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) suggests plausible models for PKG regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) domain interactions in the inhibited state.</p><p id="Par71"><bold>Methods:</bold> We determined a crystal structure of PKG I&#x003b2; holoenzyme complex at 2.3&#x000a0;&#x000c5; that enables us to visualize the R&#x02013;C interface of PKG I&#x003b2; of the inhibited state for the first time.</p><p id="Par72"><bold>Results:</bold> We crystallized a monomeric PKG I&#x003b2; that lacks the dimerization domain, but the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a twofold symmetric dimer. The interfaces formed between PKG R and C domains are similar to those seen in the PKA I&#x003b1; holoenzyme with the inhibitor sequence docked to the active site cleft.

</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the light of previous PKG structural biology, this structure suggests that the PKG inhibited and activated states are stabilized by mutually exclusive domain&#x02013;domain contacts that either occlude or expose the active site. Our previous structure of the activated state of the isolated PKG I&#x003b2; regulatory domain [1] identified a dimer formed by R&#x02013;R domain interactions (mediated in part by interfacial cGMP). Results from other studies [2&#x02013;4] suggest how these domain&#x02013;domain contacts might be differentially stabilized by cyclic nucleotide binding, and how conformational changes associated with nucleotide binding might bias the topology of each full-length monomer towards or away from the trans-inhibited dimer state. Because of sequence differences, PKG lacks some key local contacts that stabilize the PKA holoenzyme R&#x02013;C interface, perhaps because PKA must overcome mass action to inactivate its catalytic domain, whereas native PKG is already pre-assembled as a dimer. These differences provide starting points for rationally modulating the PKG activation constant by mutagenesis to dissect the details of the mechanism of activation. The quaternary assembly seen in the trans-inhibiting dimer of PKG I&#x003b2; differs significantly from other kinases, suggesting a unique regulation mechanism for PKG I with implications for the kinetics, cooperativity, CNB domain nucleotide selectivity, and isotype-specificity of activation.</p><p id="Par74"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This project was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 GM090161 (CK) and by National Institutes of Health Grant RO1 HL132141 (DEC).

GC-A is basally phosphorylated on multiple serines and threonines and dephosphorylation renders the enzyme unresponsive to NP stimulation. We generated a knock-in mouse called GC-A<sup>8E/8E</sup> where glutamates were substituted for the eight conserved phosphorylation sites in GC-A to mimic a constitutively phosphorylated enzyme that is activated normally by NPs but cannot be inactivated by dephosphorylation to determine which processes are regulated by changes in GC-A phosphorylation (2).</p><p id="Par82"><bold>Methods:</bold> CRISPR&#x02013;CAS9 technology was used to generate the GC-A<sup>8E/8E</sup> mice.

In contrast, the hearts of the male, but not female, mutant mice were 12% smaller than hearts from wild type animals, which was explained in part by a decrease in cardiomyocyte area. Male 12&#x02013;13&#x000a0;week old GC-A<sup>WT/WT</sup> and GC-A<sup>8E/8E</sup> mice were also assessed for body composition by EchoMRI. Male GC-A<sup>8E/8E</sup> mice have a 30% reduction in percent fat mass compared to GC-A<sup>WT/WT</sup> mice, whereas, lean mass and free water mass was unchanged between the wild type and mutant mice. The male GC-A<sup>8E/8E</sup> mice also had less total mass than wild type mice (Fig.&#x000a0;8D), which was accounted for by the decreased fat mass. Finally, serum testosterone levels were 25% higher in the mutant compared to the wild type mice.</p><p id="Par84"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Increased GC-A activity results in decreased heart size, increased adiposity and increase testosterone levels in male mice.

Using out real time imaging techniques, we could show that uniform CNP membrane localisation leads to CNP/GC-B/cGMP signals which diffuse over long distances inside the cell, whereas ANP/GC-A/cGMP signals are highly confined to T-tubular microdomains by local pools of PDE2 activity.</p><p id="Par105"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This provides a clear molecular basis and explains distinct functional effects engaged by the two natriuretic peptide receptors in the heart.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>S 3-04 NP/NO regulation of cardiac sympathetic drive</title><sec id="Sec46"><title>David J.

We tested whether phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A), which regulates the action of BNP-activated cGMP, was directly involved in modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling from stellate ganglia (SG) neurons and cardiac norepinephrine (NE) release in rats and humans with an enhanced sympathetic phenotype. We also tested whether gene knockdown of PDE2A or overexpression of neuronal NO could rescue the sympathetic phenotype.</p><p id="Par108"><bold>Methods:</bold> Stellate ganglia (SG) were harvested from patients undergoing stellectomy for sympathetic hyperactivity or from donor patients for molecular profiling (Western analysis and qRT-PCR). In rats predisposed to hypertension and their controls, stellate ganglia were also isolated for bulk and single cell RNAseq. An adenoviral vector expressing PDE2A or catalytically inactive PDE2A (dnPDE2A) tagged with red fluorescent protein mCherry was transduced into cultured rat cardiac sympathetic neurons (for calcium current and transient measurements). An adenoviral vector expressing only mCherry was used as a control for comparing the effect of viral transduction following application of BNP. cGMP, cAMP and PKA were measured using FRET sensors (Gi500, pfPKG, H187 AKAR). A viral vector encoding a noradrenergic promotor for nNOS or its adaptor protein was given in vivo in diseased and normal rats to establish if neurotransmission could be normalised.</p><p id="Par109"><bold>Results:</bold> PDE2A was upregulated in stellate ganglia from both human and rat diseased ganglia. Single cell seq also revealed the presence of PDE2A in <italic>Th</italic> positive neurons. nNOS, sGC and cGMP was decreased in stellate ganglia from pre-hypertensive rats. This was associated with increased conductance of I<sub>CaN</sub> (Cav 2.2), increased calcium transients and neurotransmission. Diseased neurons also had a blunted response to cGMP to increasing concentrations of BNP. Similarly overexpression of PDE2A in healthy neurons recaptulated the diseased cellular phenotype. Inhibition of PDE2A with BAY 60-7550 or dnPDE2A restored calcium balance and neurotransmission in diseased neurons. Gene transfer of nNOS or the adaptor protein to nNOS (CAPON) also rescued abnormal transmission in diseased neurons.</p><p id="Par110"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest that impaired second messenger signalling coupled to dysregulation of PDE2A is linked to abnormal sympathetic hyperactivity in states associated with hypertension and heart failure.

Neprilysin degrades multiple circulating peptides, but the presumed mechanism of benefit of sacubitril occurs via prevention of natriuretic peptide (NP) degradation, leading to augmentation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling. The potential additive effects of sacubitril on top of angiotensin receptor blocker blockade with valsartan remain poorly understood. Further, the specific requirement of PKG for the cardiovascular effects of Sac/Val in presure overload are unknown. We previously demonstrated that mutation of the PKGI alpha leucine zipper protein interaction domain blocks the anti-remodeling effects of the cGMP augmenting drug sildenafil in left ventricular (LV) pressure overload [2]. The current study tested the hypothesis that the PKGI&#x003b1; LZ domain also mediates the anti-remodeling effects of Sac/Val in LV pressure overload.</p><p id="Par118"><bold>Methods:</bold> We subjected 12&#x000a0;week old wild type (WT) or PKG Leucine Zipper Mutant (LZM) mice to 56&#x000a0;day&#x000a0;LV pressure overload by moderate (26G) transaortic constriction (TAC) or to sham surgery. At 14&#x000a0;days post-TAC, mice were randomized mice to vehicle (Veh), valsartan (Val, 52&#x000a0;mg/kg/day), and Sac/Val (50&#x000a0;mg/kg/day Sac, 52&#x000a0;mg/kg/day Val) by gavage. At day 56, echocardiography, LV invasive hemodynamics, and organ harvest were performed.</p><p id="Par119"><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with WT mice, LZM TAC mice developed worse LV fractional shortening (FS) from day 14 to day 56, as well as increases in LV end diastolic dimension, indicating more severe response to TAC. In WT TAC mice, both Val and Sac/Val reduced LV hypertrophy to the same degree. However, in WT mice only Sac/Val, but not Val, improved LV FS compared with vehicle, indicating an additive effect of sacubitril to valsartan alone. In LZM TAC mice, Sac/Val also improved LV FS, whereas Val alone did not improve this parameter. Sac/Val, but not Val, also improved invasive measures of LV systolic function in LZM TAC mice, compared with vehicle or with Val. When compared by genotype, Sac/Val induced identical improvements in LV end systolic diameter and in LV FS between WT and LZM mice.</p><p id="Par120"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings indicate a selective effect of Sac/Val versus Val alone on LV function in moderate pressure overload. Mutation of the PKGI&#x003b1; LZ domain induces a more severe TAC phenotype but does not abolish the effect of Sac/Val on LV function. These findings support that the PKGI&#x003b1; LZ domain does not mediate effects of Sac/Val in TAC, and suggest that signaling other than the NP-cGMP-PKGIa axis may mediate the benefit of neprilysin inhibition in HF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Similar effects of sacubitril/valsartan on LV function in wild type and in PKGIa LZ mutant mice. <bold>a</bold> End systolic diameter (ESD) on Day 14 (start of drug) or Day 56 (final day of drug) in WT and PKG LZ mutant mice treated with vehicle, valsartan, or sacubitril/valsartan. <bold>b</bold> Fractional shortening (FS%) on Day 14 or Day 56 in WT and PKG LZ mutant mice treated with vehicle, valsartan, or sacubitri/valsartan. *p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 WT day 56 vs WT day 14; <sup>#</sup>p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06 LZM day 56 vs LZM day 14; <sup>&#x02020;</sup>p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 LZM day 56 vs LZM day 14. <bold>c</bold> Summary data for absolute and relative change in LV fractional shortening from day 14 to day 56. *p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

Malfunctioning of the kinase has severe consequences and results for example in elevated blood pressure and abnormalities in smooth muscle contraction. Recently, a missense variant of PKG I&#x003b1; with replacement of valine at position 219 by isoleucine (V219I) was identified in a patient with congenital heart disease presenting with aortic aneurism and dilation of the aortic root.</p><p id="Par138"><bold>Methods:</bold> Full-length human PKG I&#x003b1; wildtype and V219I mutant (<italic>h</italic>PKG I&#x003b1; WT/V219I) were recombinantly expressed in HEK 293T cells and purified using Strep-Tactin superflow agarose. Kinase activity and activation were measured by an enzyme-coupled photometric assay according to Cook et al. (1982). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) direct binding assays were performed with <italic>h</italic>PKG I&#x003b1; WT and V219I as ligand and cGMP as analyte.

The activation and kinase activity as well as the binding kinetics of cGMP were monitored in comparison to the wildtype (WT) protein. While our studies demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the mutant protein does not differ from WT, it could be shown that the mutation impacts on the activation constants and the cGMP binding kinetics.

Loss of dystrophin compromises neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) signaling, which contributes to skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction. Approaches that enhance or restore nNOS signaling reduce dystrophic pathology in murine mdx models of DMD; therefore, enhancing nNOS signaling has potential as a stand-alone therapy or as an adjunct therapy to improve the efficacy of genetic approaches that do not restore nNOS. However, we currently lack an effective pharmacological approach to increase nNOS signaling in muscle. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an important target and effector of nNOS in skeletal muscle. Allosteric sGC agonists called sGC stimulators are under development as a novel approach for increasing NO-cGMP signaling and are currently used clinically to treat pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, we hypothesized that sGC stimulation would ameliorate skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology in mdx mice.</p><p id="Par146"><bold>Methods:</bold> To test our hypothesis, we randomly assigned young or aged mdx mice to vehicle or sGC stimulator treatment for 2&#x02013;16&#x000a0;weeks and analyzed the impact of sGC stimulation on dystrophic skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology.</p><p id="Par147"><bold>Results:</bold> In the skeletal muscles of mdx mice, sGC stimulation promoted muscle cell growth, as well as reduced muscle damage and susceptibility to lengthening contraction-induced injury and post-exercise fatigue. In addition, sGC stimulation increased thoracic diaphragm movement and reduced some breathing irregularities. In aged cardiac muscle, sGC stimulation opposed hypertrophic left ventricle remodeling and indices of diastolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, reductions in skeletal muscle pathology were associated with substantial decreases in macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines. sGC stimulation also decreased fibrosis, and this anti-fibrotic effect was most prominent in cardiac muscle. Improved muscle integrity and function was not due to increased utrophin expression.</p><p id="Par148"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In summary, these data provide pre-clinical proof-of-concept that sGC stimulation ameliorates skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology in mdx mice. In addition, these data provide important new insights into the role of NO-cGMP signaling in dystrophic pathogenesis that have important implications for the therapeutic potential of cGMP-targeted therapies for DMD. This new understanding provides a compelling rationale for the clinical testing of sGC stimulators as a novel therapy for DMD.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec69"><title>S 5-01 Designing an allosteric switch: lessons learned from PKA</title><sec id="Sec70"><title>Susan S.

While they are close homologs that share a common domain organization and conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domains and are both allosterically regulated by cyclic nucleotides, they also have fundamental differences. PKG, like most other protein kinases, has the regulatory and catalytic domains on a single protomer while PKA is unique in having a &#x0201c;split protomer&#x0201d;. Having separate regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits each having multiple genes and/or splice variants provides a wide range of combinatorial diversity. In addition, there are many levels of cross talk between heterologous kinases including PKA and PKG. While we have learned a great deal from single R and C subunits in PKA, it is not until one sees the R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> holoenzymes that one can appreciate the remarkable full range of allosteric activation as well as the structural diversity of the RI and RII holoenzymes. Disease mutations in the RIa subunit, in particular, are a treasure chest of information that emphasizes the complexity of the allosteric network. Some of these mutations are activating and lead to <italic>Carney Complex Disease</italic> while others are inhibitory and lead to <italic>Acrodysostosis</italic>. In addition to these phenotypic differences is the tissue specificity where unique isoforms are expressed. To appreciate this complexity requires an interdisciplinary strategy that goes from molecules to cells to tissues to animals and includes not only structural biology but also cell biology, pharmacology and physiology.</p><p id="Par151"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> Funded in part by NIH grants DK54441 and GM130389 to sst.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>S 5-02 Phosphodiesterase 2 promotes nitric oxide/guanylyl cyclase/cGMP signalling in heart failure</title><sec id="Sec74"><title>Michael E.

Cyclic guanosine 3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-monophosphate (cGMP) helps preserve cardiac structure and function, and impaired cGMP signaling contributes to HF pathophysiology. Cyclic GMP concentrations are regulated by synthetic pathways&#x02014;triggered by natriuretic peptide- (NP) or nitric oxide- (NO) sensitive guanylyl cyclases (GCs)&#x02014;in cooperation with degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The expression and activity of PDE2 is up-regulated in HF, but a causative role for this isoform in pathogenesis has not been established. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological inhibition of PDE2 promotes the cardioprotective effects of cGMP in HF, and sought to determine whether this is dependent on NP/GC-A or NO/GC-1&#x003b1; signaling.</p><p id="Par154"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), GC-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and GC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (21&#x02013;23&#x000a0;g) were anesthetized (1.5% isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub>) and abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) performed by tying a 4-0 thread against a 25-gauge needle at the suprarenal level.

Atrial (ANP) and brain (BNP) natriuretic peptide mediate their effects preferentially through the natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A, and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) through NPR-B. NPRs are membrane bound guanylyl cyclases that increase cyclic GMP (cGMP) production when activated. We have previously shown that NPR-B stimulation by CNP enhances &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR)- and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> serotonin receptor-mediated signaling in failing hearts, probably through inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, a potential detrimental effect in the failing heart. In this study we examine the role of PDE2 and PDE3 in regulating the CNP-induced enhancement of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> signaling in non-failing (Sham) and failing (HF) hearts.PDE2 is a dual-selective PDE and can potentially be stimulated by cGMP.</p><p id="Par160"><bold>Methods:</bold> Chronic heart failure was induced in male Wistar rats by 6-week coronary artery ligation. Contractility studies were performed ex vivo in left ventricular muscle strips in the presence of appropriate receptor agonist and antagonists. cGMP measurements were performed on isolated left ventricular cardiomyocytes and PDE activity assays on left ventricular cardiomyocyte homogenates.</p><p id="Par161"><bold>Results:</bold> CNP, by stimulating NPR-B, was able to enhance &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR- and 5-HT<sub>4</sub>-mediated inotropic responses in Sham and HF left ventricular strips. CNP elicited a similar increase of cGMP in cardiomyocytes from Sham and HF. cGMP reduced the cAMP-PDE activity of PDE3 and increased the cAMP-PDE activity of PDE2 concentration-dependently in cardiomyocyte homogenates in a similar way in Sham and HF. In Sham inhibition of PDE2 by EHNA amplified the CNP-induced enhancement of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR- and 5-HT<sub>4</sub>-mediated inotropic responses. In HF PDE2 inhibition did not influence the functional effects of CNP despite increasing the cGMP response to the same marked extent as in Sham.</p><p id="Par162"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is a preserved mechanism of CNP-induced enhancement of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> in Sham and HF. cGMP levels and cGMP-mediated activation and inhibition of cAMP-PDE activity of PDE2 and PDE3, respectively, are similar in Sham and HF. However, PDE2 seems more involved in regulating the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AR and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> enhancement in Sham compared to HF, which might reflect differences between Sham and HF in PDE2 and cyclic nucleotide compartmentation.</p><p id="Par163">A version of this abstract was previously published in the proceedings from the 7th International Conference on cGMP Generators, Effectors and Therapeutic Implications [1].</p><p id="Par164">

CVD is closely linked to dysregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration, which has been strongly implicated in both the progression of plaque formation, and neointimal hyperplasia following clinical intervention. The nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway plays a central protective role in vascular biology [1&#x02013;5]. NO signaling leads to increased VSMC differentiation and relaxation through activation of its receptor soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), leading to the generation of the second messenger cGMP. NO-cGMP signaling also potently inhibits VSMC migration and invasion. Consequently, activating the NO-cGMP pathway has led to decreased neointimal hyperplasia in several animal models.</p><p id="Par168"><bold>Results:</bold> Recent work in our lab has identified a novel VASP-Rac1 pathway regulating sGC expression and cGMP signaling in brown adipocytes: mice deficient of VASP have increased Rac1 activity, leading to increased sGC expression and promoting adipogenic differentiation. We therefore investigated the role of VASP and Rac1 in cGMP signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells. Surprisingly, although Rac1 activation increased sGC expression in murine VSMCs, VASP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have normal vascular cGMP signaling. Analysis of mice expressing constitutively active Rac1 under the control of the smooth muscle-specific Acta2 promoter also failed to show any differences in NO-mediated vascular relaxation. However, activation of Rac1 in human VSMCs strongly reduced both sGC protein and mRNA expression.</p><p id="Par169"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our preliminary data indicate that activation of Rac1 reduces sGC expression in human VSMCs through interference with specific Notch ligand&#x02013;receptor interactions.</p><p id="Par170">

We seek structural insight into signal transduction; mechanism in drug-based stimulation; regulation through transmembrane protein CD47; and the role of sGC and NO in promoting breast cancer progression. Here, we focus on biophysical measurements of signal transduction in GC1 and provide the first model for stimulator compound binding.</p><p id="Par179"><bold>Methods:</bold> Much of our biophysical data are with GC1 from the tobacco hornworm/hawkmoth. Hawkmoth GC1 is highly homologous to mammalian GC1 and responds to GC1 stimulatory compounds. One focus is on a family of truncated GC1 proteins that lack cyclase domains but respond to stimulator compounds, referred to as GC1-NT. GC1-NT constructs can be produced in large quantity and provide many advantages for structure/function studies. Studies with bacterial H-NOX proteins and mammalian GC1 are also included.</p><p id="Par180"><bold>Results:</bold> NO and CO binding display linked equilibria with stimulator compound binding to GC1-NT, with binding of one enhancing binding of the other. Using photolabile stimulators, mass spectrometry and GC1-NT, we identified the binding pocket for stimulator compounds, which includes a heme-domain pocket. We also found that bacterial homologues of the GC1 heme domain (H-NOX proteins) bind to stimulator compounds. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have determined a full model for compound binding to the H-NOX from <italic>Shewanella woodyi</italic>. Mutations introduced into the binding pocket of GC1-NT confirm its role in compound binding and one such mutation mimics compound action, including tightened CO affinity and generation of a geminate recombination phase after CO photolysis. A crystal structure of an H-NOX protein with mimetic mutation indicate the changes due to mutation are small.</p><p id="Par181">Additional studies suggest signal transduction proceeds through the GC1 coiled-coil &#x02018;signaling helix&#x02019;, the domain with the highest sequence homology among GC1 proteins. Studies of GC1-NT with modified coiled-coil domains display altered CO affinity to the GC1 heme and altered kinetics for NO-induced proximal histidine release. Stabilizing the coiled-coil through introduction of a disulfide bond leads to loss of CO affinity.</p><p id="Par182"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We propose a model for signal transduction between heme domain and cyclase domains that requires small but critical rearrangement of the coiled-coil domain. A conserved binding pocket for stimulator compounds has been identified and predominately resides in the heme domain but likely includes the interface with other GC1 domains.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec93"><title>S 6-03 Structural aspects of sGC activation</title><sec id="Sec94"><title>Michael A.

In an exploratory, Phase 2 study in 26 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension on standard of care therapy, 14&#x000a0;days of praliciguat treatment showed positive trends in reducing fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. In animal models, praliciguat distributes broadly to tissues and elicits hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and metabolic effects.</p><p id="Par208"><bold>Methods:</bold> We assessed the metabolic effects of praliciguat in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. DIO mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD) formulated with praliciguat to achieve a C<sub>max</sub> similar to a daily oral administration of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg for 6&#x000a0;weeks. Metabolic assessments began following 1&#x000a0;week of dosing and occurred over the subsequent 5&#x000a0;weeks. Obese mice maintained on control HFD and lean mice maintained on low-fat diet served as controls.

Caloric intake, body weight, and body composition were unaffected by praliciguat treatment. The HFD-induced increase in gene expression of liver tumor necrosis factor &#x00251; (Tnf), lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) in control DIO mice was attenuated in praliciguat-treated DIO mice.

Work from our and other laboratories found that red blood cells (RBCs) play a fundamental role in systemic NO metabolism, produce NO under hypoxic conditions and carry an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). It is unknown whether eNOS-dependent signaling occurs in RBCs and its functional significance in physiology and pathophysiology of RBCs. The talk will present the results of our current investigations aimed to demonstrate that RBCs carry a functional sGC-signaling pathway and to analyze its functional significance in vivo in mice and in clinical cohorts with coronary artery disease (CAD).</p><p id="Par213"><bold>Methods:</bold> We isolated and determined the presence, isoform identity and activity of sGC and of proteins belonging to its downstream signaling pathway, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 and protein kinase G (PKG) in RBC lysates by chromatography, western blot, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic assays using 32P-GTP or coupled to radioimmunoassay (RIA). The NO-dependent stimulation of cellular cGMP levels and VASP phosphorylation was assessed by RIA and western blot.

In patients with stable CAD and endothelial dysfunction, red cell sGC expression/activity and responsiveness to NO is fully preserved, although sGC oxidation is increased in both groups.

Biological effects of NO are mediated by activation of guanylate cyclase (GC). However, mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of NO inhalation after CA/CPR are incompletely understood. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of inhaled NO after CA/CPR.</p><p id="Par224"><bold>Methods:</bold> Effects of NO breathing on outcomes after CA/CPR were studied in adult male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient for the 1&#x003b1; subunit of GC (GC-1&#x003b1;KO). Mice were subjected to potassium chloride-induced cardiac arrest and resuscitated by manual CPR and breathed air or NO in air thereafter. To determine the role of GC in bone marrow (BM)-derived cells in the protective effects of inhaled NO, we subjected chimeric WT mice with WT BM and WT mice with GC-1&#x003b1;KO BM to CA/CPR with or without NO inhalation.

Fibrosis is a pathological feature of most chronic inflammatory diseases. In fibrosis, compared to wound healing, the matrix deposition is excessive resulting in destruction of normal tissue architecture which may lead to organ failure. In fibrogenesis and angiogenesis pericytes play a major role. We have previously shown that pericytes in several different tissue express high amounts of NO-GC.</p><p id="Par229"><bold>Methods:</bold> To characterize the fibrotic response, we performed lineage tracing using cell/promoter-specific expression of the red fluorescent dye tdTomato. We identified several suitable Cre lines to linage trace NO-GC expressing pericytes in several organs (lung, liver, skin and heart). Using confocal microscopy, we traced NO-GC<sup>+</sup>-pericytes during fibrosis in these organs.</p><p id="Par230"><bold>Results:</bold> NO-GC is highly expressed in pericytes, as judged by colocalization with different pericyte markers (desmin, NG2 and PDGFR&#x000df;) and by its perivascular localization. During the fibrotic response, pericytes proliferate in lung, liver and skin. Following CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury NO-GC<sup>+</sup> pericytes respond by migrating into the wounded area and by increasing NO-GC expression. In the lung, bleomycin induced the formation of two types of PDGFR&#x000df;-positive myofibroblasts which differ in NO-GC expression and tissue localization. NO-GC<sup>+</sup> pericytes differentiate into &#x003b1;SMA-expressing myofibroblast which constantly expresses PDGFR&#x003b2; and proliferate within the alveolar wall. We also identified NO-GC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> myofibroblasts which show de novo PDGFR&#x003b2; synthesis and occupy the alveolar space. After repetitive damage, intra-alveolar myofibroblasts disappear whereas NO-GC<sup>+</sup> pericytes remain in the alveolar wall. In both liver and lung, pericyte-specific deletion of NO-GC augmented the severity of CCl<sub>4</sub>/bleomycin-induced fibrosis.</p><p id="Par231"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clearly, NO-GC-expressing pericytes are of paramount importance for wound healing and fibrosis in several different organs.

Indeed, PDE9A inhibitors are under evaluation in clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and schizophrenia. However, little is known about the cGMP signaling cascades regulated by PDE9A. Canonical cGMP signaling in brain follows the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the generation of nitric oxide, which activates soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGMP synthesis.

PDE10A inhibition also suppressed vascular remodeling of human saphenous vein explants ex vivo. In cultured synthetic SMCs, the expression of PDE10A was further induced by growth factors or inflammatory cytokines. PDE10A depletion by RNA interference or PDE10A inhibition attenuated SMC proliferation in vitro with a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and down-regulation of cyclin D1.

Atrial (ANP) and brain NP (BNP) activate NP receptor (NPR)-A and C-type NP (CNP) activates NPR-B. NPRs are membrane bound guanylyl cyclases (GCs) that catalyse the production of cGMP upon activation. These receptors consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD), coiled-coil domain (CCD) and GC domain (GCD). We have previously identified small molecular allosteric enhancers that increased the activity of NPR-A, but not NPR-B.

Compounds ability to modulate the efficacy of BNP and CNP in chimeric NPR-A/NPR-B receptors were investigated in transiently transfected cells and the cGMP production was measured using AlphaScreen assay for cGMP. Modulation of the enzyme activity of the GCD was investigated in substrate-velocity assays in membranes from NPR-A expressing cells and cGMP production was measured by ELISA.

In contrast to effects observed using whole cells, none of the compounds were able to increase the guanylyl cyclase activity in substrate-velocity assays or in cGMP assays using broken cells. Similarly, none of the compounds modulated the affinity of natriuretic peptide binding in membrane preparations but increased the overall affinity of NPR-A to ANP in whole cell binding assays.</p><p id="Par257"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that our allosteric enhancers bind the KHD and a mechanism of action that requires cell integrity.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec145"><title>P2 Safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characterisation of vericiguat: key results from six phase I studies in healthy subjects</title><sec id="Sec146"><title>Michael-Friedrich Boettcher<sup>1</sup>, Dirk Thomas<sup>2</sup>, Wolfgang Mueck<sup>1</sup>, Stephanie Loewen<sup>3</sup>, Erich Arens<sup>6</sup>, Kenichi Yoshikawa<sup>5</sup>, Jane Liu<sup>4</sup>, Corina Becker<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec147"><title><sup>1</sup>Bayer AG, Clinical Pharmacology, Wuppertal, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Bayer AG, Experimental Medicine, Wuppertal, Germany; <sup>3</sup>Chrestos Concept GmbH &#x00026; Co.

<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p id="Par260"><bold>Background:</bold> Vericiguat is a once-daily oral soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) stimulator in clinical development for treatment of chronic heart failure (HF).</p><p id="Par261"><bold>Purpose:</bold> To characterise safety, pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of vericiguat in healthy males. Bioavailability (BA) and effect of food on vericiguat PK were also studied.</p><p id="Par262"><bold>Methods:</bold> Vericiguat (oral solution/immediate-release [IR] tablet) was administered to healthy White, Chinese and Japanese men as single doses (SDs; 0.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg) or multiple doses (MDs; 1.25&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg; once-daily for 7&#x000a0;days) in six phase I studies. Safety, PD and PK profiles of vericiguat were assessed.</p><p id="Par263"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 265 subjects were randomised and 255 completed their respective studies. There were no deaths or serious adverse events (AEs). In the first in human, single-ascending dose study (oral solution, fasted state in White subjects), the most common drug-related AEs in vericiguat-treated subjects were headache (5 [8.9%] vs 0 in placebo) and postural dizziness (5 [8.9%] vs 0 in placebo), consistent with the vasodilatory effect of vericiguat. Increases in heart rate (HR;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;bpm), vasoactive hormones and changes in cardiac impedance were observed at &#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mg vericiguat relative to placebo. The 15&#x000a0;mg dose (oral solution, fasted) was not well tolerated due to exaggerated PD effects of orthostatic reactions in 3 of 4 subjects. Mean vericiguat exposure (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) increased with dose (0.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg: 17.2&#x02013;430&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 273&#x02013;7900&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively).</p><p id="Par264">In the MD study in Japanese subjects, SDs and MDs of 1.25&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg vericiguat for 7&#x000a0;days were well tolerated. Effects of vericiguat on HR corresponded to compensatory increases in HR following expected vasodilation. Vericiguat (IR tablet, fasted state) was rapidly absorbed (median time to reach C<sub>max</sub> [t<sub>max</sub>]: 1.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;h) with low inter-individual variability in exposure. Observed half-life was 18&#x02013;27&#x000a0;h. No evidence for deviation from dose-proportionality was observed. Slight accumulation in AUC was observed with MDs (accumulation indices for AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were 1.40&#x02013;1.66 and 1.16&#x02013;1.44, respectively). In White subjects, administration of vericiguat IR tablet with food increased BA by 19%, reduced PK variability and prolonged vericiguat absorption (median t<sub>max</sub>: 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;h [fasted]; 4&#x000a0;h [fed]).</p><p id="Par265"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SDs and MDs of vericiguat up to 10&#x000a0;mg were generally well tolerated. AEs and PD changes were consistent with the mechanism of action. Vericiguat PK was linear with low inter-individual variability; the half-life indicated suitability for once-daily dosing. The PK, PD and safety profile of vericiguat was in line with the expected effects of an sGC stimulator and consistent across populations studied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Relationship between vericiguat concentrations and hemodynamics/biomarkers.

Soluble GC activators (sGCact) bind and activate apo-sGC independently of NO, resulting in an increase in tissue cGMP levels as well as anti-proliferative and anti-platelet effects. We hypothesize that sGCact might be capable of maintaining beneficial cGMP generation even under CKD-associated oxidative stress conditions.</p><p id="Par272"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated the effects of sGCact on cellular and kidney cGMP production and vasorelaxation in ex vivo and in vivo models. We measured 1/cGMP production of glomeruli from of FRET-sGC mouse kidney slices, 2/quantified isolated renal arteriole relaxation, and 3/renal blood flow and cGMP production from isolated perfused mouse kidney. Finally, 4/we measured in vivo renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance in a rat model of CKD (diabetic and hypertensive ZSF1 rats). In vitro and ex vivo investigations were performed on native sGC and on Apo-sGC.</p><p id="Par273"><bold>Results:</bold> Under basal conditions (in the presence of NO), sGCact did neither increase cGMP production in glomeruli of FRET mice nor potentiate NO-induced cGMP signal. ODQ reduced basal and DEA/NO-induced glomerular cGMP production (from 1.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1 norm AUC to &#x02212;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.3 norm AUC) which was completely recovered by sGCact (2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 norm AUC). Pre-contracted and NO depleted mouse renal arterioles were dilated by sGCact with a greater and faster effect on efferent (100-fold) than on afferent arterioles (70-fold). In pre-contracted and NO depleted isolated perfused mouse kidneys, sGCact dose-dependently improved renal blood flow (RBF) (relative RBF from baseline from 0.99&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01&#x000a0;AU to 2.80&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10&#x000a0;AU) and increased kidney cGMP production (from 1.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8 to 13.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9&#x000a0;pmol/min/g kidney). Finally, in vivo, sGCact dose-dependently increased RBF (9.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;ml/min to 13.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x000a0;ml/min, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and reduced renal vascular resistance of CKD rats (15.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000a0;mmHg/ml&#x000a0;min to 9.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8&#x000a0;mmHg/ml&#x000a0;min, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p><p id="Par274"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> sGCact increased renal cGMP production, vasodilated renal arterioles and increased RBF in ex vivo models under NO depletion.

<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p id="Par277"><bold>Objective:</bold> Hypertension is a risk factor for the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) and is associated with impairment of NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. This study is aimed to characterize the relaxing response induced by sGC modulators in isolated corpus cavernosum (CC) from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY).</p><p id="Par278"><bold>Methods:</bold> SHR and WKY 16&#x000a0;weeks were used. Concentration&#x02013;response curves (CRCs) to BAY 41-2272, BAY 60-2770, tadalafil and acetylcholine (ACh) were carried out. In some experiments, CRCs to BAYs and ACh were also done in the presence of sGC inhibitor, ODQ or BAY 41-2272/BAY 60-2770 (100&#x000a0;nM), respectively. Intracellular levels of cGMP and protein expression sGCalpha1, sGCbeta1 and PDE5 were also determined. Results are expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA were used.</p><p id="Par279"><bold>Results:</bold> In CC from SHR the relaxation induced by BAY 41-2272 (pEC50: 6.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08 and Emax&#x02009;=&#x02009;66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4%) or BAY 60-2770 (pEC50: 6.99&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15 and Emax&#x02009;=&#x02009;87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4%) did not differ significantly in comparison to CC from WKY (BAY 41: pEC50: 6.11&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.16 and Emax&#x02009;=&#x02009;73&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4% and BAY60: pEC50: 7.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.16 and Emax&#x02009;=&#x02009;89&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8%). In the presence of ODQ BAY 41-2272- or BAY 60-2770-induced relaxation was reduced and potentiated, respectively to similar magnitude in CC from WKY and SHR. Although no difference in the relaxing response induced by BAY 60-2770 was observed between groups, in CC from SHR stimulated with BAY 60-2770 (1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) alone or in combination with ODQ (10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) the cGMP levels were 3- and 2-times greater in comparison to CC from WKY. In CC stimulated with sodium nitroprusside, the cGMP levels were reduced in SHR than in WKY. The relaxation induced by ACh was reduced in CC from SHR (Emax: 3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4%) in comparison with WKY (Emax: 9.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2%). In the presence of BAY 41-2272 (WKY Emax: 15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3% and SHR Emax: 8.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0,4%) or BAY 60-2770 (Emax WKY: 16&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7% and SHR: 9.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8%) a significant potentiation in ACh-induced relaxation was observed. The relaxing response induced by tadalafil was significantly lower in CC from SHR (pEC50: 6.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.41 Emax: 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8%) than in WKY (pEC50: 5.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.19 Emax: 59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9%). Protein expression for PDE5 was greater in CC from SHR than in WKY, while no difference was observed for sGCalpha1 and sGCbeta1.</p><p id="Par280"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> sGC stimulator and activator are highly effective at relaxing CC from SHR. Thus our study provides a rationale for the use of sGC modulators in patients with ED, especially in those unresponsive to PDE5 inhibitors, but clinical trials are required.</p><p id="Par281">

In cirrhotic PHT, the altered NO/sGC/cGMP pathway contributes to fibrosis development and endothelial dysfunction. Current medical treatment of PHT is limited to non-selective beta-blockers, while there is no special treatment against liver fibrosis. Modulation of sGC activity presents a beneficial approach to promote vasodilation, in line with fibrosis prevention. In bile duct ligated rats (BDL), we investigated the sGC stimulator riociguat (RIO), sGC activator cinaciguat (CINA) and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor tadalafil (TADA).</p><p id="Par287"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats underwent BDL or sham-operation. Starting 1&#x000a0;week after surgery&#x02014;RIO (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg), CINA (1&#x000a0;mg/kg), TADA (1.5&#x000a0;mg/kg) or vehicle (VEH) were gavaged for 3&#x000a0;weeks. Portal pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure, heart rate and splanchnic/portal blood flow were measured as a primary outcome parameter. Additionally, liver fibrosis, hepatic inflammation, and hepatic cGMP levels were assessed.</p><p id="Par288"><bold>Results:</bold> Cirrhotic BDL-VEH rats showed a significant increase in PP (13.07&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.97&#x000a0;mmHg) compared to healthy controls. Both RIO (9.96&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x000a0;mmHg, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.021) and TADA (10.27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.86&#x000a0;mmHg, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.050) treatment reduced PP without affecting systemic hemodynamics. Furthermore, RIO reduced intrahepatic vascular resistance (2.86&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25 vs. 4.85&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.54&#x000a0;mmHg/min&#x000a0;mL, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005). BDL rats developed significant fibrosis, while BDL-RIO rats presented with the strongly reduced chrome-aniline-blue stained area (2.14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.3% vs. 4.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.53%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011). Accordingly, hepatic hydroxyproline content was lower in BDL-RIO and BDL-TADA groups (RIO 350&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003; TADA 282&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003 vs. BDL-VEH 503&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g). In line also transaminase levels were lower in the RIO and TADA groups (AST: RIO: &#x02212;&#x02009;36%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; TADA: &#x02212;&#x02009;24%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006/ALT: RIO: &#x02212;&#x02009;32%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035; TADA: &#x02212;&#x02009;27%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.053), as well as intrahepatic IL6 expression in BDL-RIO rats (&#x02212;&#x02009;44%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.053).Expression of hepatic cGMP was significantly enhanced by RIO, but not by TADA or CINA. In cirrhotic BDL rats, 1&#x000a0;mg/kg CINA caused weight loss, systemic hypotension yet no amelioration of PHT, increased lactate levels and TNF-&#x003b1; expression.</p><p id="Par289"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The sGC stimulator riociguat and the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil showed beneficial effects in cirrhotic rats by reducing liver fibrosis and decreasing portal hypertension.

Most of the malaria deaths are caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. An essential regulator for the development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the cyclic GMP (cGMP) dependent protein kinase (<italic>Pf</italic>PKG). <italic>Pf</italic>PKG is composed of a regulatory region and a catalytic domain. In the absence of cGMP, the regulatory region inhibits the kinase domain.

One promising approach to circumvent this problem is to selectively target less conserved regulatory regions of <italic>Pf</italic>PKG, such as the cGMP-binding domains (CBDs).

While the enzymes are canonically downstream of nitric oxide/naturetic peptide induced cGMP generation, various groups have reported oxidation-induced direct activation of the kinase (2, 3). However, in contrast to some of these reports, we have previously shown that oxidation of PKGI&#x003b1; at C43 does not directly increase kinase activity (4).</p><p id="Par310"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used in vitro and cell based assays to examine oxidation-induced PKGI activation.</p><p id="Par311"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that PKGI&#x003b1; stored overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C became activated in an oxidation dependent manner, which was prevented in the presence of DTT. Since PKGI&#x003b1; C43S was activated to a similar extent as wild-type enzyme, the activation was independent of disulfide bond formation at C43. Activation was also prevented in the presence of EDTA, indicating dependence on trace metals in the elution buffer (PBS&#x02009;+&#x02009;100&#x000a0;nM Flag-peptide). In addition, the higher basal activity after overnight storage in elution buffer could not be reversed by subsequent reduction with DTT, suggesting that cysteines were oxidized to sulfinic or sulfonic acid. Interestingly, under the same overnight storage conditions, PKGI&#x003b2; was not activated. Similarly, Sheehe et al. recently found that short exposure of purified PKGI to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activated PKGI&#x003b1; to a much greater extent than PKGI&#x003b2;, and proposed that once C118 was modified to an acidic form, it interacted with basic residues unique to the PKGI&#x003b1; autoinhibitory loop, leading to an opening of the catalytic cleft (5). We found that residues within the isoform-specific autoinhibitory loop were responsible for PKGI&#x003b1; activation. While this result is consistent with the activation mechanism proposed by Sheehe et al., we observed that mutation of the proposed, mechanistically-important basic residues in the PKGI&#x003b1; autoinhibitory loop to the corresponding non-basic residues in PKGI&#x003b2; did not prevent activation. In addition, while PKGI&#x003b1; with a C118D mutation initially had a slightly higher basal activity than wild-type enzyme, the basal activity dramatically increased after overnight storage, indicating that the enzyme was being activated by modification at one or more additional sites. To explore whether oxidants activate PKGI&#x003b1; in cells, we treated rat cardiac-derived H9C2 cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under a variety of experimental conditions and monitored VASP phosphorylation. While we were able to observe robust PKGI&#x003b1; crosslinking, we were unable to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PKGI&#x003b1; activation in cells.</p><p id="Par312"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While PKGI&#x003b1; is activated by oxidation in vitro, whether oxidants induce PKGI&#x003b1; activation in cells remains unclear.</p><p id="Par313">

Upon pathophysiological changes in their environment, e.g. during development of atherosclerotic plaques, VSMCs are involved in a process named vascular remodeling. Previous studies with atherosclerotic mice have suggested that cGMP signaling affects vascular remodeling. However, it is not fully understood how cGMP derived via different cGMP generator pathways (e.g. NO-induced vs. natriuretic peptid-induced) affects VSMC growth and survival, and if cGMP signaling interacts with extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin (Fn).</p><p id="Par321"><bold>Methods:</bold> The impact of the cGMP signaling pathway on the growth and survival of primary VSMCs from mouse aorta was analyzed in real time using the impedance-based xCELLigence system. Control VSMCs were compared to VSMCs lacking NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI). Moreover, we investigated if Fn regulates VSMC growth behavior and phenotype, and whether this might be connected to cGMP signaling, by growth monitoring, Western blot analysis and FRET-based cGMP measurements in the presence and absence of Fn. Smooth muscle-specific Fn knockout mice (Fn-smko) were generated on an apolipoprotein E-deficient background to investigate the specific role of Fn in VSMCs for atherosclerosis.</p><p id="Par322"><bold>Results:</bold> By comparing control VSMCs with NO-GC- and cGKI-deficient VSMCs, we found that activation of the NO-GC/cGMP/cGKI cascade promotes the growth of VSMCs without affecting their viability. In contrast, stimulation of the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase A by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) had only a moderate effect on VSMC growth, but a strong pro-survival effect. Furthermore, our data showed that Fn ablation accelerates VSMC growth. Interestingly, VSMCs from Fn-smko mice had an increased activity of NO-GC. Thus, amplified NO/cGMP signaling might explain the increased growth of Fn-deficient VSMCs. Experiments with Fn-smko mice are in progress to test if Fn in VSMCs modulates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo.</p><p id="Par323"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that VSMCs have distinct cGMP pools that regulate VSMC growth and survival differently, i.e. a NO-induced pool and an ANP-stimulated pool, which promote VSMC growth and survival, respectively. These growth effects might be modulated by a novel crosstalk between Fn and cGMP signaling and affect the growth and stability of atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.</p><p id="Par324"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This work was supported by the DFG (FOR 2060 projects FE 438/5-2 and FE 438/6-2).

Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated, pseudokinase domain (PKD) that is critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain (2). Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B (3,4), we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influences the guanylyl cyclase activities of GC-A and GC-B.</p><p id="Par327"><bold>Methods:</bold> The x-ray structure of the Src family kinase LCK (PDB ID: 3LCK) was used to create a homology model of the PKD, using the SWISS-MODEL server (5). Molecular modeling indicated all the residues of the ATP binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-Bwere created by site-directed mutagenesis. Effects of mutations on enzymatic activity were assessed by performing guanylyl cyclase assays. PyMol was used to predict how gain of function mutations affect the structure of the PKDs and guanylyl cyclase assays were used to determine if the predictions increased allosteric activity.</p><p id="Par328"><bold>Results:</bold> Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting NP-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to NP-stimulation, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that observed in catalytically active kinases.</p><p id="Par329"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in their PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases by increasing affinity for the substrate, GTP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The residues that bind ATP in PKA are conserved in the PKD of GC-A. <bold>a</bold> Structure of the active site of the kinase domain of PKA and the corresponding site in the PKD of GC-A showing conservation of the residues (red) that interact with ATP (blue) in the active site. <bold>b</bold> Structures showing the R-spine (red), the C-spine (green), and the F helix (yellow). <bold>c</bold> The serine and threonine residues mutated in nonphosphorylated or phosphomimetic constructs are indicated with their position numbers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12967_2019_1994_Fig11_HTML" id="MO11"/></fig>

Fibrosis is accompanied by the formation of myofibroblasts (&#x003b1;-SMA<sup>+</sup>) and excessive production of collagen leading to functionally restricted tissue. Because of limited therapeutic options, median survival of IPF patients is 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years. Anti-fibrotic effects of the NO/cGMP pathway have already been described in other organs such as liver, skin and kidney. Consequently, NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) could have a protective effect within lung fibrosis.</p><p id="Par339"><bold>Methods:</bold> Mice deficient in NO-GC (GCKO) allow the investigation of NO-GC-mediated effects. Lung injury was induced by a single intratracheal dose of bleomycin. Lungs were harvested at day 7, 14 or 21 after bleomycin application. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the NO-GC-expressing cell type(s) and to characterise the fibrotic tissue, e.g. the formation of myofibroblasts. Hydroxyproline assay was performed to quantify the extent of fibrosis.</p><p id="Par340"><bold>Results:</bold> NO-GC is mainly expressed in lung pericytes. Bleomycin treatment leads to destruction of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), formation of myofibroblasts and increase in collagen content. NO-GC expression discriminates two types of myofibroblasts: (1) intra-alveolar, NO-GC-negative and (2) interstitial, NO-GC-positive myofibroblasts. After bleomycin administration, collagen content in WT and GCKO mice was increased compared to the respective untreated controls at all assessed time points. Furthermore, fibrotic response in GCKO lungs was more pronounced compared to WT.</p><p id="Par341"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that NO-GC has an anti-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis. Based on the distinct location and NO-GC expression, interstitial myofibroblasts may constitute ideal therapeutic targets to influence lung fibrosis. In addition, myofibroblasts should not be addressed as a homogeneous target cell type within this disease.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec185"><title>P12 Can erythrocytes produce biologically active NO?</title><sec id="Sec186"><title>Stepan Gambaryan<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec187"><title><sup>1</sup>Russian Academy of Sciences, Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry, St. Petersburg, Russia; <sup>2</sup>UNIVERSIT&#x000c4;TSMEDIZIN der Johannes-Gutenberg Universit&#x000e4;t, Centrum f&#x000fc;r Thrombose und H&#x000e4;mostase (CTH), Mainz, Germany</title><sec id="Sec188"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Stepan Gambaryan - gambaryan@klin-biochem.uni-wuerzburg.de</title><p id="Par342"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>P12</p><p id="Par343"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets represent the major cell population in mammalian blood. Functional interactions between RBCs and platelets are known for a long time from clinical observations. The bleeding time is prolonged in patients with anemia independent on their platelet count and could be corrected by RBCs transfusion. Consequently, RBCs transfusion could increase platelet activation and might be dangerous in the treatment of coronary artery diseases. However, in numerous papers nitric oxide (NO) released from RBCs, especially in the presence of nitrite, was shown to inhibit platelet activation. Endogenous NO is a well-known and potent inhibitor of platelet activation and platelet inhibitory effects of NO are mediated solely by sGC activation. Intact platelet sGC is highly sensitive to endogenous NO and even nanomolar NO concentrations are sufficient for cGMP generation and PKG activation. The main aim of our study was to evaluate whether RBCs under different conditions (oxygenated, deoxygenated, in the presence of nitrite) could release biologically active NO which will be involved in inhibition of platelet activation.</p><p id="Par344"><bold>Methods:</bold> For evaluation of platelet sGC activity we used our well-established model based on NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG dependent vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation in human platelets.

Skin fibrosis is a failure of tissue repair, which is characterized by initial inflammation and appearance of myofibroblasts producing excessive extracellular matrix. There is evidence that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in skin fibrosis. NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) is the main target for NO. In skin, the exact cell type expressing NO-GC as well its role during wound healing and fibrosis has yet to be identified.</p><p id="Par350"><bold>Methods:</bold> To investigate the function of NO-GC in skin, we used the bleomycin model of skin fibrosis induced by repetitive (21&#x000a0;days) subcutaneous bleomycin injections (0.5&#x000a0;mg/ml) in the neck. Reporter mice were used to lineage trace NO-GC<sup>+</sup> cells within the course of the fibrotic reaction.</p><p id="Par351"><bold>Results:</bold> We found NO-GC expression in skin pericytes indicated by colocalisation with the pericyte marker PDGFR&#x000df;; NOGC<sup>+</sup> pericytes were found to be closely associated with CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells in the hypodermis of the skin. Tamoxifen-induced expression of the reporter dye tdTomato under the control of SMMHC (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain) promotor was found to colocalize with NO-GC<sup>+</sup> pericytes. tdTomato-labeled pericytes are spindle shaped and mainly located within a collagen IV matrix which surrounds the adipocytes of the hypodermis. After bleomycin injection, the fibrotic reaction occurred exclusively in the hypodermis. We showed an increase of collagen III and IV and a higher density of fibroblasts. tdTomato labeled pericytes remain in the collagen IV matrix.</p><p id="Par352"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We assume that NOGC<sup>+</sup> pericytes constitute an interesting therapeutic target to treat skin fibrosis. In the next step, we want to identify the role of NO-GC using additional promotor-specific lineage tracing of NOGC<sup>+</sup> cells and knockdown of NO-GC.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec193"><title>P14 Characterization of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases potentially involved in pain processing</title><sec id="Sec194"><title>Tilman Gro&#x000df;<sup>1</sup>, Jonas Petersen<sup>1</sup>, Lea Kennel<sup>1</sup>, Jessica Schlaudraff<sup>2</sup>, Domenico Del Turco<sup>2</sup>, Ruirui Lu<sup>1</sup>, Wiebke Kallenborn-Gerhardt<sup>1</sup>, Achim Schmidtko<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec195"><title><sup>1</sup>Goethe-Universit&#x000e4;t Frankfurt am Main, Institut f&#x000fc;r Pharmakologie und Klinische Pharmazie, Frankfurt am Main Hesse, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Goethe-Universit&#x000e4;t Frankfurt am Main, Institut f&#x000fc;r Klinische Neuroanatomie, Frankfurt am Main Hesse, Germany</title><sec id="Sec196"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Tilman Gro&#x000df; - t.gross@em.uni-frankfurt.de</title><p id="Par353"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>P14</p><p id="Par354"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Accumulating evidence suggests that cGMP essentially contributes to the processing of chronic pain. However, little is known about the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that regulate the duration and amplitude of cGMP signaling in nociceptive tissues. Twenty-one PDE genes have been identified, which are classified into 11 families (PDE1 to PDE11), each with distinct substrate specificity and tissue distribution.

Current anti-hypertensive pharmacotherapies aim to protect from renal damage. However, this goal is not reached in many cases since both, pressure-dependent and -independent mechanisms can contribute to renal damage. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulation addresses an important signalling pathway in the cardiovascular and cardiorenal system. We have recently published that sGC stimulation using BAY 41-8543 significantly reduces blood pressure and protects from experimental heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in rats. Here we aimed to investigate the effect of BAY 41-8543 on renal damage in hypertensive rats. To test blood pressure dependent and blood pressure independent effects, we used two different doses of BAY 41-8543.</p><p id="Par361"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used 4-week-old male double transgenic rats (dTGR) expressing both human renin and angiotensinogen genes. dTGR progressively develop hypertension and renal damage, leading to a high mortality at 7&#x000a0;weeks of age. We treated dTGR with either 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg/d, 3&#x000a0;mg/kg/d BAY 41-8543 or vehicle daily for 3&#x000a0;weeks by oral gavage. Age-matched vehicle-treated Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats served as healthy controls.</p><p id="Par362"><bold>Results:</bold> Both doses improved the survival at week 7 as compared to vehicle. The higher dose reduced mean arterial blood pressure significantly as compared to vehicle, whereas the lower dose did not. Still, the lower dose significantly augmented cGMP serum levels. High dose-treated dTRG were protected from albuminuria throughout the experiment, whereas the low dose reduced albuminuria only in weeks 5&#x02013;6. Cystatin C serum levels were significantly reduced after 3&#x000a0;mg/kg/d BAY 41-8543 treatment compared to vehicle, indicating preservation of glomerular filtration. Kidney injury marker NGAL was significantly reduced in the serum of dTGR treated with 3&#x000a0;mg/kg/d BAY 41-8543. Anti-CD68 immunofluorescence of kidney sections indicated significantly less immune cell infiltration in dTGR treated with the higher dose. Further histologic characterization of renal damage markers was undertaken.</p><p id="Par363"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The sGC stimulator BAY 41-8543 can dose-dependently protect from hypertensive induced renal damage. The magnitude of the effect of BAY 41-8543 was higher in a blood pressure lowering dose but also a blood pressure neutral dose was beneficial.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec201"><title>P16 Investigating the protective role of the NO/sGC/PKG pathway in diabetic nephropathy in vivo and in vitro</title><sec id="Sec202"><title>Manuela Harloff, Jens Schlo&#x000df;mann</title><sec id="Sec203"><title>University of Regensburg, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Regensburg, Germany</title><sec id="Sec204"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Manuela Harloff - manuela.harloff@ur.de</title><p id="Par364"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>P16</p><p id="Par365"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a severe microvascular complication of a persisting Diabetes mellitus. DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, which requires dialysis and renal replacement therapy. A specific therapy does not exist so far because underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood. Previous studies showed that treatments with sGC-activators prevent kidney damages [1, 2]. In this work we want to investigate the role of the NO/sGC/PKG pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy using the sGC-activator Cinaciguat as a potential therapeutic approach.</p><p id="Par366"><bold>Methods:</bold> For the in vivo studies, we established a mouse model for DN using wild type and eNOS-KO mice [3]. Diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin injections (50&#x000a0;mg/kg/d; i.p.) on 5 consecutive days. After 12&#x000a0;weeks the mice developed DN-typical kidney damages. Half of these mice received Cinaciguat (3&#x000a0;mg/kg/d, p.o.) in the last 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par367">For further in vitro analyses we used primary murine mesangial cells isolated from mouse kidneys. To simulate the blood glucose levels in diabetes, the cells were incubated with normal glucose (8&#x000a0;mM <sc>d</sc>-Glucose, NG) and high glucose (25&#x000a0;mM <sc>d</sc>-Glucose, HG) conditions for 48&#x000a0;h. To activate the NO/sGC/PKG signaling, cells under HG conditions were additionally treated with 1&#x000a0;mM 8-Br-cGMP or with 20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M cinaciguat.</p><p id="Par368"><bold>Results:</bold> After induction of diabetes, the mice developed typical symptoms like elevated blood glucose levels, glucosuria or higher blood pressure. Treatment with cinaciguat appeared to have no influence on these symptoms.</p><p id="Par369">After 12&#x000a0;weeks of diabetes changes in the kidneys can be detected. Diabetic kidneys showed an increased expression of Collagen IV and &#x003b1;-SMA associated with fibrotic processes. In kidneys from cinaciguat treated mice, no increase of these markers were detectable.</p><p id="Par370">Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an important regulator of transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;, plays a critical role in the development of kidney damage [4]. TSP-1 gene expression was upregulated in diabetic kidneys, whereas mice treated with cinaciguat showed significantly lower levels of TSP-1 mRNA.</p><p id="Par371">In mesangial cells HG conditions led to a higher TSP-1 expression. Further incubation of the cells with 8-Br-cGMP or Cinaciguat retained the protein expression levels equally to normal glucose conditions. Moreover the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT-1 was increased under HG conditions conceivably induced by higher TSP-1 levels. Activation of PKG with 8-Br-cGMP inhibited the higher GLUT-1 expression.</p><p id="Par372"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our first results show that the activation of the NO/sGC/PKG pathway with cinaciguat has protective effects on DN and might be an appropriate new therapy option.</p><p id="Par373">

Most commercial bronchodilators work through generation of cAMP, and show diminished efficacy in the presence of Th2 lung inflammation, and when patients develop &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR desensitization. Although the NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway is known to evoke vascular smooth muscle relaxation, its role in mediating airway smooth muscle relaxation remains controversial. Recently, direct-acting sGC agonists that bypass NO generation have been developed and thus offer a new opportunity to assess the pathway in airway relaxation. The sGC agonists, BAY 41-2272 (BAY 41) and BAY 60-2770 (BAY 60), stimulate the heme-containing sGC or directly activate the heme-free form of sGC, respectively. In order to ascertain their potential value as bronchodilators, we compared BAY 41 and BAY 60 against a commercial beta agonist drug (Formoterol) in their abilities to reverse contractile agonist-induced airway bronchoconstriction in human lung samples.</p><p id="Par397"><bold>Methods:</bold> Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from lungs of healthy human donors. PCLS bronchioles were precontracted to 70&#x02013;80% maximal with carbachol, and were then titrated with BAY 41, BAY 60, or formoterol at increasing doses.

In some cases the PCLS were incubated overnight with formoterol (100&#x000a0;nM) to induce &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR desensitization, prior to the titrations.

Furthermore, mice with a global loss of GC-B activity suffer from severe gastrointestinal malfunction which probably contributes to the premature death of these animals. Previous reports suggested that CNP-induced relaxation of smooth muscle cells is involved in the regulation of pyloric and colorectal motility. However, the identity of CNP and GC-B expressing cells underlying CNP&#x02019;s effects in the gastrointestinal tract needs to be resolved.</p><p id="Par405"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used reporter mouse lines generated by our lab for the characterization of CNP and GC-B expressing cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Expression mapping using X-Gal staining of whole mount tissue from CNP- and GC-B-lacZ reporter lines (<italic>CNP</italic><sup><italic>wt/lacZ</italic></sup> and <italic>GC</italic>-<italic>B</italic><sup><italic>wt/lacZ</italic></sup>) was followed by immunofluorescent double labeling of sections with anti-&#x003b2;-galactosidase and cell type-specific marker antibodies.

While high densities of CNP-expressing cells were detected in the esophagus, pylorus, jejunum/ileum and colon, GC-B expression was observed to be especially high in the esophagus, pylorus, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Beginning to determine the cellular identity of CNP and GC-B expressing cells in the colon we found that CNP and GC-B are expressed in neuronal subpopulations of the myenteric plexus in a mostly non-overlapping manner (less than 5%). Co-labeling with an antibody specific for neuronal nitric oxide synthase demonstrated that approximately half of the CNP as well as GC-B positive cells are nitrergic myenteric neurons.</p><p id="Par407"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, our data point towards an involvement of the CNP/GC-B system in the modulation of neuronal signaling processes which control colonic motility.

The MASTL-ENSA-PP2A pathway controls the phosphorylation of multiple proteins and enables mitotic entry [1] but is not known in anucleate platelets. ENSA/ARPP19 were detected in our human platelet proteomic/phospho-proteomic studies with S109 ENSA/S104 ARPP19 phosphorylation in response to cAMP-/cGMP-elevating platelet inhibitors [2, 3].

Platelet PP2A activity and its regulation by recombinant pS67-ENSA/pS62-ARPP19 was investigated by PP2A-specific phosphatase assays, functional effects of PP2A inhibition on platelets by aggregometry.</p><p id="Par418"><bold>Results:</bold> ENSA, ARPP19 and PP2A, but not the classical MASTL, were abundantly expressed in human platelets. cAMP-/cGMP-elevating platelet inhibitors increased S109 ENSA/S104 ARPP19 phosphorylation and decreased S67 ENSA/S62 ARPP19 phosphorylation. Specific ENSA-S109/ARPP19-S104 (by PKG and PKA) as well as ENSA-S67/ARPP19-S62 (by MASTL) phosphorylation was confirmed with recombinant proteins. These phosphorylation sites were also detected upon phosphatase PP1/PP2A inhibition with the toxin okadaic acid (OA) for endogenous ENSA, and recombinant wild-type ENSA/ARPP19 in intact platelets and lysates. This demonstrated a specific MASTL-like kinase activity in human platelets. A broad spectrum of platelet PP2A holoenzymes was detected by proteomics. pS67-HisENSA and pS62-GST-ARPP19 reduced platelet PP2A activity of about 20% in platelet lysates compared to controls, stronger PP2A inhibition was observed with specific protein substrates. 1&#x000a0;nM OA completely inhibited platelet PP2A activity.

Studying the hearts of CRP4 deficient mice, we demonstrated a direct interaction between CRP4 and cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI) in angiotensin II stressed hearts and, in consequence, lack of CRP4 exaggerated the angiotensin II provoked cardiac remodelling [1]. Although, CRP4 has been identified as a cGMP/cGKI dependent modulator of the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific gene program [2, 3], which is usually perturbed during vessel injury when &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; VSMCs switch from a contractile to a synthetic cell phenotype, the vascular functions of CRP4 in both health and disease remain largely elusive so far.</p><p id="Par427"><bold>Methods:</bold> Primary and highly passaged VSMCs were established from the aorta of CRP4 mutant (CRP4-KO) and littermate control siblings (CRP4-WT). The localization of CRP4 as well as typical VSMC proteins were studied by immunohistochemical methods. Proteomic data were generated in order to identify CRP4-regulated proteins. Because proliferation and cell migration are hallmarks of phenotypic diversity in VSMCs, we studied whether these cell behaviours were dependent on cGMP/CRP4. Blood pressure of CRP4-WT/-KO mice was assessed at baseline and upon challenge with different cGMP-elevating agents utilizing a radiotelemetric system.

Yet, distinct changes regarding the expression profile of typical VSMC genes and proteins became apparent in contractile versus synthetic VSMCs. Accordingly, the proliferative and migratory behaviours differed in a CRP4-dependent manner between primary and cultivated VSMCs. In the absence and presence of cGMP-elevating compounds we find evidence for higher cGMP levels in synthetic VSMCs lacking CRP4, which may at least partly explain the reduced blood pressure observed in global CRP4-KO mice. Our ongoing analyses of a recently established CRP4 and ApoE double-mutant mouse model should further validate the role of this LIM-only protein in VSMCs within atherosclerotic lesions in vivo.</p><p id="Par429"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CRP4 controls blood pressure under physiological conditions and it serves different functions in &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; VSMCs and during phenotype modulation of VSMCs in disease. Our combined ex vivo and in vivo analysis of CRP4-deficient VSMCs and mouse models imply that CRP4 may be a cGMP-dependent modifier of vascular diseases associated with hypertension.</p><p id="Par430">

The NO/cGMP pathway with known vasodilatory properties also sets the contractility degree of airway smooth muscle and is further involved in the modulation of immune responses. In this pathway, two NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclases, NO-GC1 and NO-GC2, are engaged in synthetizing cGMP in response to NO.</p><p id="Par436">In lung, both NO-GCs are expressed with the NO-GC1 being responsible for 90% of the NO-GC activity. Consistent with a reduced cGMP formation, pulmonary resistance is higher in NO-GC1 KO mice and increases stronger, when the airways are challenged with Methacholine. This suggests a localisation of NO-GC1 in airway smooth muscle. Regarding the action site of NO-GC2, pulmonary resistance of NO-GC2 KO mice tended to be reduced and was attenuated in response to Methacholine challenge. A finding that assigns NO-GC2 a function different from NO-GC1.</p><p id="Par437"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we studied the roles of the NO-GC isoforms in the pathogenesis of COPD by using mice deficient in either NO-GC1 or NO-GC2.

In contrast, BAL fluids of CS-exposed NO-GC1 KOs revealed higher lymphocyte levels indicating a role of NO-GC1 in the regulation of immune responses.

Components of the cGMP signaling system which mediates relaxation of smooth muscle cells were described in contractile PTCs, but functional data are scarce.</p><p id="Par442"><bold>Methods:</bold> To investigate contractility of seminiferous tubules ex vivo, we used a combination of time-lapse imaging and Fourier analysis. Isolated rat and human seminiferous tubules were embedded in a collagen lattice for stabilization and observed by time-lapse imaging. To assess movements of the rat seminiferous tubule wall, changing grey values within defined regions of interest (ROIs) were tracked over time and translated into characteristic frequency spectra by the use of Fourier analysis. Contractile activity of human seminiferous tubules was analyzed by using a kymograph function on the recorded time stacks. cGMP production was enhanced by the NO donor SNP and cGMP degradation was inhibited by the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil.</p><p id="Par443"><bold>Results:</bold> In the rat seminiferous tubule wall, time-lapse imaging revealed spontaneous contractions with an undulating and irregular contraction pattern. Fourier analysis generated characteristic frequency spectra that form several groups of distinct spectral patterns. Stimulating cGMP generation by SNP slowed down contractile frequency and the corresponding Fourier spectra were shifted towards slower frequencies. This frequency shift was more pronounced when PDE5 was additionally inhibited by sildenafil. First findings point towards an association of certain Fourier spectra with distinct stages of spermatogenesis and a differential susceptibility towards cGMP signaling. In the human testis, disturbances in spermatogenesis are often associated with fibrotic changes of the peritubular structures. Moreover, contractility of the tubules and cGMP effects are also disturbed.</p><p id="Par444"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Time-lapse imaging combined with Fourier analysis is a valuable tool to study contractile function of seminiferous tubules and its regulation under near-physiological conditions and the impact of various signaling pathways or drugs. Altered cGMP signaling affects function of contractile PTCs in the testis and could contribute to male infertility.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec245"><title>P27 The effects of the sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 in an experimental model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</title><sec id="Sec246"><title>Shalini Murali Krishnan, Ina Hagelschuer, Ilka Mathar, Jutta Meyer, Elke Hartmann, Mira Pavkovic, Peter Sandner</title><sec id="Sec247"><title>Bayer AG, Research &#x00026; Development, Pharmaceuticals - Heart &#x00026; Vascular Disease Research, Wuppertal, Germany</title><sec id="Sec248"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Shalini Murali Krishnan - shalini.murali@bayer.com</title><p id="Par445"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>P27</p><p id="Par446"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a monogenetic disorder affecting 1 in 5000 boys worldwide. The lack of dystrophin causes severe progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. As a result the affected boys require the aid of a wheelchair and non-invasive ventilation already in their teenage years. In addition, it has a significant impact on cardiac function, causing cardiomyopathy and eventually heart failure. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, therefore it is crucial that new therapies for effective medical management are identified to improve the quality of life and prolong life expectancy.</p><p id="Par447">Increasing cGMP levels is known to be cardio-protective and also improve skeletal muscle function. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine if an sGC stimulator, BAY41-2272, displayed beneficial effects in the treatment of DMD.</p><p id="Par448"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we used 20&#x000a0;wk old, male mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice, an experimental model of DMD susceptible to develop cardiomyopathy early. C57Bl6/J mice were used as wild-type controls (WT).

All 3 techniques demonstrated that mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice had reduced skeletal muscle function and treatment with BAY41-2272 improved grip strength. Contrary to a previous report, ECHO assessments demonstrated that mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice do not display any cardiac dysfunction at 36&#x000a0;wks, however invasive hemodynamics displayed that mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice have reduced mean arterial pressure vs WT and this was further reduced with BAY41-2272 administration.</p><p id="Par450"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In summary, mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice have impaired skeletal muscle function, however they display a normal cardiac phenotype compared to WT mice. BAY41-2272 treatment improves skeletal muscle function and decreased BP compared to mdx/mTR<sup>G2</sup> mice administered NF.

Most disease definitions are symptom- or organ-based and have no mechanistic basis. Consequently, different disease mechanisms are clustered under the same disease phenotype and the most marketed drugs have an alarmingly high number needed to treat (NNT). In order to shift to a precision medicine approach, we need to understand the precise mechanisms behind diseases and to develop biomarkers to stratify patients for mechanism-based drug therapy. Pathological cGMP signaling is a common mechanism of a cluster of disease phenotypes such as stroke, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and resistant hypertension. The precise defects of impaired cGMP signaling are not well-understood and there are no precision diagnostic tools to stratify patients for cGMP modulating drugs.</p><p id="Par454"><bold>Methods:</bold> In our approach, we make use of the latest developments in recombinant antibodies, constantly evolving databases and new computational tools. Phage Display Technology takes advantage of the structure and biology of bacteriophages, usually the bacteriophage M13, to develop new recombinant antibodies against specific antigens.

Clinical and experimental data have shown a correlation between BPH and obesity (1, 2). Prostate gland is surrounded by periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), which is believed to play a paracrine role and may release pro-inflammatory substances, growth factors, contractile and anti-contractile substances and hormones (3). The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of PPAT on prostate reactivity from lean and obese mice.</p><p id="Par464"><bold>Methods:</bold> Six-week old C57BL/6 male mice were fed with standard chow (lean) or high-fat diet (obese) for 10&#x000a0;weeks. Prostate and PPAT were collect for histological and immunohistochemistry (Ki-67) analysis. PPAT from obese mice was weighted (~&#x02009;40&#x000a0;mg), kept in Kreb&#x02019;s solution (30&#x000a0;min, 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and the supernatant collected. Prostate segments from lean and obese mice were incubated without and with PPAT supernatant for 30&#x000a0;min. Concentration&#x02013;response curve to phenylephrine (PE) was carried out. In another set of experiments, the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), was incubated with PPAT for 30&#x000a0;min and then incubated in prostate segments from both groups.

Unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA were carried out.</p><p id="Par465"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological analysis showed that adipocyte area from PPAT is greater (60%, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in obese than in control mice. Histological analysis sections showed a simple columnar epithelium and a thin layer of prostate from lean mice. Obese mice showed prostate epithelial hyperplasia, accompanied by an increase of 93% in Ki67 (25.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6 cells, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in relation to control mice (13.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0 cells). Surprisingly, when PPAT supernatant was added in prostate strips from both lean and obese mice a significant reduction by 44% (1.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.30, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and 58% (1.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.28, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), respectively in PE-induced, contraction was observed in comparison with strips that were not incubated with PPAT (lean: 2.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x000a0;mN vs obese: 3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.53&#x000a0;mN).

In contrast, sildenafil inhibited PDE5 in a competitive manner and exhibited comparable potency to inhibit the full-length and catalytic fragment of PDE5 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3 and 5&#x000a0;nM, respectively. Unlike sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors that non-selectively inhibit other PDE isozymes (e.g. PDE6 and PDE11), abazafil did not significantly inhibit other PDE isozyme at concentrations up to 15,000 fold higher than its IC<sub>50</sub> value to inhibit PDE5. In cell-based experiments, abazafil increased intracellular cGMP levels, as determined by cGMP biosensor and immunoassays, and activated PKG, as measured by phospho-VASP levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.

The unique chemical structure, mechanism of binding, and superior potency and PDE isozyme selectivity of abazafil compared with known PDE5 inhibitors, could provide efficacy advantages and reduced side-effects for erectile dysfunction treatment and other indications. Abazafil&#x02019;s ability to reduce neuro-inflammation, improve cognitive function, and increase penile length, along with tolerability in mice supports further preclinical development.

FGFR3 activation causes dephosphorylation and inactivation of GC-B, suggesting that GC-B is downstream of FGFR3 in the dwarfism pathway (1, 2). Mice expressing GC-B with glutamate-substitutions for known phosphorylation sites (GC-B-7E) have increased C-type natriuretic peptide-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity and skeletal overgrowth (1).

Expression of two FGFR3-G380R alleles reduced skeletal length to the same degree in mice expressing either wild type GC-B or GC-B-7E, which is consistent with GC-B dephosphorylation not being required for achondroplasia.

Therefore, a pharmacological intervention that has memory enhancing effects would be beneficial to patient outcomes. Previous studies have implicated the importance of the intracellular cGMP-PKG signaling pathway in memory processes. This pathway is initiated through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric oxide (NO). sGC stimulators enhance sGC activity by directly stimulating its production while also increasing sGC sensitivity to endogenous NO. In this experiment we hypothesized that sGC stimulator vericiguat could have beneficial effects on memory functioning through enhanced cGMP-PKG signaling and subsequent increased GluA1-AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking.</p><p id="Par498"><bold>Methods:</bold> To evaluate the effects on long-term memory functioning in rats, different oral dosages of vericiguat or vehicle were administered 30&#x000a0;min before T1 of the object location task (OLT) to investigate memory acquisition processes. A 24&#x000a0;h inter-trial interval was used. To evaluate the effects on GluA1-AMPAR trafficking, an acute mouse hippocampal slice model was used to chemically induce late time potentiation (chemLTP). The slices would either be incubated with vericiguat immediately before chemLTP induction to investigate acquisition-like processes, or 10&#x000a0;min after chemLTP induction to investigate early consolidation-like processes.

It is a heterodimer consisting of one alpha (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>&#x003b1;</italic><sub>2</sub>) and one beta (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>) subunit, with a prosthetic heme group located in the <italic>&#x003b2;1</italic> H-NOX regulatory domain. sGC catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), upon binding of nitric oxide (NO) to the heme group [1]. A number of pathological states, in particular cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases [2] have been at least partly attributed to impairment of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, due for example to low NO bioavailability and/or heme oxidation and subsequent sGC dysfunction. Besides NO donors, two functional classes of sGC agonists have been identified: the heme-dependent sGC stimulators such as the recently approved drug riociguat (BAY 63-2521) and the clinically evaluated vericiguat (BAY 1021189) [2] as well as the heme-independent sGC activators, such as the amino dicarboxylic acid derivative cinagiguat (BAY 58-2667) [2]. Notably, the enzymatic activity of sGC by sGC activators is enhanced after oxidation or removal of the heme moiety due for example to oxidation of the heme iron and loss of the heme group from sGC, a change elicited by synthetic tricyclic oxadiazolone derivatives such as the closely related analogues ODQ and NS2028 [3, 4].</p><p id="Par504"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the present study, following a rational drug design approach, we designed new potential sGC activators with structural features which may enable both the oxidation of the heme moiety (e.g. a fused oxadiazolidinone ring) and sGC activation (e.g. appropriate carboxylic substituents).</p><p id="Par505"><bold>Results:</bold> Our presentation will describe (a) the progress of our efforts towards the synthesis of the target molecules and (b) the characterization by NMR-based analysis of the binding mode of a sGC activator, cinaciguat (BAY 58-2667), with recombinant <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp.

Despite consistent results in activity measurements with similar EC<sub>50</sub> values, we observed unexpected differences in thermostabilisation of sGC: While BAY 60-2770 had a significant thermostabilising influence on sGC, this effect was absent for BR 11257.</p><p id="Par515">Important binding sites for the activators&#x02019; carboxylic acids are the hydrogen bond donating amino acids in the conserved Y-x-S-x-R motif [2]. To compare the importance of this hydrogen bond network for thermostabilisation and activation by the dicarboxylic acid BAY 60-2770 and the monocarboxylic acid BR 11257, we performed measurements with the point mutated sGC variants &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>Y135F and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>R139L.</p><p id="Par516"><bold>Methods:</bold> Purification of sGC from Sf9 cells.

Binding to both amino acids is necessary, explaining the lack of thermostabilisation with the monocarboxylic acid BR 11257. In contrast, one hydrogen bond either to Y135 or R139 is sufficient for activation by activator drugs. This is in line with the similar activation profiles of BR 11257 and BAY 60-2770. However, the mutant &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>Y135F allows for a discrimination between mono- and dicarboxylic acids in activity measurements: a tenfold higher EC<sub>50</sub> value indicates a lower affinity towards BR 11257. The only carboxylic acid of BR 11257 seems to interact with Y135 and not with R139. Accordingly, mutation of the main interaction partner Y135 lowers the affinity towards BR 11257, while mutation of R139 has no influence on activation by BR 11257 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Importance of amino acids Y135 and R139 for sGC activation and thermostabilisation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12967_2019_1994_Fig17_HTML" id="MO17"/></fig>

Podocytes wrap around the capillaries of the glomerulus maintaining the filtration barrier through their interdigitated foot processes and are exposed to the hydrostatic pressure. To adapt to the environmental forces the foot processes form a dynamic cytoskeleton consisting of an actin-based contractile apparatus regulated by mechanical stress and vasoactive hormones. Podocyte foot process effacement is considered to be a culprit of glomerular disease and is a pathologic event in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Podocytes express receptors for natriuretic peptides and nitric oxide&#x000a0;and thereby synthetize the cyclic guanosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP is&#x000a0;instrumental in regulating the function of glomeruli by influencing vascular cell types and regulating vasomotor tone. However, the knowledge about a cGMP pathway in podocyte mechanobiology is limited to a few in vitro studies. In order to gain a better understanding of spatial cGMP dynamics, we aimed at showing if and to what extent podocytes cGMP levels respond to osmolality changes induced by naturally occurring osmolytes.</p><p id="Par533"><bold>Methods:</bold> We isolated glomeruli from mice expressing a cytosolic cGMP sensor (R26-cGi500) ubiquitously in all cells of the glomerulus. cGi500 is a FRET-based ratiometric cGMP biosensor which undergoes a conformational change upon cGMP binding leading to a measurable decrease in FRET efficiency. The isolated glomeruli were stimulated for 3&#x000a0;min with different substances (CNP, DEA/NONOate, SNAP). Confocal microscopy with a superfusion system was used to visualize the changes in cGMP levels. In addition, we tested different osmolytes in various concentrations (<sc>d</sc>-Glucose, Urea) and osmotic control agents (<sc>d</sc>-Mannitol&#x02009;+&#x02009;<sc>d</sc>-Glucose, 3-Methyl-<italic>O</italic>-Glucose).</p><p id="Par534"><bold>Results:</bold> A reproducible elevation of cGMP levels was observed after the stimulation of the NO/cGMP and CNP/cGMP signaling pathway in R26-cGi500 mice. <sc>d</sc>-Glucose concentration (30&#x000a0;mM) which are postulated to initiate cGMP release in vitro did not stimulate a signal in isolated glomeruli of cGi500 mice.

Furthermore, a marked shrinkage of the whole glomerulus was evident.</p><p id="Par535"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, our findings suggest that hyperosmotic solutions can induce cGMP release in cells of the isolated glomeruli.

In addition to cyclic GMP (cGMP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP), ExoY synthesizes cyclic 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-uridylylmonophosphate (cUMP) and the corresponding cytidylyl analogue cCMP [2]. We hypothesize that cGMP and cUMP exert distinct functions as first or second messengers during the bacterial infection.</p><p id="Par538"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to elucidate the function of cGMP and cUMP during the course of the infection, we investigated the concentrations and effects of ExoY-generated cNMP in an acute mouse lung infection model [3], and studied a potential suppressive function of the cNMPs in murine and human immune cells. Furthermore, we have begun to explore a second messenger role of cUMP in T cells.

This increase in cUMP correlated with an altered immune response as compared to control mice infected with a cyclase-deficient bacterial mutant.

A first hint for a specific function of cUMP in the infected host itself was found in &#x003b1;CD3/&#x003b1;CD28-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC): cGMP and the cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides cCMP and cUMP inhibited IL-2 production in these cells (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par540"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The observed effects of cNMPs in our lung infection model may be due to an immune-modulatory role of cUMP as a first or second messenger. This modulation may be exerted by T cells, especially when focusing on chronic diseases, because both cUMP and cGMP influenced the IL-2 production in PBMC and purified T cells. Further research is needed to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms, but T cells have proven to be a promising model system for further investigations of the immunologic effects of cUMP and cGMP. ExoY mutants with altered substrate specificity will be a valuable tool in these investigations and might contribute to the elucidation of the different behaviour of ExoY in vivo (cUMP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;cGMP) and in vitro (cGMP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;cUMP).</p><p id="Par541">

Previously, our search for molecular determinants of axonal branching identified a cGMP signaling cascade composed of the ligand C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP; gene name <italic>Nppc</italic>), the receptor guanylyl cyclase B (GC-B; gene name <italic>Npr2</italic>), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI; gene name <italic>Prkg1</italic>) that is essential for the bifurcation of DRG neurons upon entering the spinal cord during embryonic development. In mice deficient for any of these components the axons of DRG neurons no longer bifurcate and instead turn either in only an ascending or descending direction. However, the impact of axon bifurcation on sensory processing in adulthood remains poorly understood.</p><p id="Par548"><bold>Methods:</bold> Since the analysis of global GC-B as well as cGKI mouse knockout mutants is hampered by their decreased survival rates, we generated conditional mouse mutants of GC-B and cGKI (<italic>GC</italic>-<italic>B</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>;<italic>Wnt1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> and <italic>cGKI</italic><sup><italic>KO/fl</italic></sup>;<italic>Wnt1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>) that lack sensory axon bifurcation in the absence of additional phenotypes observed in the global knockout mice, to investigate the functional consequences of impaired axon bifurcation during adult stages.</p><p id="Par549"><bold>Results:</bold> Cholera toxin labeling in digits of the hind paw demonstrated an altered shape of sensory neuron termination fields in the spinal cord of conditional GC-B mouse mutants.

Pharmacological improvement of symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) include reagents known to reduce the tone of smooth muscle tissue such as alpha1-adrenergic antagonists (e.g. tamsulosin) or the newly approved inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) (tadalafil).

Nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) signaling, which is important for synaptic transmission and vascular tone, was found to be reduced in AD patients and to be correlated with memory decline [1]. Since NO-sGC-cGMP signaling can be increased by application of specific sGC stimulators by more than 20-fold [2], we hypothesized that sGC stimulation may have a therapeutic potential in AD. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of sGC modulation on memory function and amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) plaque load in a murine AD model.</p><p id="Par579"><bold>Methods:</bold> 5XFAD transgenic mice or their wild-type littermates were randomly and blindly allocated to the following groups: wild type (wt), 5xFAD&#x02009;+&#x02009;vehicle and 5xFAD&#x02009;+&#x02009;drug (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11/each group). BAY 41-2272, a sGC stimulator, was administered p.o. (45&#x000a0;mg/kg). Feeding was initiated when the mice were 2-month old and was continued for 10&#x000a0;months. Learning and memory were analyzed monthly using a Barnes maze paradigm. After sacrifice, A&#x003b2; plaque load was quantified by Thioflavine-S and Congo Red staining and by ELISA measurements.</p><p id="Par580"><bold>Results:</bold> Application of the sGC stimulator showed no effect on body weight or other physiological parameters. As expected, 5xFAD mice receiving vehicle developed memory and learning deficits (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Pharmacological activation of sGC significantly improved memory function and learning at 6 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), 7 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and 8 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) months of age.

Thus, NO-sGC-cGMP signaling seems to play an important, so far little recognized, role in the pathophysiology of AD. Further experiments need to clarify the precise connection between NO-sGC-cGMP signaling and A&#x003b2; plaque formation and the molecular interactions between the sGC-cGMP pathway and memory function.</p><p id="Par582">

Cardiac hypertrophy is initially associated with an increased myocardial capillary density, whereas at later stages capillary rarefaction may occur (1). In cardiac pressure/volume overload, natriuretic peptide expression and secretion rapidly increase. NPs are known for vascular and renal actions, essential for the physiological maintenance of intravascular volume and arterial blood pressure. Moreover, they exert direct local, cardiac antihypertrophic and antifibrotic actions (2). In addition, endothelial effects of NPs were shown to enhance angiogenesis and neovascularization (3). Herein we studied whether NP/GC-A/cyclic GMP signaling modulates adaptative myocardial angiogenesis during early stages of experimental cardiac hypertrophy.</p><p id="Par593"><bold>Methods:</bold> To study GC-A-mediated microcirculatory actions of ANP in vivo, we selectively inactivated the GC-A gene in pericytes by tamoxifen-induced <italic>loxP/PDGFR&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>ERT2</italic></sup>-mediated recombination. In pericyte GC-A KO mice, cardiac structure and function were explored in an experimental model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced hypertensive heart disease. To evaluate cardiac contractile functions, aortic and LV pressure&#x02013;volume relationships were recorded. Cardiac cellular remodelling was studied by immunocytochemistry and morphometrical analyses.</p><p id="Par594"><bold>Results:</bold> LV contractile and relaxation functions of TAC-operated mice were mildly impaired, as evidenced by genotype-independent changes in LV and aortic pressures and contraction/relaxation rates. Morphometry of cardiac sections co-stained with anti-NG2, anti-PDGF-R&#x003b2; and anti-CD31 antibodies indicated mild decreases of cardiac pericyte densities (by 5%) and significant decreases of myocardial capillaries (by 15%) in the pericyte GC-A KO mice already under baseline conditions. A significant increase in pericyte and capillary densities was observed in both genotypes 7&#x000a0;days after TAC. Of note, the density of cardiac pericytes (by 5%) and myocardial capillaries (by 15%) remained diminished in pericyte GC-A KO mice after TAC, indicating that loss of GC-A/cGMP signaling alters pericyte proliferation and/or viability and thereby the communication from pericytes to endothelial cells. Indeed, our studies of the pericyte proliferation in real time demonstrated that ANP simulates pericyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par595"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our observations demonstrate that inhibition of pericyte NP/GC-A/cGMP signaling diminishes pericyte proliferation, promotes microvascular rarefaction, and thereby possibly the transition from compensated hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.</p><p id="Par596"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG KU 1037/7-1 and KU 1037/8-1 to MK) and the Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Forschung und Technik (BMBF 01EO1004 to MK and BMBF 01EO1504 to KSS).</p><p id="Par597">

Early studies established that sGC associates with heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) in cells and tissues and this usually correlated with an increase in sGC activity. More recently we determined that (i) in cells and tissues, hsp90 associates with only the heme-free apo-form of sGC&#x003b2;, and not with holo-sGC&#x003b2;, sGC&#x003b1;, or the sGC&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer, and (ii) purified apo-sGC&#x003b2; can interact directly with hsp90 to form a complex. We utilized interaction mapping based on our HxD MS and biophysical measures, existing structural data, and computer-assisted docking, to build an evidence-based model of an apo-sGC&#x003b2;-hsp90 interaction complex. In this model, apo-sGC&#x003b2;1(1-358) binds through its PAS domain to the middle domain of one protomer of an hsp90 homodimer. In the present study, we sought to determine if a complex corresponding to our model actually forms in mammalian cells, and if so, to define its biological relevance in regulating sGC&#x003b2; heme insertion, sGC&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer formation, and catalytic activity.</p><p id="Par603"><bold>Methods:</bold> We generated sGC&#x003b2; variants that contain model-based point and deletion mutations predicted to disrupt the apo-sGC&#x003b2;-hsp90 interaction in three specific regions in sGC&#x003b2;. We used fluorescence polarization and antibody immuno-precipitation (co-IP) to measure each sGC&#x003b2; variant&#x02019;s interaction with hsp90 both in vitro and in cultured mammalian cells. We utilized a FIash-based fluorophore tag method to monitor heme insertion into each sGC&#x003b2; variant in live cells, and used co-IP to determine their heterodimer formation with sGC&#x003b1;, and a kit to measure cyclase activity.</p><p id="Par604"><bold>Results:</bold> Most of the model-guided mutations either partly or completely inhibited sGC&#x003b2;-hsp90 complex formation, both in purified form and when the proteins were expressed in mammalian cells.

Several apo-sGC&#x003b2; variants that could no longer bind hsp90 could now bind an sGC&#x003b1; partner in cells to form a heme-free sGC&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer.</p><p id="Par605"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Heme-free sGC&#x003b2; and hsp90 do form a direct complex in mammalian cells that mimicks the molecular modeled structure.</p><p id="Par606">Complex formation is needed to drive heme insertion into the &#x003b2;-subunit, and to ultimately create an NO-responsive sGC&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer.</p><p id="Par607">Hsp90 binding to apo-sGC&#x003b2; also prevents a premature association with sGC&#x003b1;, and thus prevents formation of a heme-free sGC&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer in cells.</p><p id="Par608">Hsp90 directs sGC maturation by two mechanisms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig20"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Dual regulation of sGC maturation by hsp90 in mammalian cells.

Strikingly, caveolae-localization of GC-1 is dynamic. In cardiac pressure- or volume-overloaded animals, GC-1 re-localized away from caveolae, with subsequent oxidation and blunted NO-responsiveness in the hypertrophied heart [1&#x02013;3]. How GC-1 dynamically localizes to caveolae is unknown. S-palmitoylation is a reversible, enzyme-catalyzed, post-translational modification that enhances membrane affinity of protein substrates. We hypothesized that s-palmitoylation mediates GC-1 localization to caveolae and thereby modulates redox regulation of GC-1 in cardiac myocytes.</p><p id="Par619"><bold>Methods:</bold> To determine whether GC-1 is differentially s-palmitoylated in the hypertrophied heart, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) vs thoracotomy (Sham). S-palmitoylation was assessed by modified acyl-biotin exchange (ABE). Using computational prediction algorithms, we identified 5 conserved cysteine residues on GC1&#x003b1; as possible S-palmitoylation sites. We generated human GC1&#x003b1; mutants with serine substitution of each and all of the 5 cysteines (C3S, C15S, C176S, C497S, C595S, C-S*) and expressed the mutants and WT GC1&#x003b1; in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) using adenoviral mediated gene transfer.

Intracellular cGMP concentrations are regulated by degradation enzymes (phosphodiesterases, PDEs) as well as by active transport across the plasma membrane by multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 4 and 5. This study evaluated the functional effect of MRP 4 inhibition and the role of MRP 4-mediated cGMP export in mouse corpora cavernosa.</p><p id="Par628"><bold>Methods:</bold> Isometric tension of mouse corpora cavernosa was measured after cumulative addition of MK-571, an inhibitor of MRP 4, or sildenafil, a PDE-5 inhibitor.

In this pathway, proteins are tagged with ubiquitin chains and then degraded by the 26S proteasome. Although it is generally believed that degradation rates by the UPS are regulated solely at the level of ubiquitination, our recent studies established that proteasomal activities and degradation of misfolded and regulatory proteins are activated by cAMP and Protein Kinase A (PKA) through phosphorylation of proteasome subunit Rpn6.</p><p id="Par637">We show here that cGMP and Protein Kinase G (PKG) also activate 26S proteasomal activities, but via phosphorylation of a subunit other than Rpn6, and unlike cAMP and PKA, stimulates degradation of the bulk of cell proteins in addition to misfolded and regulatory proteins. 26S proteasomes purified from cultured human neuroblastoma cells, zebrafish, or tissues from mice treated with the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil exhibit enhanced degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins, ATP, and small peptides. Dephosphorylating the proteasomes from sildenafil-treated cells eliminated the greater activity and incubating control proteasomes with Protein Kinase G (PKG) stimulated their activity. Raising cGMP in several cell lines with PDE5 inhibitors or soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators also activated proteasomes and the degradation of the bulk of cell proteins by the UPS, without altering the autophagy-lysosome system. Inhibition of PKG, or siRNA-mediated knock down, blocked the cGMP-mediated increase in bulk protein degradation and transiently-overexpressing PKG stimulated it.</p><p id="Par638">Because neurodegenerative diseases are caused by an accumulation of mutant proteins, we tested whether raising cGMP could enhance proteasome function and protein degradation in mouse and zebrafish models of proteotoxic diseases of the nervous system. Sildenafil treatment of zebrafish larvae overexpressing mutant tau (A152T) reduced the accumulation of the mutant proteins and the associated neuronal death and anatomical defects. A 2-week sildenafil treatment of a mouse model of Charcot Marie Tooth 1B, a demyelinating neuropathy caused by expression of mutant <italic>Myelin Protein</italic> Zero which causes an unfolded protein response and proteasome impairment, stimulated proteasomal activity in the affected sciatic nerves, reduced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and increased myelin thickness and nerve conduction. Thus, cGMP and PKG are important regulators of proteasome activity and intracellular protein breakdown and agents that raise cGMP have the potential to combat neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec341"><title>P51 Anti-proliferative effects of cCMP and cGMP in breast cancer cell lines</title><sec id="Sec342"><title>Sabine Wolter, Malte Gl&#x000fc;sen, Roland Seifert</title><sec id="Sec343"><title>Medical School Hannover, Institute of Pharmacology, Hannover Lower Saxony, Germany</title><sec id="Sec344"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sabine Wolter - wolter.sabine@mh-hannover.de</title><p id="Par639"><italic>Journal of Translational Medicine</italic> 2019, <bold>17(2):</bold>P51</p><p id="Par640"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Breast cancer leads to over 450,000 annual deaths in women world-wide. The classification of breast cancer is based on the overexpression of certain receptors on the cell nucleus such as estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) genes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks ER, PR and HER2 gene amplification (1). The classification is important for the treatment: For ER+ and PR+ breast cancer, receptor-specific therapy is applicable; for TNBC breast cancer, chemotherapy is applied.</p><p id="Par641">The canonical second messenger cAMP and cGMP and also the non-canonical second messenger cCMP and cUMP show diverse effects. cCMP and cUMP induce apoptosis in several cell lines (2, 3).</p><p id="Par642"><bold>Methods:</bold> For our investigations we used the human ER+ MCF-7 and the ER- and PR-MDA-MB-231 (MDA) breast cancer cell line. The second messenger functions of cNMPs were imitated by the membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl ester analogues (cNMP-AMs), which release cNMPs after intracellular hydrolysis. The cell viability was analysed by the alamarBlue assay. Impedance was measured continuously for 120&#x000a0;h by the xCelligence system. Expression of genes, e.g. cGMP-dependent kinase isoforms (PKGI&#x003b1; and PKGII), ER, and PR was analysed by qRT-PCR analysis.</p><p id="Par643"><bold>Results:</bold> Cells showed a cell type-specific expression pattern for ER and PR.

</p><p id="Par646"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show an anti-proliferative activity of cCMP-AM and cGMP-AM in MCF-7 and MDA cells. Particularly important are the results for the MDA cells, because this cell line has been used as a model for the currently difficult-to-treat form of breast cancer. We thus plan to perform further studies with cCMP- and cGMP-AMs, other membrane-permeable analogues as well as a mixture of cNMP-AMs with chemotherapeutic drugs to analyse the mechanism by which cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines is reduced. The decrease of the cell index in MDA cells was restricted to 24&#x000a0;h; therefore, repeated replication of cNMP-AMs has to be investigated.</p><p id="Par647">
