Introduction</title><p>Volatiles occur in honey bee colonies as a complex mixture, determined by pheromones produced by bees, and other chemicals emitted by beeswax, honey, pollen and larval food [<xref rid="B1-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These volatiles have been identified as alcohols, aldehydes, benzenoid compounds, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, ketones and terpenoids [<xref rid="B1-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Volatiles in honey bee colonies are easily received by bees through antennal reception, sometimes over long distances. Therefore, using volatiles is an efficient means to moderate bee social behaviors. With regard to the volatiles that maintain social cohesion, most come from adult worker bees, such as the alarm pheromone inducing defensive behavior of honeybees [<xref rid="B2-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the Nasanov pheromone triggering aggregation [<xref rid="B3-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and other volatiles that transmit recognition cues. A few volatiles are detected in queens specifically [<xref rid="B4-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Very little effort has been made to determine the volatiles emitted directly by intact and alive honey bee larvae. In contrast, the nonvolatile chemicals of honey bee larvae are widely studied by solvent extraction methods [<xref rid="B5-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-Ocimene is the only identified volatile chemical produced by live worker larvae. There is evidence for the existence of other larval volatiles, because different chromatogram peaks in addition to (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene were discovered [<xref rid="B8-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but their compositions are not clear. There is also a lack of information about how these unknown larval volatiles change with larval development. However, an understanding of the composition and content variation of volatiles during larval development is necessary for interpreting their functions.</p><p>Food provided to honeybees could directly or indirectly affect honeybee volatile production. There is evidence that food shortages might stimulate worker bee larvae to release more (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene [<xref rid="B9-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and feeding honeybee worker larvae essential oils via diet supplements may change their volatiles [<xref rid="B10-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the volatiles extracted from worker larval food have not been reported. Only volatile carboxylic acids were identified in drone larval food, and other unidentified non-acidic volatiles were noteworthy [<xref rid="B11-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If the volatiles of the worker larval food were analyzed and combined with volatiles analysis of the worker larvae, it would provide a deep insight into the relationship between volatiles in larvae and their food during the same larval instar.</p><p>In this paper, we analyzed the volatiles from worker larvae and their food at different instars, using solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) combined with high resolution gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through this research, we discovered new volatiles associated with developing worker larvae and their food that have been previously overlooked.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-insects-10-00118"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>Three standard Chinese commercial strains of Western honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera ligustica</italic> L.) were used in this experiment. Large double-deep colonies (30,000 to 50,000 adult bees) were located at our apiary in the Institute of Apicultural Research in Beijing (39&#x000b0; N, 116.2&#x000b0; E). Queens were caged within plastic controllers (interior dimensions: 457 &#x000d7; 50 &#x000d7; 245 mm, only allowed for passage of worker bees) to oviposit on empty new combs (without pollen and nectar stores) for 24 h and were then removed to the outside of the controllers. Oviposition combs were kept in the controllers. At each caging interval, we obtained three combs with single-age cohorts of worker larvae. Caging events were carried out seven times, for a total of 21 combs.</p><p>After the combs were brought back to the laboratory, cells were randomly chosen to provide both the larval food and larvae samples for further analysis. Larvae and larval food was obtained with a small spatula. Larvae were inspected under the microscope, and only live and uninjured larvae were used for the study [<xref rid="B9-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-insects-10-00118"><title>2.1. Treatments</title><p>The volatiles of grouped larvae at three development stages were monitored. Group sizes were 20 second-instar (2nd-instar) larvae, 10 fourth-instar (4th-instar) larvae, and 10 fifth-instar (5th-instar) larvae. The larval food volatiles were also detected at different stages. To monitor changes in volatiles with respect to ontogeny, the amount of volatiles released by individual larva was determined [<xref rid="B8-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To compare volatiles content between larvae and food, the amount of volatiles released per unit weight of sample were calculated [<xref rid="B12-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Larvae and food were carefully transferred into 20 mL glass vials. Before analysis, 2 &#x000b5;L of 0.1 mg/L hexadecane hexane solution on a strip of filter paper was added as an internal standard for quantification. Clean empty vials were analyzed separately as controls to remove background interference.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-insects-10-00118"><title>2.2. SPDE-GC-MS System</title><p>Volatile extraction was performed using SPDE (solid phase dynamic extraction) equipment installed in a CTC-Combi-PAL auto sampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland), as described by Castro [<xref rid="B13-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The SPDE needle (SPDE-01/AC-50-56, 50 &#x000b5;m &#x000d7; 56 mm), coated with 90% polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 10% active charcoal (AC) was preconditioned before use. The equilibration between sample and headspace lasted for 30 min at 35 &#x000b0;C in an incubation pool. After equilibration, the extraction procedure occurred as follows: An extraction volume of 1 mL, agitator temperature of 35 &#x000b0;C, headspace syringe temperature of 35 &#x000b0;C, &#x02212;30 strokes, and a filling/ejecting speed of 25 &#x003bc;L/s. During the equilibration and extraction procedure, the larvae were alive and isolated from food for more than 45 min [<xref rid="B9-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The needle was then withdrawn and introduced into the injection port of the gas chromatograph, and pumped with 1 mL nitrogen at 100 &#x003bc;L/s for desorption and at 250 &#x000b0;C for 2 min in splitless mode.</p><p>GC-MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph-2010 equipped with a DB-5ms capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm &#x000d7; 0.25 &#x000b5;m; J&#x00026;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) coupled to a Shimadzu Quadrupole-2010 Mass Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The oven program was as follows: 35 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, 35&#x02013;200 &#x000b0;C at 5 &#x000b0;C/min, 200 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, 200&#x02013;250 &#x000b0;C at 10 &#x000b0;C/min, then 250 &#x000b0;C for 3 min. Injector temperature was maintained at 250 &#x000b0;C, transfer line temperature was 250 &#x000b0;C, and ion source temperature was 200 &#x000b0;C. Helium was used as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-insects-10-00118"><title>2.3. Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis</title><p>The identification of the compound with authentic standards was performed by comparing the mass spectra (Wiley6 and NIST05) and retention times to those of authentic standards. Compounds without standards were identified by comparing the mass spectrum peaks with data system libraries (Wiley6 and NIST05) and other published spectra (Mass Spectrometry Data Centre 1974). Additionally, the linear retention indices (LRI) of the compounds were calculated by injecting a series of n-alkanes (C10&#x02013;C25) (o2si Smart Solutions) into the GC-MS on two columns of different polarities under identical conditions. Authentic standards (listed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-10-00118">Supplementary Data, Table S1</xref>) purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) were serially diluted with hexane to make standard solutions. The peak areas on the total ion chromatogram were used for quantification. The calibration curve derived from a step-series of standard compounds for individual target compounds was built by plotting the area ratio of target compounds to the internal standard against the concentration ratio. The concentrations of volatile compounds were calculated based on the corresponding calibration curves.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-insects-10-00118"><title>2.4. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) using a correlation matrix was applied to the data to establish relationships between the different samples and their volatile compounds.

A total of 96 samples and 15 compounds were used (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy: 0.731; Bartlett&#x02019;s Test of Sphericity: <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The majority of information is contained in the first two PCs and accounts for 62.2% of the explained variation. A scatter plot of the PCA scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00118-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) shows the distribution of samples, and the corresponding loading plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00118-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) shows the volatiles in larvae and food at different development stages. Combining these results allows for interpretation of the relationships between the samples and their compounds.</p><p>The analyses show clear differences between the volatile profiles of larvae and the volatile profile of food. The two kinds of samples were separated by PC2. The majority of food samples had positive PC2 scores, attributable to the contribution of the aldehydes (a1, a2, a3), hydrocarbons (h1, h2, h3), and two of the terpenoids (t5, t7). Moreover, all of the larval samples had negative PC2 scores, driven by most of the terpenoids (t1, t2, t3, t4, t6), one ester (e1), one ketone (k1).</p><p>Samples of the same type were distinguished by PC1 according to development stages. Both larvae and food samples generally shifted from positive to negative along the PC1 axis, from the 2nd to 5th instar. Samples of 2nd-instar larvae located at the fourth quadrant were essentially characterized by the compounds distributed in that quadrant, especially terpenoids. Larvae at other instars were located in the third quadrant, implying that the volatiles of these stages were highly conserved and at relatively low levels. Part of the 2nd and 4th instars food located at the first quadrant was mainly characterized by the compounds distributed in that quadrant, especially aldehydes and hydrocarbons. The rest of the food samples were located in the third quadrant, with low PC scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-insects-10-00118"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Terpenoids have previously been reported as characteristic products of the Nasanov gland of worker bees and include nerol, geraniol, (<italic>E</italic>) and (<italic>Z</italic>)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>E</italic>)-farnesol [<xref rid="B14-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-Ocimene can be emitted by established mated queens [<xref rid="B4-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present study, we found that terpenoids are the major constituents of worker bee larvae. Larvae and food at the 2nd instar had a greater similarity of dry substance weight per unit volume compared to other stages. Assuming that larvae and food at the 2nd instar had similar densities, larvae would have released significantly higher amount of terpenoids than food; thus, these terpenoids, such as (<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene, (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene, (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-alloocimene and &#x003b1;-terpineol, were likely produced by the larvae. Some terpene synthases have been identified in larvae [<xref rid="B9-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The terpenoid concentration could be diluted in old larvae because body fluid accounts for most of their weight. Under these conditions, terpenoid contents in larvae were still significantly greater than in food, suggesting that compounds such as (<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene, (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene (t2) and (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-alloocimene could be identified as larval volatiles. (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene was determined to be a worker larval pheromone in a previous study [<xref rid="B12-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. (<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-Ocimene and &#x003b1;-terpineol have not been reported as honeybee volatiles, but they have been indicated as pheromones in other insects. (<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-Ocimene could be released by calling males of the Caribbean fruit fly (<italic>Anastrepha suspensa</italic>) [<xref rid="B15-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; &#x003b1;-Terpineol is reported as a compound of the male-produced aggregation pheromone secreted by the spined soldier bug (SSB) <italic>Podisus maculiventris</italic> [<xref rid="B16-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>(<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene, (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene and (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-alloocimene were once reported as the components of <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> essential oil, which is highly lethal to <italic>V. destructor</italic> [<xref rid="B17-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. &#x003b1;-Terpineol was demonstrated to have a repellent effect on the mite in a laboratory assay, and may therefore repress its entry into the brood cells of hives [<xref rid="B18-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These terpenoids might be noteworthy in <italic>V. destructor</italic> control.</p><p>There are sesquiterpenes identified as pheromones. (<italic>E</italic>)-b-Farnenese is an aphid alarm pheromone [<xref rid="B19-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, cedrol is a tentatively identified sesquiterpene with tertiary alcohol functionality. This alcohol could easily eliminate to give mixtures of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cedrene, these sesquiterpenes might be gathered by bees from gum and pollen of <italic>Cedrus deodara</italic> planted nearby the apiary.</p><p>All aldehydes detected in this study have been previously reported as the pheromone from calling males of <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> [<xref rid="B20-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the volatiles of hives. The aldehydes are emitted by adult worker bees [<xref rid="B21-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and virgin queens [<xref rid="B22-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and are present in enclosed brood combs containing active larvae and attending workers [<xref rid="B1-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our results found that aldehyde content per unit weight was higher in larval food than in larvae. This supports the assumption that aldehydes are secreted by worker bees, because larval food is a material that is manipulated by worker bees. This is consistent with the findings of Torto et al. [<xref rid="B23-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who reported these aldehydes in pollen. The result also explains why aldehyde contents in food did not show significant fluctuations during larval development. Aldehyde contents in larvae also remained steady, regardless of larval growth, except that a1 disappeared after the 2nd instar.</p><p>Hydrocarbons have transpiration-reducing functions in arthropods. They include linear and branched, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, with different numbers of carbon atoms ranging from 15 to 35 [<xref rid="B24-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some of these compounds function in nestmate recognition and social acceptance [<xref rid="B25-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Pentadecane has been reported as a larval volatile [<xref rid="B26-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It was detected in nurse bees [<xref rid="B27-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and queens at liftoff [<xref rid="B28-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], coupled with heptadecane. Octadecane is found in comb wax, with worker bees treated with this compound becoming less acceptable to their untreated nestmates [<xref rid="B29-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is released by the clearwing moth (<italic>Paranthrene diaphana</italic>) as female sex pheromone [<xref rid="B30-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. If we assume that cuticular hydrocarbons have an even and constant distribution on the surface of larvae, hydrocarbon content should increase with larval volume. A previous report has indicated that the level of tricosane and pentacosane would increase with drone larval development [<xref rid="B31-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, hydrocarbon content increased at different degrees in individual larvae during larval development. To some extent, this provides another support for the hypothesis. In food, the hydrocarbon content showed different degrees of decrease in per unit weight. This suggests that the production of hydrocarbons in food is independent from that in larvae. In other words, hydrocarbons in food are affected by the food provider, while hydrocarbons in larvae are affected by the larvae themselves.</p><p>Aliphatic esters are known as another group of pheromones secreted by insects. For example, ethyl acetate is a male pheromone produced by the Mediterranean fruit fly (<italic>Ceratitis capitate)</italic> [<xref rid="B32-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Acetate and propionate esters are found in the poison gland reservoir of <italic>Myrmecina graminicola</italic> [<xref rid="B33-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In honeybee colonies, aliphatic ester is also ubiquitous. Decyl decanoate is secreted by virgin queens from the tergal gland; ethyl oleate is produced by forager bees, suppressing the onset of foraging among younger bees. Ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids are brood pheromones mediating the communication between brood and worker bees [<xref rid="B14-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ethyl 2(<italic>E</italic>)-decenoate is tentatively identified in honeybees for the first time in the present study. Ethyl 2(<italic>E</italic>)-decenoate was once tentatively identified as one of the major compounds from fermented sugar baits for lepidopteran species resulting from sugar decomposition during the fermentation process [<xref rid="B34-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>(<italic>E</italic>)-Geranylacetone has been previously identified as a queen volatile [<xref rid="B28-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a male-produced sex pheromone of cerambycid beetle (<italic>Hedypathes betulinus</italic>) [<xref rid="B35-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and a male-produced aggregation pheromone of the brown spruce longhorn beetle (<italic>Tetropium fuscum</italic>) [<xref rid="B36-insects-10-00118" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Concentrations of this compound in larvae did not show obvious changes with the growth of individual larvae, and the concentrations only displayed a dramatic increase during the capping stage (the 5th instar). No significant differences in the concentrations of this compound were found in food at different stages, either. This may suggest that the compound is released by larvae for a specific role in this particular period.</p><p>When tracing the origins of the volatiles of worker larvae and larval food, the following factors need to be considered in the future: the volatiles of the adult worker bees, the in-hive matrix (such as honey, pollen, propolis and wax), and even the out-hive plants published by other studies based on the same locality. Moreover, the constancy of volatile components in worker larvae samples from different localities should be established. Additionally, more qualitative analysis should be conducted to the tentatively identified volatiles. Finally, only a single extraction method was applied in this study, and the use of more advanced extraction or detection methods for worker larvae volatiles might yield additional compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-insects-10-00118"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that volatiles could be identified from honeybee worker larvae and their food, in addition to (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene. We provide evidence that these volatiles change and follow certain change rule during larval development. The present study should provide some basis for further research into the molecular mechanism of the volatiles, and for verification of the role of the identified components.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-insects-10-00118"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/10/4/118/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/10/4/118/s1</uri>, Table S1: Linearity of response for standards.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="insects-10-00118-s001"><media xlink:href="insects-10-00118-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>H.Z., C.H. and Q.D. conceived and designed the experiments; H.Z. performed the experiments; H.Z. analyzed the data; Y.L., Y.W., Y.P. and Q.D. contributed reagents, materials, and analysis tools; H.Z. and C.H. wrote the manuscript.
