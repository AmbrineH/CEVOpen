It is believed that BJO can reduce tumor cell growth<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and has activities in anti-inflammation and anti-malaria.<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In China, two BJO-contained marketed products, javanica oil emulsion injection and BJO soft capsule, are widely used in association with chemotherapy for cancer patients. Almost all the studies demonstrated that the side effects caused by chemotherapy were mitigated and patients&#x02019; quality of life were improved significantly by jointly using javanica oil emulsion injection and BJO soft capsule. One of the commonly adjunctive therapeutic areas of these two BJO marketed products is gastric cancer.</p><p>Oleic acid is BJO&#x02019;s main activity component, so it is commonly used as the essential indicator for the determination of BJO.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, oleic acid exists not only as the free one as mentioned earlier but also in the glycerol trioleate as well. Actually, oleic acid and linoleic acid amount to 63.3% and 21.2%, respectively, in BJO. After orally taking glycerol trioleate, gastric lipase will initiate the digestion of glycerol trioleate. Later in the small intestine, glycerol trioleate is broken down by pancreatic lipase, which acts primarily at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of glycerol trioleate to produce 2-monoglyceride and free fatty acid.<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hence, most commonly used methods for the analysis of oleic acid in pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of BJO preparations involve hydrolysis<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> by specific lipase or methyl esterification by an acid or a base catalyst,<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> through which the total oleic acid could be calculated including those on the sn-2 position. However, such a preprocess is highly impacted by the specificity of lipase and completion of the reaction; any inappropriate procedure will lead to the loss of starting glycerol trioleate and will fail to obtain the whole oleic acid. After the preprocess, gas chromatography (GC) or gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS) plays an indispensable role in the final analysis of oleic acid as oleic acid has mainly ultraviolet end absorption, which makes it hard to be detected by the ordinary high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical method.<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, GC has its drawbacks when detecting fatty acids, such as instability, low accuracy, tailing peaks and interferences.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore, compared to taking the oleic acid as the detective component, glycerol trioleate is a preferred indicated marker for the pharmacokinetic study of BJO preparation due to high content of glycerol trioleate in BJO and slow digestion rate and extent of glycerol trioleate. Glycerol trioleate in BJO is constituted by the long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> oleic acid, which takes a slower uptake route.<xref rid="b11-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate laboratory self-prepared BJO&#x02019;s therapeutic effect against gastric cancer and gastric ulcer by comparing with commercial products. In addition, to better achieve BJO&#x02019;s therapeutic effects in stomach, gastroretentive drug delivery system (GRDDS) was investigated. As conventional systems do not possess the capacity to face gastric emptying, the incomplete release of drugs and the concomitant reduction of dose effectiveness are the consequences as conventional systems cannot be retained in the stomach.<xref rid="b12-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Hence, we applied a novel oral gastroretentive preparation as a drug-control pattern with in vivo pharmacokinetic study performed. A high-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method by detecting the concentration of glycerol trioleate in pharmacokinetic study was also established so as to increase the accuracy, convenience and repeatability of detection and shed light on the possible alternative in BJO quantification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>The seeds of <italic>B. javanica</italic> were purchased from Guangdong Province, China, and were identified by Dr Hongmei Zhang (School of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine).

The presence of inflammatory cells, lymphocytes infiltrating into the gastric mucosal tissues and defective gastric epithelium, which was found in the control group, did not exist in the high-dose BJO group, indicating that BJO had a therapeutic effect against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, when administered at oral doses, particularly at the dose of 0.8 g/kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Modeling of drug-release profiles of BJO gastroretentive floating bead</title><p>The percentage of BJO released was found to be a little bit quick for the initial 1 h but maintained a slow release afterward and reached &#x0003e;90% release after 6 h.<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similar drug-release behaviors among the three batches could be found, which indicated that the formulation and technology used to develop BJO gastroretentive floating bead had a good reproducibility.</p><p>Sodium alginate and carrageenan are hydrophilic, colloidal substances. They are expected to undergo hydration and form a protective gel layer upon reaching the simulated gastric fluid (SGF). With more gel structure formed, the diffusion hindrance in SGF was increased. Thus, the release of BJO in SGF was slower. Besides, with the penetration of water into the beads, the presence of carrageenan formed a large number of pores along the matrices of beads, leading to the formation of channels that brought the complete release of BJO at the end. Thus, the drug-release mechanism was classified as a combination of gel diffusion and erosion controlling.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-12-535">Table 1</xref> lists the values for the correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), which was used to determine the best-fit kinetic model.

This could attribute to the slow uptake rate in the stomach of BJO gastroretentive floating bead and nearly completed digestion and absorption of glycerol trioleate in the small intestine<xref rid="b16-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> of BJO soft capsule.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue distribution of BJO gastroretentive floating bead</title><p>After orally administrating BJO gastroretentive floating bead and marketed BJO soft capsule at the same concentration, distribution of glycerol trioleate in animals&#x02019; stomachs was observed.

In this study, we investigated the potency and efficacy of the self-prepared BJO against gastric cancer cell lines. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the BJO that we produced presented a stronger anti-gastric cancer activity compared to the commercial product javanica oil emulsion injection.</p><p>We also investigated the self-made BJO&#x02019;s effects on gastric ulcer. The animal models were induced by ethanol administration since ethanol could produce necrotic damage penetrating deeply into the mucosa,<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> disappearance of the mucus cells,<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> hemorrhagic erosion<xref rid="b23-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and inflammatory cell infiltration.<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> As expected, ethanol caused a marked gastric ulceration in the present study. Yet pretreated and posttreated BJO exhibited dose-dependent preventative and therapeutic effects against gastric mucosal damage. Severe gastric submucosal lesions, irregular arrangement of glands, epithelial cell loss and lymphocyte infiltration in mice with ulcer were alleviated. The high dose of BJO exhibited a similar preventative effect with RAN, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, that inhibits stomach acid production,<xref rid="b24-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> when acting against stomach injury.</p><p>Although BJO has evidently strong pharmacological action, its clinical use is restricted on account of its nonspecific distribution, low therapeutic index<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and poor systemic bioavailability.<xref rid="b26-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Besides, the current BJO preparations available in the market are frequently administrated with large dosage (oral emulsion: 2 mL BJO/20 mL, 20 mL/time, two to three times/day; soft capsule: 0.5 mL/capsule, four capsules/time, two to three times/day).<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, different delivery systems have been investigated for improvement of BJO&#x02019;s absorption and bioavailability when treating cancer, such as liposomes,<xref rid="b28-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> nanocarriers,<xref rid="b29-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> emulsion<xref rid="b28-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and microencapsule.<xref rid="b30-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, as far as we are concerned, no particular efforts were made on expanding the narrow absorption window as well as strengthening local activity in stomach since BJO&#x02019;s prominent role was showed in this segment. Hence, we developed a GRDDS to improve BJO&#x02019;s bioavailability after oral administration in a previous study.<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Also in that study,<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> we investigated in vitro release profile of BJO gastroretentive floating bead. It was found that even under the agitation at 100 rpm, the beads still delivered stable drug release for 6 h. Combing with the kinetic parameters, in the present study, we concluded that quick release was observed at first in the system due to part of the drug on the surface of the beads. Then, the embedding of rest of the drug into the gel matrix beads controlled the drug release. As we mentioned, the system formed a gel layer upon reaching the SGF so that the gel layer could control the drug-release rate effectively. Later on, with the water penetrated into the beads, the drug release from gel matrices was controlled by erosion of the polymers.</p><p>In order to investigate whether BJO gastroretentive floating bead could really improve the bioavailability of BJO, pharmacokinetic evaluation was applied. We studied drug concentration in both blood and stomach of rats. First, the concentration of oleic acid was measured; unfortunately no oleic acid, as we expected, was detected at each time point after correcting by the original oleic acid concentration in blank plasma. This might be because gastric lipase has a greater activity against short-chain than long-chain triacylglycerol,<xref rid="b31-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> while glycerol trioleate in BJO is a long chain as mentioned. Therefore, glycerol trioleate in stomach was cleaved very slowly. Besides, as free acid bound in position sn-2 of the glycerol is much better absorbed in the form of monoacylglycerols<xref rid="b32-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and the content of oleic acid on sn-2 is ~74.9%,<xref rid="b33-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> suggesting that the concentration of oleic acid could be hardly measured directly unless a preprocess is applied. In this regard, we took glycerol trioleate as the indicative component to see whether our gastroretentive floating bead could increase the therapeutic effect of BJO. After removing the endogenous concentration of glycerol trioleate, we found that although the drug concentration in blood cannot be detected after 6 h due to the slow uptake rate in stomach and almost complete digestion and absorption of glycerol trioleate in the small intestine as mentioned before, the drug concentration in the stomach was detectable up to 6 h and the value was much higher than that of marketed BJO soft capsule, whose tissue concentration was almost declined to zero. This result, showing a slower drug release that BJO gastroretentive floating bead possessed, which corresponded to the finding of in vitro drug-release profile<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and was also evidenced by the SPET/CT study, which demonstrated that all the floating beads remained in the stomach and no signal was observed in the small intestine.<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, the anti-gastric tumor effect of self-prepared BJO was investigated. The results showed that the BJO we extracted had more effective action on cancer cells compared with commercial formulation. Self-made BJO also showed a paralleled capability with RAN in preventing and treating gastric ulcer. We developed a BJO gastroretentive floating bead to increase the bioavailability. The in vitro drug release study showed an excellent sustained release characteristic. Pharmacokinetic studies by HPLC-MS/MS indicated BJO gastroretentive floating bead&#x02019;s enhanced absorption and oral bioavailability with longer drug residence time in the stomach compared to the BJO marketed production. Hence, BJO gastroretentive floating bead would be a promising sustained and controlled drug delivery system for BJO.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported
