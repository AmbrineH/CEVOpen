The influencing factors in the fermentation process for producing DHA and &#x003b2;-carotene have proven to be: the concentration of carbon source (different glycerol crude and pure concentrations) for both of them, and in particular temperature for DHA and pH for &#x003b2;-carotene. Testing the effect of these parameters was determined: biomass, DHA and &#x003b2;-carotene concentration. The highest production by <italic>S. limacinum</italic> was obtained at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, while using a quantity of 90&#x000a0;g/L of glycerol (crude or pure) as a carbon source. Temperature was the main factor that influenced the biosynthesis of DHA. The quantification of DHA was made by GC&#x02013;MS chromatography, followed by a purification process, with the end result of DHA in pure phase. The maximum quantities for &#x003b2;-carotene production were obtained with pH 7 and 60&#x000a0;g/L of crude glycerol.

DHA is one of the most studied bioactive compounds of marine origin due to clinical evidence that highlights the importance of this fatty acid in the development of neuronal and retinal functions especially in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Currently the main source of DHA is fish oil, which has become a very popular food supplement since of its health benefits. The composition and quality of this traditional source of fatty acids is the variable being influenced by species of fish and environmental factors. There is a growing awareness that the current source of DHA is in decline, moreover environmental contamination may result in contamination of fish oil with heavy metals. Thus, efforts are being made to find an alternative and sustainable source for production of DHA. Recently, microalgae have been given special attention as an alternative source of DHA, and among the many species, <italic>Schizochytrium limacinum</italic> has been noted for its ability to turn waste in the value-add products, such as DHA, especially when grown in culture medium with glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. <italic>S. limacinum</italic> is a marine microalga, which has the ability to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, and contains a large amount of DHA in the cytoplasm, but it needs a significant amount of salt to grow. The concentration of salt in the culture medium can be adjusted to the optimal amount by supplementing the medium with various concentrations of crude glycerol.</p><p id="Par9">Crude glycerol, due to its high salinity, favors the growth and development of marine microorganisms.

</p><p id="Par62">A temperature of 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C favored the biomass accumulation and DHA production and the explanation might be due to the increased membrane fluidity as cell response to the low temperature conditions. Also, the 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C led to an increased availability of intracellular molecular oxygen, which facilitates the oxygen dependent enzymes in the desaturation and elongation of DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Small changes observed in the range 20&#x02013;24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C may be due to the fact that a lower temperature is favorable for the production of DHA, but it leads to a decrease in cell growth.

This suggests that cells adapt to a high temperature by producing more saturated fat. In order to maintain adequate lipid fluidity of the membrane at low temperatures, the proportions of unsaturated fatty acids is increased, but the highest increase can be seen with polyunsaturated acids. This is a phenotypic adaptation of the fatty acid composition in concordance with the temperature increase. Higher quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures derived from lipid stabilization at these temperatures. Also increased production of polyunsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures may also be due to the sensitivity of the biosynthetic enzymes of fatty acids to temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Optimizing the culture medium to improve the production of biomass and &#x003b2;-carotene by <italic>B. trispora</italic></title><p id="Par65">In an attempt to improve the production of &#x003b2;-carotene by cultivating <italic>B. trispora</italic> in the bioreactor in addition to the influence of carbon concentration, the effect of pH was also analyzed.

The &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> of the absorption spectral bands indicates the length of the p-electron chain and the identity of the chromophore, the carotenoids will absorb at longer wavelengths since have longer systems of linear conjugated double bonds.

The highest concentration of DHA was achieved at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C when the concentration of both carbon sources was 90&#x000a0;g/L. The DHA fraction purity from the total lipid extract after winterization process was 65%. The highest &#x003b2;-carotene production was obtained when the carbon source used was crude glycerol 60&#x000a0;g/L (13.5&#x02013;14&#x000a0;g/100 wet biomass) at a pH 7. The &#x003b2;-carotene extracted from biomass was purified with a yield higher than 99%. This implies that the glycerol can be utilized as alternative carbon source to glucose in the fermentation medium in order to produce DHA and &#x003b2;-carotene which act as nutraceutical supplements. It appears that glucose was fully utilized in the fermentation medium by the strain, resulting in higher biomass growth but not higher &#x003b2;-carotene or DHA productivity compared with the productivity when using pure or crude glycerol. This could be a potential aspect to offset production costs and enhance commercial viability of the process.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>B. trispora</italic></term><def><p id="Par2">
