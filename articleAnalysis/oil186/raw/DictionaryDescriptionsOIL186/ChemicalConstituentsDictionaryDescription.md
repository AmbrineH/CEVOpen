**Questions for Peter:**
========================

-   Throughout the text, should I switch the word “tested” to “mentioned”, as
    in: *"Table number containing chemical composition of EO mentioned in the
    article” *vs.* “tested in the article” *?

-   I’m not sure if I’ve described the column headings correctly

    -   **E2.0_compound_identifiers:** is that EssOilEbv2.0?

        -   **notes_for_lookup_in_compound_dictionary:** are these Ambarish’s
            notes, or were they found in the articles?

**Only 12 PMCIDs in this table**
