   <span class="italic">K. anatolica</span> was collected in 2015 at different altitudes of Lakes Region Turkey (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). All samples were collected at full flowering stage for species identification and fruit maturing stage for essential oil analyses. Plant materials were identified by Dr. Hasan ÖZÇELİK of the Department of Biology at Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta according to “Flora of Turkey” (Davis et al., 1988) and voucher specimens (63.36.1.1) and deposited in the Herbarium GUL, at Suleyman Demirel University, Turkey. As a description of 
   <span class="italic">K. anatolica:</span> Erect, branched, glabrous perennial with terete very finely ridged stems, up to 100 cm. Basal leaves ovate-triangular, 10-30 χ 5-10 cm, 1-2-pinnate; ultimate segments ovate, pinnatifid or irregularly toothed, 2-3 χ 1.5-3 cm, petiole 8-15 cm. Upper cauline leaves 1-pinnate with linear-oblong to linear segments 30 χ 1.5-2 mm and broad sheathing petioles. Umbel rays 20-30, subequal, 1.5-3.5 cm. Bracts up to 12, narrow oblong-setaceous, 2-5 mm long. Umbellules 20-25 flowered; pedicels 1.5-4 mm. Bracteoles 3-6, linear, 1-5 mm. Petals yellow. Fruit oblong-cylindrical, 3.5-1.5 χ 1-1.5 mm, not attenuate towards apex, glabrous, ridges of mericarps broadly filiform, vittae numerous, irregularly arranged. Stylopodium conical.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis was performed on QP5050 GC-MS equipped with FID detector. The GC was equipped with CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column (50 m x 0.32 mm; film thickness = 0.25 μm) and helium was used carrier gas with flow rate of 1 mL/min. The GC oven was heated from 60°C to 230°C at a rate of 3°C/min, the final temperature was then maintained during 20 min. The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250°C. Injection volume 0.1 mL of 1% solution prepared in n-hexane; split ratio 20:1. The mass spectrometer was operating in EI mode at 70 eV with mass scan range of 40- 450 amu. Identification of constituents was done on the basis of RI (determined with reference to homologous series of n-alkanes C8-C25, under identical experimental condition), MS library search (NIST 08MS Library (Version 2.0 f) and Wiley MS 9th edition), and by comparison with MS literature data (Adams, 2007). The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on GC peak area (FID response) without using correction factor.</p>
