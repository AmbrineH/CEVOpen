 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) is one of the largest families of flowering plants with more than 3500 species spread across 455 genera (Arbizu et al., 2014). In Turkey, it is represented by 101 genera belonging to 485 species included in 511 taxa and endemism rate of the family is about 37.3% with 181 species (Özhatay et al., 2009; Baser and Kırımer, 2014). Lake District of Turkey located on the boundary between Mediterranean and Iran-Turan geographic regions is very rich in the number of plant species, particularly in Apiaceae family. It was reported that more than 70 taxa included in the Apiaceae family has been found in the floristic studies conducted in the region (Davis, 1988; Sağıroğlu and Duman, 2006; Yıldırımlı and Selvi, 2006; Pimenov and Leonov, 2014). Members of the family Apiaceae are usually comprised of aromatic plants having a distinctive flavour attributed to high concentration of volatile terpenic compounds (Kılıc, 2014a, b).</p>

  <span class="italic">Kundmannia</span> is a typical genus of the Apiaceae and are well represented in Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, Syria and North Africa. The genus 
  <span class="italic">Kundmannia</span> consists of five species; 
  <span class="italic">K. anatolica, K. syriaca, K. insulana, K. pastinacifolia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K. sicula</span> (Djarri et al., 2008). The genus 
  <span class="italic">Kundmannia</span> is represented by 
  <span class="italic">K. anatolica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K. syriaca</span> in Turkey with 100% endemism (Özhatay et al., 2009). 
  <span class="italic">Kundmannia anatolica</span> Hub.-Mor. is located at elevations between 550-650 m in Southeast Anatolia region of Turkey (Davis et al., 1988; Çinbilgel and Gökçeoğlu, 2010). However, our recent field observations in the region showed the species spread at elevations between 400-1560 m in Lakes Region of Turkey in C3 Antalya, Isparta and Burdur (Karadogan et al., 2016). Similar to the other taxa of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Kundmannia, K. anatolica</span> produces essential oils, which can be extracted from different parts of the plant, including the fruit, root and flower as well as stem and leafs, with significant diversity in yield and composition. In general, the relative composition of essential oils varies remarkably with geographical position, climate conditions and several other factors (Arruda et al., 2012). There are many studies related to the essential oils in Apiaceae species. To our best knowledge, there is no study performed on the chemical composition of fruit from 
  <span class="italic">K. anatolica</span>, but essential oil compounds and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts of the specie has been recently reported by Paksoy et al. (2016). Some studies on the essential oil composition of fruit and aerial parts from 
  <span class="italic">K. sicula</span> growing in Algeria and Tunisia have been carried out (Djarri et al., 2008; Abderrahim et al., 2013; Faidi et al., 2014).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, this study was aimed at testing possible altitudinal effect on volatile chemical constituents of essential oil obtained from the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">K. anatolica</span> growing spontaneously in different altitudes of Lakes Region in Turkey. This is the first report on the composition of essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">K. anatolica</span> fruits.
