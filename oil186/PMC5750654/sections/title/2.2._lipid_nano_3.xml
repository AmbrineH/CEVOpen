  <span class="italic">w</span> of EO) were separately heated at 85 °C. Two series of NLCs were prepared: NLCs BEO1–4 were obtained using a constant amount of lipid phase (7%

  <span class="italic">w</span>) with different ratios solid lipid/liquid lipid, while NLCs CEO1–3 contained a constant amount of solid lipid (7%

  <span class="italic">w</span>) and different percentages of liquid lipid.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When both phases were at the same temperature, the water phase was slowly added to the oil phase while being stirred and then the resulting colloidal system was cooled to room temperature, under constant agitation. The turbid mixture turned into a clear system at the phase inversion temperature (PIT), whose value was determined using a conductivity meter, model 525 (Crison, Modena, Italy).</p>
