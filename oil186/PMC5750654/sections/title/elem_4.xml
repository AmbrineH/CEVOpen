  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For negative-staining electron microscopy, 5 µL of lipid nanocarriers dispersions were placed on a 200-mesh formvar copper grid (TAAB Laboratories Equipment, Berks, UK) and allowed to be adsorbed. Then the surplus was removed by filter paper. A drop of 2% (
   <span class="italic">w</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span>) aqueous solution of uranyl acetate was added over 2 min. After removing the surplus, the sample was dried at room temperature before imaging it with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM 2010, Jeol, Peabody, MA, USA) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean particle size and size distribution were determined in double distilled water by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer NanoZS (ZEN 3600, Malvern, Germany).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the samples were diluted at 1:5 (sample/water) and thermostated at 25 °C for 2 min prior to the measurement. The instrument performed particle sizing by means of a 4 mW laser diode operating at 670 nm. Using the same instrument, ζ potential was determined by the technique of laser Doppler velocimetry, after diluting the sample with KCl 1 mM (pH 7.0), according to a procedure already reported [
