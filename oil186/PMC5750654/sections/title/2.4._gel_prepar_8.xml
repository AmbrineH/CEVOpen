 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gel formulations were prepared using Carbopol Ultrez 21 as a gelling agent and TEA for neutralization, and their compositions are reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t002" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-t002">Table 2</a>. The rheological additive (0.8%

  <span class="italic">w</span>) was carefully dispersed in the aqueous phase, under mild agitation. The aqueous phase consisted of deionized water (gel A), deionized water containing EO and Solubilisant Gamma 2428 (gel B and B1), SLN A (gel C), NLC CEO3 (gel D and D1). As rosemary essential oil was poorly water soluble, we added a solubilizing compound to obtain aqueous gels containing different percentages of EO. All gel formulations were prepared using deionized water containing 0.35%

  <span class="italic">w</span> methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone as preservatives. The resulting mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 24 h, to allow complete polymer hydration. Then, TEA (0.8%
