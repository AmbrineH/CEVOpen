 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean particle size and size distribution were determined in double distilled water by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer NanoZS (ZEN 3600, Malvern, Germany).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the samples were diluted at 1:5 (sample/water) and thermostated at 25 °C for 2 min prior to the measurement. The instrument performed particle sizing by means of a 4 mW laser diode operating at 670 nm. Using the same instrument, ζ potential was determined by the technique of laser Doppler velocimetry, after diluting the sample with KCl 1 mM (pH 7.0), according to a procedure already reported [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each measurement was performed in triplicate and values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.).</p>
