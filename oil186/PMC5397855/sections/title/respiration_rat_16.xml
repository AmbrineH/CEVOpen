 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respirometry bioassays were conducted 3 h after the beetles were exposed or not exposed to garlic essential oil and their constituents, as previously detailed. The doses used corresponded to the recorded LC
  <sub>50</sub> of each toxic compound and control consisted of insect treated with distilled water. Carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) (μL of CO
  <sub>2</sub> h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>/insect) production was measured with a respirometer of the type CO
  <sub>2</sub> Analyzer TR
  <sub>3</sub>C (Sable System International, Las Vegas, USA), using methodology adapted from previous studies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>. Respirometers (25 mL) were used, each one holding 3 adults of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> with mixed sex and connected to a closed system. CO
  <sub>2</sub> production was measured after the insects were acclimated in the chambers for a period of 12 h at a temperature of 27 ± 2 °C. To quantify the CO
  <sub>2</sub> produced inside each chamber, compressed oxygen gas (99.99% pure) was passed through the chamber at a flow of 100 mL min
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for a period of 2 min. This airflow forces all produced CO
  <sub>2</sub> molecules to pass through an infrared reader coupled to the system, which makes a continuous measurement of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> produced by the insects and held inside each chamber. After CO
  <sub>2</sub> measurement, the insects were removed from the chambers and then weighed using an analytical balance (Sartorius BP 210D, Göttingen, Germany). Respiration rate values were not normalized by body mass because this method masks the individual effects of the variables
