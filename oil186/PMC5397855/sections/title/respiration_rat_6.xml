  <sub>2</sub> h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>/insect) of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> was significantly different for garlic essential oil and compounds with concentrations estimated for the LC
  <sub>90</sub> values in larva (F
  <sub>3,71</sub> = 6.84, P &lt; 0.001), pupa (F

  <sub>3,71</sub> = 10.45, P &lt; 0.001). Respiration rate observed between 1 and 3 h were different in larva (F
  <sub>2,71</sub> = 4.95, P &lt; 0.001), pupa (F
  <sub>2,71</sub> = 12.75, P &lt; 0.001), and adult (F
  <sub>2,71</sub> = 58.23, P &lt; 0.001). The interaction treatments and time in was different in larva (F
  <sub>3,71</sub> = 10.45, P &lt; 0.001), but was not different in pupa (F
  <sub>3,71</sub> = 0.15, P = 0.932) and adult (F
  <sub>3,71</sub> = 3.19, P = 0.041). In general, garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide reduced the respiration rate of
