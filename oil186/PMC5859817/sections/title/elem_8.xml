  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Screening Bioactive Compounds of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> Essential Oil
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">C. operculatus</span> leaves essential oil (CLO) has yellowish color and fragrant odor, with 0.1% yield. The presence of some active compounds in CLO was determined by GC-MS analysis, and data were recorded in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. Briefly, a total of 13 compounds were identified in CLO: 6-camphenol; isopinocarveol; p-cymen-8-ol; (−)-myrtenol; I-verbenone; cis-carveol; ethaneperoxoic acid, 1-cyano-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentyl ethaneperoxate; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; (−)-globulol; 2-(4a,8-dimethyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydronaphthalen-2-yl) propan-1-; and longipinocarvone. Most of bioactive compounds identified in CLO exhibited antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activities, such as isopinocarveol, (−)-myrtenol; I- verbenone; cis-carveol; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; (−)-globulol. This finding indicated that CLO may be used as topical treatment, at least as the anti-infective and antiseptic agent, for burn wound. Therefore, the next question has been raised whether CLO could inhibit the growth and/or eliminate some common bacteria inhabited on burn wound or not.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Screening of Antibacterial Activity of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> Essential Oil
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous report, Livimbi and Komolafe (2007) suggested that
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> was the most common bacteria isolated from burn wound, followed by
   <span class="italic"> P. mirabilis, Streptococci </span>spp.,
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Salmonella</span>, and
   <span class="italic"> Klebsiella </span>spp. [
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">21</a>]. Therefore, we investigated antibacterial activity of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil against two bacteria commonly found on burn wound such as
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> to prove the anti-infective efficiency of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> essential oil (CLO). Furthermore,
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> also represent two types of bacteria, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. We found that both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> whereas they did not exhibit antibacterial activity against
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The diameter of inhibition zones of gentamicin (positive control) against
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> was highest (11.37 ± 0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03 ± 0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17 ± 0.12 mm, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa (</span>12.07 ± 0.15), but
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </span>was resistant with commercial tamanu oil and CLO (diameters of inhibition zones = diameter of dishes, 6 mm). These results were identical with previous reports [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">19</a>, 
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. In previous study, Nguyen et al. (2017) suggested that methanol extract of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> leaves could inhibit
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> but not hinder
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> growth [
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> leaves from Nepal against
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> has also been demonstrated [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">19</a>]. However, Dung et al. (2008) indicated that essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> isolated from flower buds could inhibit both
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> [
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">16</a>]. It may be explained that different parts of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> possess a variety of bioactive compounds which account for different antimicrobial activities of essential oils isolated from different parts of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus.</span> In addition, although tamanu oil is effective remedy for burn wound treatment,
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> is also resistant with commercial tamanu oil [
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. From these results, we suggested that CLO has antimicrobial activity against
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, the most common skin wound opportunistic bacterium, but the effectiveness of CLO is lower than commercial tamanu oil. This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment. Next we investigated the wound contractive ability of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil on second-degree burn wound model.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Establishment of Second-Degree Burn Wound Model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second-deep-degree burn is characterized by the extent of injury through the epidermis and into the dermis with painful, red, blistered, moist wound [
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. To confirm severity of burn wound, the histological examination of burned skin collected from burn lesion was performed with pathological experts from Division of Pathological Anatomy, the Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Centre of Military Hospital 175. Histological analysis showed that injury of burn wound was extended into both epidermis and dermis. In normal skin section, thick squamous epithelium covered the epidermis, and both of epidermis and dermis had the normal structure with several hair follicles and sebaceous glands. In burn wound skin section, epidermis and dermis lost their normal structure. Of note, squamous epithelium layer was removed, and epidermis was necrotized. Moreover, the underlying stromal tissue was swollen and congestive. These results indicated that the second-degree burn model was successfully established in experimental mice (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. Supportive Effect of
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> Essential Oil on Burn Wound Model
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that both tamanu oil and essential oil accelerated the wound contraction rate of burn wound after 10 days and 20 days (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). At the beginning of the experiment, all burn wounds were of similar sizes in three groups. In day 10, burn wound areas of tamanu oil and CLO treated mice (0.57 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.03 mm
   <span class="sup">2</span>, accordingly) were smaller than saline treated group (0.73 ± 0.04 cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>), and the significant difference of wound contraction between tamanu oil and essential oil treated mice was observed (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, essential oil group was fully recovered whereas the burn areas of tamanu oil treated and control groups remained after 20 days. Of note, wound healing process of tamanu oil treated mice was also significantly higher than control mice at this time-point (0.22 ± 0.03 versus 0.31 ± 0.02 cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). These results implied that
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil has supportive effect on wound healing process and its efficiency was higher than the commercial tamanu oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For reconfirmation of efficiency of essential oil on wound healing process, we investigated the microscopic structure of skin from burn wounds treated with essential oil, tamanu oil, and saline via histological examination (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Histology studies revealed that burn wounds treated with essential oil developed complete epidermal structure: squamous epithelium covered on epidermis, the stratum spinosum keratinized, observation of matured hair follicles, thick and neatly arranged fibers, and scattered immune cells. That proved that burn wound treated with essential oil was fully recovered. In tamanu oil treated mice, wounds were partially recovered with existence of coagulative necrosis region on epidermis and vascular congestion, swollen stromal tissue, and no matured hair follicles. On the contrary, saline treated mice formed uneven epidermal layer with the necrotic ulcer on epidermis layer, infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmatocytes and multinuclear leukocytes, existence of granulation tissue, and fibrosis region. These results suggested that
   <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil did not only accelerate the wound healing rate but also helped the wound recovery with normal structure.
