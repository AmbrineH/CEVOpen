 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burn, one of the most common household injuries, is defined as a type of damage of skin or other tissues caused by exposure to heat, chemicals, electric currents, flame, hot liquid, hot metal or object, steam, radiation from X-ray, sunlight, ultraviolet, and so forth. Among them, the thermal injuries are leading cause of burn (86%), followed by electrical sources (4%) and contacting with chemical sources (3%), and other sources of burns (7%) [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Note that flame and scald burns account for the majority of burns in children and adults. Thermal burn causes not only a small or local injury which can be treated at home or outpatient but also the severe and fatal injuries which require the in-hospital treatment. The World Health Organization estimates that thermal burns account for approximated 6.6 million injuries and 300 thousand deaths annually over the world [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Furthermore, Kemp et al. (2017) also suggest that 25,000 children who suffered from burns or scald require the Emergency Department admission in English and Wales each year, of which 3,800 patients must receive in-hospital treatment [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. The severity of burn is evaluated by the extent and the depth of burn. The extent of burn is estimated through total body surface area burn (% TBSA) whereas the depth of burn is estimated by the deep extent of injury into the epidermis or dermis. If the burn extent involves only the epidermis, thus it is classified as superficial burn (first degree). When the burn involves epidermis and dermis, it is categorized as partial thickness burn (second degree). The other burn is full-thickness burn (third degree) which extend into subcutaneous fat or deeper. Thermal burns resulted in both local injuries and a systemic response, in case of severe burn (% TBSA &gt; 20%). Deep and widespread burns may cause many complications such as infection, hypovolemia, hypothermia, blood clotting, scarring, joint mobility problem, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In superficial and partial thickness of burns, topical antibacterial regimes with antibiotic ointments or cream and/or absorbent dressing to cover the burn wound are recommended. Otherwise, in deep partial and full thickness of burns, the surgical excision of damaged tissue and skin grafting are performed to cure the wound.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several medical plants exerting antibacterial activity and/or wound healing potential have been applied for treating burn injuries such as
  <span class="italic"> Aloe vera</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Achillea millefolium</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Carica papaya</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> Datura alba</span> [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">10</a>]. Herbal preparations may be obtained from a variety of parts of plants (fruit, leaf, bulb, stem, root, pollen, whole plant, and seed) and extraction forms (oil, acetone, methanol, ethanol, hydroalcoholic, and aqueous extract). In Polynesia and Southeast Asia, tamanu oil which is produced from
  <span class="italic"> Calophyllum inophyllum </span>is the well-known and common use product to heal thermal burn wound. Tamanu oil has been proven as promising topical remedy which exerts acceleration of skin healing process, antineuralgic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">11</a>]. Note that the number of researches using vegetable oil and essential oil to treat burn wound has been increased. Dursun et al. (2003) suggested that thymus essential oil could reduce NO level induced by burn and enhance the formation of new tissue in burn wound [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">12</a>]. The beneficial effect of
  <span class="italic"> Nigella sativa </span>seed oil on burn wound healing process also was proven [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">13</a>]. Furthermore, Khedir et al. (2016) observed that
  <span class="italic"> Pistacia lentiscus </span>fruit oil accelerated wound contraction in CO
  <sub>2</sub> laser burned wound model [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">14</a>]. These findings consolidate the idea using the vegetable and vegetable oils for treating burn wound.

  <span class="italic">Cleistocalyx operculatus </span>(Roxb.) Merr &amp; Perry is a well-known medicinal plant in Asia. It is grown and widely spread in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, and other tropical countries. Leaves and buds are two parts of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> commonly used for treating gastrointestinal disorder and dermatophytic infection for many years [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">15</a>]. Furthermore, the other beneficial effects of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>such as anticancer, antihyperglycemic hypolipidemic, and cardiotonic effects are well documented [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">17</a>]. In addition, DÅ©ng et al. (1994) have analyzed the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> leaves [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">18</a>]. Recently, Dosoky et al. (2015) proved that essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> leaves possessed a strong antimicrobial effect and cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">19</a>]. However, application of essential oil isolated from
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> leaves on wound healing, especially in thermal injury, has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, we investigated the effect of essential oil isolated from
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> leaves on burn wound model in this study.
