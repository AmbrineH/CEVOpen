 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified a total of 13 bioactive compounds of essential oil, several of which exhibited the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, the essential oil showed the antibacterial effect against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, the common pathogen bacterium in skin. The supportive effect of essential oil on burn wound healing process also has been proven. Of note, wounds of essential oil treated group were fully recovered. Furthermore, we found that wound contract rate of tamanu oil treated mice was higher than control mice (0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.31 ± 0.02 cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively) after 20 days. Histological studies revealed that burn wounds treated with essential oil formed a complete epidermal structure. On the contrary, tamanu oil and saline treated burn wounds were partially recovered. Therefore, these data prove that essential oil exerts the supportive effect for wound healing process not only in acceleration of wound contraction rate but also in recovery of normal epidermis and dermis structure. This finding demonstrates the utilization of
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> leaf essential oil as promising topical agent. Furthermore, it also sheds light on the application of aromatherapy from by-product of tropical plants for treating the dermatological trauma.
