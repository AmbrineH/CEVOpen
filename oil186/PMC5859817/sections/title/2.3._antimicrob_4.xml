 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial activity of essential oil was determined by the agar diffusion method. The following bacterial strains
  <span class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 6538 and
  <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> ATCC 9027, which are considered as two common opportunistic bacteria in skin and mucous membrane [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">21</a>], were employed for screening the antimicrobial activity of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil. Briefly, the tested microorganisms (0.1 ml of 1 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/ml) were inoculated on LB agar. Then the sterilized filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of
  <span class="italic"> Cleistocalyx operculatus</span> essential oil or tamanu oil. The discs were placed in LB agar plates, after which the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The commercial antibiotic discs (Gentamycin, Nam Khoa Biotek Co.) and tamanu oil (Inopilo, Binh Minh Pharmaceutical Joint Co. Ltd.) were used as positive controls. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters.
