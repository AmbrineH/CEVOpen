 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alkaline hydrolysis of pumpkin seed oil was carried out according to the method reported by Cossignani et al. [
  <a rid="B27-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-foods-07-00030">27</a>]. Prior to alkaline hydrolysis, 0.2% 5-α-cholestane in CHCl
  <sub>3</sub> and 1% 1-octacosanol (used as internal standards) were added to the oil samples, then the American Oil Chemists’ Society (AOCS) method (Ch 6–91) was used [
  <a rid="B28-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-foods-07-00030">28</a>]. The products obtained after alkaline reaction were applied to TLC silica gel plates previously treated with 0.2 N KOH in MeOH, then activated for 1 h at 100 °C. The developing system was hexane/diethyl ether (65:35, 
  <span class="italic">v/v</span>). The band containing the sterols, visualized with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein spray, was scraped off and extracted with CHCl
  <sub>3</sub>. Then the solvent was evaporated and removed under nitrogen stream.
