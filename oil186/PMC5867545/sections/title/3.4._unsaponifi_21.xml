 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another part of the research was analyzing the main components of unsaponifiable fractions, i.e., sterols and alcohols. Alkaline hydrolysis was carried out on pumpkin seed oils to obtain data relative to the qualitative composition of sterol and alcohol fractions. Phytosterols have been studied for their role in lowering cholesterol levels. In addition to this property, plant sterols have antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidation activities [
  <a rid="B44-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-foods-07-00030">44</a>]. Together with the high content of linoleic acid, sterols can help in the treatment of lipid-associated disorders such as atherosclerosis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the other vegetable oils with Δ
  <span class="sup">5</span>-sterols (β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol) as the major components, Wenzl et al. [
  <a rid="B45-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-foods-07-00030">45</a>] showed that pumpkin seed oil contains specific Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-phytosterols, typical of only a few plant families (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Cucurbitaceae</span>), that provide a fingerprint for detection of adulteration. These Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols are supposed to give the pumpkin seed oil a beneficial effect in the treatment and prophylaxis of disorders of the prostate gland and the urinary bladder [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, sterol identification was carried out by HRGC-MS. Each peak was analyzed via detection of the parent molecular ion and the fragmentation pattern of the TMSE derivative. In addition to the presence of specific ion fragments, the relative intensity of the ion fragments was considered. Some TMSE sterols were identified by comparison with the NIST mass spectra library; typical fragmentation is reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t003" href="#foods-07-00030-t003">Table 3</a>, together with sterol composition (% and mg/100 g). TMSE sterols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was usually equivalent to [M-15]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, due to the loss of the methyl terminal group. Other main fragment ions useful for identifying the single sterol compounds are [M-90]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, [M-105]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, and [M-129]
  <span class="sup">+</span>. They correspond to the loss of the trimethylsilanol, methyl group with trimethylsilanol, and fragmentation of the 1,2-cyclopenthanophenanthrene structure, respectively. The predominant sterols of Berrettina pumpkin seed oil are Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols, in particular Δ
  <span class="sup">7,22,25</span>-stigmastatrienol, Δ
  <span class="sup">7,25</span>-stigmastadienol, and spinasterol, which accounted for about 76.8% of the total sterols, followed by Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-avenasterol and Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-stigmastenol. The Δ
  <span class="sup">5</span>-sterols were represented by campesterol, stigmasterol, and only a little cholesterol, as in other foodstuff [
  <a rid="B47-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-foods-07-00030">47</a>]. Differences between the contents of Δ
  <span class="sup">5</span>- and Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols could be attributed to the maturity stage of seeds or to the solvent used in the extraction procedure [
  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00030">15</a>]. A total sterol content of 295 mg/100 g oil was measured in 
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span> seed oil; 15.7 mg/100 g was represented by Δ
  <span class="sup">5</span>-sterols and 279.3 mg/100 g by Δ
  <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols. The total content was in agreement with other studies [
  <a rid="B9-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-foods-07-00030">9</a>,
  <a rid="B48-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-foods-07-00030">48</a>], even if a wide range of variability is reported [
  <a rid="B9-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-foods-07-00030">9</a>]. Hence, more detailed examinations of the composition of the sterol fraction of this oil could be of special interest. For example, analysis of a more extensive sampling is required for better characterization of pumpkin seed oils and for their authentication.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The alcoholic fraction (aliphatic and triterpenic classes) was also studied, after derivatization as TMSE and analysis by HRGC-MS; the typical fragmentation is reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t004" href="#foods-07-00030-t004">Table 4</a>, together with the alcohol composition (% and mg/100 g). Some aliphatic alcohols (from C16 to C25 members of the 1-alkanol homologous series) with odd and even numbers of carbon atoms of the aliphatic chain were identified. The TMSE alcohols were identified by comparison with the NIST mass spectra library. TMSE alcohols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was equivalent to [M-15]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, due to the loss of the methyl terminal group, and [M-117]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, equivalent to the loss of [(CH3)
  <sub>3</sub>-Si-O]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, i.e., the OTMSi group. Moreover, HRGC-MS analysis of alcohols after BSTFA derivatization resulted in various peaks with MS fragments 
  <span class="italic">m/z</span> 73, 75, 103, and 117 characteristics for OTMSi groups. The peak at 
  <span class="italic">m</span>/
  <span class="italic">z</span> 129, corresponding to [(CH3)
  <sub>3</sub>-Si-O
  <span class="sup">+</span>=CH-CH=CH
  <sub>2</sub>]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, has been identified as the fragment originating from the breakdown of ring A along with the TMS moiety. Four main triterpenic alcohols were identified: butyrospermol, obtusifoliol, β-amyrine, and cycloartenol. The key fragmentation ions were molecular ion [M]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, [M-15]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, [M-90]
  <span class="sup">+</span>, and [M-105]
  <span class="sup">+</span>. Aliphatic alcohol content was 36.8%, of which hexadecanol and octadecanol were the most abundant (each about 4.4 mg/100 g oil), while triterpenic alcohol content was around 63.2%, of which obtusifoliol was the most abundant (11.9 mg/100 g oil).
