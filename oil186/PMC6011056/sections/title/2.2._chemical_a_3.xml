 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical compositions of the essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu QP2010 Plus chromatograph with helium (He) as the carrier gas and a FactorFour/VF-5 ms capillary column (30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 mm film thickness). The carrier gas was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The initial oven temperature was 60°C, followed by constant heating for 2 min, and was increased 2°C per minute to 110°C, 3°C per minute to 150°C, and 15°C per minute to 290°C, with a final isotherm of 290°C for 17 minutes. The temperatures of the injector and detector were, respectively, set at 250°C and 310°C. The injection mode was split and the injection volume used was 1

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative analyses of the chemical compositions of the essential oils were performed on a gas chromatograph coupled to an HP5890 Series II ionization detector (GC-FID), using the same operating conditions and the same column type as was used in the GC/MS analysis, except the temperatures of the injector and detector which were set at 220°C and 250°C, respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The percentage of each constituent was calculated by the integral of the area of the respective peaks in relation to the total area of all constituents of the sample. The various constituents of the essential oil were identified by visual comparison of their mass spectra with those previously published and with standards from the Nist08 library on the instrument, as well as by comparing retention indices with those previously published. A standard solution of n-alkanes (C8-C20) was injected under the same chromatographic conditions of the sample and used to obtain the retention indices [
