  <span class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> C. cassia</span> Bark Essential Oils and (E)-Cinnamaldehyde on Bacteria
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde inhibited the growth of all bacteria assayed in this study in planktonic form, the antimicrobial activity data for which are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOCz, EOCc, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde exhibited bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> S. epidermidis</span>. The MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the EOCz showing a bacteriostatic effect at 0.50 mg/ml, while EOCc and (E)-cinnamaldehyde had the same effect at 0.25 mg/ml. At the concentrations assayed in this study, no MIC or MBC for oxacillin could be determined, since growth was not detected at any concentration tested. The similarity between the data can be explained by the amount of (E)-cinnamaldehyde present in the EOCc (90.22%) (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The MIC value for the oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde against
  <span class="italic"> S. pyogenes</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> was 0.50 mg/ml, and no bactericidal effect of these natural products was observed for these bacteria. In contrast, for
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>, only EOCc did not exhibit a bactericidal effect, and the MIC varied from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the MBC was 2.00 mg/ml for both for EOCZ and (E)-cinnamaldehyde.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">39</a>], it was shown that the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> C. cassia</span> was 85.06% (E)-cinnamaldehyde. In addition, antimicrobial activity was found against strains of
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli,</span> and
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect in which the MICs of (E)-cinnamaldehyde and
  <span class="italic"> C. cassia </span>oil were 0.3 mg/ml for Gram-negative strains and that of (E)-cinnamaldehyde was 0.25 mg/ml for
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, with the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> C. cassia</span> having an MIC of 0.6 mg/ml against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">40</a>], (E)-cinnamaldehyde was tested against ten Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and three fungal species. The results demonstrated an inhibitory effect, according to the classification established by [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">41</a>], with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 12.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l/ml for
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus, E. coli,</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>, bacteria which were used in the present study; the specific values for these concentrations were 1.56 and 12.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l/ml, respectively. In the present study, the MIC values for (E)-cinnamaldehyde against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus, E. coli</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> were 0.25 and 0.50 mg/ml, respectively, corresponding to approximately, 0.24 and 0.48 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l/ml. Thus, the observed inhibitory effect obtained in this study was up to approximately twice as high as those observed by [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study by [
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">42</a>] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of cinnamaldehyde against
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> and
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>. In this study, cinnamaldehyde presented MIC values of 0.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l/m and MBC value of 0.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l/ml for both bacteria, similar to the data obtained in this study. In addition, scanning electron microscopy showed morphological changes, which were confirmed by the increase of nucleic acid and protein levels in the cell suspension, indicating that the cell membrane was damaged. Thus, according to the authors, cinnamaldehyde plays a role in disrupting the bacterial cell membrane.
