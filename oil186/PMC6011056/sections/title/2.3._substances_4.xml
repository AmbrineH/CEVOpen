 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The substances used in the tests were included the essential oils from the trunk bark of
  <span class="italic"> C. cassia</span> and
  <span class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</span>, cinnamaldehyde, and oxacillin as a positive control. Calculations for the preparation of the solutions containing the oils and cinnamaldehyde were performed on the basis of the density of the substances and, to facilitate solubilization, 2% Tween 20 was used. All solutions were prepared at an initial concentration of 4 mg/ml and, after being diluted in broth, the resulting concentrations ranged from 2 to 0.01 mg/ml for all substances.
