  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biofilm biomass quantification data are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the results presented (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>), the comparison between the concentrations of the substances that reduce
   <span class="italic"> S. pyogenes</span> biofilms shows that the (E)-cinnamaldehyde concentration was approximately eight times higher than that of EOCc and four times higher than that of EOCz. In this case, it may be suggested that other components of the essential oils also participate synergistically in the antibiofilm action. A similar behavior is observed on biofilms of
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>. However, against
   <span class="italic"> Staphylococcus</span>, the concentration of the essential oils remains constant when compared to (E)-cinnamaldehyde or is twice as high as that of
   <span class="italic"> S. epidermidis</span> biofilm.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercially obtained
   <span class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil was able to inhibit the biomass and number of viable
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> biofilm cells at concentrations from 0.12 to 1.92 mg/ml. At 1.92 mg/ml, no biomass was observed and the viable cell reduction was significantly different from that of the negative control [
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">43</a>]. One study showed that 41.7% of biofilms of
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> and 33.3% of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another
   <span class="italic"> Cinnamomum </span>species also exhibited antibiofilm activity; the essential oil of the trunk bark of

   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> biofilms. These results showed that, at a concentration of 0.12% (v/v), the oil was able to inhibit planktonic cell growth of both bacteria by 50%. Fifty percent inhibition of biofilm formation was observed at a concentration of 0.03%, while at a concentration of 0.12% (v/v), biofilms formed by both bacteria were destabilized [
