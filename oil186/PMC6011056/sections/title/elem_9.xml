  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plates were assembled in a process similar to the MIC test, and after 24 h the antibiofilm activity was assessed through the methods mentioned and described below. After 24 h incubation, the plates were washed with sterile water (200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l/well) to remove the loosely adhered and air-dried cells. The adhered cells of the biofilm were fixed in the plate wells by addition of 200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of methanol for 15 min. Afterwards, the methanol was removed and 200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of a 1% violet crystal solution was added for 15 min. Subsequently, the plates were washed and air dried again, after which 200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of ethanol (96%) was added to each well which were left shaking for 5 min and then read on a microplate reader at 595 nm [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the incubation period, the culture medium was removed and the plates were subjected to three washes with distilled water. Next, 200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of a 0.9% saline solution was aliquoted into the wells, and the plate was incubated in a sonic bath (LK-D32 Ultrasonic Bath) operating at 50 kHz for 10 min. The liquid from the wells for each concentration teste was pooled to bring the volume to 1 ml, after which a 20 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l aliquot was withdrawn and subjected to serial dilution in 180 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l volumes of 0.85% saline solution (10
   <span class="sup">−1</span> to 10
   <span class="sup">−7</span>). In a Petri dish containing TSA, three 10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l aliquots were cultured for each concentration. These plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, after which the resulting colonies were counted [
