  <span class="italic">Assay of the EO Content</span> The content of essential oil in herbal raw materials was assayed by indirect distillation with xylene for 3 h. The distillation was conducted in conformance with the Polish Pharmacopoeia VI [

  <span class="italic">GC Analysis: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis</span> A GC/MS. ITMS Varian 4000 GC–MS/MS (Varian, USA) equipped with a CP-8410 auto-injector and a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA), film thickness 0.25 µm, was used; carrier gas He at a rate of 0.5 ml/min; injector and detector temperature 250 and 200 °C, respectively; split ratio 1:50; injection volume 5 µl. A temperature gradient was applied (50 °C for 1 min, then incremented by 4 °C/min to 250 °C, then held at 250 °C for 10 min); ionization energy 70 eV; mass range 40–870 Da; scan time 0.80 s. The oil obtained was collected in dark glass vessels, dried using dehydrated sodium sulfate and stored at below − 10 °C until chromatographic determination.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A qualitative analysis was performed on the MS spectra of the samples; the results were compared with those of the NIST library [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] and with data available in the literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. The identity of the compounds was confirmed by their retention indices, taken from the literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] and our own data. The quantity composition of the volatile oil was determined by GC(FID), assuming that a total area percents of all the particular oil constituted 100%. All determinations were performed in triplicate and averaged.
