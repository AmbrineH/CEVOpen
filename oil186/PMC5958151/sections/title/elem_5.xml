Voucher specimens (number N-1SKK-01, N-1SKK-02, N-1SKK-03, N-1SKK-04, N-1SKK-05) are deposited at the Department of Medicinal and Industrial Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin. Plant material was collected in August 2016, then dried at 40 °C in a drying chamber and powdered.

VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA), film thickness 0.25 µm, was used; carrier gas He at a rate of 0.5 ml/min; injector and detector temperature 250 and 200 °C, respectively; split ratio 1:50; injection volume 5 µl. A temperature gradient was applied (50 °C for 1 min, then incremented by 4 °C/min to 250 °C, then held at 250 °C for 10 min); ionization energy 70 eV; mass range 40–870 Da; scan time 0.80 s. The oil obtained was collected in dark glass vessels, dried using dehydrated sodium sulfate and stored at below − 10 °C until chromatographic determination.
