 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show that marjoram, thyme and oregano essential oils effectively inhibit the growth of 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> strains. The essential oils contain many compounds that act synergistically and induce strong anti-algal effects. The active substances, including carvacrol and various polyphenols, are capable of dissolving the algal cell wall and penetrating into the cell, where they affect the cell metabolism [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]: They cause damage to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, release proton propulsion and coagulate the cytoplasmic contents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key to this process is the lipophilic nature of the hydrocarbon skeleton and the hydrophilic nature of the functional groups. Of these compounds, the greatest activity is demonstrated by phenols, with activity falling in the following sequence: aldehydes &gt; ketones &gt; alcohols &gt; esters/ethers &gt; hydrocarbons. The most active phenols are thymol, carvacrol and eugenol, and these are present in various oils including thyme and oregano oil. Slightly less activity is demonstrated by mint and marjoram oil, as well as other essential oils which contain alcohols, e.g., terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol and menthol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in vitro effectiveness of essential oils against 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca</span> algae strains has also been confirmed by other researchers. Bouari (Cuc) et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] tested the effects of oils from 
  <span class="italic">Satureja hortensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Abies alba</span> on 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span>. The strains of 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> were derived from milk samples from mastitis cows and cow excrement. The MIC values for the essential oils (0.25–1 μl/ml) are the same as those for the marjoram, thyme and oregano oils. Fir oil is characterized by lower anti-algae activity (MIC: 1–4 μl/ml) than those tested in the present study.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grzesiak et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] tested eight essential oils: cinnamon (
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylandicum</span>), geranium (
  <span class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</span>), clove (
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span>), thyme (
  <span class="italic">T. vulgaris</span>), lavender (
  <span class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</span>), basil (
  <span class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</span>), rosemary (
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span>) and clary sage (
  <span class="italic">Salvia sclarea</span>). The activity of these oils was tested against eight strains of 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> isolated from milk samples taken from cows suffering from mastitis using the broth microdilution method. All studied oils were effective against algal strains, of which cinnamon, clove and thyme had the greatest effectiveness (MIC: 0.6–1 μl/ml). While the MIC values of thyme oil were found to range from 0.25 to 1 μl/ml in the present study, they were found to range from 0.6 to 1 μl/ml by Grzesiak et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Although these are similar values, slight discrepancies may result from differences in the composition of the oil.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> strains showed low sensitivity to routine chemotherapeutics. All were 100% resistant to fluconazole and flucytosine and 90% resistant to clotrimazole, econazole and amphotericin B. The most sensitive were nystatin (90% of strains showed sensitivity) and ketoconazole (50% of strains were sensitive). Similar results were obtained by Wawron et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] who conducted a study on 27 strains of 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span>. The strains of algae showed 100% resistance against clotrimazole, fluconazole, econazole and flucytosine and nearly 93% for miconazole. The most effective agents were nystatin (88.9% of strains), ketoconazole (51.9% of strains) and amphotericin B (48.1%). It is interesting that while only one strain was found to be susceptible to amphotericin B (801/IV) in the present study, Wawron et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] report that almost half of the tested strains were susceptible. Grzesiak et al. found that while eight tested strains of 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> were susceptible to nystatin, they were 100% resistant to amphotericin B, clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, econazole, fluorocytosine, amoxicillin, piperacillin and ceftazidime. Some strains were also resistant to gentamicin and tetracycline.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increasing number of cases of human and animal protothecosis caused by 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca</span> algae, including mastitis, and increasing resistance to routine antifungal chemotherapeutics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>], has prompted intense research into new anti-algae agents by researchers and commercial companies. Numerous in vitro studies have shown that the oils of various plants demonstrate effective antimicrobial activity against pathogenic strains of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca</span>, due to their high levels of polyphenols, catechins and isoflavones, together with various other biologically active compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Studies carried out by Bouari (Cuc) et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> on a mouse model show that mint oil (
  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span>) and savory oil (
  <span class="italic">S. hortensis</span>) are highly effective against skin symptoms caused by 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span>.
