A voucher specimen of the plant material was deposited at the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Avicenna Tajik State Medical University under accession number TD2016-24. The material was completely dried and hydrodistilled using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h to give an essential oil yield of 0.5%.
