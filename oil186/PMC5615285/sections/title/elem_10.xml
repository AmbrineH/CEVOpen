The anethole-rich cluster can be subdivided into three chemotypes: an anethole chemotype (CT1a, including the sample from Tajikistan), an anethole/limonene chemotype (CT1b), and an anethole/camphor chemotype (CT1c) represented by a single sample from Romania (see

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Antioxidant Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The investigation of antioxidant activity of essential oils as lipophilic secondary metabolites became an interesting aspect of food and pharmaceutical research. Synthetic food additives are increasingly replaced with plant-based natural ingredients, due to their safety, effectiveness and consumer acceptance [
   <a rid="B50-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-foods-06-00073">50</a>]. In general, fennel as an edible and medicinal plant represents an interest through the neutralization of reactive oxygen species in order to prevent the damage of protein, lipid, and DNA which are supposed to be the main reason for cell aging, oxidative stress-originated diseases (cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases), and cancer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of fennel exhibits low antioxidant activity as compared to the positive control, caffeic acid. The results of the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP analyses are represented 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t002" href="#foods-06-00073-t002">Table 2</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentration of 50% inhibition (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) was the parameter used to compare the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity. A lower IC
   <sub>50</sub> (for DPPH and ABTS) and higher FRAP values indicate higher antioxidant activity. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values for the antioxidant activity were 15.6 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (DPPH) and 10.9 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (ABTS). The IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of the known antioxidant substance—caffeic acid—were 0.0017 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for DPPH and 0.0011 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for ABTS, respectively. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were equivalent to 193.5 µM Fe(II)/mg for oil and 2380 µM Fe(II)/mg for caffeic acid. In agreement with our results, it was reported that the an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
   <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> essential oil was 15.3 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> [
   <a rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-06-00073">7</a>]. According to the authors [
   <a rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-06-00073">7</a>], fennel essential oil reacts with free radicals as a primary antioxidant and, therefore, it may limit free-radical damage occurring in the human body. In our previous paper, we reported the antioxidant activity of pure essential oil components, including the main component of the essential oil of fennel (
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole). It shows weak antioxidant activity. We assume that the phenolic substances (carvacrol (2.1%) and thymol (1.0%)) are responsible for the observed antioxidant activity. These data are in agreement with previously reported data [
   <a rid="B25-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-06-00073">25</a>]. However, it is known that the bioactivity of plant extracts is due to the entire composition of the extract [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. Cytotoxicity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity of the oil was tested against HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7, CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cancer cell lines (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t003" href="#foods-06-00073-t003">Table 3</a>). IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were 207 mg L
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for HeLa, 75 mg L
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for Caco-2, 59 mg L
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for MCF-7, 32 mg L
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for CCRF-CEM, and 165 mg L
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for CEM/ADR5000 cell lines. As compared to the positive control doxorubicin, the essential oil exhibits low cytotoxicity. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antitumor antibiotic is a hydrophilic drug, and shows broad spectrum anticancer activity [
   <a rid="B53-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-foods-06-00073">53</a>]. The cytotoxicity of 
   <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> oil is most likely due to the lipophilic properties of essential oil and alkylating properties of the major components 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-anisaldehyde. Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 overexpress the ABC transporter p-gp which can actively pump out any lipophilic compound that has entered the cell by free diffusion [
   <a rid="B54-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-foods-06-00073">54</a>]). Thus, both cell lines are rather insensitive towards lipophilic cytotoxic agents. In contrast, the parent cell line CCRF-CEM should be sensitive. We also suspect that some components of the essential oil are may be substrates for p-gp, as IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were higher in CEM/ADR5000 cells.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the mechanism of action of 
   <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> essential oil, we have investigated its hemolytic effect. The result of hemolytic activity indicates that the oil is able to lyse the cell membrane albeit with a rather high IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 1100 mg L

   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t003" href="#foods-06-00073-t003">Table 3</a>). Moreover, in order to investigate the effect of essential oil on the cell morphology, the images of untreated and treated CCRF cells with essential oil were captured by fluorescence microscope. The images are illustrated in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00073-f002" href="#foods-06-00073-f002">Figure 2</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtained images indicate that the essential oil can change the morphology of cells. Results of both hemolysis and microscopic investigation indicate that essential oil also affects the integrity of cell membranes. This is in agreement with many of the reported data [
   <a rid="B55-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-foods-06-00073">55</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, the main component of the essential oil, was examined for its cytotoxicity in RC-37 cells. Its IC

   <span class="sup">−1</span> [
   <a rid="B56-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-foods-06-00073">56</a>]. The incubation of hepatocytes with anethole caused a cell death accompanied by losses of cellular ATP and adenine nucleotide pools [
   <a rid="B57-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-foods-06-00073">57</a>]. Anethole shows apoptotic activity, as it can damage DNA [
   <a rid="B58-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-foods-06-00073">58</a>]. Thus anethole could be responsible for the overall cytotoxicity of the essential oil in our study.
