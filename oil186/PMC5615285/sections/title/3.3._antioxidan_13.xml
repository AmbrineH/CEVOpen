 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The investigation of antioxidant activity of essential oils as lipophilic secondary metabolites became an interesting aspect of food and pharmaceutical research. Synthetic food additives are increasingly replaced with plant-based natural ingredients, due to their safety, effectiveness and consumer acceptance [
  <a rid="B50-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-foods-06-00073">50</a>]. In general, fennel as an edible and medicinal plant represents an interest through the neutralization of reactive oxygen species in order to prevent the damage of protein, lipid, and DNA which are supposed to be the main reason for cell aging, oxidative stress-originated diseases (cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases), and cancer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of fennel exhibits low antioxidant activity as compared to the positive control, caffeic acid. The results of the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP analyses are represented

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentration of 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was the parameter used to compare the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity. A lower IC
  <sub>50</sub> (for DPPH and ABTS) and higher FRAP values indicate higher antioxidant activity. IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for the antioxidant activity were 15.6 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (DPPH) and 10.9 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (ABTS). The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of the known antioxidant substance—caffeic acid—were 0.0017 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for DPPH and 0.0011 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for ABTS, respectively. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were equivalent to 193.5 µM Fe(II)/mg for oil and 2380 µM Fe(II)/mg for caffeic acid. In agreement with our results, it was reported that the an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
  <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> essential oil was 15.3 mg mL

  <a rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-06-00073">7</a>]. According to the authors [
  <a rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-06-00073">7</a>], fennel essential oil reacts with free radicals as a primary antioxidant and, therefore, it may limit free-radical damage occurring in the human body. In our previous paper, we reported the antioxidant activity of pure essential oil components, including the main component of the essential oil of fennel (
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole). It shows weak antioxidant activity. We assume that the phenolic substances (carvacrol (2.1%) and thymol (1.0%)) are responsible for the observed antioxidant activity. These data are in agreement with previously reported data [
  <a rid="B25-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-06-00073">25</a>]. However, it is known that the bioactivity of plant extracts is due to the entire composition of the extract [
