 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of a comprehensive DS knowledge representation has restricted research on their safety and efficacy. In our previous DS study, we identified mutual ingredients coverage for over the counter medicines and DS across several databases, despite them falling under different regulations and having different representations. In this study, we evaluated and compared five databases limited to DS only (both ingredient and product levels), by cross checking them against a preliminary, standardized set of data elements. This set of data elements entails information deemed essential to comprehensively represent DS. While, we found fragmented and inconsistent DS representations across these five databases (
  <a rid="t3-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t3-2840637">Table 3</a>), high DS coverage (89%-100%) was discovered for each data element within a database (
  <a rid="t4-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t4-2840637">Table 4</a>). The knowledge gained from this effort could be used as a platform to develop a more structured and comprehensives DS terminology/ontology system that could represent DS related information in a more accurate and consistent format, similar to their drug counter parts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed varied levels of completeness in representation of DS across databases based on presence or absence of various data elements represented in the model. Several sections, such as title &amp; introductory information, dosage, purpose of use, cautions, have wider coverage across databases as compared to other sections, such as mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and packaging. These discrepancies have multiple possible causes. For one, ingredient and product level resources are meant for different purposes and users. For example, product level databases provide more packaging related information. Another possible cause is the fragmented and/or incomplete coverage across databases, e.g., NM is more comprehensive than DSID. Lexical variations were also observed in how data elements were referred to within a database, e.g., the terms “uses” and “purpose” employed interchangeably within NHPID. This variation was also observed across databases, e.g. use of term “adverse reactions” in NHPID/LNHPD vs. “adverse effects” in NM and use of word “purpose” in NHPID vs. “people use this for’ in NM. Some overlap was seen among content coverage especially under naming sections. For example, the Latin names Zingiber officinale and Panax ginseng are (Latin terms) labelled as scientific names under NM. Whereas, the term synonym or taxonomical synonym universally represents alternate names. Content pertaining to some of the above facets is often inferred from other data rather than mentioned implicitly and is therefore marked as available, e.g., under DSLD and DSID, route of administration (oral) could be inferred from dose form (tablet).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since DS usage is primarily self-initiated rather than based on clinicians’ recommendations, it renders unique challenges pertaining to efficacy, safety, and regulatory policies and practices to clinicians, consumers, and researchers

  </span>. In our set of data elements (
  <a rid="t1-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t1-2840637">Table 1</a>), the section “cautions” includes following facets: side effects, adverse reactions, contraindications, sensitivity reaction, interactions, toxicity/treatment, precautions and safety/interaction ratings. Our DS evaluation showed substantial coverage for various facet under “caution” section across all five databases. Comprehensive information on DS risks could be made available through our DS ontology after cross mapping each facet under “caution” section to the pertinent databases.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative analysis (
  <a rid="t4-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t4-2840637">Table 4</a>) showed fragmentary coverage of data elements across five databases, NM having most comprehensive coverage (7/8 sections), while DSID the least (2/8 sections). High percentage of data elements coverage (89%-100%) was observed within each database, thus making it possible to collect DS representation information from these databases. We found some unique data elements usually not seen in drug databases, such as source (animal or plant) and origin (Asia or North America), which can affect the functions of DS, e.g., American Ginseng vs. Korean Ginseng.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complete representation of DS as shown for Ginseng and Fish oil, employing consistent vocabulary (
  <a rid="t5-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t5-2840637">Table 5</a> showing only important data elements at ingredient level) across databases, could help in more effective and efficient use of DS databases, e.g., mapping, integrating and searching for information.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are few limitations associated with this study. Only five databases limited to USA and Canada were evaluated. Each section in the model was not weighted and that could potentially influence interpretation of results. It is also possible that we missed some data elements, not presented in these five databases. More granular analyses are needed for data sections as name categories, dose administration routes, dose forms etc. This research study is an initial step towards the development of more formal DS terminology/ontology model that could represent DS related information in more accurate and consistent format, similar to their drug counter parts. The knowledge gained here will promote informatics research in DS, such as information extraction and knowledge discovery of safety on DS. Other information, such as safety information, is largely stored in unstructured format in various data sources, which would prove difficulties to support clinical research in dietary supplement. Further efforts, such as extraction of structured information in standardized format from texts in resources, are required.</p>
