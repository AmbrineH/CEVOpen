 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last decade, research into essential (volatile) oils has received increasing attention from both industrial and academic sectors because of the growing interest in green consumerism and the need for alternative techniques to assure the quality and safety of perishable foods [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">1</a>]. The plant
  <span class="italic"> Melaleuca alternifolia (M. alternifolia)</span> belongs to the Myrtaceae family [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2</a>], which is described as a scrubland species and found throughout South America, western India, and Australia [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">3</a>]. The plant has been used in medicine, cosmetics, food, agriculture, and other industries [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">4</a>–
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">7</a>]. In recent years,
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span> has also been gradually introduced in southern China. The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span> is derived by steam or hydrodistillation from
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span> as secondary metabolites and is monoterpene-rich, volatile oil characterized by a strong odor [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">8</a>, 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">9</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies conducted on natural plant essential oils have indicated that these oils may be used as antimicrobial agents and have potential use in industrial applications [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">10</a>–
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">12</a>].
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span>, also known as tea tree, has been investigated as an alternative antimicrobial agent [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">13</a>]; however, there is no information that focuses exclusively on the antioxidant activities of the essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span>. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span>.
