 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC and MBC. The potato dextrose broth and Mueller Hinton broth were prepared at twice the final concentration.
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>essential oil was added to glass tubes to yield final sample media concentrations at 0.2 to 48 mg/mL for the potato dextrose and Mueller Hinton broths, respectively. The control sets were run simultaneously without the addition of an antimicrobial agent. An appropriate volume of inoculum (6.0 log⁡CFU/mL) was added to the media to give an approximate final cell concentration of 4.0 log⁡CFU/mL.
  <span class="italic"> P. italicum Wehmer</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. digitatum Sacc. </span>cultures in potato dextrose broth were incubated at 28°C and 120 rpm for 48 h, whereas
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> and
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus </span>cultures in Mueller Hinton broth were incubated at 37°C and 120 rpm for 24 h. The essential oil concentration that yielded no visible growth for a tested species was considered the MIC for that particular species. Then, 0.1 mL suspension obtained from the above transparent tubes was spread onto either potato dextrose agar (PDA) or Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). After 48 h culturing at 28°C (fungi) or 48 h culturing at 37°C (bacteria), the concentration of inoculated suspension containing the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that showed no colonies on the plate was determined as the MBC.
