 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenolic content of extracts of many plants contributes significantly to their total antioxidant activity. The antioxidant feature of the investigated essential oils was determined by the phenolic compouds presence in their composition by the Folin–Ciocâlteu method [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total concentration of phenolic compounds found in essential oil samples are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t001" href="#materials-10-00045-t001">Table 1</a>, and a decrease in phenolic content concentration in the following order was found: clove &gt; thyme &gt; tea tree &gt; rosemary. Excepting the rosemary oil, all oils were found to have different phenolic levels, ranging from 0.034 to 1.136 mg·GAE/g·DW, which can play a vital role in the increase of food shelf-life. The clove oil has the highest content of phenolic compounds.
