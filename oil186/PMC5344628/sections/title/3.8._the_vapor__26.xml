  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA, CM 0131, Oxoid Ltd., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) with

  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot7-materials-10-00045" href="#sec3dot7-materials-10-00045">Section 3.7</a>. A volume of 10 µL of each pure EO was added to sterile filter discs with a diameter of 6 mm, and sterile water was used as control. The discs were placed on the inside center of a Petri dish lid in a sterile working hood. A control was also prepared by adding 10 µL of sterile water to the filter discs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inoculated agar plate was then placed to fit the lid but with the agar upwards. This created a closed Petri dish with a distance of about 1 cm between the disc and the bacteria inoculated agar surface in accordance with Goni et al. [
