 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils were screened to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration against the food spoilage microorganisms selected. The same procedure as the one described for the antifungal assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The definition of the MIC differs between various publications [
  <a rid="B57-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-materials-10-00045">57</a>,
  <a rid="B58-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-materials-10-00045">58</a>,
  <a rid="B59-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-materials-10-00045">59</a>], so it was decided that the MIC would be defined as the lowest volume of essential oil that inhibited the growth of the tested fungi with an inhibition rate higher than 80%. The MIC is expressed in different units including mg/mL [
  <a rid="B60-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-materials-10-00045">60</a>], µg/mL [
  <a rid="B61-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-materials-10-00045">61</a>,
  <a rid="B62-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-materials-10-00045">62</a>], µL/L [
  <a rid="B63-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-materials-10-00045">63</a>,
  <a rid="B64-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-materials-10-00045">64</a>], µL/mL [
  <a rid="B65-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-materials-10-00045">65</a>], and ppm [
  <a rid="B62-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-materials-10-00045">62</a>,
  <a rid="B66-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-materials-10-00045">66</a>]. In this study, the MIC of fungi was expressed as ppm.
