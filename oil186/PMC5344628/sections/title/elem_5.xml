 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity of the essential oils against the three fungi strains examined was assessed by the percentage of the inhibition rate (
  <span class="italic">IR</span>%) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In order to evaluate the quantity of essential oils needed to be used, a preliminary investigation was carried out with a volume of 10 µL and 20 µL of each of them. After this screening, the maximum concentration used was 60 µL, while the minimum volume used was 2.5 µL. The results presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f005" href="#materials-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</a>,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f007" href="#materials-10-00045-f007">Figure 7</a> for the antifungal activity of the essential oils tested are the ones from the 7th day of analyses. From all tested oils, the most effective were the essential oils of clove, thyme, and tea tree. The efficacy of these essential oils can be attributed to the terpenes and phenylpropanoides present in their composition. The research studies demonstrated that phenolic compounds are responsible for the antifungal potential of these oils.

   <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span>, being a plant pathogen, is a fungus commonly found in cereal grains (mostly wheat and barley). This pathogen has the potential to produce mycotoxines (deoxynivalenol and zearalonene) that have a negative impact on human and animal health [
   <a rid="B45-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-materials-10-00045">45</a>]. The contamination of cereals by this toxigenic mold produces major economic impacts in agriculture.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils selected were tested against 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span>, and the results are presented in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f005" href="#materials-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fungal growth inhibition induced by essential oils, as determined by the disc diffusion assay, was dependent mostly on the volume (varying from 5 µL to 60 µL) and nature of the essential oils. According to the results presented in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f005" href="#materials-10-00045-f005">Figure 5</a>, it can be noticed that the essential oils tested had antifungal activity against 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span> G87, but their efficacy is different. Thyme essential oil was the most effective, with an inhibition rate of over 80% at the lowest volume of essential oil used for the growth inhibition of this fungus, namely, 87.04% for 7 µL. Clove oil was also effective against the tested fungus, with an inhibition rate of 81.64% when using 40 µL. It is assumed that the high antifungal potential of clove essential oil is due to its active principle, eugenol (85.7%). The results are in accordance with the study of Abbaszadeh et al. [
   <a rid="B46-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-materials-10-00045">46</a>] regarding the effectiveness of eugenol against pathogenic fungi, which demonstrated that this phenylpropanoide had antifungal activity against all tested fungi. The antifungal activity was in direct ratio with the concentration of eugenol added to the media. In a study made by Marin et al. [
   <a rid="B47-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-materials-10-00045">47</a>] who tested the efficacy of cinnamon, clove, oregano, palmarosa, and lemongrass oils against the mycotoxines produced by 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span>, it was shown that clove essential oils was the most efficient against zearalenone and deoxynivalenol release.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosemary essential oil exhibits antifungal activity, but this was very low. For a volume of 60 µL of this oil, the inhibition was below 10%. Tea tree essential oil had an inhibition rate higher than 80% against 
   <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> G87 only for the highest volume used in this study (60 µL).

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f006" href="#materials-10-00045-f006">Figure 6</a>. As can be seen, thyme essential oil is more active than clove essential oil, showing an inhibition rate of 100% at 10 µL, while clove oil was less effective (
   <span class="italic">IR</span> = 47.6%) at a volume of 10 µL. As well, tea tree essential oil has antifungal properties, but when a higher oil volume is used. It produced an inhibition of 89.04% for a quantity of 40 µL. It is considered that the antifungal activity of tea tree oil was significantly affected by the presence of high content of γ-terpinene (16.3%), 4-terpineol (38.7%), and α-terpineol (4.6%). Previous studies showed that tea tree oil has antifungal activity against 
   <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Rhizopus stolonifer</span> under in vitro conditions, inhibiting the spore germination and mycelial growth [

The strong antifungal activity of thyme oil is attributed to phenolic compounds carvacrol (2.75%) and thymol (43.1%), while the antimicrobial effectiveness of clove oil is associated with the activity of eugenol (85.7%), β-caryophyllene (4.5%), and eugenol acetate (7.9%). Similar studies were conducted by Abbaszadeh et al. [
