 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result showed that H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> significantly decreases the total protein and albumin (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-00610-f002" href="#ijms-19-00610-f002">Figure 2</a>). However, when H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> was used with Argan oil or with Argan oil and clove essential oil, there was no significant change in the total protein or albumin as compared to the water group except for total protein in group that received H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> with Argan oil.
