  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The virgin Argan oil used in this study was obtained by mechanical press extraction from Agadir city, south west of Morocco, and was preserved at 4 °C in the dark container. In order to investigate the antioxidant effect of this oil, an extraction of phenolics compounds was used. Briefly, 10 g of the Argan oil was dissolved in 5 mL of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane then extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with 10 mL of methanol/water (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 100 g clove was subjected to hydro-distillation for 3 h with 600 mL distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus modified: the hydrosol was collected in a separator funnel (1 L) so that the heavy essential oil was decanted to the bottom of the flask and collected. Another funnel of distilled water was used to add water to the flask containing the plant material during boiling. The essential oil obtained was collected and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a refrigerator at 4–5 °C prior to analysis. The yield based on dried weight of the sample was calculated.</p>

The operating condition of GC oven temperature was maintained as: initial temperature 40 °C for 2 min, programmed rate 2 °C/min up to final temperature 260 °C with isotherm for 10 min; and injector temperature 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium, flow rate 1 mL/min. The samples were run in hexane with a dilution ratio of 1:10. The volume of injected specimen was 1mL of diluted oil, splitless injection technique; ionization energy 70 eV, in the electronic ionization mode; ion source temperature 200 °C, scan mass range ofm/z 40–650 and interface line temperature 300 °C.
