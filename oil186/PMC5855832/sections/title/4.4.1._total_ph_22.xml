 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The determination of the content of phenolic compounds was made by Folin–Ciocalteau method. Gallic acid was used as a reference. 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil (50 µL) prepared in ethanol or Argan oil (100 µL) were mixed with 500 µL of Folin–Ciocalteau (0.2 N) reagent and 400 µL of sodium carbonate solution. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h in the dark, the absorbance was read at 760 nm, and the tests were made in triplicate [
