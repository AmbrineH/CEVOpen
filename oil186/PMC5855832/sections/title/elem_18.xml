  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The isolated oil was diluted with hexane (dilution ratio 1:10), and 1 mL was sampled for the gas chromatographic analysis. Trace gas chromatograph (GC) (ULTRA S/N 20062969, Thermo Fischer, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) that is equipped with HP-5MS non polar fused silica capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) was used. Operating conditions: oven temperature program from 50 °C (2 min) to 280 °C at 5 °C/min and the final temperature kept for 10 min; 2 “split mode” ratio 1:20; carrier gas Azoth (N), flow rate 1 mL/min; temperature of injector and detector (flame ionization detector) were fixed at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the volatile constituents was run on a Thermo Fischer capillary gas chromatograph directly coupled to the mass spectrometer system (model GC ULTRA S/N 20062969; Polaris QS/N 210729), using an HP-5MS non polar fused silica capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness). The operating condition of GC oven temperature was maintained as: initial temperature 40 °C for 2 min, programmed rate 2 °C/min up to final temperature 260 °C with isotherm for 10 min; and injector temperature 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium, flow rate 1 mL/min. The samples were run in hexane with a dilution ratio of 1:10. The volume of injected specimen was 1mL of diluted oil, splitless injection technique; ionization energy 70 eV, in the electronic ionization mode; ion source temperature 200 °C, scan mass range ofm/z 40–650 and interface line temperature 300 °C. The component identification was made by determination of their retention indices (KI) relative to those of a homologous series of n-alkanes (C
   <sub>8</sub>–C
   <sub>20</sub>) (Fluka, Buchs/sg, Buchs, Switzerland) and by matching their recorded mass spectra with those stored in the spectrometer database (NIST MS Library v. 2.0, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and the bibliography [
