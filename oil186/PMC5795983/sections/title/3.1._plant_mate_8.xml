 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of 
  <span class="italic">B. salicifolius</span> were collected in Botucatu City, Brazil (22°57′55,90″ N 48°24′16,99″ W), on a morning during December 2014. For the purpose of scientific research of the species under study, an authorization to access samples of components of the genetic patrimony (Nº 010621/2015-6) was obtained from the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). The plant was identified by a specialist, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Federal University of Uberlândia, under number HUFU 71037. The essential oil was obtained by steam distillation of fresh leaves for 2 h using a distiller designed for essential oil production (model MA480—Marconi). The essential oil was separated from water by decantation, filtered (membrane filter—0.2 μm), stored at low temperature (−10 °C) and protected from light until analysis. The percentage yield was calculated relative to the dried mass of the initial sample and this analysis was performed in triplicate.
