 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxic effect of the essential oil was tested in estrogen-receptor positive MCF-7 and estrogen-receptor negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, the human normal breast cell line, MCF-10A, was evaluated. The results of the cytotoxicity assays are shown in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil was toxic against MDA-MB-231 (46.60 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) cancer cell lines. MDA-MB-231 cells, which represent an aggressive phenotype, responded more favorably to the cytotoxic effect of the essential oil than the less-aggressive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Several difficulties are associated with the treatment of estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cells because these usually have poor prognosis and hormone therapies are not effective [

Moreover, this essential oil presented similar results compared to other plant essential oils considered active and with relevant action against this cell type, such as 
  <span class="italic">Decatropis bicolor</span>, which had a CC
  <sub>50</sub> of 53.81 μg·mL

  <a rid="B40-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijms-19-00033">40</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Hedychium spicatum</span> with values around 65 μg·mL

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The normal breast cell line, MCF-10A (314.44 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), was around sevenfold more resistant to essential oil action than MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. A relationship between normal breast cell lines and breast cancer cell lines was established through the selectivity index (SI) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-00033-t002" href="#ijms-19-00033-t002">Table 2</a>) in order to check specificity. A positive SI value is desirable, and represents more selectivity against cancer cells than toxicity to normal cells. The negative value of SI for MCF-7 (−0.21) showed selectivity by normal cells, but the SI for the MDA-MB-231 cells was 0.83, which means selectivity by cancer cells and confirms the potential of this essential oil as a good candidate as a cytotoxic agent.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Against MCF-7, the essential oil did not present cytotoxic action at the tested concentrations. Methanolic extract, chalcones and ursolic acid isolated from the leaves of this species presented cytotoxic activity against such cellular types [
  <a rid="B9-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijms-19-00033">9</a>,
  <a rid="B42-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijms-19-00033">42</a>]. This suggests that differential content or concentration, especially of polar compounds in 
  <span class="italic">B. salicifolius</span>, may be related to cytotoxic action against MCF-7 cells.
