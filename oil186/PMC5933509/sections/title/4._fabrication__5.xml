      <p>Center the wafer on a spin coater and coat a ~100 µm thick layer of SU-8 100 photoresist by applying ~7 mL of SU-8 resist, ramping the spin speed up to 3000 rpm at a rate of 500 rpm/s, and then holding the speed at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds.</p>

      <p>Remove the wafer from the hotplate and place in a 500 mL beaker containing 100 mL SU-8 developer for at least 10 min, swirling the wafer slowly in the solution throughout to remove non-exposed photoresist. After 10 min, rinse the patterned wafer with isopropanol and dry with air.

      <p>Pour ~10 mL of poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS; prepared by mixing Silicone Elastomer Base and Silicone Elastomer Curing Agent in a 10:1 ratio) on top of the chip, carefully avoiding incorporating any PDMS within the placed silicone tubing.</p>

      <p>Place the patterned PDMS and a glass slide upside-down in a high-power plasma cleaner with an air feed. Apply the plasma at 200 mTorr and 45 W for 90 s to bond the PDMS to the glass slide and create the final microfluidic chip.</p>

      <p>Using two seperate infusion syringe pumps (one for the oil upstream, one for the oil added after the nozzle), deliver the oil into the chip at a flow rate between 1.1 mL/h and 5.5 mL/h without starting the polymer flow to prime the chip and ensure the chip is defect-free and operational (typically maintained over a 30 min period).</p>

      <p>Collect the particles until all oil is consumed (12-55 h, depending on flow). Stop the syringe pumps and, if desired, immediately pump water in place of the precursor polymer solutions through the chip to clean.  However, given the rapid in situ gelation of these materials when the flow is stopped, it is recommended to use a new chip for each separate experiment.</p>
