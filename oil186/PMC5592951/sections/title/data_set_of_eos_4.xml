 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, analyzing the EOs is the first stage in the “EOROT” algorithm. The target of this stage is to determine all the compounds and their concentration percentages in the composition of EOs. This stage is the base of the reduction process, which will specify the significant compounds and remove the noninfluential ones.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimental study in this research is based on 24 types of plant EOs as a sample for antibacterial EOs, which are common in inhibiting the same types of bacteria. These EOs have &gt;850 compounds;
