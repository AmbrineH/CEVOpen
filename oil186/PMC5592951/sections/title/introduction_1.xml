 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nature is rich in antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant products. Plants are considered as one of the important anti-organism producers. Plants produce various types of secondary metabolites that are characterized by their biological properties, for use against predators and microbial pathogens. One of these secondary metabolites, which have an effective antimicrobial activity, is the “essential oil” (EO).
  <a rid="b1-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1-aabc-10-065">1</a> EOs, also known as essences, volatile oils, etheric oils, or aetheroleum, are natural products that can be produced from different parts of the plants (e.g., flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, fruit, or barks of aromatic plants). The EOs consist of several types of compounds, which are usually liquid, volatile, limpid, with lower density than water, and soluble in organic solvents. Extracting the EOs from different parts of the plants can be done by various chemical techniques such as “steam distillation”, “solvent extraction”, “expression under pressure”, “supercritical fluid”, and “subcritical water extraction”.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, due to the efficiency of EOs as antimicrobials, antioxidants, antitumoral, antifungal and anti-inflammatories, they are widely used in different fields such as the cosmetic industry (e.g., ingredients of fragrances, decorative cosmetic, fine fragrances, and flavoring), the food industry (e.g., aromas and flavors), the pharmaceutical industry (e.g., active components of medicines and as antibacterials/antimicrobials), and aromatherapy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the EOs are characterized by their efficiency as antibacterial organisms, their effective degree is varied according to their chemical composition, which may vary due to their agriculture, geographic location, seasonal variability, and climatic factors and according to the part of the plant (fruit, leaves, etc.).
  <a rid="b4-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-aabc-10-065">4</a> Nowadays, the determination of the bioactivity of the EOs from their chemical composition is a well-established idea among the scientific community. However, practically, the traditional experimental methods usually have many limitations. Characterizing the complexity of the chemical interactions among the components of EOs is a significant limitation. In addition, defining the relations between these components and the attacked microbes is another limitation.
  <a rid="b3-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3-aabc-10-065">3</a> Thus, the importance of using the computational models instead has increased. Developing a computational tool to select the EOs that have antimicrobial activities depending on knowing their effective compounds only and without complex laboratory analysis can save money and time and enhance consistency of final products. Generally, the computational tools (e.g., artificial neural networks [ANNs], genetic algorithm [GA], and particle swarm optimization [PSO]), especially those that are based on mathematical or statistical models (e.g., rough sets [RS] and fuzzy logic), can enhance the ability of determining the relationships among the EOs’ compounds such as the chemical interactions, synergisms, and antagonisms. Accordingly, these tools may be very useful in classifying, optimizing, and predicting the antibacterial activity of a certain EO depending on the historical analysis of other EOs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main challenges faced by scientific researchers in determining the antimicrobial activity of the EOs is the huge number of compounds that constitute the oil and which compounds have the significant antimicrobial effects. In this article, a new computational tool is presented based on RS and PSO algorithms. The proposed tool uses the RS algorithm as a reduction mathematical model to solve the problem of the huge number of EO compounds, which accordingly improves the optimization process that is based on PSO to determine the most proper EO for every type of bacteria.</p>
