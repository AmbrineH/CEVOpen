  <result pre="swarm optimization Introduction Nature is rich in antibacterial, antifungal, and" exact="antioxidant" post="products. Plants are considered as one of the important"/>
  <result pre="pathogens. One of these secondary metabolites, which have an effective" exact="antimicrobial" post="activity, is the &quot;essential oil&quot; (EO). 1 EOs, also"/>
  <result pre="due to the efficiency of EOs as antimicrobials, antioxidants, antitumoral," exact="antifungal" post="and anti-inflammatories, they are widely used in different fields"/>
  <result pre="3 Although the EOs are characterized by their efficiency as" exact="antibacterial" post="organisms, their effective degree is varied according to their"/>
  <result pre="Developing a computational tool to select the EOs that have" exact="antimicrobial" post="activities depending on knowing their effective compounds only and"/>
  <result pre="may be very useful in classifying, optimizing, and predicting the" exact="antibacterial" post="activity of a certain EO depending on the historical"/>
  <result pre="the main challenges faced by scientific researchers in determining the" exact="antimicrobial" post="activity of the EOs is the huge number of"/>
  <result pre="that constitute the oil and which compounds have the significant" exact="antimicrobial" post="effects. In this article, a new computational tool is"/>
  <result pre="tended to use the artificial computing tools in predicting the" exact="antimicrobial" post="effects of EOs, while others have tried to use"/>
  <result pre="use these tools in classifying the EOs according to their" exact="antibacterial" post="activities. Daynac et al have developed a computational model"/>
  <result pre="to evaluate the use of the ANNs for predicting the" exact="antimicrobial" post="activity of EOs. The suggested model was fast artificial"/>
  <result pre="compositions as the network inputs; the output data reflected the" exact="antimicrobial" post="activity of these EOs against four common pathogens: &quot;"/>

  <result pre="et al have developed two optimization models to predict the" exact="antifungal" post="effects for mixing the EOs of &quot; Thymus vulgaris"/>
  <result pre="models have provided a good quality of prediction for the" exact="antifungal" post="effect in terms of the three predefined independent variables."/>

  <result pre="EOs presented in Table 1 are commonly characterized by their" exact="antibacterial" post="effects, especially for certain types of bacteria listed in"/>
  <result pre="can be measured by several methods such as the minimum" exact="bactericidal" post="concentration (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). 8 The"/>
