  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> Essential Oils
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interest in using essential oils as an antimicrobial agent is increasing mainly due to their natural origin, wide spectrum of activity and their GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status. Since earlier reviews published on the 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> oils only described bioactivity against human pathogens, here we have illustrated literature from 2000 onwards on 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> oils only against plant pathogens. Essential oils from the 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> species have been explored for their antimicrobial properties against several bacterial and fungal plant pathogens by using different methods such as the disc diffusion method, agar dilution method, poison food method and inverted Petri plate method depending upon the nature of fungal and bacterial species [
  <a rid="B74-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-medicines-04-00068">74</a>]. In our laboratory bioassay, 
  <span class="italic">A. nilagirica</span> oil performed potent results with postharvest pathogens of table grapes. Oil exhibited 100% mycelia inhibition against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. ochraceus</span> and 0.29 and 0.58 μL/mL fungistatic and fungicidal values, respectively, were noticed for all the fungal species. Oil (1.6 μL) completely suppressed the growth and mycotoxin (AFB1 and OTA) secretion of aflatoxigenic and ochratoxigenic strains of 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span>. Fumigation of oil (300 μL) was found to protect 1 kg of table grapes and enhanced the shelf life for up to 9 days. Thus, this oil can be used as grape protectant from fungal spoilage [
  <a rid="B75-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-medicines-04-00068">75</a>]. Sati et al. [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00068">18</a>] examined in the laboratory that 
  <span class="italic">A. nilagirica</span> oil is effective against root rot pathogens with ED
  <sub>50</sub> (effective dose) values against 
  <span class="italic">Rhizoctonia solani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Sclerotium rolfsii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Macrophomina phaseolina</span> were 85.75, 87.63 and 93.23 mg/L, respectively. This oil also showed fungicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum fragariae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. gloeosporioides</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia caerulescens</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">densiflora</span> (Viv.) oil against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> species [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00068">26</a>,
  <a rid="B76-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-medicines-04-00068">76</a>], whereas 
  <span class="italic">A. maritima</span> oil has poor mycelial growth inhibition. In the three tested 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> (
  <span class="italic">A. scoparia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. sieberi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. aucheri)</span> oils against soil-borne pathogens from Iran, 
  <span class="italic">A. aucheri</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. sieberi</span> oils proved strong antifungal inhibitors with 41.406 μL/L EC
  <sub>50</sub> (effective concentration) for 
  <span class="italic">A. aucheri</span> oil against 
  <span class="italic">Rhizoctonia solani</span>, while 
  <span class="italic">A. sieberi</span> oil showed 121.798 μL/L EC
  <sub>50</sub> with MIC value (minimum inhibitory concentration) 250 μL/L against 
  <span class="italic">R. solani</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia sieberi</span> oil was also fungistatic against 
  <span class="italic">Tiarosporella phaseolina</span> (1000 μL/L), 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium moniliforme</span> (750 μL/L) and 
  <span class="italic">F. solani</span> (750 μL/L) with EC
  <sub>50</sub> values 203.419, 211.072 and 188.134 μL/L, respectively [
  <a rid="B77-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-medicines-04-00068">77</a>]. Essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. arborescens</span> also reported as fungicidal agent against 
  <span class="italic">R. solani</span> at 12.5 μL/20 mL [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00068">22</a>]. Essential oil isolated from 
  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span> from different geographical regions showed significant antifungal activity (ED
  <sub>50</sub> 0.5 μg/mL) against 
  <span class="italic">F. oxysporum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">F. solani</span> [
  <a rid="B78-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-medicines-04-00068">78</a>]. All these plant pathogens have a wide range of hosts including chick pea, mungbean, urdbean, soyabean etc., so their study suggests that these oils can be used as seed treatment for the control of these phytopathogenic fungi infecting agricultural crops. In the laboratory bioassay of Badawy and Abdelgaleil [
  <a rid="B79-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-medicines-04-00068">79</a>], 
  <span class="italic">A. monosperma</span> oil was examined as a strong mycelial growth inhibitor of 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">F. oxysporum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">F. solani</span> and EC
  <sub>50</sub> values reported were 54, 111, 106 and 148 mg/L, respectively. However, they noticed that oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. judaica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. monosperma</span> caused highest spore germination inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">F. oxysporum</span> at EC
  <sub>50</sub> values 69 and 62 mg/L, respectively
  <span class="italic">.</span> The growth of 
  <span class="italic">Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</span>, a crown rot pathogen was inhibited by 
  <span class="italic">A. santonica</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. pontica</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. annua</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. austriaca</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. dracunculus</span>,

  <span class="italic">A. vulgaris</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. vulgaris</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">pilosa</span> oils at MIC of 2400 μL/L. However, 
  <span class="italic">A. abrotanum</span> showed 1200 μL/L MIC value against 
  <span class="italic">S. sclerotiorum</span>, while 
  <span class="italic">A. scoparia</span> did not exhibit complete mycelial inhibition [
  <a rid="B80-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-medicines-04-00068">80</a>]. Some 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> oils showed weak antifungal activity against plant pathogens i.e., 
  <span class="italic">A. proceriformis</span> oil showed a poor efficacy (MIC100 &gt; 1.5 mg/mL) on 
  <span class="italic">Septoria glycine</span> and other phytopathogens tested [
  <a rid="B57-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-medicines-04-00068">57</a>] which shows that this oil cannot be recommended as a plant protection product against said phytopathogens. This strong and poor effect of essential oil of different species of the same genus may be due to chemical composition and their synergistic effect. In another study, 
  <span class="italic">A. campestris</span> oil showed a potent antifungal agent against 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium citrinum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. viridicatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span>. The MICs reported were 1.25 μL/mL (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) for 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span>, while MFC for all fungal species exceeded 20 μL/mL [
  <a rid="B53-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-medicines-04-00068">53</a>]. The MIC of 
  <span class="italic">A. stricta</span> oil was reported as 0.625 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> followed by 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sporothrix schenckii</span> [
  <a rid="B52-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-medicines-04-00068">52</a>]. Similarly, essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span> showed 84 and 91 μg/mL MIC values for 
  <span class="italic">P. chrysogenum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. fumigatus</span> respectively [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to essential oil screening, chemical compounds isolated from different species of 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> have also been evaluated against plant pathogens [
  <a rid="B81-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-medicines-04-00068">81</a>]. 5-phenyl-1,3-pentadiyne and capillarin isolated from 
  <span class="italic">A. dracunculus</span> oil showed fungicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">C. fragariae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. gloeosporioides</span>, and

  <a rid="B82-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-medicines-04-00068">82</a>]. Dadasoglu et al. [
  <a rid="B74-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-medicines-04-00068">74</a>] assessed some chemical constituents like camphor, caryophyllene oxide, linalool, 1, 8-cineole, teminen-4-ol, borneol and α-terpineol isolated from 
  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. santonicum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. spicigera</span> oils against plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The MIC value of linalool was in the range of 50–110 mg/mL, terpinen-4-ol, 60–110 mg/mL for 
  <span class="italic">Xanthomonas campestris</span> pv. 
  <span class="italic">vitians</span> RK-Xcvi; α-terpineol-8, 60–70 mg/mL for 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas cichorii</span> RK-166,

  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span> oil from the Turkish population has been described as an effective fungicidal agent against wilt fungi 
  <span class="italic">F. solani</span> and

  <a rid="B74-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-medicines-04-00068">74</a>]. Mycologists assumed that these chemical constituents present in the essential oils cause degeneration of fungal hyphae result in potent antifungal activity. Chemical compounds of essential oils dissolved in the membranes and therefore increase the permeability of the cell membrane, resulting in membrane swelling and reduction of membrane function [
  <a rid="B85-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-medicines-04-00068">85</a>]. Additionally, essential oils penetrate the cell walls of fungi due to their lipophilic property therefore affecting the enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis reactions, thus causes morphological changes in fungi which further lead to the lysis of the fungal cell wall [
