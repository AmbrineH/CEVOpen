 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organic petrographic techniques included maceral identification in epi-fluorescence and reflected white light under oil immersion, and reflectance measurements of solid bitumen for maturity estimation. The New Albany Shale rock powder and its pyrolysis residues (~1 mm size) were mounted in heat-setting plastic 1-inch (25.4 mm) round pellets and observed using a reflected light microscope (Zeiss) with oil immersion objectives (×50, 1.0 NA; ×100, 1.30 NA). Sample preparation followed ASTM D2797

  </span> wherein thermoset plastic pellet sample mounts were mechanically ground and polished by paper (120–1200 grit) using water as lubricant followed by final polish on matte clothes with 1.0 µm alumina and 0.05 colloidal silica abrasives to achieve smooth surfaces for microscopic and AFM-IR analysis. Maceral identification and solid bitumen reflectance measurements followed ASTM D7708
  <span class="sup">

  </span> as previously described

  </span>. Reflectance analysis emplayed a Leica DM4000 microscope with LED illumination and monochrome camera detection with the computer program DISKUS-FOSSIL by Hilgers Technisches Buero and a Klein and Becker YAG calibration standard (0.908% R
  <sub>o</sub>). Reflectance is a measurement of the percentage of light reflected from macerals under oil immersion. For the New Albany Shale sample and its pyrolysis residues, reflectance of 30–50 random individual solid bitumen particles was measured and the mean value reported as BR
  <sub>o</sub>.
