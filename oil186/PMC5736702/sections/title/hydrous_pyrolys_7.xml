  </span>. The crushed rock samples (2–4 g, 1–3 mm maximum size) were loaded into gas chromatograph ovens and isothermally heated for 72 h, plus ~5–10 min warm-up. Rock residues were rinsed in acetone at experiment conclusion to remove generated bitumens from surfaces. Residues were vacuum-dried overnight prior to preparation for petrographic and AFM-IR analysis.
