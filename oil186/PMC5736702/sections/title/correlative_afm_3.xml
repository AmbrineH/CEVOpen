 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Macerals of interest in the New Albany Shale are imaged and identified by incident light microscopy and then registered and imaged by AFM-IR. In the unpyrolyzed (immature) sample, abundant solid bitumen (gray solid hydrocarbon residue from amorphous organic matter conversion) and 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> (a unicellular planktonic marine alga) are present, along with minor inertinite (remains of carbonized wood) fractions. For example, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> shows the incident white light microscopy image, illustrating discrete solid bitumen and inertinite macerals from the unpyrolyzed immature New Albany Shale sample. The field of view in this image is 30 × 30 µm
  <span class="sup">2</span>, comparable to a single pixel in a traditional micro-FTIR instrument. The AFM-IR measurements are performed in the same area, including images of high-resolution topography (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), IR absorption (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), and mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>), all acquired with pixel size of 100 × 100 nm
  <span class="sup">2</span>. The three AFM-IR images were simultaneously acquired by irradiating the sample with the IR fixed at 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, characteristic of absorption by OM aliphatic C–H stretching. This feature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span> is conveniently distant from common absorption bands in inorganic phases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, so imaging at this wavenumber enables interference-free mapping of OM. The topography image (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>) shows relatively little contrast, indicating a smooth surface after mechanical polishing, such that OM cannot be identified. Instead, the discrete macerals are readily identified as having intense 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> absorption (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and low mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>) relative to the surrounding mineral matter. The closely matching spatial distributions seen in the white light microscopy image and AFM-IR images confirm accurate registration.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the solid bitumen and inertinite macerals, the 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> maceral in the immature New Albany Shale is identified and located by organic petrography (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). As before, the topography (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), IR absorption (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), and stiffness (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) images of the same area are collected with the AFM-IR by fixing the IR wavelength at 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Topography again indicates a well polished surface, with little distinction between OM and the inorganic matrix. IR mapping shows that 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> strongly absorbs at 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, whereas the small inorganic particle (~1 μm across) entrained inside (indicated by the gray arrow) does not absorb. The stiffness image reveals significant contrast between 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span>, the embedded particle, and surrounding mineral matrix. The embedded particle has similar stiffness to the mineral matrix and does not absorb at 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, confirming its assignment as mineral matter. These observations demonstrate the capability of documenting spatial variability in chemistry and mechanical properties of shale at nanoscale with AFM-IR.
