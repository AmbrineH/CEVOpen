 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geomechanical heterogeneity can be estimated by analyzing the distribution of contact resonance (CR) frequencies measured on each maceral, as CR frequency is positively correlated with sample stiffness. Inertinite, solid bitumen, and 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> are highlighted in stiffness images Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>a–c, respectively. Prior to the AFM-IR imaging, the AFM probes are carefully selected to have nearly the same contact resonance frequency when measured on a polystyrene thin film sample. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a> displays the distribution of CR frequencies from pixels assigned as inertinite (highlighted in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), where each pixel (100 × 100 nm
  <span class="sup">2</span>) contributes one data point. Inertinite accounts for an area of 130.74 μm
  <span class="sup">2</span>, with 13,074 measured points yielding an average CR frequency of 182.1 kHz ± 1.7 kHz (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e, f</a> displays the resulting CR frequency distributions of solid bitumen (178.8 kHz ± 3.6 kHz) and 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> (177.2 kHz ± 4.3 kHz), indicating the average mechanical stiffnesses of 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> is slightly less than solid bitumen and much lower than inertinite.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geochemical heterogeneity can be probed by measuring the IR spectra collected at different locations corresponding to different macerals. Localized IR spectra are obtained for inertinite, solid bitumen, and 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span>, as indicated by the colored dots in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>a-c. Because the absolute intensities of localized IR spectra are affected by absorbing material thickness, all spectra are normalized for comparison. All localized spectra illustrate the characteristic bands of IR absorption in OM: aliphatic absorption at 2920 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 2850 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 1450 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and 1375 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; aromatic absorption at 3100–3000 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 1600 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; and carboxyl absorption at ~1710 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (details of band assignments for IR spectra of OM are described in the “Methods” section). Different locations within a maceral present nearly identical IR spectra, as observed for the inertinite (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g</a>), solid bitumen (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3h</a>), and 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3i</a>) macerals. These results indicate compositional homogeneity within a maceral type. However, large variations exist between maceral types in immature shale (see also Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Inertinite displays a strong aromatic character, exhibiting a distinct aromatic absorbance band at 3000–3100 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, strong aromatic absorbance at 1600 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and relatively low oxygenated group stretching at ~1710 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> shows intense C=O absorption at ~1710 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and low aromatic absorption at 1600 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Solid bitumen shows no aromatic C–H absorbance at 3000–3100 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, modest aromatic C=C ring stretching at 1600 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and modest C=O stretching at ~1710 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>.

  <sub>2</sub> (methyl-to-methylene ratio, an indicator of aliphatic chain length and/or the degree of branching of aliphatic moieties), C-factor (proportional to the oxygenated character), and A-factor (proportional to the aliphatic character). Results (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) show that the various OM types in the New Albany Shale are distinct in terms of their chemical composition. 
  <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span> is relatively rich in oxygenated functional groups and aliphatic carbon, with relatively long chains and little aromatic carbon. Inertinite lies on the other extreme, dominated by aromatic carbon with relatively short chains and relatively little oxygenated functional groups or aliphatic carbon. Solid bitumen is intermediate in all regards, with moderate amounts of aliphatic carbon, aromatic carbon, oxygenated fuctional groups, and chain length. The mechanical stiffness (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) is correlated with the chemical composition of OM, showing increasing stiffness with higher aromaticity, similar to other findings
