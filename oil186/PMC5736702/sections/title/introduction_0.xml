 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent boom in unconventional oil and gas production from shale has revolutionized the energy landscape in the United States
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> and stimulated both considerable research
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> as well as environmental and political concerns. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, composed of solid organic matter (OM) scattered in a mineral framework. This solid OM is the source of petroleum, as the OM breaks down into oil and gas under high temperatures during a process known as maturation. The solid OM remaining after maturation develops a network of nanoscale pores responsible for hydrocarbon storage and transport during petroleum production and migration over geologic time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Additionally, OM partially controls shale’s geomechanical properties as it is the softest component, affecting both fracturing efficiency and flow of petroleum to the wellbore
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Therefore, investigation of geochemical and geomechanical properties of OM in shale is important for building robust geological models to access unconventional resources and enhance hydrocarbon production efficiency.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solid OM in shale is typically highly heterogeneous at the submicron length scale. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown that adjacent micron-sized OM grains sometimes differ greatly in porosity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. This heterogeneity can result from innate differences in the OM originally deposited in the shale and potentially from local variations in the extent of thermal alteration brought on by catalysis from nearby mineral grains. While SEM provides detailed, high-resolution information on pores in OM, it provides no information on the type, chemical composition, or mechanical properties of that OM. Organic petrography via incident light microscopy allows the identification of various types of organic components and has been broadly applied to shale petroleum systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, but again this technique provides no direct molecular or mechanical data. Numerous bulk measurements, such as programmed pyrolysis (Rock-Eval) and various spectroscopies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> including infrared spectroscopy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, have documented dramatic variations in the average chemical composition of OM across a wide maturation range, but these bulk analyses cannot assess heterogeneity at small spatial scales. Progress toward documenting geochemical heterogeneity in shale has been realized by application of Fourier transform infrared microscopy (micro-FTIR)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, micro-FTIR cannot reliably resolve chemical features at the submicron length scale relevant to shale due to the diffraction limit
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Alternatively, Raman imaging provides structural information on the degree of organization of OM at the micron length scale but suffers from strong fluorescence background for immature shale samples
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Geomechanical heterogeneity in shale has been studied by nanoindentation at the micron length scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in peak force tapping mode at nanoscale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, but these techniques provide no information regarding chemical composition.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AFM-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) is a rapidly emerging technique in materials and life sciences
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> that provides chemical and mechanical stiffness mapping at nanoscale unaffected by the diffraction limit, in additional to topographic imaging by AFM. During the measurement, an AFM probe with tip radius smaller than 25 nm is placed in contact with an area of interest simultaneously irradiated with a tunable IR laser
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. When the laser wavelength is tuned to an infrared absorption band of the sample material, the sample thermally expands as the energy of absorbed photons is converted to heat. That thermal expansion acts as a force impulse on the AFM cantilever, driving it into oscillation. Oscillation amplitude is directly proportional to the local IR absorption coefficient at the IR wavelength at which the sample is irradiated. Because the AFM tip remains in contact with the sample, the contact resonance (CR) frequency of the coupled sample-cantilever system provides information about the sample’s mechanical stiffness, with higher frequency corresponding to stiffer materials and lower to softer materials (quantitatively translating the measured CR frequency to stiffness requires extensive modeling of the mechanical response of the cantilever to the photothermal expansion of the sample, so stiffness in AFM-IR measurements is typically described using the CR frequency)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Thus, at a fixed laser wavelength, IR absorption and stiffness images can be collected simultaneously by recording the AFM cantilever oscillation amplitude and frequency. The spatial resolution is independent of the IR laser spot size, thus no longer limited by diffraction, but instead determined by the contact area between the probe and the sample as well as by the sample’s thermomechanical properties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The typical spatial resolution of the resulting chemical image is ~100 nm
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, orders of magnitude finer than the spatial resolution attainable by traditional micro-FTIR. Additionally, localized IR spectra can be obtained by measuring the AFM oscillation amplitude while tuning the IR laser wavelength. The resulting local IR absorption spectra are nearly identical to those measured with bulk transmission FTIR

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we demonstrate the first application of AFM-IR in the earth sciences. This technique is used to provide direct, in situ, simultaneous geochemical and geomechanical characterization of individual dispersed OM particles at nanoscale. The AFM-IR images are correlated with optical microscopy images to analyze chemical and mechanical properties of macerals (optically discernible organic constituents) in a New Albany Shale sample. To understand the impacts of maturation on nanoscale OM composition, similar measurements are performed on a series of samples prepared to different stages of maturation by laboratory hydrous pyrolysis. This approach allows evaluation of compositional and mechanical variations among different macerals and unravels the chemical evolution of different macerals with increasing maturity. Beyond the bulk picture provided by conventional analysis, this approach of following compositional and mechanical evolution of individual macerals at the relevant length scale during maturation provides a microscopic picture of the heterogeneous process of petroleum generation.</p>
