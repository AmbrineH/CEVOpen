 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Palestine has an unique geographical location which results in an unique biodiversity as well. In fact, it is located at the meeting point of three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. It extends between the Mediterranean Sea and the continental rift valley which includes the Dead Sea, the most unique sea in the world since it is located in the lowest level from the sea. In addition, it has a lot of mountains, plains, and a desert which also results in an unique weather and climate. Accordingly, the Palestinian desert, plains, and mountains are rich in plants of various species. In fact, more than 2700 plants species are distributed on this small Mediterranean area, of which more than 300 are mentioned in published ethnobotanical data and its cultural characteristics are highlighted in the literature, including traditional herbal Palestinian medicine and materia medica for curing various illnesses [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>]. As reported by Salgueiro et al., in 1997 [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>], climate, genotype, growth area, rainfall, and harvest methods can influence the essential oil composition of plants. Many published studies demonstrated that the yield and chemical composition of the essential oils varied within different geographical areas [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>, 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>–
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils obtained from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> growing in different countries have shown very large differences in their major components. The 2-undecanone and 2-nonanone are the major components of the essential oil from most of the studied
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> leaves from various countries [
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>–
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study which was performed by Tzakou and Couladis, 2011, on the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from Greece showed that the main components of the oil were 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-phellandrene (10.7%) and 2-methyloctyl acetate (44.0%) [
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. Another study which was conducted in Tunisia by Tounsi et al., 2011, showed that the leaves of cultivated
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> contained 2-nonanol as the major active constituents of the essential oil [
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>]. Another study conducted also in Tunisia by Ghazghazi et al., 2015, showed that the main chemical constituents of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil were menthol (43.92%) and linalool (42.10%) [
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>]. These variations in the phytochemical components may be due to the various geographical locations and climatic and weather conditions from which the
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> leaves were collected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, a high similarity was observed in the quality and the biological activities of the essential oils obtained from the Hebron and Jerusalem mountains, while the essential oil obtained from Jenin region showed different quality and activity. This may be due to differences in the location and weather between these regions. In fact, Jenin is a plain area and it is located in the northern part of Palestine. In addition, it has a very humid and hot weather. On the other hand, both Hebron and Jerusalem are mountainous regions and are located in the middle to southern area of the West Bank, close to the Dead Sea, and they usually have moderate to dry weather. Moreover, the soil in Palestine is highly variable in type and characteristics. Brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas are found in the southern mountain ridge, in Jerusalem and Hebron, whereas grumosols are found Jenin within the northern West Bank, which is known for low-lying areas that exhibit a higher temperate climate compared to other regions [
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>]. These variations in soil type and climate may affect the growth and characteristics of the native flora.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More specifically, the antioxidant activity results showed that the essential oil obtained from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> leaves which were collected from Jerusalem region had the highest antioxidant potential followed by the essential oil obtained from Hebron regions with antioxidant potential of 69.56% and 61.53% of inhibition according to Trolox; meanwhile the antioxidant potential was the weakest for the essential oil obtained from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from Jenin region which had 24.12% of inhibition potential compared to Trolox a reference antioxidant compound.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, only one research was performed to assess the antioxidant activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis.</span> In this study, the method of extraction was Soxhlet with methanol/water, and it was not conducted on the essential oil nor using microwave sonicator as method of extraction. The reported antioxidant activity was several times lower than our results (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 70.01 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml) [
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, our tested
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin regions had IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 6.9 ± 0.94 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml, 7.8 ± 1.05 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml, and 19.9 ± 0.68 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml, respectively, that showed that our studied essential oils had more powerful antioxidant activity than the above-mentioned study on the antioxidant potential for
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> leaves extract [
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>]. This may be justified due to differences in the location, weather, soils, method of preparation, and type of tested extracts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the antiseptic activities, the best antibacterial activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil against
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>,
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, and MRSA was for the essential oil obtained from the plant from the Jerusalem region followed by the essential oil obtained from Hebron region which had MIC values of 1.5 mg/ml, 9 mg/ml, 3.25 mg/ml, and 8 mg/ml, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the weakest antibacterial activity was for the essential oil obtained from Jenin region with MIC values of 12 mg/ml, 22 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, and 21 mg/ml, respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the antifungal activity for
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> leaves essential oil was the best for the plants collected from Jenin region and was 2.75 mg/ml followed by the essential oil from Jerusalem region while the lowest antifungal potential was for the essential oil obtained from Hebron.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results about antifungal activity had been demonstrated in a study conducted by Khoury et al., 2014, which showed that the essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> growing in Lebanon had the major components 2-nonanone, 51.7%, and 2-undecanone, 36.7%, which exhibited antifungal activity against the yeast
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> and the dermatophyte
  <span class="italic"> Trichophyton rubrum</span> [
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the antioxidant and antibacterial results may be explained by the fact that the essential oils from Jerusalem and Hebron are rich in linalyl acetate which showed powerful antibacterial activity and can result in alterations of membrane permeability and in leakage of intracellular substances of microorganisms. In addition, linalyl acetate might interact with intracellular sites resulting in antibacterial activity [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>, 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> plant from Jerusalem and Hebron had high content of linalyl acetate which corresponded with the best antibacterial activity while the essential oil from Jenin area did not contain this pharmacologically active compound. For that reason, this plant essential oil had the lowest antibacterial activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further pharmacological and clinical studies are required to evaluate the effects of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil collected from Jerusalem and Hebron regions against cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular and other diseases. In elaboration of the above, the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from Jenin region also needs more studies on other fungal infections to evaluate the complete antifungal activity of this plant species.
