 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phytochemical profile of the
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil components from Hebron region was almost similar to Jerusalem region and the total components of the essential oil were 96.75% and 96.3%, respectively. In addition, they contained major phytochemical classes such as (i) alcohol which represented 32.36% and 38.24%, respectively, (ii) ketone group 31.16% and 18.27%, respectively; and (iii) ester group which represented 29.51% and 35.05%, respectively. Meanwhile the essential oil from the same species growing in Jenin region had almost different components: the total essential oil represented 92.58% and the major represented class of phytoconstituents was ketonic products with 89.81% of total identified essential oil components. Moreover, 14 components were identified from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil which was harvested from the mountains of Hebron. Regarding
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil which was obtained from the mountains of Jerusalem, 17 components were identified. Surprisingly, only 7 components were identified in the essential oil that was extracted from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> of Jenin region and two phytochemical classes (hydrocarbons and ester groups) were absent in this sample. The compositions of the essential oils isolated from
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from the three regions of Palestine are illustrated in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of the essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span>, collected from three regions of the Palestinian West Bank, was tested by DPPH and using Trolox as a reference compound. The used concentrations ranged 1–100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml for all the studied essential oils from three regions as well as for standard Trolox as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The results revealed that the free radical scavenging property was exhibited by all the studied

   <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> collected from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin were 6.9 ± 0.94

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin regions of Palestine extracted by microwave-ultrasonic method exhibited interesting potential bioactivity against the growth of all microbes examined in this study. However, the highest antibacterial activity (lowest MIC) against bacterial pathogen examined was for
   <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil from Jerusalem and was seen against
   <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>,
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>,
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, and MRSA with MIC values of 0.75 mg/ml, 7 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, and 4 mg/ml, respectively, in comparison with gentamycin which has MIC values of 0.5 mg/ml, 2 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1.5 mg/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the best antifungal activity against
   <span class="italic"> C. albicans</span> was for
   <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil from Jenin region which showed MIC value close to 2.75 mg/ml in comparison with amphotericin B which had MIC value around 2 mg/ml. The antifungal and antibacterial activity for the three essential oils are shown in
