 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaves of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> were collected during its flowering time, in April 2015, from three regions of Palestine; Jerusalem (the middle part of the West Bank), Hebron (the southern part of the West Bank), and Jenin (the northern part of the West Bank). The plant taxonomical classification was carried out by Pharmacognosist Dr. Nidal Jaradat. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, An-Najah National University, under the code number: Pharm-PCT-2084.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To extract the essential oil, the methods in previously published studies were followed; the leaves of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> were separated carefully and then washed twice with distilled water. The washed leaves were dried for 10â€“14 days in the shade at room temperature to avoid damage and to minimize cross-contamination of the separated leaves. Finally, the dried leaves were grounded well and the powder obtained was stored in cloth bags for future use [
