The plant taxonomical classification was carried out by Pharmacognosist Dr. Nidal Jaradat. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, An-Najah National University, under the code number: Pharm-PCT-2084.

About 100 g of the dried leaves powder was suspended in about 500 ml deionized water into a 1 L round bottom flask and placed in this apparatus and connected with Clevenger apparatus. The power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50 W with a frequency of 40 kHz). The isolation process using this apparatus was conducted for 10 min at 100°C. This process was repeated for three times for each plant sample. The obtained essential oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried, and stored in the refrigerator at 2–8°C [
