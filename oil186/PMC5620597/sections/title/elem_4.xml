   <span class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</span> L. (basil) seeds, belonging to varieties lettuce, cinnamon, minimum, latifolia, and violetto, were purchased from the local market. Basil seeds of the five varieties were sown into sowing boxes filled with universal soil for sowing seeds in an environmentally controlled growth chamber. Environmental conditions were: photoperiod 12/12, air temperature 18/24 °C, and air relative humidity 50/70% (day/night). When the plants formed true leaves were transplanted into small plastic pots. When they reached 12–15 cm height, they were transplanted to their final position either into plastic 20 L pots in the greenhouse or directly to the land in the experimental field. For each variety 20 plants were planted in each cultivation site. For the field conditions, basil transplants were planted into rows with 0.50 m in-row and 1.00 m between row spacing, covering a total area of 15 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Plants were irrigated every second day with an irrigation tape providing 5–7 L of water, in both field and greenhouse conditions. During the growing period, no pests or diseases were observed apart from the inability of var. cinnamon to grow in the greenhouse conditions and that var. violetto failed to grow in the field conditions, thus only the results from one cultivation site are given. Harvesting of the plants was performed almost two months after transplantation, prior to flowering stage [

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f005" href="#plants-06-00041-f005">Figure 5</a>). Plant material was hand harvested by removing the apical portion of the herbage 20 cm above ground and leaving 1–2 internodes in order to promote rejuvenation from the sleeping buds. For each variety and cultivation site, 2–3 harvests were performed depending on the variety and its ability to regenerate stems and flowers. Practically, this includes a period of 30–40 days between each cutting. In every collection, plant material was collected the same time of the day in order to eliminate day variations to the yield of essential oil, transferred to the laboratory and fresh weight was measured, and the essential oil yield to fresh weight was calculated. In total, 23 samples were collected extracted and analysed, namely 10 essential oils obtained from 4 four different varieties cultivated in the greenhouse, and 13 essential oils obtained from four varieties cultivated in the field (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t001" href="#plants-06-00041-t001">Table 1</a>). The plant materials have been deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Food Technology (Technological Educational Institute of Ionian Islands) under the number 737.

   <a rid="B31-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-plants-06-00041">31</a>]. Each plant material sample (about 2.0 kg) was extracted for 3 h. The essential oil content (% 
   <span class="italic">v/w</span>) was estimated on a fresh weight basis. The oil samples were dehydrated over anhydrous Na
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub>. The obtained essential oils were of yellowish colour and a pleasant odor, and were deposited in vials at −20 °C prior to further chemical analyses.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantification was performed using gas-chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Analyses were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph with FID, fitted with a fused silica Rtx-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d.), film thickness: 0.25 μm). The column temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were programmed at 230 °C and 280 °C, respectively. 0.5 µL of each sample were diluted in 500 µL GC grade n-pentane and 2 μL of the obtained solution was further injected in the GC apparatus. Identification of constituents was achieved by calculating the arithmetic indices relative to linear alkanes from C
   <sub>9</sub>–C
   <sub>23</sub> and comparing with data from GC-MS identifications.

The temperature program for HP-5 MS column was from 60 °C (5 min) to 280 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injection volume for all samples, diluted as previously described, was 2 μL.</p>
