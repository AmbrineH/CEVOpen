  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the greenhouse conditions the essential oil (EO) content of varieties violetto, latifolia, and minimum increased in the second and/or third harvest, whereas in var. lettuce the second harvest produced less essential oil content when comparing to the first and third harvest where the essential oil content was in the same levels. Noteworthy is the fact, that in the field conditions, the essential oil content in the varieties of latifolia, minimum and lettuce decreased gradually after the successive harvests while in var. cinnamon sequential harvests didn’t affect overall essential oil yield (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t001" href="#plants-06-00041-t001">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results indicate that different cultivation conditions affect plant’s response to successive harvests and consequently the essential oil content, even of the same variety. As such controlled greenhouse conditions favor or have no impact to the total production of essential oil in the varieties latifolia, minimum, and lettuce when comparing to the field conditions. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All obtained essential oils were analyzed with GC/FID and GC/MS. In total, 96 individual constituents were identified representing 98.0–99.9% of the total essential oil. The detailed chemical analysis of the essential oils of the greenhouse samples showed that the major constituents, in var. violetto, were linalool (22.5–26.5%) and 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (15.2–20.0%), followed by eugenol (4.5–11.9%). Variety latifolia has as major compounds linalool (17.1–35.6%), eugenol (10.1–23.3%) and 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (8.8–16.1%). In var. minimum linalool (27.4–28.3%) and eugenol (14.5–23.4%) were the main constituents while in var. lettuce linalool (21.0–23.6%), methyl chavicol (12.1–17.5%), 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (11.4–12.9%) and 
   <span class="italic">epi</span>-α-cadinol (6.0–9.2%) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t002" href="#plants-06-00041-t002">Table 2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the field conditions, the main constituents of var. latifolia were linalool (32.2–49.5%), eugenol (19.8–34.9%), 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (5.9–9.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.2–6.7%). In var. minimun linalool (30.2–52.0%) and eugenol (28.8–36.0%), were the dominating compounds. Var. lettuce has as major components linalool (20.4–26.0%) and methyl-chavicol (45.4–54.1%). The latter constituent was dominating also in the essential oil of var. cinnamon in a range 61.2–75.1% among harvests (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). Between harvests and cultivation sites, the main compounds of the essential oils displayed varying concentrations. The highest concentration for linalool (52.0%) was measured in var. minimum in the field cultivation, in the second harvest in contrast to what has been stated from Zheljazkof et al. (2008) that measures a higher content of linalool in the third cutting of 
   <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> varieties [
   <a rid="B9-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-plants-06-00041">9</a>]. Interesting is the fact that eugenol showed the highest concentration in var. minimum in the first harvest in the field conditions. Noteworthy, from var. minimum methyl-chavicol is lacking or is present in small amounts. Given that methyl-chavicol has a structural resemblance to potential carcinogenic phenylpropanoids such as safrole, chemotypes rich in linalool are preferred for cultivation when used in food and perfume industries [
   <a rid="B15-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-plants-06-00041">15</a>,
   <a rid="B20-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-plants-06-00041">20</a>]. Methyl-chavicol showed the highest concentration (75.1%) in var. cinnamon in the field conditions from the first harvest followed by var. lettuce (54.1%) from the first harvest in the same conditions. In addition, it has been observed that the intensity of purple leaf colour is positively correlated in varieties rich in methyl chavicol [
   <a rid="B21-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-plants-06-00041">21</a>]. However, in compliance with Liber et al. (2011), our results show that the biosynthesis of phenylopropanoids e.g., methyl chavicol, is not characteristic exclusively for the purple morfotypes. Also, green morfotypes (var. lettuce and cinnamon) are rich sources of methyl chavicol as well. [
   <a rid="B22-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-06-00041">22</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the observation that in the field conditions the total essential oil yield was decreasing after successive harvests the individual components, prevalent in basil, like linalool and eugenol seem to follow an opposite pattern. Linalool in var. latifolia was beyond 32.2% in all harvests and in the last harvest reached 49.5% while in var. minimum the percentage of linalool was in all harvests above 30.0% and in the second harvest reached 52.0% in the total essential oil concentration. Furtermore, although the concentrations of linalool in var. lettuce for both cultivation conditions were similar, compound methyl-chavicol showed a remarkable difference reaching 54.1% of the EO in the second harvest in the field conditions, whereas in the greenhouse conditions the higher concentration measured, was 17.5% in the first harvest (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t002" href="#plants-06-00041-t002">Table 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). These data suggest that changes in the environmental conditions can alter the biosynthesis of individual essential oils’ components. Ložienė et al. (2004) have reached similar conclusion while studying the influence of environmental and genetic factors in 
   <span class="italic">Thymus pulegioides</span>’ essential oil [
   <a rid="B23-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-plants-06-00041">23</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached also by Awadh Ali et al. (2017) while studying the EO content of 
   <span class="italic">O. forskolei</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Teucrium yemense</span> collected from different regions of Yemen [
   <a rid="B24-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-plants-06-00041">24</a>]. In parallel, var. cinnamon grown in the field conditions has methyl-chavicol as major constituent reaching 75.1% of the EO content, in the first harvest (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). It seems that the unstable field conditions, in combination with successive harvests affect and promote the metabolic pathway of L-phenylalanine and cinnamic acid [
   <a rid="B25-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-plants-06-00041">25</a>], in var. latifolia, minimum and lettuce that leads to the production of methyl chavicol and eugenol. Moreover, the combination of the harvest stress with the unstable field conditions seems to promote the biosynthesis of individual components. In addition to this, the observed decrease in the EO yield in the field conditions during harvests can be attributed to the partial evaporation of the essential oil from the plant surface.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2. Statistical Analysis </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical analysis of our results confirmed the laborious interaction between the essential oil composition, different varieties, and cultivation conditions. After thorough study of the cluster analyses, it is obvious that during the growing period, varieties can alter the composition of individual components of the essential oil by shifting their chemotype [
   <a rid="B23-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-plants-06-00041">23</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking into account the EO content similarities between harvests for the varieties cultivated in the greenhouse, four clusters were formed (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f001" href="#plants-06-00041-f001">Figure 1</a>). Cluster 1 consists of samples OCK1, OCK3, and OCP4, with linalool, 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene, and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 2 consists of samples OCP5, OCS6, and OCS7, with linalool and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 3 is “simplicifolious” and consists of OCK2 with major constituents linalool and 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene. Finally, cluster 4 consists of OCM8, OCM9, and OCM10 with major components linalool, methyl chavichol, and 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f002" href="#plants-06-00041-f002">Figure 2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultivation conditions in the field defined the dominant constituents for the formation of four clusters in the dendrogram (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f003" href="#plants-06-00041-f003">Figure 3</a>). The similarities observed between harvests and varieties characterized the clusters as: Cluster 1 consisting of samples OCP11, OCP12, OCP13, OCS15, and OCS17 with linalool, eugenol, and 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene as major components. Cluster 2 consists of OCP14 and OCS16 with linalool and eugenol as major components. Cluster 3 consists of OCM18, OCM19, and OCM20, with methyl chavicol and linalool as major components. Finally, cluster 4 is “simplicifolious” and consists of samples OCC21, OCC22, and OCC23, with methyl-chavicol as the dominant component (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f004" href="#plants-06-00041-f004">Figure 4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that in both field and greenhouse the conditions were same for all of the varieties, the observed variations can be attributed to the ability of each variety to react to the stressing factor of harvesting. The grouping obtained for the examined basil varieties in greenhouse and field conditions, provides significant data about the effect of harvesting and cultivation site in the chemical composition of basil essential oils. A comparison of Cluster 1 between field and greenhouse conditions reveals that in var. latifolia, between harvests, shifts are observed in the chemotype by alterations in the biosynthesis of essential oils’ components. These results are in compliance with the study of Božović et al. (2017), in EOs obtained from 
   <span class="italic">Calamintha nepeta</span> (L.) Savi subsp. 
   <span class="italic">glandulosa,</span> indicating that the main compounds were stable, but the ratio between them varied greatly according to the growth stage [
   <a rid="B26-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-plants-06-00041">26</a>]. Especially in var. lettuce it is obvious that apart from the harvest factor, the cultivation site also affects the chemical profile of the obtained EO. Observation of cluster 3 from field cultivation and cluster 4 from greenhouse cultivation reveals a different chemical profile in the EOs obtained for the same variety. As such, these results imply that the cultivation site should also be considered as factor affecting the composition of EOs, apart from the number of harvests. The variations of the chemical profile of the five basil varieties are in accordance with the results of Verma et al. (2013) where different 
   <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> populations belonging to the “basilicum” group are distributed to different clusters [
   <a rid="B27-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-plants-06-00041">27</a>]. The alteration in the chemical profile of the essential oils obtained from 
   <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> Miller between harvests was also indicated by Garzoli et al. (2017). Researchers showed that while 
   <span class="italic">o</span>-cymene and 
   <span class="italic">a</span>-phellandrene were dominating compounds in the first two harvests, EO from the last harvest was characterized by a high content of methyl-chavichol (estragole) [
   <a rid="B28-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-06-00041">28</a>]. Cluster analysis has been proved as a useful tool in the attempt of an evaluation of chemotypes among essential oil bearing plants. However, in 
   <span class="italic">O. basilicum’s</span> case, the numerous synonymous names, varieties, and inerspecific hybridization along with the several factors that affecting essential oils’ composition make this process extremely difficult [
   <a rid="B29-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-06-00041">29</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained data can serve as a guide for cultivation conditions and the harvesting of basil varieties in this geographical region in order to obtain maximum essential oil yield along with certain metabolites or mixtures of them in the composition of the essential oil. Comparing to the literature data about basil chemical composition, current results are in accordance about the yield of essential oil produced. Additionally, they are very promising concerning the composition of them to important constituents like linalool, eugenol, and methyl chavicol. Environmental conditions, like temperature, humidity, and soil conditions, in the island of Kefalonia affect the chemical profile of the cultivated basil varieties and favor the production of bioactive compounds like linalool [
   <a rid="B30-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-plants-06-00041">30</a>]. Practically, this implies that essential oils from aromatic plants cultivated in the climatic conditions of Kefalonia have the quality characteristics needed for commercial exploitation.
