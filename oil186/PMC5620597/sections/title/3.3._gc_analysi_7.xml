 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantification was performed using gas-chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Analyses were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph with FID, fitted with a fused silica Rtx-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d.), film thickness: 0.25 μm). The column temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were programmed at 230 °C and 280 °C, respectively. 0.5 µL of each sample were diluted in 500 µL GC grade n-pentane and 2 μL of the obtained solution was further injected in the GC apparatus. Identification of constituents was achieved by calculating the arithmetic indices relative to linear alkanes from C
  <sub>9</sub>–C
  <sub>23</sub> and comparing with data from GC-MS identifications.
