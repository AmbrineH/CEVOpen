 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical analysis of our results confirmed the laborious interaction between the essential oil composition, different varieties, and cultivation conditions. After thorough study of the cluster analyses, it is obvious that during the growing period, varieties can alter the composition of individual components of the essential oil by shifting their chemotype [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking into account the EO content similarities between harvests for the varieties cultivated in the greenhouse, four clusters were formed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f001" href="#plants-06-00041-f001">Figure 1</a>). Cluster 1 consists of samples OCK1, OCK3, and OCP4, with linalool, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene, and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 2 consists of samples OCP5, OCS6, and OCS7, with linalool and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 3 is “simplicifolious” and consists of OCK2 with major constituents linalool and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene. Finally, cluster 4 consists of OCM8, OCM9, and OCM10 with major components linalool, methyl chavichol, and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultivation conditions in the field defined the dominant constituents for the formation of four clusters in the dendrogram (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f003" href="#plants-06-00041-f003">Figure 3</a>). The similarities observed between harvests and varieties characterized the clusters as: Cluster 1 consisting of samples OCP11, OCP12, OCP13, OCS15, and OCS17 with linalool, eugenol, and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-α-bergamontene as major components. Cluster 2 consists of OCP14 and OCS16 with linalool and eugenol as major components. Cluster 3 consists of OCM18, OCM19, and OCM20, with methyl chavicol and linalool as major components. Finally, cluster 4 is “simplicifolious” and consists of samples OCC21, OCC22, and OCC23, with methyl-chavicol as the dominant component (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that in both field and greenhouse the conditions were same for all of the varieties, the observed variations can be attributed to the ability of each variety to react to the stressing factor of harvesting. The grouping obtained for the examined basil varieties in greenhouse and field conditions, provides significant data about the effect of harvesting and cultivation site in the chemical composition of basil essential oils. A comparison of Cluster 1 between field and greenhouse conditions reveals that in var. latifolia, between harvests, shifts are observed in the chemotype by alterations in the biosynthesis of essential oils’ components. These results are in compliance with the study of Božović et al. (2017), in EOs obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Calamintha nepeta</span> (L.) Savi subsp. 
  <span class="italic">glandulosa,</span> indicating that the main compounds were stable, but the ratio between them varied greatly according to the growth stage [
  <a rid="B26-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-plants-06-00041">26</a>]. Especially in var. lettuce it is obvious that apart from the harvest factor, the cultivation site also affects the chemical profile of the obtained EO. Observation of cluster 3 from field cultivation and cluster 4 from greenhouse cultivation reveals a different chemical profile in the EOs obtained for the same variety. As such, these results imply that the cultivation site should also be considered as factor affecting the composition of EOs, apart from the number of harvests. The variations of the chemical profile of the five basil varieties are in accordance with the results of Verma et al. (2013) where different 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> populations belonging to the “basilicum” group are distributed to different clusters [
  <a rid="B27-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-plants-06-00041">27</a>]. The alteration in the chemical profile of the essential oils obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> Miller between harvests was also indicated by Garzoli et al. (2017). Researchers showed that while 
  <span class="italic">o</span>-cymene and 
  <span class="italic">a</span>-phellandrene were dominating compounds in the first two harvests, EO from the last harvest was characterized by a high content of methyl-chavichol (estragole) [
  <a rid="B28-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-06-00041">28</a>]. Cluster analysis has been proved as a useful tool in the attempt of an evaluation of chemotypes among essential oil bearing plants. However, in 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum’s</span> case, the numerous synonymous names, varieties, and inerspecific hybridization along with the several factors that affecting essential oils’ composition make this process extremely difficult [
  <a rid="B29-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-06-00041">29</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained data can serve as a guide for cultivation conditions and the harvesting of basil varieties in this geographical region in order to obtain maximum essential oil yield along with certain metabolites or mixtures of them in the composition of the essential oil. Comparing to the literature data about basil chemical composition, current results are in accordance about the yield of essential oil produced. Additionally, they are very promising concerning the composition of them to important constituents like linalool, eugenol, and methyl chavicol. Environmental conditions, like temperature, humidity, and soil conditions, in the island of Kefalonia affect the chemical profile of the cultivated basil varieties and favor the production of bioactive compounds like linalool [
  <a rid="B30-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-plants-06-00041">30</a>]. Practically, this implies that essential oils from aromatic plants cultivated in the climatic conditions of Kefalonia have the quality characteristics needed for commercial exploitation.
