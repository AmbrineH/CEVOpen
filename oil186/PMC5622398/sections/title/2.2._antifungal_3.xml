 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fungal infection can be very dangerous for humans, producing mycotoxins and reducing or destroying the nutritive value of foodstuffs, grains, and leaves during storage. Numerous EOs and their constituents have been investigated for their antimicrobial properties against different fungi [
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00063">4</a>]. Antifungal activity is estimated in terms of growth inhibition, and the order of activity is phenols &gt; cinnamic aldehydes &gt; alcohols &gt; aldehydes &gt; ketones &gt; ethers &gt; hydrocarbons [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, the antifungal activity of phenolic components increases with the steric hindrance of the molecule (p-n-propylphenol &lt; thymol &lt; isoeugenol &lt; eugenol) [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00063">22</a>]. Pelczar et al. [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00063">23</a>] reported that the addition of alkyl groups to the benzene ring of phenol increases the antifungal property, because a certain degree of hydrophobicity of aromatic aldehydes and phenolic components seems necessary to show an optimal antifungal effect.
