 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1. Antimicrobial Activity</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial activity of essential oils has been widely reported by Hammer et al. [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00063">8</a>] and Dorman and Deans [
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00063">9</a>]. These authors reported that phenolic compounds present in essential oils, for example, carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol (from various plant origins), are active against many microorganisms. They show different activities against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, mainly due to the position of the hydroxyl group in the phenolic structure of the terpenes [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00063">8</a>]. The main mechanism of antibacterial activity is the denaturation of proteins. An increase in the antibacterial activity of terpenoids depends on the type of alkyl substituent incorporated in a non-phenolic cycle. The presence of a carbonyl function in the terpenoids’ chemical structure also increases the antibacterial properties. Another aspect which influences the bioactivity of essential oils is their stereochemistry and the introduction of a double bond which increases the activity against Gram-negative bacteria [
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00063">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms of antimicrobial action identified in the EOs are the inhibition of microorganisms’ growth (food safety) and the control of natural spoilage processes (food preservation) [
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00063">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EOs are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, phytochemicals such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, phenolics, esters, and other complex aromatic and aliphatic compounds. These phytochemicals possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, and antiviral properties [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00063">11</a>,
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00063">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00063">13</a>]. The different biological effects of EOs are due to the concentration and proportion of their chemical constituents. For example, EOs with higher concentrations of terpenoids exhibit higher antifungal activity compared with EOs rich in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00063">11</a>]. EOs rich in thymol and carvacrol show higher membrane-damaging activities in bacteria than those less rich in phenolics. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In view of the published data on the antimicrobial efficacy of EOs, the following general ranking (in order of decreasing antibacterial activity) can be made: oregano &gt; clove &gt; coriander &gt; cinnamon &gt; thyme &gt; mint &gt; rosemary &gt; mustard &gt; cilantro/sage.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial properties of EOs are mediated via several mechanisms: (a) EOs disrupt the permeability barrier in cells and induce various morphological and physiological changes (lipophilic moieties of the EOs attack the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to changes in membrane stability, hydrophobicity, fluidity, and fatty acid composition [
  <a rid="B14-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-medicines-04-00063">14</a>], and (b) EOs also disrupt proton pump function, destabilizing cell membrane architecture, which causes an uncontrolled flux of H
  <span class="sup">+</span> ions, resulting in the inhibition of H
  <span class="sup">+</span> ion-dependent movement of solutes across the membrane and the disruption of the intracellular pH.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding concentrations, several studies have shown that the antimicrobial activity of essential oils in foods takes place at modest concentrations (200 µL/L), for example in 
  <span class="italic">Thymus algeriensis</span> L. EO and 
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> L. EO [
  <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00063">15</a>]. Espina et al. [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00063">16</a>] also reported that the combination of low concentrations of individual constituents present in lemon essential oil (50–20 µL/L of carvacrol or citral) inactivated foodborne pathogens in fruit juices.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the incorporation of single EOs as antimicrobial agents in certain foods (for example in meat) may produce favourable conditions promoting the growth of undesirable microorganisms, due to possible changes in the ecology of the microorganisms [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00063">17</a>]. Therefore, individual constituents of EOs may not be able to inactivate meat spoilage by microorganisms. In this situation, a combination of different EOs may help by causing an additive antimicrobial effect. For example, Gutierrez et al. [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00063">18</a>] demonstrated that a combination of 
  <span class="italic">Origanum majorana</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span> EOs had an additive effect on meat spoilage.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils exhibit two main characteristics: low risk of resistance by pathogenic microorganisms and low toxicity for humans [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00063">19</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of natural products as preservatives of meat currently focusses largely on essential oils. Regarding antimicrobial activity, the use of essential oils in meat products is a strategy for the reduction of synthetic antioxidants. However, the effects of 
  <span class="italic">R
   <sub>EO</sub>
  </span> depend on the characteristics of the food matrices and on its concentration [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00063">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several benefits of using this EO as a food preservative have been identified: extended shelf life, hypoallergenicity, the improvement of aroma and taste, and possible health benefits to consumers due to its antioxidant and anticancer effects [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00063">21</a>]. Although there is considerable literature exploring the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of EOs derived from numerous plants, for most EOs, the in vitro results do not easily translate into actual use as meat preservatives. EOs are more effective when they come into direct contact with organisms; however, direct contact affects the organoleptic properties of the meat. Essentials oils tend to have an intense aroma even at low concentrations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another negative aspect is that different mould and yeast (
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Mucor</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Torulopsis</span>) or bacteria species (
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Acinetobacter-Moraxella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</span>) cause spoilage of meat. Since EOs possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, and antiviral properties, their use may be part of a good strategy to control meat spoilage. Despite this, they may also represent some disadvantages: EOs may eliminate certain types of bacterial populations and produce favourable environments for the promotion of virulence and the growth of undesirable microorganisms. Additionally, strong aromas and flavours associated with EOs may cause negative organoleptic changes which will affect the consumer acceptability of the meat. Finally, it also must be noted that some EO phytochemicals interact with meat constituents and, in this way, reduce the efficacy of the EOs’ meat spoilage prevention.
