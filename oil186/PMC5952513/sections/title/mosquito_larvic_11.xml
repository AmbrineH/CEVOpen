  <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span> were received from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five larvae were reared in 250 mL glass beaker and fed with Brewer’s yeast/dog biscuit (1:3) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The beaker with larvae were maintained at 27 ± 2 °C, 75 ± 2% relative humidity and photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Larvicidal activity of the essential oil and of the main compounds (estragole and eucalyptol) isolated from the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</span> were evaluated according to the standard procedures suggested by the WHO [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The essential oil and compounds were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO solution and prepared into different concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100 125, and 150 ppm) using distilled water. For comparison commercial larvicide Pylarvex (Pyrethrum Board of Kenya) was used as a positive control. Twenty larvae of early fourth-instar stage were used in the larvicidal assay and five replicates were maintained for each concentration. During this experiment no food was offered to the larvae. The larval mortality was calculated after the 24 h exposure period.
