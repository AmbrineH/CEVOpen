 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leishmaniasis caused by protozoa of the 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> genus, one of the six infectious and parasitic diseases of major importance in the world, is endemic in 98 countries, present on four continents: Africa, America, Asia and Europe, with annual record of 1 million to 1.5 million cases (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>). Every year about 2 million new cases are notified, having a high detection rate and ability to produce deformities (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This disease occurs in 12 countries in Latin America, 90% of cases occurring in Brazil, especially in the Northeast region. In the country, the disease is found throughout the Brazilian territory except for the Southern region. Over the last 10 years, the annual average is of 3,156 cases, with an incidence of 2/100,000 cases per inhabitant. It is most common in children under 10 years old, and proportionally males are most affected (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another annoyance disease neglected is Chagas, which began millions of years ago as enzootic diseases of wild animals, and subsequently transmitted to human beings characterized as an anthropozoonosis. Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan 
  <span class="italic">T. cruzi</span>, which has affected about 12 million people only in Latin America and 75 million people are likely to acquire it (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pharmacotherapy for leishmaniasis treatment and Chagas disease is a little bit scarce (
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>). This is due to commercial disinterest reflected by the fact that the parasitic diseases mainly affect developing countries, where the population has low purchasing power, leading to a low yield for factories, because the drugs would have to be affordable (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemotherapy with pentavalent antimony is widely used, but it is not free of side effects, requiring parenteral administration, extensive treatment and the emergence of resistance, justifying the search for effective alternative drugs, where medicinal plants are highlighted growing (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>). Based on this reasoning, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the urgent need to develop new medicine for the prophylaxis of these diseases (
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In popular medicine, some species of the 
  <span class="italic">Piper</span> genus showed antiparasitic activity; therefore may be required for employment as an alternative therapy (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>). In developed studies, many compounds derived from 
  <span class="italic">Piper</span> species have proven their parasitic activities (
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">Piper betle</span> extract showed activity against promastigotes of 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania donovani</span> (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Piper chaba</span> was effective against promastigotes of 
  <span class="italic">L. donovani</span> varieties (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Piper hispidum</span> was effective against amastigote form of 
  <span class="italic">L. amazonensis</span> (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>), and the extracts and fractions of 
  <span class="italic">Piper ovatum</span> showed activity against the promastigote and amastigote varieties of 
  <span class="italic">L. amazonensis</span> (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>). Extracts and fractions of 
  <span class="italic">Piper reginelli</span> (Mic) DC. var pallescens (C. DC.) Yunck were effective against promastigote form of 
  <span class="italic">L. amazonensis</span> (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this way, it is believed that 
  <span class="italic">P. tuberculatum</span> Jacq. has the potential to combat parasitic diseases, by their kinship degree with the above species. 
  <span class="italic">P. tuberculatum</span> Jacq. is a Piperaceae of economic and medicinal importance, popularly known as “monkey pepper”, found in regions of the states: Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará, Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso. It is used empirically as sedative antidote for snake venom (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>) and in the treatment of stomach disorders (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the objective was to assess the possible anti-parasitic effect of the essential oil from the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">P. tuberculatum</span> Jacq., against lines of 
  <span class="italic">L. braziliensis </span>and 
  <span class="italic">L. infantum</span> as well as 
  <span class="italic">T. cruzi</span>, contributing to the search for therapeutic alternatives for these diseases.
