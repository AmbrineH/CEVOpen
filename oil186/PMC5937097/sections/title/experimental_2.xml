  <span class="italic">Plant material and obtaining the essential oil</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plant material (fruits of 
  <span class="italic">P. tuberculatum</span> Jacq.) was collected at the farm Arajara in the city of Barbalha, State of Ceará, Brazil. The botanical identification was carried out by Professor Dr. Maria Arlene Pessoa da Silva and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium Caririense Dárdano de Andrade Lima - HCDAL of the Regional University of Cariri - URCA, cataloged under the registration number 10631.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fresh fruits (3852 g) were subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger type device. The material was weighed and placed in a glass flask, added distilled water and subjected to boiling for 2 h. At the end of that period, the extracted essential oil was treated with anhydrous sodium sulphate to eliminate the residual moisture.</p>

  <span class="italic">Chemical analysis of the essential oil</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oil was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometer (CG/EM Shimadzu model QP5050A) and provided with a capillary column DB-5HT of fused silica with 30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and film of 0.25 μm, with helium as carrier gas and flow 0.8 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and the detector temperature (or interface) was 200 °C. The column temperature was programmed from 35 °C to 180 °C at 4 °C/min and then 180 °C to 250 °C at 10 °C/min. The mass spectra were recorded from 30-450 
  <span class="italic">m/z</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The individual components were identified by matching their mass spectra with 70 eV impact energy, with the data base using the library built through the spectrometer (Wiley, 229) and other two computers using the retention indices as a pre-selection (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the 
  <span class="italic">in-vitro</span> tests for 
  <span class="italic">T. cruzi</span>, CL-B5 clone was used (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>). The parasites stably transected with the gene for β-galactosidase of 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (
  <span class="italic">lacZ</span>) were provided by Dr. F. Buckner through Commemorative Gorgas Institute (Panama). Epimastigotes forms were cultured at 28 °C in 
  <span class="italic">Liver Infusion Tryptose Broth</span> (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin (Ern, SA, Barcelona, Spain) and streptomycin (Reig Jofr SA, Barcelona, Spain) as described by Le Senne 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>). The cells were collected for testing in the exponential phase of growth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Culture of 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> spp. were obtained from the Health Science Research Institute, Asunción, Paraguay - IICS and identified by isoenzyme analysis. The maintenance of lines, forms of cultivation and isolation of promatigotas forms of 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> spp. followed procedures described by Roldos 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). The inhibitory action of these promastigotes forms were performed using the 
  <span class="italic">L. braziliensis</span> (MHOM / CO / 88 / UA301) and 
  <span class="italic">L. infantum</span> lines (MHOM/ES/92/BCN83), cultured at 22 °C in Schneider’s Drosophila supplemented with 20% FBS.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cytotoxicity assays used NCTC929 fibroblasts lines were grown in Minimal Essential Medium (Sigma). The culture medium was supplemented with heat inactivated FBS (10%), penicillin G (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The viability of the lines was evaluated through the use of resazurin as a colorimetric method (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sodium resazurin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and stored at 4 °C protected from light and prepared with 1% phosphate buffer, pH 7 and filter sterilized before use. The red-β-D-galactopyranoside chlorophenol (CPRG, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was dissolved in a solution of Triton X-100 0.9% (pH 7.4). Penicillin G (Ern, SA, Barcelona, Spain), streptomycin (Reig Jofré SA, Barcelona, Spain) and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were also used.</p>

  <span class="italic">Anti-epimastigote activity test</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The test was performed in microplates with 96 cavities with cultures in exponential phase, as described by Vega 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>). The epimastigotes were inoculated at a concentration of 1 x 105 mL-1 in 200 μL of tryptose liver broth. The plates were then incubated with the drugs at concentrations of 100 and 500 μg/mL at 28 °C for 72 h. After this time, 50 μL of CPRG solution was added to achieve a final concentration of 200 μM. The plates were incubated for an additional period of 6 h at 37 °C and were subjected for visualization under 595 nm. Each experiment was carried out twice and independently, with each concentration triplicate tested in each experiment. The efficiency of each compound was estimated by calculating the percentage of anti-epimastigotes activity (EA%).

After this incubation, 20 μL of a 2 mM solution of Resazurin was added to each cavity. The plates were incubated for 3 h and the reduction of resazurin was determined by absorbance at dual wavelengths of 490 and 595 nm. The control value (blank) was subtracted.
