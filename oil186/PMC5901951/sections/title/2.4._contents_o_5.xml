 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contents of unsaponifiables in tree-borne seed oils, particularly phytosterols, the representative unsaponifiables, were analyzed by an alkaline saponification method [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. We mixed 0.5 g of extracted seed oils with 0.5 mL 5
  <span class="italic">α</span>-cholestane (1 mg/mL hexanes), an internal reference, followed by addition of 8 mL of 3% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) pyrogallol-ethanol solution for antioxidative capacity and 1 mL saturated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, which was then well mixed, saponified at 80°C for 1 h, and cooled in an ice bucket. For extraction, 10 mL distilled water and 7 mL hexanes were added to the sample mix and then the supernatant corresponding to the hexane layer was separated. Extraction of the hexane layer was repeated three times. The solvent was completely evaporated from the separated hexane layer under nitrogen gas to concentrate the residue. Weight of the completely concentrated residue was measured and compared with input sample amount, by which residue weight was calculated as the ratio of unsaponifiables.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For phytosterol analysis, derivatization was performed by using the trimethylsilyl group. Unsaponifiables were mixed with 0.5 mL of BSTFA (N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + trimethylchlorosilane) that contained 1% trimethylsilyl chloride and 1 mL pyridine, and dissolved again, followed by induction of reaction at 80°C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were slowly cooled at room temperature and filtered with a 0.45 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m filter to remove particles, which were used as samples for phytosterol analysis. Phytosterol was analyzed by gas chromatography, for which HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m in film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used, and helium (2.7 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was 260°C at the beginning, increased to 300°C by 3°C/min, and then maintained at 300°C for 15 min. Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 300°C and 320°C, respectively, and the split ratio was 10 : 1. Detection was performed by a flame ionization detector. For identification and measurement of phytosterols, each reference standard, campesterol, stigmasterol, and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-sitosterol, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., and retention time and peak area were used for identification. Phytosterol quantification was performed using 5
  <span class="italic">α</span>-cholestane as the internal standard. To accurately quantify the phytosterols in oils, relative response factors (RRFs) to 5
  <span class="italic">α</span>-cholestane were determined based on three replicate analyses. The RRFs were determined according to the following equation:
