 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proportions of unsaponifiables within tree-borne seed oils are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>. ORT and JLT had the highest level of unsaponifiables in tree-borne seed oils, which seemed to be proportional to the high tocopherol level (101.98 ± 1.34 mg/100 g oil; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>) and a high phytosterol content (479.45 ± 4.27 mg/100 g oil; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>) of JLT. For industrial application of unsaponifiables (fat-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble pigments, and phytosterols), the study results on total oil contents of seeds will be informative.
