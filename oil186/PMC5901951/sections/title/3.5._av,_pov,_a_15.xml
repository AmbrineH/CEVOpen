  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. Acid value indicates acidity when fatty acids of oils bound to glycerol were separated to free fatty acids, by the change in quality; a high acid value means a high proportion of free fatty acids or a low quality of oils. Of the oil resources, MPA had the highest acid value with (38.94 ± 0.24), whereas TUT had the lowest value (0.79 ± 0.01). Additional research is needed to determine if the high acid value of MPA was due to acidification or due to preexisting free fatty acids. For POV, JCT oil showed the lowest value (3.53 ± 0.21 meq/kg) among the tree-borne seed oils, whereas MPA oil showed a relatively high value (127.67 ± 1.79 meq/kg). Although POV is a basic method to measure primary oxidation products, it is difficult to use in cases of high temperature or increasing acidification. POV is obtained by measuring lipid hydroperoxide, the primary oxidation product, which is used for detection of acidification in oils or for the measurement of the induction period. At levels of 60 meq/kg or lower (the reference value for POV content of vegetable oils for frying), it is possible that acidification by generation of primary oxidation products (e.g., in tree-borne seed oils except MPA oil) might not have been completed yet [

  <span class="italic">p</span>-AV ranged from 2.07 ± 0.51 to 9.67 ± 0.25. Except MPA oil, all tree-borne seed oils had stable values from 2.07 ± 0.51 to 4.18 ± 0.50. In a study of Miraliakbari and Shahidi, oxidative stability of seven tree nut oils were measured, in which 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-AV ranges of tree nut oils after being freshly collected and after 12 days of storage were between 0.24 and 0.55 and from 9.36 to 48.83, respectively [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Considering 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-AV of tree-borne seed oils, it is likely that aldehydes were formed in all the oils to some degree; thus, it seems to be necessary to block oxygen or maintain low temperature during oil extraction in order to prevent oxidation in future.
