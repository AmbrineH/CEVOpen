 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trees from which we obtained tree-borne seed oils for this study were MPA, JCT, KOE, JLT, TUT, and ORT. Samples were harvested and collected by Southern Forest Resources Research Center, Jinju, Republic of Korea, in 2016, and oils were extracted from seed endosperm, for which seed coats and impurities were removed manually.
