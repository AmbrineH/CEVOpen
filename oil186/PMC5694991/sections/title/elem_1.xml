  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first experiment, the seeds of two landraces of cumin were planted in the experiment site of College of Aburaihan, University of Tehran, during two successive years (2014 and 2015). Each landrace was planted in 2 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> plots in a sandy-clay soil. The soil was well drained, with pH of 7.2. Recommended crop management practices were implemented to raise the crops to desirable growth stages. Plots were kept weed-, pest-, and disease-free until harvesting time. Chemical characters including the content of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, protein, proline, essential oil, and its composition of two landraces of cumin were measured. It is worth noting that catalase and ascorbate peroxidase play an important role in the maturity of plant tissues and their high activities affect somatic embryogenesis [

   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
   <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. Each essential oil is made up of numerous different organic molecules and some of these including terpenic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and phenols existing in the essential oil are among the genetic properties affecting somatic embryogenesis [
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>–
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. In order to measure chemical characteristics of two landraces of cumin, leaf tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein and proline contents of the leaves were measured according to Bradford and Bates et al. [
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>, 
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>], respectively. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including catalase and ascorbate peroxidase were estimated as described by Beers and Sizer [
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>] and Nakano and Asada [
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>]. The essential oil of the ripened seeds was extracted by the Clevenger apparatus, using the hydrodistillation method. The dried powdered seeds of cumin (40 g) were placed in a distillation apparatus with 400 mL of distilled water and hydrodistilled for three hours. Then, the essential oils were stored in glass vials at 5°C until the essential oil compositions' analysis. The analysis of essential oil composition was performed by GC-MS analysis (a combined analytical method to identify different substances within a sample): Varian CP-3800 GC (gas chromatography) coupled with Varian 4000 (ion trap) MS (mass spectrometry) equipped with a capillary VF-5 fused silica column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness: 0.25 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>m). Helium was used as the carrier gas at the constant flow of 1.0 ml min
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, with split ratio of 1/50. Mass spectra were taken at 70 Ev and Mass range was from 
   <span class="italic">m</span>/
   <span class="italic">z</span> 35–400 a.m.u. The oven temperature was held at 60°C for 1 min and then programmed to 250°C at a rate of 3°C min
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and held for 10 min. The injector and detector (FID) temperatures were kept at 250 and 280°C, respectively. The essential oil compositions were identified by calculation of their retention indices under temperature-programmed conditions for n-alkanes (C6–C24) and the oil on a VF-5 column under the same chromatographic conditions. The compounds were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the internal reference mass spectra library (Wiley 7) or with authentic compounds and confirmed by comparison of their retention indices with authentic compounds or with those reported in the literature. For quantification purposes, relative area percentages obtained by FID were used without the use of correction factors.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In second set of experiment, the cumin seeds were surface-sterilized following the procedure previously described [
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. To obtain plantlets, the sterilized seeds were cultured in the half-strength MS medium and stored in the growth chamber [
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. One month after seed culturing, when grown plantlets were about 5 cm in height, about 0.5 cm of each explant including hypocotyl and cotyledon was prepared. The prepared explants were cultured in MS medium containing 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar and supplemented with 7 different concentrations of PGRs (2,4-D and Kin) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The cultured explants were incubated in the growth chamber at 24°C ± 2°C, 75% relative humidity, and dark condition during the first month of culture. After this step, the formed calli were subcultured into fresh mediums containing the previous combination of PGRs and then were stored in the growth chamber at 24°C ± 2°C and 75% relative humidity under 16/8 h photoperiod with 50

   <span class="sup">−1</span> photosynthetic photon flux density provided by cool white fluorescent light. Data related to the percentage of callus formation was recorded five weeks after culture. Seven weeks after culture, calli images were taken by a camera under the same situations and then perimeter and area of calli were calculated by Digimizer, an image analysis software (version 4.3.1, MedCalc Software, Belgium). In the eighth week, the symptoms of somatic embryogenesis in some of the studied mediums were observed without transferring the calli to the PGRs-free medium; then different stages of the somatic embryogenesis were recorded using a microscope.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thereafter, the calli were transferred to the PGR-free medium for excluding of auxin effect and further stimulation of somatic embryogenesis. The percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential was calculated on the basis of a number of explants producing somatic embryogenesis/number of total cultured explants in each Petri dish after two to three weeks. Data related to the percentage of plant regeneration were recorded during 12 weeks after the first culture. The percentage of plant regeneration was calculated on the basis of the number of regenerated explants/the number of induced calli with embryogenic potential in each Petri dish.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment was performed in a factorial form using a completely randomized design with three factors and three replications (as Petri dishes). Five explant segments were placed in each Petri dish containing 25 ml different medium. Studied factors included two Iranian cumin landraces, Golestan and North Khorasan, two explants, hypocotyl and cotyledon, and 7 different concentrations of PGRs (

The data related to the percentage of callus formation, perimeter, and area of calli were subjected to ANOVA and DMRT to evaluate the statistical significance and were expressed as the mean ± SE. Since the distribution of the recorded data related to measured characters including the percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential and the percentage of plant regeneration was not normal and no transformation was able to induce normality, the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann–Whitney nonparametric tests were used and median grouping was made [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the best response of plant regeneration was observed in the MS medium containing 0.1 mg/L Kin, the regenerated 3 to 4 cm long plantlets were excised from mentioned medium and then were cultured in pots containing half-strength MS medium. The following treatments were investigated for more rooting: MS + PGR-free, MS + IAA (0.35 mg/L), MS + NAA (0.37 mg/L), and MS + IAA (0.35 mg/L) + NAA (0.37 mg/L). Pots were observed every 3-4 days regularly and then some of the characters including days to production of the main rooting, the percentage of produced main rooting, and the percentage of produced lateral rooting were recorded to compare investigated treatments. After 3 weeks, sufficiently developed cumin plantlets containing rooting were transplanted into plastic pots containing sterilized garden soil. Then, the pots were covered with the plastic cover for maintaining of plants moisture and kept in the greenhouse for two weeks. Thereafter, they were acclimatized to greenhouse conditions by removing the covering plastic. Percentage of survival plantlets was recorded and then they were kept until flowering and seed production.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Somaclonal variation is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by plant tissue culture. It is particularly common in plants regenerated from callus [
