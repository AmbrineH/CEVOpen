 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant enzymes play a role in metabolizing reactive oxygen species and preventing damage due to oxidative stresses, auxin metabolism, cross-links in the cell wall, and response to environmental stresses [

  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">32</a>]. Results of the present study showed that level of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase enzymes in Golestan landrace was significantly much more than that in North Khorasan landrace (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(a)</a>). The presence of catalase in plant cells plays an important role in increasing resistance to oxidative stresses. In addition to ascorbate peroxidase catalyzing the H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> reduction reaction, also this enzyme plays a role in many cellular processes such as auxin metabolism, cross-links in cellular wall, and response to environmental stresses [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results suggested that, in terms of protein contents, there was no significant difference between the two landraces of Golestan and North Khorasan (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(b)</a>). The protein content of cells is regarded as one of the most important factors of cell growth [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. Proteins play important physiological roles such as structural and enzymatic roles on the level of cells and it is not possible for cells to continue growing in the long run without these materials. Any factors that inhibit protein synthesis lead to cell growth failure [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">32</a>, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">34</a>]. Proline is also the key amino acid that develops stress tolerance in plants through protection and sustainability of cell membranes [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">32</a>, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">34</a>]. The results showed that Golestan landrace had higher proline content than North Khorasan landrace (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(b)</a>). Proline in addition to its osmotic role is effective as a source of nitrogen for rapid growth of plant cells [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">35</a>]. There was no significant difference between the two landraces in terms of the amount of essential oil (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(c)</a>). In terms of chemical structure, the essential oils are not homogeneous and have different compositions. Dubey et al. [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">36</a>] reported significant differences between the Indian landraces of cumin in terms of the amount of essential oil. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3"> Table 3</a> represents GC-MS profile of essential oil of two studied cumin landraces. The results showed that the identified compounds in their essential oil may be classified into five organic groups including terpenic hydrocarbons, alcohols and phenols, aldehydes, epoxides, and other compositions (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be mentioned that the two groups of terpenic hydrocarbons and aldehydes were the highest existing compositions in the essential oil of the studied cumin. In a study on the chemical compositions of the landraces of Indian cumin, the main ingredients of essential oil of terpenic hydrocarbons and aldehydes were reported [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. In the present study, the extracted essential oil from Golestan landrace contained 62.27% terpenic hydrocarbons, while the amount of these compositions was 51.14% in North Khorasan landrace (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). It would be worth noting that two compositions of alpha-thujene and gamma-terpinene were the main constituent elements of terpenic hydrocarbons and their expanding range varied from 6.91% to 24.8%. Alpha-thujene was significantly higher in North Khorasan landrace, while the number and amount of other identified terpenic hydrocarbons in Golestan landrace were higher compared to North Khorasan landrace (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). In the present study, a total of 45 compositions were identified by GC-MS based analysis of cumin essential oil, representing 98.42 to 99.15% of the total compositions (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). In other studies, some researchers reported that the total numbers of identified compositions in Egyptian landraces, Indian landraces, Chinese landraces, and Tunisian landraces were 41, 29, 19, and 38, respectively [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. Discrepancies in the results reported on chemical compositions of cumin essential oil may be due to factors including the sensitivity of the system used or method adapted for analysis. The chemical compositions of the essential oil of medicinal plants are affected by numerous internal and external factors including plant genotypes, geographical location, climatic conditions, growth season, and essential oil extraction method [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">37</a>]. Analysis of essential oils of the two landraces showed that, among the identified compositions in the essential oils, cumin aldehyde has been the main constituent of cumin essential oil whose value in the Northern landrace has been significantly higher compared to Golestan landrace (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). Cumin aldehyde smells good and is the main reason for the aromatic smell of cumin seeds and spice. This substance is commercially used in perfume and in hygienic and cosmetic industries. It is worth noting that, in local and international markets, cumin seeds containing more cuminaldehyde are preferred to cumin seeds containing terpinene [
