 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yield of hull essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> L. variety Bronte (HEO) was 0.25% (

  <a rid="B20-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijms-18-01212">20</a>], demonstrating how the Bronte variety possesses a much higher content of essential oil, probably due to characteristic pedoclimatic conditions of growth and probably to the extraction carried out immediately after harvest, which allowed for an increase in the extraction efficiency. This practice also led to a reduced formation of peroxidation, isomerization, or rearrangement of products due to temperature, light, and oxygen availability [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil composition, with retention indices and percentages, was reported in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 40 volatile constituents were identified, fully characterized, and grouped in four classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and others (non-terpenoidic compounds). The major components of HEO were 4-Carene (31.743%), α-Pinene (23.584%), 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-Limonene (8.002%), and 3-Carene (7.731%), all monoterpenes hydrocarbons that represented 86.591% of the HEO, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes, which presented an average value of 8.235% with α-Terpineol (4.036%), Borneol (0.831%), and α-Pinene oxide (0.787%) as the main compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the monoterpenes hydrocarbons remained the most abundant family, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes (reflecting the results reported in the literature [
  <a rid="B20-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijms-18-01212">20</a>]), the characteristic absence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and the very low presence of non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes, makes the essential oil of Bronte pistachio hulls easily recognized and distinguishable from essential oils derived from other pistachio hull varieties.
