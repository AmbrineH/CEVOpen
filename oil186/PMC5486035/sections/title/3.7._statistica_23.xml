 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results (inhibition %) were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments in triplicate (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) and as concentration inhibiting 50% of the initial activity (IC
  <sub>50</sub>). Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of the difference from the respective controls for each experimental test condition was assayed by using Tukey’s test for each paired experiment. Statistical significance was considered at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05. IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by Graphpad Prism software (version 5.0, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
