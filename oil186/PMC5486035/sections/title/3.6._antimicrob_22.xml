 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following strains, obtained from the in-house culture collection of the University of Messina (Messina, Italy), were used for antimicrobial testing: 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 6538P, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> MRSA ATCC 43,300, three clinical isolates of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> (of which two were methicillin resistant), 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> ATCC 10536, and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> ATCC 9027.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultures for antimicrobial activity tests were grown in Mueller–Hinton Broth (MHB, Oxoid, CM0405) at 37 °C (24 h). For solid media, 1.5% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) agar (Difco) was added.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of HEO were determined by the broth microdilution method, according to CLSI (2009). MBCs were determined by seeding 20 mL from all clear MIC wells onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA, Oxoid) plates. The MBC was defined as the lowest extract concentration which killed 99.9% of the final inocula after 24 h incubation at 37 °C.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All experiments were performed in triplicate on three independent days. A number of positive and negative controls with selected antibiotics and solvent (DMSO) were included in each assay.</p>
