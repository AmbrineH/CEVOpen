   <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> were extracted by steam distillation using the Linax extractor (model D2 Mini, São Paulo, Brazil). The leaves were transferred to the reservoir, which features a continuous water cycle coming directly from the water system. This water was not in contact with the sample, the water vapor was passed through the reservoir, which contains the leaves, and drags down the volatile constituents. The samples were stored in glass vials under refrigeration to prevent possible losses of volatile constituents. Different extraction times [1 to 6 h] were used to optimize the estimate of the best yield.

The autosampler was an AOC-20 series injector (Shimadzu), the gas chromatograph was a GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu), the mass spectrometer was a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) and ion trap detector (MS, model 4000) (Shimadzu), with electron ionization-mass spectrometry (EI-MS 70 eV). The analysis was developed in a Rtx

Temperature program: injector at 250ºC with a column-oven from 60 to 240 ºC at 3 ºC /min. The retention index (RI) was calculated for all the volatile constituents using an n-alkane homologous series, ranging from C8 to C40, using a linear temperature programmed equation.[

    <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] The preparation of W/O emulsions by the PIT method is a widely used technique in obtaining emulsified systems, in particular, emulsions containing the essential oil.[

    <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>
    <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a>] According to studies presented by Esquena, Sankar,[
    <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>] the PIT method requires the system whose phase inversion temperature is above the freezing point of water, and below the temperature where degradation of substances occurs. This can be achieved by choosing the surfactant with the nonionic appropriate HLB value for the system. The oil in water emulsion composition was 5% (w/w) of PaEO, 2% (w/w) of surfactants, and 93% (w/w) of water. Initially, the continuous phase was prepared by dispersing the required Tween 20
    <span class="sup">®</span> in distilled water. The dispersed phase was obtained by adding Span 80
    <span class="sup">®</span> into the essential oil. Both phases were heated separately to 70°C and one phase dispersed within the other. The studies report the use of up to 70°C to obtain emulsions containing essential oil.[

The heparin-free capillary tubes were filled to 75% with each formulation and placed in a micro-centrifuge (Quimis, model Q10.500, São Paulo, Brazil) at 10,500 rpm for 10 min. The evaluation was realized at room temperature on the storage days 1 (D1), 30 (D30) and 90 (D90). After the centrifugation cycle, the IC calculations were performed in accordance with (equation 2).
