 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils extraction conditions are important as they are one of the main physical and chemical parameters which are directly related to the quality of the essential oil. A rapid distillation can lead to a product containing predominantly volatile constituents with better organoleptic and chemical characteristics. However, a prolonged extraction of the product makes the process more expensive and can also increase the amount of less desirable compounds.[
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>] In our study, the PaEO extraction was performed in a period from 1 to 6 hours [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1</a>]. The data showed higher extraction efficiency after 3 hours. After that, the extractions from three hours, showed constant behavior. Under these conditions, 0.9 ml of PaEO was obtained from 2 kg of fresh leaves of

   <a rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref46">46</a>

   <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>] The selection of the surfactant used is fundamental in the production of formulations with a good stability. The first step in the selection of the correct surfactants for the emulsion system is the identification of the HLB value of the oil fraction. The concept of the hydrophile-lipophile balance [HLB] was first described by Griffin[
   <a rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref51">51</a>] and is used as a semi-empirical scale for selecting surfactants to form stable emulsions. A well established methodology to identify the HLB of essential oils is the study of long-term stability of a bath of emulsions produced with the essential oil, and ranging the HLB value of the surfactants.[

In spite of the various HLB values of the formulations, the process of emulsification by phase inversion was able to produce stable emulsions with a milky aspect and which remained stable on the day of preparation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the emulsions showed different behavior to creaming during the storage time, according to the concentration of the emulsifying agent used. The cream index (CI) reflects the emulsion stability by measuring the height of the separated cream layer with time, but also indirectly demonstrates the process of separation of droplets in the creaming.[

Consequently, there is a decrease of the CI over storage time in which the emulsion is preparing for phase separation.

The emulsions F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F11 showed a phase separation process after 120 days. Therefore, phase separation of the emulsion F12 and F13 in D180 demonstrated instability of these formulations. The F14 formulation showed a high CI in D180. On the other hand, there was no phase separation of emulsions for F1, F2, F3, and F4. However, among these emulsions, the F1 had the lowest rate of creaming [

Thus, besides the simplicity, the ability to use a low amount of sample and with a short time of execution made this method an excellent tool to evaluate and/or optimize formulation parameters and their respective HLB values. The results of the short term stability study are shown in

This is because the emulsified system has free energy in the first days of storage which can lead to altered results. Thus, the study was conducted using the micro-emultocrit technique on three different days, where it was observed that the day D1 showed instability in relation to D30 and D90, possibly because free energy still existed in the system. The formulations on D30 and D90 had greater stability, because free energy had already dissipated promoting a kinetic stabilization. It was noted that F2 is the most stable formulation due to lower IC, based on the static data.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The F1, F2, F3, and F4 emulsions, which had the highest values of HLB, showed the highest carvacrol content after 180 days.

   <a rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref65">65</a>] the HLB system is based on surfactants, which are amphiphilic compounds whose molecules are in the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups. The higher HLB values are assigned to more hydrophilic surfactants in which the hydrophilic groups are more suitable for the production of O/W emulsions. In fact, the essential oil properties presented a volatility which could explain the difficulty of oil entrapment and retention.
