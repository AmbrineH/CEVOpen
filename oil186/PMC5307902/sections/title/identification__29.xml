 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of the chemical constituents of the PaEO performed by GC-MS as well as the percentages, retention time and Kovats Index; are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">Table 3</a>. The chromatographic data allowed the identification of 19 components, corresponding to 99.99% of the total oil composition. The main constituents were carvacrol [33.5%], p-cymene [28.20%], γ-terpinene [14.77%], E-caryophyllene [4.63%], acid phthalic [4.32%], γ-bergamotene [3.16%], α-terpinene [2.52%], and β-myrcene [2.03%].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The qualitative data of the major compounds are in agreement with data previously reported for 
  <span class="italic">Plectranthus</span> sp. oils from Brazil.[
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>] However, the quantitative data were different for: carvacrol [33,5%], 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cyneme [10.3%], and γ-terpinene [5.9%]. Other studies on the composition of the 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> oil also showed carvacrol as the main constituent, but the concentrations ranged from 28.65% to 90-98%.[

  <a rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref43">43</a>
  <a rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref44">44</a>] The variations observed among the various reports can be attributed to the methodology used in the extraction process, seasonal variations, soil type, climate, genetic aspects, and geographical variations of plant.[
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>] According to Haddouchi, Chaouche[
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a>] the knowledge about essential oil composition is fundamental in its correct application as a bioactive product. To control the types of components and the essential oil yield in the plant, it is necessary to standardize the cultivation conditions as well the harvest and postharvest procedures. Thus, the extraction of high quality essential oils is feasible.[
