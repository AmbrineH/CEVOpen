 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of emulsions containing essential oil remains a technological challenge, specifically in the improvement of their topical applicabilities. However, in the present work the feasibility of production of disperse systems was demonstrated using only the essential oil from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> in the disperse phase, and its HLB value was described for the first time. Accordingly, the combination of surfactants [Span 80
  <span class="sup">®</span> and Tween 20
  <span class="sup">®</span>] leads to a required HLB value of 15.7.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize, the present work demonstrated the feasibility of emulsion containing essential oil extracted from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span>. However, further biological studies are necessary to evaluate the activity of the PaOE containing emulsions, as well as the study of cutaneous permeation for topical use, as well as the definitive dose to be administered.
