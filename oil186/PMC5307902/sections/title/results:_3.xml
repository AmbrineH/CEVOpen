 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PaEO was obtained by steam distillation and the total extraction was reached after 3 hours yielding of 0.2% (w/w). This essential oil was characterized by physicochemical analyses for density [1.5 g.ml
  <span class="sup">-1</span>], refraction index [0.9167], ethanol 90% solubility [1:2], color, and appearance (yellow/clear). Nineteen components were identified in the oil, among them the sesquiterpenes: carvacrol [33.50%], p-cymene [28.20%] and Î³-terpinene [14.77%]. The emulsions obtained successfully showed, for the first time, HLB values for essential oils from
