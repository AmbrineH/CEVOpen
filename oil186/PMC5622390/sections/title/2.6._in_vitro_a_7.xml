 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity was performed by the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging method [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00055">26</a>], adapted for microplates. 178 μL of the essential oils solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 4480–560 μg/mL were added to a 96-well microplate and 72 μL of DPPH (0.3 mmol/L) solubilized in methanol were added. Blank reading was performed with the test sample prior to the DPPH radical incubation. As a negative control, 178 μL of methanol was used. As positive controls, quercetin from 20 to 0.625 μg/mL and 
  <span class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</span> extract (Herbarium Laboratório Botânico S.A., Paraná, Brazil) from 40 to 1.25 μg/mL were used. The microplate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 518 nm using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA). The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the formula AA% = 100 − {[(Abs 
  <sub>sample</sub> − Abs 
  <sub>blank</sub>) × 100]/Abs 
  <sub>control</sub>}. All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean ± standard deviation. The amount of essential oil required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity was also evaluated by the β-carotene bleaching test, which is based on spectrophotometric measurements of the β-carotene oxidation induced by the lipoperoxidation products from linoleic acid [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00055">27</a>] to determine the concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>). The essential oil (10 μL) solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 10,400–325 μg/mL was added in a 96-well microplate, together with 250 μL of a reactive solution composed by β-carotene and linoleic acid in water saturated with O
  <sub>2</sub>. Methanol (10 μL) was used as the negative control and as the positive controls, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) at concentrations between 130–4.1 μg/mL. The microplate was incubated in the dark at 45 °C and subsequently the absorbance was read at 450 nm (multi-well scanner BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA), immediately after adding the reactive solution and every 30 min for 2 h. The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the AA% = 100 − {[(Abs 
  <sub>final</sub> − Abs 
  <sub>initial</sub>) × 100]/Abs 
  <sub>control</sub>}. All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean ± standard deviation.
