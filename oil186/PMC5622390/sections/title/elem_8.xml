  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil yields for male and female 
   <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> flowers were 0.24 ± 0.01 and 0.38 ± 0.01%, respectively. The yield of leaf essential oils, both male and female, presented a yield of 0.33 ± 0.01% (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t001" href="#medicines-04-00055-t001">Table 1</a>). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifty compounds were identified from all essential oils analyzed, comprising 96–98% of the total components. The major compounds for all 
   <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> essential oils were sabinene, curzerene, and carotol. Leaf essential oils presented mostly monoterpenes (53% ♂ and 55% ♀), followed by sesquiterpenes (39% ♂ and 41% ♀), and phenylpropanoids (2% ♀ and 5% ♂). Flower essential oils presented monoterpenes (54% ♀ and 45% ♂), sesquiterpenes (40% ♂ and 50% ♀), and phenylpropanoids (1% ♂ and 2% ♀). The leaf main constituents were sabinene (16%), β-pinene (5%), 1,8-cineole (3–7%), methyl eugenol (2–5%), curzerene (17–18%), and carotol (6%), while flowers presented sabinene (8–10%), α-phellandrene (1–8%), 1,8-cineole (2–7%), germacrene D (4–6%), curzerene (11%), and carotol (9%) as major compounds.

   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t001" href="#medicines-04-00055-t001">Table 1</a> generated a plot, which condensed scores and loadings of the first two components, PC1 and PC2, which explain 61% and 34% of total variance (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f001" href="#medicines-04-00055-f001">Figure 1</a>). Leaves presented higher amounts of sabinene and curzerene than flowers, while flowers presented higher amounts of carotol, as discriminated by PCA (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f001" href="#medicines-04-00055-f001">Figure 1</a>). Furthermore, PCA analysis showed that female flowers and leaves presented higher amounts of 1,8-cineole than the male counterparts (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils of 
   <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> presented clear inhibition zones corresponding to antifungal activity in the limit of detection against 
   <span class="italic">Cladosporium cladosporioides</span> and

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f002" href="#medicines-04-00055-f002">Figure 2</a>). Female flowers presented the strongest activity for both fungi from 200 μg until 25 μg of essential oil tested, but the other oils presented weaker inhibition, up to 50 μg against 
   <span class="italic">C. sphaerospermum</span> and to 25 μg against

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After TLC elution of the most active oils, two inhibition bands, at retention factors (R

   <sub>f</sub> 0.12 was composed by a complex mixture, with predominance of α-terpineol, α-eudesmol, and ferula lactone I (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f004" href="#medicines-04-00055-f004">Figure 4</a>) in different proportions, not allowing to point only one single active compound, as presented in
