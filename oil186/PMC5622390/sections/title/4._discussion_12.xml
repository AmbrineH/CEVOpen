 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there were previous studies on the essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> leaves, none of them discriminated among male and female plants [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00055">18</a>,

  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00055">28</a>] and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report with flower essential oils. In our study, the essential oil yields were similar for flowers and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span>, with the male flowers presenting the lowest oil amounts. Regarding the leaf oil contents, the results were like those found for a Paraná State specimen (Brazil) [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00055">28</a>], collected in an area not far from Ilha do Cardoso (São Paulo State, Brazil). However, these values were lower than those found for a specimen collected in Santa Catarina State (Brazil), whose leaves yielded 0.5% (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil analysis for the Parana (Brazil) specimen was not complete, most of the oil components were not identified [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00055">28</a>]. Nonetheless, with the composition published it was possible to detect 23 common compounds with the São Paulo (Brazil) specimen, but only sabinene (7%) was a common major compound. However, for the Santa Catarina (Brazil) study were found 22 compounds in common [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00055">19</a>], having as major compounds α-terpineol (10%), curzerene (9%), pinocarvone (8%), β-thujene (7%), and carotol (6%). Curzerene (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f004" href="#medicines-04-00055-f004">Figure 4</a>A) was the only common major compound with the present analysis, but with 17–18% in the leaves and 11% in flowers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PCA plot shows that leaves have a higher percentage of sabinene and curzerene than flowers, which have a more significant amount of carotol, responsible for differentiating them. Besides that, PCA was also able to discriminate male flowers and leaves from the female ones by the 1,8-cineole abundance, which was higher in the female counterparts (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f001" href="#medicines-04-00055-f001">Figure 1</a>). These results showed that it is important to analyze separately male and female individuals, part of the variable results on the chemical composition might be explained by not separating the plant genders.

  <span class="italic">Cladosporium</span> spp. are phytopathogenic filamentous fungi usually chosen for bioautographic assays, as they present high sensitivity and permit the detection of fungitoxic substances by contrast with their dark color [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bioautography followed by TLC separation has been useful to determine antimicrobial activity of essential oils and to isolate the active compounds. A bioautography study with five aromatic plants (

  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> using High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) plates for separation of 
  <span class="italic">H. sprucei</span> essential oil. In our study, the bioautography methodology indicated curzerene as the main compound for the active band found at R

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of essential oils is already well known [
  <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00055">34</a>,
  <a rid="B35-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-medicines-04-00055">35</a>,
  <a rid="B36-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-medicines-04-00055">36</a>,
  <a rid="B37-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-medicines-04-00055">37</a>]. According to Karadag et al. [
  <a rid="B38-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-medicines-04-00055">38</a>], the antioxidant potential is related to compounds capable of protecting a biological system against the potentially harmful effect of reactive oxygen species. The results of a single-assay can give only a narrow view of the essential oil antioxidant properties. Therefore, the antioxidant potential of 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> essential oils was determined by two different mechanisms of action: DPPH free radical scavenging, that works as electron transfer, and β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, measuring the suppression of lipoperoxides. In the DPPH assay, the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for all the oils ranged from 2516.18 to 3783.49 μg/mL (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t002" href="#medicines-04-00055-t002">Table 2</a>), indicating a weak electron transfer capacity for the oils when compared to the positive controls quercetin and 
  <span class="italic">G. biloba</span> extract, that presented IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 2.5 and 13.5 μg/mL, respectively. These results are comparable to those obtained for 
  <span class="italic">Salvia tomentosa</span> Mill. essential oils [
  <a rid="B36-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-medicines-04-00055">36</a>], which was rich in β-pinene (39.7%), α-pinene (10.9%) and camphor (9.7%), and it was not considered effective as antioxidant by DPPH and β-carotene/linoleic acid assay. Similarly, the essential oils of seven 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> spp. were tested by the same methods and showed weak activities, as their composition were markedly rich in non-phenolic components [
  <a rid="B39-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-medicines-04-00055">39</a>]. The antioxidant capacity of essential oils, by the DPPH method normally, is not very high when compared with that obtained for extracts and fractions rich in phenolic compounds. The major antioxidative plant phenolic compounds known are eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, menthol, and safrole, among others [
  <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00055">34</a>]. In a test with 98 pure essential oil components for their antioxidant activity, phenols, such as thymol and carvacrol, were the most active compounds, followed by alcohols mono- and sesquiterpenes and ketones α,β-insaturated, however hydrocarbons presented very low antioxidant activity [
  <a rid="B40-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-medicines-04-00055">40</a>]. On the other hand, our results indicated that the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> were much more active in the β-carotene bleaching assay, presenting IC
  <sub>50</sub> values from 71.12 to 180.71 μg/mL (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t002" href="#medicines-04-00055-t002">Table 2</a>), indicating their ability in destroying the conjugated diene hydroperoxides, the end products of linoleic acid peroxidation. In this way, the low radical scavenging activity observed for the 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> essential oils might be explained by the low amounts of phenolic compounds present in the oil, only 1.11 to 3.63% of thymol, and the high amounts of mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t001" href="#medicines-04-00055-t001">Table 1</a>). Since antioxidant activity of the entire oil is the result of the interaction of all constituents [
  <a rid="B41-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-medicines-04-00055">41</a>], it is hard to attribute the essential oils activity to a single compound, as other oil components may contribute exhibiting synergistic or antagonistic effects [
