 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and β-carotene bleaching methods. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) were calculated and the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t003" href="#medicines-04-00055-t003">Table 3</a>. Quercetin and 
  <span class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</span> extract were employed as positive controls showing IC
  <sub>50</sub> 2.5 ± 0.09 and 13.5 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively, for DPPH assay, while butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) were the positive controls for β-carotene assay, showing IC
  <sub>50</sub> 0.08 ± 0.09 and 0.27 ± 0.02 μg/mL, respectively.
