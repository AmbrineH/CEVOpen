 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaf and flower essential oils were dominated by sabinene, 1,8-cineole, curzerene, and carotol. However, the contents of these constituents differed according to the plant part and gender.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This was the first report of antifungal activity of curzerene, explaining partially the activity of 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> essential oils by bioautography. Moreover, the complex mixture of α-terpineol, α-eudesmol, and ferula lactone I may have acted synergistically to the antifungal activity observed. Bioautography assay helped to detect antifungal fractions in a complex matrix of essential oils and guided to the isolation of target-directed constituents. Further studies are necessary to isolate higher amounts of pure curzerene, in order to test its limit of detection.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity of essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> was more effective by β-carotene discoloration assay than by DPPH assay, indicating their higher ability in quenching conjugated hydroperoxides than free radicals. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation may have been a result of the interaction of all constituents of the essential oils, since it was not possible to attribute antioxidant activity to a single compound.
