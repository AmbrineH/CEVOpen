  <sub>254</sub> silica-gel chromatoplates, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Nystatin, thymol, and cinnamic acid (5 µg) were used as positive controls. The plates were sprayed with a suspension of salts and glucose (6:1) containing fungus spores (&gt; 2 × 10

  <span class="italic">Cladosporium cladosporioides</span> and
