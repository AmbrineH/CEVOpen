  <span class="bold">Background</span>: The 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum monogynum</span> species belongs to the family Rutaceae and is found in Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast Brazil. For this genus several biological activities have been described. 
  <span class="bold">Methods</span>: The essential oil (EO) was obtained from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum monogynum</span> by hydro-distillation and was analyzed by gas chromatograph and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC and GC/MS). Also the EO of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> was evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against six tumor cell lines and for antimicrobial activity, performing disk diffusion and MIC assays with yeast and bacterial strains. 
  <span class="bold">Results</span>: The chemical analysis afforded the identification of 18 components (99.0% of the EO). The major components were found to be citronellol (43.0%) and farnesol (32.0%). The 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines, resulted in IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11–65 µg/mL against all tested cell lines. Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was also tested and oil was effective, especially against Cryptococcus sp. yeast. All the tested yeast strains showed at least 90% growth inhibition. 
  <span class="bold">Conclusions</span>: the essential oil from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> has a different qualitative and quantitative composition when compared to the composition previously described. Also this EO has significant cytotoxic activity and moderate activity against 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cereviseae</span> yeasts.
