 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding antimicrobial activity, initially, disk diffusion assays were conducted with the yeasts and bacterial strains listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001" href="#medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</a> in order to screen for antimicrobial activity. No bacterial strains were sensitive to essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span>, but the crude oil was sensitive to yeast, especially 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus</span> sp. (
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-medicines-04-00031" href="#app1-medicines-04-00031">Supplementary Table S1</a>). Since no biological activity was detected for bacterial strain in this qualitative assay, no further experiments were conducted with these microorganisms. However, the MIC test applied to the yeast species listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001" href="#medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</a> confirmed that all yeast strains were sensitive to essential oil at concentrations ranging from 0.75 (
  <span class="italic">S. cerevisae</span>) to 6.0 mg/mL (
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> sp.) with 90% growth inhibition (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several essential oils and their major constituents from medicinal plants have been reported to possess a wide range of bacterial and fungal inhibitory potentials [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00031">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00031">27</a>]. Additionally, citronellol has been described as active against

  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00031">28</a>]. However, the selectivity index (SI
  <sub>50</sub> = IC
  <sub>50</sub>/MIC) estimated for this essential oil is low, meaning that it may have low selective toxicity. In the future, this matter could be overcome by chemical modifications in the inhibitor.
