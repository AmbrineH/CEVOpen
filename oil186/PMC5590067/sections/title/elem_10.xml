  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydrodistillation of the 185.0 g of leaves resulted in 1.1 g of essential oil. Analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and calculation of Kovats indexes and comparison with the literature data [
   <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00031">18</a>] allowed for the identification of 18 compounds (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t002" href="#medicines-04-00031-t002">Table 2</a>), which represents 99.06% of the oil. The major compound is citronellol (43.03%), a monoterpenoid that is followed by the sesquiterpenoid farnesol (31.96%). Another monoterpenoid, citronellal (9.57%), was identified followed by D-germacrene (4.52%), β-pinene (2.02%), δ-elemene (1.38%), and (Z)-β-farnesene (1.20%). Together, these seven compounds correspond to 93.68% of the oil composition.

   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum,</span> from different regions, the composition of each of them is described: In one of the major compounds was the oils citronellal (57.1%), limonene (13.8%), citronellyl acetate (13.1%), and citronellol (6.2%). In the other, the main compounds were 2-undecanone (70.2%) and citronellal (22.5%). It is believed that this difference in composition might be related to the use of leaves from two chemotypes of 
   <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum monogynum</span>. Additionally, some factors can affect this difference in composition such as geographical locations, environment, and stage of maturity [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil from the leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> was evaluated for its cytotoxic activity in vitro against six tumor cell lines (B16F10, MCF-7, A2058, HeLa, HL-60, and T75). The crude oil displayed activity against all cell lines tested, with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11.0 to 65.0 µg/mL, HL60 being the most sensitive cell line to the crude oil, with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> of 11.0 μg/mL, followed by A2058 with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 34.0. Other tumor cell lines BF16F10, MCF-7, and HeLa were less sensitive with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 60.0, 65.0, and 62.0 respectively (

   <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00031">25</a>] have been described as cytotoxic against melanoma murine (BF16F10). Furthermore, several essential oils could have anticancer effects, as there is a relationship between the production of reactive oxygen species and the origin of oxidation and inflammation that can lead to cancer [

   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> showed similar or lower IC
   <sub>50</sub> values (in the case of MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines) in comparison to standard drugs (cisplatin and paclitaxel) against the tested cells, suggest that it could be further explored as a source for compounds with antitumor activity. Thus, the essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> could be considered as a source of antitumor compounds.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Antimicrobial Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding antimicrobial activity, initially, disk diffusion assays were conducted with the yeasts and bacterial strains listed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001" href="#medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</a> in order to screen for antimicrobial activity. No bacterial strains were sensitive to essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span>, but the crude oil was sensitive to yeast, especially 
   <span class="italic">Cryptococcus</span> sp. (
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-medicines-04-00031" href="#app1-medicines-04-00031">Supplementary Table S1</a>). Since no biological activity was detected for bacterial strain in this qualitative assay, no further experiments were conducted with these microorganisms. However, the MIC test applied to the yeast species listed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001" href="#medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</a> confirmed that all yeast strains were sensitive to essential oil at concentrations ranging from 0.75 (

   <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00031">28</a>]. However, the selectivity index (SI
   <sub>50</sub> = IC
   <sub>50</sub>/MIC) estimated for this essential oil is low, meaning that it may have low selective toxicity. In the future, this matter could be overcome by chemical modifications in the inhibitor.
