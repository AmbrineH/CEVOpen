 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following cell lines were obtained from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (São Paulo, Brazil): human melanoma (A2058), human leukemia (HL-60), and human breast cancer (MCF-7). The human fibroblast T75, human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell, and the melanotic (B16F10) cell line, characterized by its low immunogenicity and moderate virulence, were obtained from the Experimental Oncology Unit (UNIFESP-Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). All tumorigenic cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N2 ethanesulphonic acid (HEPES; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 24 mM sodium bicarbonate, 40 mg/L gentamicin (Hipolabor, Minas Gerais, Brazil), at pH 7.2, and 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Human T75 fibroblast was cultured in complete DEMEM medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% of FBS and 40 mg/L gentamicin. All adherent cell lines were detached from the flask by using a PBS/EDTA solution (0.02% EDTA in PBS) and subcultured for 3–5 days until achieve 80% of max confluence or prior to be used in cytotoxic assays in vitro.
