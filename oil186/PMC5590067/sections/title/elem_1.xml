  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plant material was collected in May 2013 in Itatiaia National Park, State of Rio de Janeiro. The species was identified by Dr. Marcelo Trovó (IB-UFRJ) and a voucher specimen is registered under the number MLO 601 (RB) in the herbarium (RBA) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The fresh leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> (185 g) were used to obtain the essential oil by a hydro-distillation process for 2 h at 80 °C; the residual water was removed through the addition of anhydrous sodium sulfate, which was then properly removed by a filtration procedure. An aliquot of the obtained essential oil was used for GC and GC/MS analysis.

All tumorigenic cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N2 ethanesulphonic acid (HEPES; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 24 mM sodium bicarbonate, 40 mg/L gentamicin (Hipolabor, Minas Gerais, Brazil), at pH 7.2, and 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Human T75 fibroblast was cultured in complete DEMEM medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% of FBS and 40 mg/L gentamicin. All adherent cell lines were detached from the flask by using a PBS/EDTA solution (0.02% EDTA in PBS) and subcultured for 3–5 days until achieve 80% of max confluence or prior to be used in cytotoxic assays in vitro.

   <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> essential oil, the disk diffusion method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, OPAS M2-A8) was used with some modification. Thin agar plates with 10 mL of either YPD (yeast) or LB (Gram-negative) or BHI (Gram-positive) media supplemented with 2% agar were covered with 10 mL of soft agar medium (YPD, LB, or BHI plus 1% agar) containing 100 μL of each fresh culture (adjusted to OD

After the agar was solidified, 5 mm filter paper disks sterilized and impregnated with 20 μL of crude essential oil diluted in DMSO were placed on top of agar plates and incubated at 30 °C/37 °C for 24 or 48 h depending on the microorganism. Fluconazole (1 mg) and chloramphenicol (200 μg) impregnated disks were used as positive controls for yeast and bacteria, respectively. Negative control was prepared by paper disks impregnating with DMSO at the same concentration employed to dilute the essential oil. All tests were performed in duplicates.

Briefly, MIC values were determined using micro titer plates (96 wells) in a total volume of 100.0 µL. Microorganisms were cultured in test tubes filled with 3 mL of medium (RPMI 1640 for yeast and BHI for bacteria) overnight at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (150 rpm). The cultures were diluted and adjusted to 1–2 × 10
   <span class="sup">2</span> CFU/mL using a McFarland´s scale. The CFU counts and viability was confirmed by viability counts on YPD and BHI plates (100.0 µL of diluted cells). Crude essential oil and reference standards were serial diluted (two-fold) and added to each well. A negative control containing medium only and growth control containing cell, DMSO (10.0 µL), or saline (10.0 µL) and Tween 80 were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Depending on the microorganism, the micro titer plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 24 or 48 h. Microorganism growth was determined by reading the absorbance at 530 nm in a plate reader (Logen, MT-960, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), and the minimum inhibitory concentration was considered the lowest concentration at which at least 80% of growth was inhibited. All tests were performed in triplicate.
