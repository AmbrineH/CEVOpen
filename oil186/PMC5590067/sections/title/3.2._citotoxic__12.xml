 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> was evaluated for its cytotoxic activity in vitro against six tumor cell lines (B16F10, MCF-7, A2058, HeLa, HL-60, and T75). The crude oil displayed activity against all cell lines tested, with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11.0 to 65.0 µg/mL, HL60 being the most sensitive cell line to the crude oil, with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 11.0 μg/mL, followed by A2058 with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 34.0. Other tumor cell lines BF16F10, MCF-7, and HeLa were less sensitive with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 60.0, 65.0, and 62.0 respectively (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a previous study concerning the cytotoxic activity of essential oil of another species of 
  <span class="italic">Zathoxylum</span> (
  <span class="italic">Z. fagara</span>), whose major constituent was citronellol (26%), was evaluated against MDAMB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma), Hs 578T (human breast ductal carcinoma), and 5637 (human primary bladdercarcinoma) cells. Neither the essential oil itself nor its major compounds exhibited notable cytotoxic activity against these cell lines [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the effects of essential oils have been investigated against diverse tumor cells such as glioblastoma, melanoma, leukemia, and oral cancers, as well as colon, kidney, and others [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00031">23</a>]. Additionally essential oils from

  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00031">24</a>] and

  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00031">25</a>] have been described as cytotoxic against melanoma murine (BF16F10). Furthermore, several essential oils could have anticancer effects, as there is a relationship between the production of reactive oxygen species and the origin of oxidation and inflammation that can lead to cancer [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results presented here, where the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> showed similar or lower IC
  <sub>50</sub> values (in the case of MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines) in comparison to standard drugs (cisplatin and paclitaxel) against the tested cells, suggest that it could be further explored as a source for compounds with antitumor activity. Thus, the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> could be considered as a source of antitumor compounds.
