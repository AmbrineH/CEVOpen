 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil was analyzed by GC (Shimadzu®, Kyoto, Japan) on a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus (FID detector) (Shimadzu®, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) (Agilent® J&amp;W GC Columns, Santa Clara, CA, USA). GC-MS analysis were performed on a mass spectrometer GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu®, Kyoto, Japan) at 70 eV with a DB-5 column (same as above). Oven temperature programmed from 60 °C to 246 °C at 3 °C min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. For the injection (split 1:20), 5.0 μL of the essential oil were diluted in 500.0 μL of dichloromethane, and 1.0 μL of this diluted solution was injected. Identification of volatile constituents was made on the basis of their Kovats indexes (K.I.) and their mass spectra, which were compared with reference data [
