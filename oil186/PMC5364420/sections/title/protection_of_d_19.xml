 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of samples to protect supercoiled pBR322 plasmid against AAPH was measured according to the method described by Zhang and Omaye with some modifications
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Intact pBR322 plasmid (0.5 μg) was mixed with various concentrations of samples and 2 μL of 25 mM AAPH in PBS (pH 7.4), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the samples were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide, photos of DNA bands were taken under gel image analysis system.
