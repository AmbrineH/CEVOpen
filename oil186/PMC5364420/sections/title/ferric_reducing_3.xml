  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figure 1</a> showed that the reducing power of essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes was in a concentration-dependent manner and increased with the concentration, and the absorbance value significantly increased from 0.15 at 200 μg/mL to 0.74 at 1000 μg/mL. These results suggested that the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes could result in reducing Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span>/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form (Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>), and had a remarkable potency to donate electron to reactive free radicals, transforming them into more stable non-reactive species and terminating the free radical chain reaction.
