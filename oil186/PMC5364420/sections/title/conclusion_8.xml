 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, results from the present study indicated that the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes possessed an excellent antioxidant activity, as evidenced by 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. The essential oil exhibited the protective effect against DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span> and AAPH, respectively. Moreover the essential oil also showed cytotoxic effects on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line and antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens. This study may provide biological evidence for the practical application of the 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes essential oil in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, further investigation of its activity 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, is necessary to elaborate and exploit this promise. Moreover, further studies should also include the molecular mechanism of the biological activity of the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes.
