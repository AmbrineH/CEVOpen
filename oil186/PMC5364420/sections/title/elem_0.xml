  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The light yellow essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation of dried 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes with a yield of 0.83% (v/w). The chemical compositions of essential oil were analyzed by GC-MS and the result was presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>. In total, 30 components were identified, representing 94.7% of the total amount. The α-cyperone (38.46%), cyperene (12.84%) and α-selinene (11.66%) was found to be the major components in the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes, followed by β-caryophyllene oxide (4.33%), (d)-limonene (3.62%), α-calacorene (3.14%), and γ-muurolene (3.13%), besides, other components (0.13–1.58%) were found to be lower content in the essential oil in the present study (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). The profile obtained in the present study was very similar to the previous results reported by Liu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. who found that α-cyperone (29.38%), cyperene (13.97%), caryophyllene oxide (6.71%) and β-selinene (6.47%) were the major compounds in the essential oil from Zhejiang province in China
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. Aghassi 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. reported that cyperene (37.9%) and cyperotundone (11.2%) were the major components from oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> grown in Iran
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>. The rhizome oils of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> from Tunisia were reported to have cyperotundone (19.7%), cyperene (15.2%), mustakone (5.8%), caryophyllene oxide (2.6%), rotundene (3.6%) and eudesma 5-en-11-α-ol (2.6%)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>. Lawal and Oyedeji reported that there was an obvious difference in components of essential oil between two different locations both in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Province of South Africa
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. These differences in components and its content of essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizome may be concerned in the chemotypes
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>, geographical region
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, extracts methods
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> and analysis methods
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> of essential oil. According to previous research results that the volatile compounds of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> has been divided into four types four chemotypes (H-, K-, M-, O-types)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>, the essential oil in the present study should belong to the M-type because it mainly contained α-cyperone, cyperene, caryophyllene oxide, and β-selinene.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scavenging activity of essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes on DPPH and ABTS radicals is shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>. The EC
   <sub>50</sub> values of essential oil on DPPH and ABTS radicals were 75.0 and 36.1 μg/mL, respectively. The scavenging activity of essential oil on DPPH radicals was far lower than that of Trolox (EC
   <sub>50</sub> was 13.1 μg/mL), however, its scavenging activity on ABTS radicals was significantly higher than Trolox (EC
   <sub>50</sub> was 84.7 μg/mL). These differences in data between DPPH and ABTS assays were likely due to different experimental conditions. Similarly, essential oil showed a concentration-dependent scavenging of the DPPH and ABTS radicals at certain concentrations, indicating the antioxidant activity of essential oil may be mediated through direct trapping of the free radicals through transfers of hydrogen or electron
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. In previous studies, Kilani 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a> reported the antioxidant activity of essential oil determined by DPPH assay and superoxide anion-generating system, showing an inhibition percentage of 40% on DPPH radical at 0.1 mg/mL of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oil; while Essaidi 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> also reported its antioxidant activity determined by DPPH assay and β-carotene bleaching test, indicating an inhibition percentage of 20% on DPPH radical and a dose-dependent effect. Unfortunately, they did not further determine the EC
   <sub>50</sub> value of essential oil on DPPH radicals. In the present study, the scavenging rate was 57.6% at 0.1 mg/mL of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oil on DPPH radicals (no shown). This difference in scavenging percentage could be explained by difference in the chemical composition and experimental conditions.

   <span class="sup">2+</span>), and had a remarkable potency to donate electron to reactive free radicals, transforming them into more stable non-reactive species and terminating the free radical chain reaction.

   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes on DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
   <span class="sup">2+</span> and AAPH were evaluated and the results are shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, lane 1) was prone to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals or peroxyl radicals generated by AAPH, which resulted in the formation of open circular (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, lane 2). From the gel analysis, similar results were found in protective effect assay of DNA from oxidative damage of Fe
   <span class="sup">2+</span> and AAPH. The essential oil showed effective and concentration dependent reduction in the formation of nicked DNA and increased super coiled form of DNA. In concentration range from 20 to 100 μg/mL, the protective effects of the essential oil against DNA damage induced by Fe
   <span class="sup">2+</span> and AAPH increased rapidly from 5.5% to 41.5% and from 10.4% to 58.0%, respectively. However, no significant change was found with the increase of concentration. These findings showed that the essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes owned a higher potential to prevent DNA damage. Nonetheless, essential oil exhibited stronger protection effects of DNA oxidative damage induced by AAPH than Fe
   <span class="sup">2+</span>, which may come from different determination method
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. The results of DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
   <span class="sup">2+</span> indicated that the essential oil might prevent the Fenton’s reaction, and or it probably quenched hydroxyl radicals by donating hydrogen-atom or electron
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, while the other showed that the essential oil had the scavenging activity on peroxyl radicals generated by AAPH.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>. In view of this, SH-SY5Y cells were selected to investigate the cytotoxicity of essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes. The relationship between concentration of essential oil and their cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by MTT and LDH release assays. Compared with untreated control cells, no significant change in the viability of SH-SY5Y cells was found when the concentration at 50–150 μg/mL. However, a significant decrease in cell viability and LDH leakage was observed above 150 μg/mL 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oil treatment (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Kilani 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. reported that the ethyl acetate extracts of 
   <span class="italic">Cyperus rotundus</span> suppressed growth and proliferation of L1210 cells derived from murine lymphoblastic leukaemia by MTT assay
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>. Hemanth Kumar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. also reported the cytotoxic activities of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> extracts in cell culture SH-SY5Y cells
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>. Kilani 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. suggested that 
   <span class="italic">Cyperus rotundus</span> essential oil from Tunisia was very effective against L1210 leukaemia cells line by MTT assay
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>. These results supported the present study. The MTT assay determines cytotoxicity based on the mitochondrial damage of the cells, while LDH assay determines the cytotoxicity based on the plasma membrane damage of the cells. The present study indicated that 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oil had a higher cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells and the cytotoxic effect increased with a higher dosage in a certain concentration range. The cytotoxic activity of 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oil may be attributed to the presence of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and monterpenens. Besides, the presence of antioxidants in the active 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> may play some roles in reducing cell number because reactive oxygen radicals play an important role in carcinogenesis

The results showed that the essential oil had a satisfactory antibacterial activity on all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The ZOI values of the essential oil were in the range of 10.5–24.4 mm for all tested bacterial strains, respectively. The MIC and MBC values for tested bacterial strains were in the range of 10–40 mg/mL and 20–40 mg/mL, respectively. Unfortunately, the MIC and MBC values of the essential oil for 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> have not been gained when the concentration of essential oil reached the maximum in method system tested. Of these bacteria, the essential oil performed both a minimum MIC of 10 mg/mL and a minimum MBC of 20 mg/mL against 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>, which indicated it was the most effective bacterial inhibitor and bactericide against 
   <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>. On the whole, the Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive than the Gram-negative ones to the essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, which was likely due to the significant differences in the outer layers of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
