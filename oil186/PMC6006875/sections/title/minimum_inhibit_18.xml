 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the antifungal action the essential oil was established, the research was continued to determine the MIC/MFC using serial dilution method. Serial dilution method for determination of MIC and MFC of the herbal oils have been implemented by Chitwood[
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>] and Johnson (2008)[
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>] and it was found to be satisfactory to use in laboratories. Furthermore, according to the NCCLS standards, it is an efficient method to evaluate MIC/MFC of the antifungal agents.[
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>] In the present study, the MIC of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was found to be 0.024% and MFC was observed as 0.097% [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>] when it was tested against Candida. In a study by Manohar 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.,[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] the authors showed that 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> can be fungicidal on 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> from mice with a MIC of 0.125% and MFC of 0.25%. In their study, they also observed that a daily dose of 1.0 Î¼l of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> oil for 30 days can cure systemic candidiasis in mice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared the MIC/MFC of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> with existing value for fluconazole (0.25%)[
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a>] and it was observed that the MIC/MFC of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> (0.024% and 0.097%) was much lower. The MIC of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> (0.024%) which was determined in our study is in par with a study carried out by Hammer 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.,[
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>] wherein it was found to be 0.03% against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>. In a study by Xu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.,[
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a>] MIC of fluconazole was found to be 125 times more in azole-resistant 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> than in susceptible 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>. The present experimental herb 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> showed much lesser MIC/MFC as compared to fluconazole indicating that the herb can be effective even in a lower dose of MIC/MFC. In a comparative study by Lambert 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.,[
  <a rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref39">39</a>] they also observed that 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> had a total inhibitory effect on the pathogens involved. However, their study was against bacteria and not the fungi affecting human beings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the MIC/MFC results obtained in the present study with earlier studies available may not be reliable, as the composition of the essential oil used in the present study could be different from those used in the previous studies. It is known that the composition of an essential oil can vary according to the local climatic and environmental situations and the time of harvesting the herb.[
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">40</a>
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">41</a>] Furthermore, there are no comparable studies on effect of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> on human oral isolates from denture stomatitis patients, as the present study is the first of its kind in the literature.
