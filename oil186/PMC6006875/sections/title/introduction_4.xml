 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fungal pathosis caused by different 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species results in localized and/or systemic lesions. In the oral infections, among various strains, 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> is often found in abundance in the lesions.[

  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>] Factors such as imbalanced diet, prolonged usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressant medications and wearing of an ill-fitting, and poorly maintained oral prosthesis, can promote the conversion of these oral commensals into potential pathogens. Overgrowth of these pathogens on the oral mucous membranes can lead to Candida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS).[

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most antifungal agents currently available for the treatment of CADS have several drawbacks. Some antifungal agents have been found to be toxic on long-term application required to resolve the condition.[
  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>] Furthermore, the fungi develop resistance to these drugs due to their inherent adaptive qualities such as formation of biofilms, expression of different genes, development of efflux pumps, or persistor cells.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herbal plants have a long history of being used as culinary flavoring agents and as medicines for different ailments in human beings.[
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>] Several plants have been found to possess antifungal properties against 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span>-related pathosis in the urine, blood, and stools.[

  <span class="italic">Origanum vulgare</span> is an herbal plant that has been used as food flavoring agent in many countries [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>]. It has strong antiseptic and antimicrobial activity due to the presence of carvacrol and thymol, both phenolic compounds which directly inhibit germination and hyphal formation in 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span>. Its antifungal actions have been found to be similar to nystatin and amphotericin B. A study in mice has shown to cure systemic candidiasis on a daily oral administration of 1.0 Î¼l of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> essential oil for 30 days.[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] In human beings, the antifungal activities of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> have been studied against the 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> isolated from sources of various systemic conditions.[
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>] However, no study is available in the literature that has explored its possible anti-candidal activity against oral isolates of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> that cause CADS.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was chosen to characterize its antifungal effects on oral isolates of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> from a denture wearer with CADS. The organisms were collected from the patients affected with CADS. The essential oil was extracted from the leaves of the plant, and the antifungal activity was confirmed using well diffusion method against 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species. The efficacy of two extraction methods, hydrodistillation and maceration, was compared. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the herb were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The active functional group in the experimental herb was identified as a compound similar to carvacrol through infrared (IR) spectroscopy method.
