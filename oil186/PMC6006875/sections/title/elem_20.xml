 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, effect of the antifungal agent 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was carried out on three oral isolates of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> from denture wearers affected with CADS. Characterization of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was carried out with respect to its antifungal activity, essential oil extraction methods, MIC/MFC, and the active functional ingredients present in it. Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that:

    <p>
     <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> is anti-candidal in nature against oral isolates of 
     <span class="italic">Candida</span> in CADS
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Antifungal effect of essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation is more than the effects of extracts obtained through maceration</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>MIC and MFC of 
     <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> for oral 
     <span class="italic">Candida</span> are 0.024% and 0.097%, respectively, and were much lower than that of fluconazole

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>The major functional unit in 
     <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> is similar to carvacrol, which is a proven antifungal compound.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this preliminary investigation, 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was found to be possessing high anti-candidal properties against the tested oral isolates of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp. However, the authors suggest further in-depth research into this novel herb before it can be considered for therapeutic purposes in the oral cavity.
