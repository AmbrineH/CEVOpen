 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytotherapy employs fully characterized active ingredients extracted from plants for the treatment and prevention of many diseases.</p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils and their components exhibit various biological activities and are also used for human disease prevention and treatment. They exert antiviral, antidiabetic, antimicrobial and cancer suppressive activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>], furthermore they play a key role in cardiovascular diseases prevention including atherosclerosis and thrombosis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today aromatherapy, a branch of phytotherapy, is gaining momentum as complementary therapy to the traditional medicine [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Aromatherapy uses essential oils via inhalation or massage as the main therapeutic agents to treat several diseases. The inhalation of volatile aromatic substances extracted from plants can affect the mood and state of health of the person by inducing psychological and physical effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. The transdermal and transmucosal application of essential oils also concerns the phytotherapy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, some papers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] have tried to give scientific value to the aromatherapy, traditionally based on empirical observations and evaluations also poorly stringent, by establishing criteria similar to those that support the rigorous scientific research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. It has been verified in fact, which among hundreds of papers related to aromatherapy inhalation only a few are scientifically significant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to use the essential oil appropriately it is important knowing its chemical compositions and characteristics. It seems clear, however, that if the essential oils are delivered by inhalation, the determination of gas phase (or headspace) composition above the liquid essential oil sample becomes critical [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The migration of volatile molecules into the headspace phase does not just depend on their volatility but also on their affinity for the liquid phase sample; volatile compounds relative concentrations between the two phases will reach an equilibrium value. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of each volatile component in the headspace vapor will be equivalent to the vapor pressure that is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase. In essence, the concentration of a compound in the headspace is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase and can be affected by temperature, respective volumes of the sample and the headspace, and other factors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Thus, headspace phase composition can be very different from that of the liquid phase.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the years specific studies designed to identify an analysis procedure for the determination of headspace gas at equilibrium with liquid essential oil have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. These works are mostly based on the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) by which the headspace gas is extracted by a fused silica fiber coated with a suitable stationary phase (HS-SPME) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. The volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber are then thermally desorbed in the GC injector port of a GC–MS instrument to perform the qualitative analysis and GC–FID for the quantitative determination [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the composition of volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber is different from that of headspace gas in equilibrium with the essential oil since the adsorption on the fiber depends on the fiber characteristics and extraction conditions used for the analysis. Therefore, this procedure is not sufficient to define the actual composition of the vapor phase in equilibrium with the essential oil, and hence poorly applicable to the study of aromatherapy.</p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergamot (
  <span class="italic">Citrus bergamia</span>) is an endemic plant of the Calabria region in the south of Italy and its fruit is used for the extraction of bergamot essential oil (BEO). Bergamot essential oil is the basic component of perfumes and is also used in the formulation of cosmetic products, food and confections as a flavouring.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The therapeutical applications of Bergamot essential oil are related to its antiseptic, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Of particular interest is also the composition of bergamot juice and albedo because of the presence of molecules with important biological and pharmacological activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Furthermore, it is employed in aromatherapy as an antidepressant to reduce anxiety and stress by improving mood and facilitating sleep induction [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The determination of headspace composition in bergamot essential oil is extremely useful in aromatherapy. Nevertheless, greater efforts are still needed to develop a simple and objective methodology.</p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present work, we studied the composition of the gaseous phase at equilibrium with the liquid phase of bergamot essential oil by developing a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method useful for the determination of the volatile aroma components.</p>
