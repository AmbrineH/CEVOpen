 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggest that the determination of the gaseous phase composition in equilibrium with the liquid essential oil is critical for establishing the correlation between the volatile components and their activity.</p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that for employing bergamot essential oil in aromatherapy it is not enough to know the essential oil composition but is extremely important to know the volatile fraction composition in equilibrium with it.</p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper reports a GCâ€“MS methodology for the direct analysis of volatile compounds of bergamot essential oil.</p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The method can also be applied to environments of greater volume provided that the parameters relating to temperature are maintained and that there exist conditions whereby the vapor phase is in equilibrium with the essential oil.</p>
 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The developed method is quite general and can be applied to other vegetable matrices.</p>
