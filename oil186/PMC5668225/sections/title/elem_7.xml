  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three aliquots of the essential oil bergamot (55, 95 and 147 mg), containing anisole (0.1 mL) as internal standard, were diluted to 5 mL with diethyl ether and then subjected to the quantitative analysis. Quantitative data were obtained by comparing the analyte/anisole area ratios in the standard solutions with the corresponding ratios in the oil samples solutions.</p>

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the quantitative analysis of β-pinene limonene, γ-terpinene, linalool, linalyl acetate, five stock solutions A were prepared using 150 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 5 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions A were further used to prepare diluted working solutions B. In particular, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.3 and 1.5 mL of each stock solution A, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 5 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions B were 0.6, 1.2, 3, 6, 7.8, 9.6 mg/mL respectively.</p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the quantitative analysis of α-pinene, α-phellandrene, α-terpinene, p-cimene, terpinolene, myrcene, ocimene, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, α-terpineol, octyl acetate, caryophyllene, thirteen stock solutions C were prepared as follows: 50 mg of each analyte was diluted to 100 mL with diethyl ether. Aliquots of these solutions C were then used to prepare diluted working solutions D. In particular, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.7 and 2.5 mL of each analyte, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 5 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions D were 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.13, 0.17, 0.21 mg/mL.</p>
