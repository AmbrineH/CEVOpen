 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pulsed electric field extraction significantly increases the extraction yield and decreased the extraction time because it can increase mass transfer during extraction by destroying membrane structures. The effectiveness of PEF treatment depends on several parameters including field strength, specific energy input, pulse number and treatment temperature. PEF extraction is a non-thermal method and minimizes the degradation of the thermolabile compounds.</p>
 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hou et al. obtained the highest yield of the ginsenosides (12.69 mg/g) by PEF using the conditions of 20 kV/cm electric field intensity, 6000 Hz frequency, 70% ethanol–water solution, and 150 l/h velocity. The yield of the ginsenosides of the PEF extraction method is higher than those of MAE, heat reflux extraction, UAE and PLE. The entire PEF extraction process took less than 1 s and much less than the other tested methods [
