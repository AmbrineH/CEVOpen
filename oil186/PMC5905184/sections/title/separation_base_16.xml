 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adsorption column chromatography is widely used for the separation of natural products, especially in the initial separation stage, due to its simplicity, high capacity and low cost of adsorbents such as silica gel and macroporous resins. The separation is based on the differences between the adsorption affinities of the natural products for the surface of the adsorbents. The selection of adsorbents (stationary phase) as well as the mobile phase is crucial to achieve good separation of natural products, maximize the recovery of target compounds and avoid the irreversible adsorption of target compounds onto the adsorbents.</p>
 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Silica gel is the most widely used adsorbent in phytochemical investigation. It was estimated that nearly 90% of phytochemical separation (preparative scale) was based on silica gel. Silica gel is a polar absorbent with silanol groups. Molecules are retained by the silica gel through hydrogen bonds and dipole–dipole interactions. Thus, polar natural products are retained longer in silica gel columns than nonpolar ones. Sometimes, certain polar natural products might undergo irreversible chemisorption. The deactivation of silica gel by adding water before use or using a water-containing mobile phase will weaken the adsorption. Severe tailing may occur when separating alkaloids on silica gel, and the addition of a small amount of ammonia or organic amines such as triethylamine may reduce the tailing. Twelve alkaloids belonging to the methyl chanofruticosinate group including six new alkaloids, prunifolines A–F (

 <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alumina (aluminum oxide) is a strong polar adsorbent used in the separation of natural products especially in the separation of alkaloids. The strong positive field of Al
  <span class="sup">3+</span> and the basic sites in alumina affecting easily polarized compounds lead to the adsorption on alumina that is different from that on silica gel. The application of alumina in the separation of natural products has decreased significantly in recent years because it can catalyze dehydration, decomposition or isomerization during separation. Zhang and Su reported a chromatographic protocol using basic alumina to separate taxol (
  <span class="bold">74</span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11</a>) from the extract of 
  <span class="italic">Taxus cuspidate</span> callus cultures and found the recovery of taxol was more than 160%. They found that the increase of taxol came from the isomerization of 7-
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-taxol (
  <span class="bold">75</span>) catalyzed by alumina. It was also found that a small amount of taxol could be decomposed to baccatin III (
  <span class="bold">76</span>) and 10-deacetylbaccatin III (
  <span class="bold">77</span>) in the alumina column [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Further investigation into the separation of taxol on acidic, neutral and basic alumina indicated that the Lewis souci and the basic activity cores on the surface of alumina induced the isomerization of 7-
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-taxol to taxol [

 <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The structures of polyamides used in chromatography contain both acryl and amide groups. Hydrophobic and/or hydrogen bond interaction will occur in polyamide column chromatography depending on the composition of the mobile phase. When polar solvents such as aqueous solvents are used as the mobile phase, the polyamides act as the non-polar stationary phase and the chromatography behavior is similar to reversed-phase chromatography. In the contrast, the polyamides act as the polar stationary phase and the chromatography behavior is similar to normal phase chromatography. Polyamide column chromatography is a conventional tool for the separation of natural polyphenols including anthraquinones, phenolic acids and flavonoids, whose mechanisms are ascribed to hydrogen bond formation between polyamide absorbents, mobile phase and target compounds. Gao et al. studied the chromatography behavior of polyphenols including phenolic acids and flavonoids on polyamide column. It was found that the polyamide functioned as a hydrogen bond acceptor, and the numbers of phenolic hydroxyls and their positions in the molecule affected the strength of adsorption [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. In addition to polyphenols, the separation of other types of natural products by polyamide column chromatography were also reported. The total saponins of Kuqingcha can be enriched by polyamide column chromatography, which significantly reduced the systolic pressure of SHR rat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol in a gradient as the eluent, the seven major isoquinoline alkaloids in Coptidis Rhizoma including berberine (
  <span class="bold">39</span>), coptisine (
  <span class="bold">40</span>), palmatine (
  <span class="bold">41</span>), jatrorrhizine (

  <span class="bold">80</span>, Fig.

 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adsorptive macroporous resins are polymer adsorbents with macroporous structures but without ion exchange groups that can selectively adsorb almost any type of natural products. They have been widely used either as a standalone system, or as part of a pretreatment process for removing impurities or enriching target compounds due to their advantages, which include high adsorptive capacity, relatively low cost, easy regeneration and easy scale-up. The adsorptive mechanisms of adsorptive macroporous resins include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, complex formation and size-sieving actions between the resins and the natural products in solution. Surface area, pore diameter and polarity are the key factors affecting the capacity of the resins [

  <span class="italic">S</span>)-protopanaxatriol saponins (PTS) (

  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11</a>) are known as two major bioactive components in the root of 
  <span class="italic">Panax notoginseng</span>. PTS and PDS were successfully separated with 30 and 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanol solutions from the D101 macroporous resin column, respectively. The chromatography behaviors of PDS and PTS were close to reversed-phase chromatography when comparing the chromatographic profiles of macroporous resin column chromatography to the HPLC chromatogram on a Zorbax SB-C
  <sub>18</sub> column [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Recently, Meng et al. obtained the total saponins of Panacis Japonici Rhizoma (PJRS) using D101 macroporous resin. The contents of the four major saponins, chikusetsusaponins V (
  <span class="bold">55</span>), IV (
  <span class="bold">56</span>) and IVa 
  <span class="bold">(57</span>), and pseudoginsenoside RT1 (
  <span class="bold">58</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>), in the obtained PJRS was more than 73%. The PJRS served as the standard reference for quality control of Panacis Japonici Rhizoma [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Some researchers assumed that the principal adsorptive mechanism between macroporous resins and polyphenols was associated with the hydrogen bonding formation between the oxygen atom of the ether bond of the resin and the hydrogen atom of phenolic hydroxyl group of the phenol. The hydrogen bonding interaction force was significantly affected by the pH value of the solution [

 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Silver nitrate is another useful solid support in the separation of natural products. Those natural products containing the π electrons reversibly interact with silver ions to form polar complexes. The greater the number of double bonds or aromaticity of the natural product, the stronger the complexation forms. Silver nitrate is typically impregnated on silica gel (SNIS) or alumina for separation. Several research groups reported the separation of fatty acids on SNIS [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Wang et al. reported the isolation of zingiberene from ginger oleoresin by SNIS column chromatography [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. A pair of isomers, brasiliensic acid (
  <span class="bold">83</span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11</a>) and isobrasiliensic acid (
  <span class="bold">84</span>), were separated from 
  <span class="italic">Calophyllum brasiliense</span> by Lemos et al. on an SNIS column [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Some research groups also applied silver nitrate in the two-phase system in high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) to improve the separation. Xanthochymol (
  <span class="bold">85</span>) and guttiferone E (
  <span class="bold">86</span>) are a pair of π bond benzophenone isomers from 
  <span class="italic">Garcinia xanthochymus</span> by AgNO
  <sub>3</sub>-HSCCC. The elution order of the π bond isomers in this AgNO
  <sub>3</sub>-HSCCC separation is internal π bond (earlier) &lt; terminal, which is identical to that observed from SNIS column chromatography [
