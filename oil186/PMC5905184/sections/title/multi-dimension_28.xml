 <p id="Par95" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The components in the extract subjected to separation were complex, and generally, no pure compound will be separated in one column chromatography. Multi-dimensional separation based on the solid phase extraction and coupling of multiple columns with different stationary phases greatly improves the separation efficiency. With more commercial multiple dimensional separation equipment entering the market, the separation of natural products is becoming more rapid, efficient and automated.</p>
 <p id="Par96" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Usually, the target compound was enriched by first dimensional separation and purified by last dimensional separation. Multi-dimensional separation can be achieved using the same type separation equipment (LC or GC) or different types of equipment (GC and LC). A novel volatile compound, (2

  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-methyl-6-(4-methylcyclohex-3-enylidene)hept-2-enal (
  <span class="bold">154</span>), was purified by a three-dimensional prep-GC from wampee essential oil [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>]. Five antioxidant compounds, including two alkaloids [glusodichotomine AK (
  <span class="bold">155</span>) and glusodichotomine B (
  <span class="bold">156</span>)] and three flavonoids [tricin (
  <span class="bold">157</span>), homoeriodictyol (
  <span class="bold">158</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig21">21</a>), and luteolin (
  <span class="bold">3</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>)], were separated using a two-dimensional HPLC (RP/HILIC) method from 
  <span class="italic">Arenaria kansuensis</span> on a RP-C18HCE and a NP-XAmide preparative columns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>]. Sciarrone et al. exploited the separation of sesquiterpenes in patchouli essential oil by three dimensional Prep-GC. Patchouli alcohol (
  <span class="bold">111</span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig12">12</a>) (496 μg) was separated in the first dimension on a poly(5% diphenyl/95% dimethylsiloxane) column, and 295 μg of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-bulnesene (
  <span class="bold">159</span>) was from a second column coated with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol as well as 160 μg 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-guaiene (
  <span class="bold">160</span>) from the third dimension on an ionic-liquid based column (SLB-IL60) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">105</a>]. Pantò et al. applied two three-dimensional approaches (GC–GC–GC and LC–GC–GC) to separate the sesquiterpene alcohols [(

  <span class="italic">α</span>-santalol (
