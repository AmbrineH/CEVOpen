 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microwaves generate heat by interacting with polar compounds such as water and some organic components in the plant matrix following the ionic conduction and dipole rotation mechanisms. The transfers of heat and mass are in the same direction in MAE, which generates a synergistic effect to accelerate extraction and improve extraction yield. The application of MAE provides many advantages, such as increasing the extract yield, decreasing the thermal degradation and selective heating of vegetal material. MAE is also regraded as a green technology because it reduces the usage of organic solvent. There are two types of MAE methods: solvent-free extraction (usually for volatile compounds) and solvent extraction (usually for non-volatile compounds) [

  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>) from the TCM Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix (the rhizome and radix of 
  <span class="italic">Polygonum cuspidatum</span>) by orthogonal experiment. An extraction yield of 1.76% of resveratrol was obtained from the optimized conditions as follows: extraction time 7 min, 80% ethanol, ratio of liquid to solid 25:1 (ml:g), microwave power 1.5 kw [

  <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> Mill. seeds at atmospheric pressure without any addition of solvent or water. The yield and aromatic profile in the enhanced solvent-free MAE extract was similar to those extracted by hydro distillation and cost only one-sixth of the time of hydro distillation [
