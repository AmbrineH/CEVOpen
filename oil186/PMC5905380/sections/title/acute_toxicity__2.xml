 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bioassays were conducted using field-collected samples of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> from Peoria, IL. 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> egg rafts were collected using ovitraps baited with grass infusion prepared by fermenting approximately 500 g of fresh grass clippings in 160 liters of tap water for 5 d (
  <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">Reiter 1986</a>). Egg rafts from multiple locations were hatched individually in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water held in tripour beakers and supplemented with 0.1 g of Tetramin fish food (Spectrum Brands Inc., Blacksburg, VA). The containers were maintained at 26°C, 70% relative humidity, and 10:14 light: dark cycle. At first instar stage, a single larva from each container was identified either as 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> based on the presence of a clear scale anterior to the sclerotized egg-breaker which is lacking in 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> but present in 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Crabtree et al. 1995</a>). The species identity was further confirmed at the third instar stage based on the arrangement and morphology of setae on the siphon. For each species, late third instar larvae from all locations were pooled for use in bioassays.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty late third instar larvae of either 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> were added into 120 ml of DI water held in 400-ml tripour beakers. Treatments included garlic essential oil, asafoetida essential oil purchased from New Directions Aromatics (Mississauga, Ontario Canada), a combination of the two essential oils, and allyl disulfide (≥80%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which was one of the major constituents of garlic essential oil and a minor constituent of asafoetida essential oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The two essential oils were extracted through steam distillation of bulbs (garlic) and stem and roots (asafoetida) originating from India. Each treatment was tested at 10 concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 ppm. A control group received 20 µl of absolute ethanol without oil treatment. The stock solution for each essential oil (100,000 ppm) was prepared by mixing 900 µl of absolute ethanol with 100 µl of the target essential oil. The stock solution for oil combination treatment was prepared by mixing 50 µl garlic essential oil with 50 µl of asafoetida essential oil and 900 µl of absolute ethanol. The experiment was replicated three times for a total of 246 containers. The containers were held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle and the total number of larvae surviving 24 h post-treatment were counted and recorded.
