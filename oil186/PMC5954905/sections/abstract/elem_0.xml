  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantium</span> L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as bitter orange, possesses multiple therapeutic potentials. These biological credentials include anticancer, antianxiety, antiobesity, antibacterial, antioxidant, pesticidal, and antidiabetic activities. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> was reported to display marked pharmacological effects and great variation in chemical composition depending on growing locations but mostly contained limonene, linalool, and 
  <span class="italic">Î²</span>-myrcene. Phytochemically, 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> is rich in 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine, an alkaloid, and many health-giving secondary metabolites such as flavonoids. Animal studies have demonstrated a low affinity of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine for adrenergic receptors and an even lower affinity in human models. The present review focuses on the different biological activities of the 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> in animal and human models in the form of extract and its pure secondary metabolites. Finally, it is concluded that both the extract and isolated compounds have no unwanted effects in human at therapeutic doses and, therefore, can confidently be used in various dietary formulations.
