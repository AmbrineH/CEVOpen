 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> investigations on the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peels and its isolated component limonene have demonstrated their pest fumigant activity against 
  <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> (silverleaf whitefly). In 24 h exposure, insect mortality between 41.00 and 47.67% was determined at 2.5 and 20.0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air concentrations. In the same study, the authors conducted another assay, investigating the anticholinesterase effect of the oil itself, as well as that of the pure compound. Both exerted anticholinesterase effect with the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 2.94 mM and 3.54 mM, respectively [
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>–
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">76</a>]. Other studies investigated the larvicidal effect of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> against 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles labranchiae</span>. After 24 h, the mortality counts were carried out, and LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values were determined. The outcome of this study demonstrated that the essential oils exerted significant larvicidal potential. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil was found to be the most active by the LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values of 22.64 mg/L and 83.77 mg/L, respectively [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>, 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">77</a>]. The essential oil extract from the fresh peeled ripe fruit of 
  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantium</span> showed also good larvicidal effect against mosquito vector 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</span> (LC
  <sub>50</sub> values, 31.20 ppm) The main constituent of the leaf oil was limonene (94.81).
