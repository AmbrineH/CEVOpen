 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several reports have been cited in literature regarding the antidiabetic effects of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> [
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>–
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. An 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> study was performed to evaluate the antidiabetic effect and to reveal the toxicity profile of the aqueous extract of the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> and the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Rauwolfia vomitoria</span>. In this study, NMRI lean mice (6-week-old) and C57BL/6J lean mice (6- or 11-week-old) were used. A single dose, which corresponds to seventy-fold of a human daily dose, was detected to be nontoxic to the animals. A significant weight loss was determined when the dosage, which corresponds to tenfold of a human daily dose, was administered to C57BL/KsBom-
  <span class="italic">db</span> (
  <span class="italic">db</span>/
  <span class="italic">db</span>) genetic diabetic mice for 6 weeks. These mice were maintained on the carbohydrate-deficient diet during the treatment period. The food intake was not significantly different from the control group animals; however, the serum triglyceride levels of the treated animals were significantly higher suggesting the lipid mobilization from internal stores. The fatty acid levels of the eyes of the treated mice remarkably reduced along with stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity [

  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine on liver metabolism was evaluated. In order to measure catabolic and anabolic pathways, an isolated perfused rat liver was used. Both the extract and the compound were found to enhance glycolysis, glycogenolysis, oxygen uptake, and perfusion pressure. 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-Synephrine increased the glucose output at 200 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>M concentration. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract enhanced gluconeogenesis at low concentrations, however, inhibited at high concentrations. The effects of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract on liver metabolism was found to be similar to those of adrenergic agents, and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine could be responsible from the activity [
