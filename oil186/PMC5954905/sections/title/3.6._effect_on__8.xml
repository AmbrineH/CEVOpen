 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antimicrobial activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> was investigated by using several 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> assays [
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">70</a>–
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>]. For instance, Karabıyıklı et al. [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>] explored the antimicrobial action of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> juice against 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella enterica</span> Typhimurium and 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes.</span> For this purpose, both neutralized and unneutralized juice samples with various concentrations were tested for the inoculation of the microorganisms at 4°C and 37°C temperatures, during a period of seven days. The results showed that 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella enterica</span> Typhimurium and 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> not only survived but also grown for two days in neutralized juice at 37°C. On the other hand, on day 7, none of them survived. The results also revealed that 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> was less resistant than 
  <span class="italic">S. enterica</span> Typhimurium. The low pH of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> juice was suggested to be responsible for its antimicrobial potential along with the duration of the incubation period as well as the temperature [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. In another research, the antimicrobial potential of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> was investigated, and high antimicrobial activity was recorded against 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (among 12 microorganisms tested), with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 2.7 mg/mL and 4.8 mg/mL. Moderate effects were detected against 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Mucor ramannianus</span> with the values of 9.2 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL, respectively. In the same study, radical scavenging and antibacterial effects of the essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> were evaluated. Weak antioxidant effect was detected against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) radicals [
