   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> investigations on the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peels and its isolated component limonene have demonstrated their pest fumigant activity against 
   <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> (silverleaf whitefly). In 24 h exposure, insect mortality between 41.00 and 47.67% was determined at 2.5 and 20.0 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air concentrations. In the same study, the authors conducted another assay, investigating the anticholinesterase effect of the oil itself, as well as that of the pure compound. Both exerted anticholinesterase effect with the IC

   <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>–

   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> against 
   <span class="italic">Anopheles labranchiae</span>. After 24 h, the mortality counts were carried out, and LC

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DPPH, ABTS, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays were used for the determination of the antioxidant potential of the macerate of the albedo layers of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> fruits obtained by protopectinase-SE (produced by 
   <span class="italic">Geotrichum klebahnii</span> and hydrolyzed selectively the intercellular protopectin of plant tissues). Moreover, the levels of total phenols, reducing sugars, vitamin C, total flavonones, naringin, and galacturonic acid and total acidity were detected. Antioxidant activity, vitamin C, and total flavonone levels were found to be the highest with the greatest degree of tissue maceration [

   <span class="italic">In vivo</span> and 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> antioxidant activities of polysaccharide fractions from 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> were evaluated. The most active fraction was subjected to ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatography to obtain four purified polysaccharides. Upon the evaluation of their antioxidant effect, it was found that

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by Lagha-Benamrouche et al. [
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">84</a>], the antioxidant potentials of the peels and leaves of seven orange varieties obtained from Algeria were investigated by linoleic acid and 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene oxidation assays. The presence of phenolic compounds was also investigated. 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> cv. Bigarade was found to have the highest phenol level. The antioxidant activity assay was in accordance with the phytochemical findings.

   <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">79</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peel and juice were suggested as a new potential source of natural antioxidants; although, they were found to be less effective than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and ascorbic acid, used as antioxidant standards [

Inhibition of proinflammatory mediators by blocking nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ƘB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages was assessed [
   <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">89</a>]. The flavonoids were found to have the capacity to suppress the mRNA and protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS, by clarifying their anti-inflammatory action [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the effect of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil and its main compound limonene on gastric mucosa, Moraes et al. [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>] conducted a study 
   <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. The essential oil and its compound limonene were found to possess protective activity in the gastrointestinal system against lesions, which were induced by ethanol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in rats, at doses of 250 mg/kg and 245 mg/kg, respectively. The essential oil and limonene increased the production of gastric mucus. The findings revealed that 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil and its main compound limonene can be used as a promising target for the development of a novel gastroprotective drug [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. In another study, the gastroprotective effect of 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-myrcene, a monoterpene-type compound of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>, was evaluated. Experimental models of ulcer, induced by ethanol, NSAID stress, 
   <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span>, ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R), and cysteamine (a drug used to treat cystinosis) was used to assess the ameliorative activity. 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-Myrcene was administered at dose of 7.5 mg/kg. The results showed a potential role for 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-myrcene against peptic ulcer disease. 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-Myrcene contributed to the maintenance of integrity of the gastric mucosa with a significant decrease of ulcerative lesions, attenuating lipid peroxidative damage and preventing depletion of GSH, GR, and GPx [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polo et al. confirmed the healing properties of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, Hamdan et al. assessed the effects of hesperidin and neohesperidin, important flavonoid-type components of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>. For this purpose, indomethacin-induced ulcer models of rats were used. Omeprazole was administered as a reference standard for the comparison. The parameters analyzed in the present study were ulcer index, gastric cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression, TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span>, MDA, and GSH levels. Histopathalogical analysis was also performed. The findings of the study revealed that hesperidin and neohesperidin notably aggravated indomethacin-induced gastric damage as evidenced by increased ulcer index and histopathological alteration [
   <a rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93">93</a>]. Recently, hesperidin showed strong inhibition against ovarian cancer cell viability and caused apoptosis mediated through endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways [
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">94</a>]. Hafidh et al. [
   <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">95</a>] observed the potent anticancer effects of limonene in hepatocellular carcinoma and HepG2, and the cell line caused the modulation of cancer-inducing genes. These data confirmed the antioxidant and prooxidant behavior of flavonoids showing the potential benefits and adverse effects of these opposing events.
