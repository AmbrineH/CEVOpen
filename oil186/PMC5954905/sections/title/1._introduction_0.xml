  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantium</span> L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as bitter orange, is usually utilized as a flavoring and acidifying agent for food [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Besides the essential oil and its components [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>], the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> are sources of flavonoid-type compounds with diverse biological effects [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>–
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. Additionally, it was reported that flavonoid glycosides were isolated from the plant [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>] and the biogenic amine and flavanone contents have been determined [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>]. Due to the abundance of health-giving secondary metabolites, 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> is also used for the treatment of several ailments such as anxiety [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>], lung and prostate cancers [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], and gastrointestinal disorders and obesity [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Due to the prohibition of 
  <span class="italic">Ephedra sinica</span> Stapf. in Farw.-containing weight loss products in the market, 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> has found an important place as a preferable agent to replace ephedra, as it contains 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine, a phenylethanolamine type alkaloid, which is chemically similar to adrenergic agents, as appetite suppressants [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>–
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. Recently, several scientific studies investigating the potential effects of various parts (including flowers, fruits, and essential oils) of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> have been conducted [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>–
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last years, phytopharmaceuticals have shown an outstanding role in new drug discovery [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>–
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Both in the crude form as well as pure chemical entities, a large population around the globe are getting therapeutic benefits from them [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>–
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. In this review article, we have aimed to overview the bioactivity studies performed on 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> revealing its therapeutic potential in the light of isolated molecules and/or essential oils.
