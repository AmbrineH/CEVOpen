    <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin. (A,C) The fly retains most of the cuticle, some of the internal soft tissues (black arrows) and bubbles within the body margin are small. (B,D) The fly retains some cuticle; there is a gap between resin and cuticle (white arrows) and extensive, and large bubbles. Internal soft tissue is absent. Instead the body margins are filled with a medium of the same density as the resin (compare the areas indicated by black circles) and which connects to the resin (black arrow), indicating that this is resin, not soft tissues. In the drawings (C,D), orange represents resin, white represents cuticle, grey represents internal soft tissue, and red represents bubbles. Scale bars = 1 mm.

All flies in this treatment group showed ruptured abdomens and internal bubbles and, some (n = 10) show a gap (ranging from 5 to 50 Î¼m) between the remaining cuticle and the resin, presumably as a result either of tissues shrinking as the fly dehydrates in the resin, or resin shrinkage due to the loss of volatiles (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Retention of internal tissues and the presence of bubbles were the decay features that were most significantly different between the flies embedded in different resins (p-values = 1.5E-08 for internal tissue preservation, and 4.1E-04, for bubble presence). Flies in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin were significantly more likely to have internal bubbles and to lack internal soft tissue preservation, indicating that decay proceeds more quickly in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin than in 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resin type influences decay.
