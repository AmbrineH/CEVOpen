 <p>Synchrotron tomographic images (A,B) and drawings (C,D) of flies in resin showing state of decay after 18 months entombment in (A) 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin, and in (B) 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin. (A,C) The fly retains most of the cuticle, some of the internal soft tissues (black arrows) and bubbles within the body margin are small. (B,D) The fly retains some cuticle; there is a gap between resin and cuticle (white arrows) and extensive, and large bubbles. Internal soft tissue is absent. Instead the body margins are filled with a medium of the same density as the resin (compare the areas indicated by black circles) and which connects to the resin (black arrow), indicating that this is resin, not soft tissues. In the drawings (C,D), orange represents resin, white represents cuticle, grey represents internal soft tissue, and red represents bubbles. Scale bars = 1 mm.
