 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fossil assemblages in amber provide a unique and exceptionally-well preserved record of small, soft-bodied organisms that are not typically preserved through other mechanisms of fossilization [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>]. The importance of this fossil reserve is best illustrated in what it has revealed about the evolutionary history of insects: for example, it provides evidence for macroevolutionary patterns such as a mid-Cretaceous transition between two major insect evolutionary faunas, which corresponds with the gymnosperm-angiosperm shift [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>]. Furthermore, preservation fidelity in amber is such that insects retain micron-scale morphological details allowing for accurate comparative anatomical studies with extant taxa: many fossil insects preserved in amber can be confidently placed into modern taxonomic groups on this basis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the fossil record in amber is subject to bias, which may limit and distort the extent to which the fossil assemblage represents the living assemblage. There are two components to this bias: entrapment bias, which involves the non-random patterns by which organisms become engulfed in resin; and preservation bias, effectively the non-random patterns by which entrapped organisms decay or fossilize. To date research effort has focused on entrapment into the resin [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref008">8</a>], and a number of variables such as resin viscosity, insect behaviour and habitat and plant defences have been found to be influential [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>]. For example, fossil assemblages in amber favour the preservation of small, terrestrial inclusions, because these are most easily entrapped in resin flows [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref004">4</a>]. Subsequent to entrapment and entombment in resin it has been suggested that essentially all organisms are preserved [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>]. However, recent advances in 3D scanning techniques have revealed a cryptic and surprising variability of preservation quality of internal anatomy, even where external preservation quality is close-to “life-like”. The variation ranges from internally complete fossils, retaining minute details of the most decay-prone tissues, through to fossils preserving only the most decay resistant features, to some which are hollow moulds. This indicates that decay and preservation biases are operating once carcasses are entombed in resin [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref010">10</a>]. Such bias may responsible for some of the patterns in the amber fossil record that cannot be explained by entrapment; for example, the occurrence of non-fossiliferous amber sites [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>], and taxa whose overrepresentation in amber (for example ants in some Cenozoic amber) cannot easily be explained by their behaviour [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>]. The assessment of the ecological completeness of amber fossil assemblages requires understanding of bias in the preservation process of insects, as well as entrapment bias.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use actualistic taphonomic experiments to determine whether decay and preservation potential of insects in amber, and therefore bias in the amber fossil record, is affected by 
  <span class="italic">i</span>. resin-type; 
  <span class="italic">ii</span>. dehydration prior to entombment; and, 
  <span class="italic">iii</span>. the composition of the gut microbiota.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variables to account for insect preservation fidelity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both resin type and the degree of dehydration of partially-entrapped insects prior to their full entombment have been suggested to affect preservation quality in amber [
   <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0195482.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref011">11</a>], which is why we test these variables here. We add the gut microbiome as an addition variable in our experiments for two reasons: first, in sediment-hosted exceptionally-preserved fossils it has been demonstrated to be an important control in decay and/or preservation [
   <a rid="pone.0195482.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref012">12</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0195482.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref018">18</a>]; and second, wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiota between populations [
   <a rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref019">19</a>].

    <p>Resin type: Resin—including modern resin, subfossil copal, and fossil amber—exhibits extensive chemical and physical variation [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref020">20</a>–
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref023">23</a>] and the preservation of fossils in amber—both presence/absence of complete taxa and their preservational quality—varies between the major amber chemical groups [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>]. Thus, resin properties (physical and chemical) are likely to exert a significant control on fossil preservation in amber. Physically, resin acts as a barrier to infiltration by external decay agents such as scavengers, fungi, and bacteria [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref002">2</a>]; variations in physical properties such as permeability and viscosity may influence the effectiveness of the physical barrier. But it is the chemistry of the resin which is thought to be critical for exceptional preservation of fossils in amber [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref024">24</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref025">25</a>], influencing decay by acting as an antiseptic, inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth and dehydrating the tissues [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref025">25</a>–
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref027">27</a>]. The major amber chemical groups show variation in preservation quality [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>]; there is generally better preservation in Class D amber (e.g. Dominican amber, with 93% of specimens preserving internal soft tissues) than in Class A amber (e.g. French Charentes amber with 0% of specimens preserving internal soft tissues [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>]). However, this broad pattern is complicated by preservational variation within the major amber chemical groups, (e.g. Lebanese amber, which is in Class A, has exceptional preservation reminiscent of a typical Class D amber [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref009">9</a>]). To date the influence of resin chemistry on decay has not been experimentally investigated. The only experiment designed to test the role of the entombing medium in preservation encased flies in wax and maple syrup, and compared them to a fly left in air [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref024">24</a>]. Wax and maple syrup are chemically very distinct, but are not good proxies for tree resin in a number of ways including, significantly their chemistry. However, this experiment did show enhanced decay in wax and decreased decay in maple syrup compared to the control [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref024">24</a>], suggesting that the chemical composition of the entombment media is more important than the physical barrier provided through entombment.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Dehydration prior to entombment: It has been suggested that dehydration of the carcass prior to entombment will result in better preservation of the resulting fossil inclusion, and may particularly promote the preservation of labile internal tissues [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref011">11</a>]. This scenario may occur if, for example, an insect is stuck on the surface of a resin flow, dies and subsequently dehydrates in air prior to another flow entombing it.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Gut microbiota: Microbes are central to exceptional preservation of soft-bodied animals in sediments; their action on organically-composed anatomy may result in its loss through decay, or its preservation by mediation of authigenic mineral replacement [
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref028">28</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref029">29</a>]. Microbes may be exogenous or endogenous, and the latter are likely to be more important in amber preservation because once entombed an organism is protected from exogenous bacteria[
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref001">1</a>, 
     <a rid="pone.0195482.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref024">24</a>]. We focus here on the gut microbiota as they are known to be abundant and important in preservation [
