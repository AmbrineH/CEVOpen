 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conceived to determine the phytochemical characterization, and antioxidant activity of celery 
  <span class="italic">(Apium graveolens)</span> seed essential oils. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils (EO) of celery seed were isolated by hydrodistillation technique, using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The phytochemical characterization was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated in vitro by two assays namely Free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Fe2
  <span class="sup">+</span> chelating activity. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained results showed that the main components detected in celery seed oils were Citronellol (β-sélinène) (35.93%), Epiglobulol (31.36%) and Limonene (7.55%). The two antioxidant assays showed that these oils have a very important antioxidant power confirmed by its richness in polyphenols and flavonoids. Our study suggests that celery seed essential oils have the potential to be used as a natural food preservative.</p>
