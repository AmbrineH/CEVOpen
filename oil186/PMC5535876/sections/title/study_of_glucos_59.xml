 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study of Glucose and Lipid Lowering Activity of Mentha Suaveolens Ehrh. In Normal and Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</span> Ehrh. is an aromatic and medicinal plant from Lamiacea family. This plant has many food and medicinal uses including diabetes management. The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of the aqueous extract of aerial part of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</span> Ehrh (AEAPMS) on blood glucose levels and the plasma lipid profile. Blood glucose and plasma lipid levels were followed after both single and repeated (15 days of treatment) AEAPMS (20 mg/Kg) oral administration in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, preliminary phytochemical screening, quantification of phenolic and flavonoid contents as well as histopathological examination of pancreas and liver were carried out. The results showed that AEAPMS exhibited a significant glucose and lipid (Total cholesterol and triglycerides) lowering activity in both normal and diabetic rats. However, no significant effect was observed on serum lipoproteins (HDL and LDL). Moreover, AEAPMS seems to act positively on histopathological tissues of liver and pancreas. The phytochemical analysis of AEAPMS showed that the main phytochemical constituents of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</span> are alkaloids, polyphenols, flavonoids, cyanidins, tannins, glucosides, saponins, quinones, anthraquinones, mucilage, sterols, sesquiterpenes, reducing sugars, carbohydrates and terpenoids. On another hand, a potential in vitro antioxidant of AEAPMS has been shown. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the study demonstrates that AEAPMS possesses a beneficial effect on glucose and lipid metabolism. This effect might be mediated through the amelioration of the liver and pancreas function. </p>
