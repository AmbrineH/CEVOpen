  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan Oil-Enriched Nanomedicines to Enhance Both the Efficacy and Safety of Cancer Therapy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unique quality of poly-unsaturated fatty acids contained in argan oil (Argania spinosa), in addition to the abundance of active compounds (e.g., sterols, carotenoids, xanthophyls, and potent antioxidants) in the un-saponifiable fraction indicate marked potential nutritional benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. As poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have demonstrated synergism with both radio- and chemo-therapy, in solid and haematological tumors, tocopherols and saponins derived from A. spinosa exerted evident anti-proliferative effect, both in vitro and in vivo. Within past few years, the succinate ester form of α-tocopherol, 
   <span class="sc">d</span>-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), a common surfactant in various nanocarriers, has received notable attention for its pro-apoptotic activity against cancer, not normal, cells.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our recent preclinical cancer data indicate that active argan oil composition displayed cytotoxic activity, when optimally formulated in a pharmaceutical nanoemulsion (NE) platform. Enhanced inhibitory effect on the proliferation of model cancer cell lines was achieved via the incorporation of active TPGS in the emulsification of argan oil NE, suggesting a cooperative role of tocopherols along with other core active oil compounds, contributing to augmented inhibition of cancer growth.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, utilizing antioxidant argan oil NE formulations—further enriched with oxygen—radical scavengers/anti-inflammatory molecules—demonstrated superior in vitro cardio-protective activities, as well as marked reduction of H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>—and adriamycin-induced apoptotic effects. Hence, our enriched argan NEs effectively diminished oxidative and non-oxidative damage of cardiomyocytes and aortic medial cell cultures. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collectively, optimized nano-formulations of the unique components of argan oil (PUFAs, sterols, polyphenols, tocopherols and saponins) offers not only superior pharmaceutical properties but can also enhance its pharmacological activity profiles in both cancer and cardio-protective therapies.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beneficial Effects of Argan Oil on Cardiovascular Risk Factors</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Objective:</span> The present study was designed to examine the effects of argan oil on two cardiovascular risk factors notably arterial hypertension and insulin resistance as well as on the aortic basal superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase activity in one nutritional model of hypertensive and insulinoresistant rat. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Methods:</span> Sprague-Dawley rats had free access to a drinking solution containing 10% D-glucose or tap water (control) for 5 weeks. The impact of argan oil was compared to that of corn oil given daily by gavage (5 mL/kg) during 5 weeks in glucose-fed rats. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the superoxide anion production and the NADPH oxidase activity using the lucigenin method. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Results:</span> Five weeks treatment with glucose led to increases in systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance index in association with a rise in superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase activity (sensitive to diphenyleneiodonium) in the aorta. The simultaneous treatment with argan oil prevented or significantly reduced all those effects, yet the same treatment with corn oil had a positive impact only on hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Conclusions:</span> These findings demonstrate that argan oil treatment reduced the elevation in blood pressure, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance through its anti-oxidative properties in glucose-fed rats. Hence argan oil which is now available in the market as consumable food may be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of arterial hypertension and insulin resistance.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy of Argan Oil on Pain, Metabolic Syndrome and Oxidative Stress in Rheumatology and Nephrology Patients</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan Oil is produced from kernel fruit of argan tree that is endemic in Morocco. The oil is used in traditional cuisine and also in traditional medicine to treat some skin and joint pain issues. 99% of argan oil composition is made of triglycerides (45% of oleic acid and 34% of linoleic acid), whereas the remaining 1% contains very active biological compounds such as Vitamine E, Carotenoïds, Sterols and Polyphenols. The above composition of argan oil is behind the many health benefits that are described in the literature, mainly on the cardiovascular system, pain-associated osteoarthritis and other metabolic parameters. In the present work, we report data on the improvement of clinical and metabolic parameters in patients upon argan oil consumption. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Introduction:</span> (1) Argan oil consumption is known to have the following properties: Lipid lowering effect in dyslipidemic patients; (2) Prevents prothrombotic complications in patients; Antidiabetic and antihypertensive effect in animal models; (3) Modulate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in animal models 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Aim of the study:</span> To investigate the effects of argan oil consumption on pain and metabolic syndrome in knee osteoarthritis patients, and to check its effects on oxidative stress and lipid profile in hemodialysis patients.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Results:</span> As reported in the published articles below in reference’s section, consumption of argan oil during 5 to 8 weeks, resulted in:

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy of a New Pharmaceutical Formulation of Melatonin in Preventing Aging Skin Damage</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, has been detected in multiple extrapineal organ tissues at much higher concentrations than in the pineal gland. It is a potent free radical scavenger with anti-oxidant properties, which increases the expression and activity of endogenous antioxidant. This special class of antioxidant generates a series of metabolites that are also free radical scavengers when scavenging free radicals. Capable of crossing cell membranes and of easily reaching all cell compartments, it is taken up by mitochondria and can maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in different experimental models. Melatonin has also important anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, we have developed a pharmaceutical preparation of melatonin plus other molecules for the treatment and prevention of skin aging. The success of this preparation is that the composition facilitates their transdermal adsorption, reaching both molecules all skin’s layers. Moreover, the combination of both molecules increases their take up by the mitochondria in all skin cells. The advantage of our product is that not only reverse the mitochondrial damage produced during cellular aging but also in many pathologies coursing with mitochondrial impairment.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interest of Argan Oil for The Prevention of Neurodegenerative Diseases: In Vitro and In Vivo Proofs of Concept</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In major age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, certain ocular diseases (cataract, age-related macular degeneration) and neurodegenerative diseases (particularly Alzheimer’s disease), a rupture of the RedOx equilibrium is observed. This enhances the lipid peroxidation associated with aging and increases the formation of certain oxidized cholesterol derivatives, called oxysterols, especially those formed by auto-oxidation such as 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). This lipid peroxidation is also accompanied by a degradation of the unsaturated fatty acids which generate highly reactive aldehydes which can lead to the formation of carbonylated proteins whose activities are modified compared to those of the native proteins from which they are derived. This results in perturbations of cell signaling leading to several cellular dysfunctions. Furthermore, the ability of molecules derived from lipid peroxidation to stimulate oxidative stress and/or inflammation, alter cell metabolism and induce changes in DNA may result in cell death. 7KC is the oxysterol preferentially formed by auto-oxidation of cholesterol. Since 7KC is weakly metabolized (at the exception of its degradation in bile acids by liver cells), it accumulates progressively, mainly in brain cells, and may induce cytotoxic effects: oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. Its contribution to age-related diseases is therefore widely suspected. In order to prevent the cytotoxic effects of 7KC on the nerve cells of the central nervous system, one of the possibilities is to identify cytoprotective agents in order to reduce or inhibit its harmful activities. The cytoprotective agents may be either natural or synthetic molecules or mixtures of molecules such as oils. In this context, the cytoprotective properties of argan oils (Agadir, Berkane) and some of their major compounds (especially α-tocopherol) have been studied. To this end, complementary techniques of microscopy, flow cytometry and biochemistry were used. The composition of Argan oils has also been determined by different chromatography techniques. Argan oils have highly antioxidant properties even in vivo when given per os in the rat. On 158N murine oligodendrocytes, these oils are capable of attenuating the cytotoxicity of 7KC: loss of cellular adhesion, alteration of the plasma membrane, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions, overproduction of oxygen radicals, induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Overall, our findings provide several in vitro and in vivo proofs of concept that suggest that Argan oils could prevent and mitigate severe age related pathologies especially neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
