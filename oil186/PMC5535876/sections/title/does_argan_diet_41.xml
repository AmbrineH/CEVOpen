 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does Argan Dietary Uptake Reverses Memory Impairment Processes in Wistar Rats?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argania spinosa (Argan) and Baillonella toxisperma (Moabi) belong to the class of Sapotaceae. The entire tree is used in African traditional medicine, especially in the Moroccan and Cameroonian pharmacopeia. The fruits seeds of these trees are consumed as food or used as cosmetic products. Their oils are rich in Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), this component plays essential roles in brain functions, including brain plasticity and memory processes. In this context, the purpose of this work was to study the effect of PUFA supplementation on short and long term memory processes. The Acute oral toxicity studies were carried out according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline No. AOT-425 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate toxicity and to determine the minimum lethal dose of the used oils. A total of 20 adult male rats, weighed (170 ± 6) g, were randomly divided into three groups: (1) T: control groups, (2) Moa 750: groups received Moabi oil at 750 mg/kg, (3) Arg 750: groups received Argan oil at 750 mg/kg. The animals were kept under treatment for 1 month. An object recognition task was used to evaluate the short and long term memory. The Time spent exploring each object was recorded. Intact memory for the familiar object was demonstrated if the rat exhibited a “preference” for the novel object in the choice phase. A preference was indicated if the rat spent more time than chance with the novel object. The results showed that, at a dose level of 2000 mg/kg, neither mortality nor any clinical signs of toxicity were observed. The Moa750 was associated with a significant alteration in short and long term memory tested in memory tasks compared to the control rat, in contrast the administration of Argan oil into rats improved their memory impairment.</p>
