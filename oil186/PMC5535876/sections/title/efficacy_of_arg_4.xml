 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy of Argan Oil on Pain, Metabolic Syndrome and Oxidative Stress in Rheumatology and Nephrology Patients</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan Oil is produced from kernel fruit of argan tree that is endemic in Morocco. The oil is used in traditional cuisine and also in traditional medicine to treat some skin and joint pain issues. 99% of argan oil composition is made of triglycerides (45% of oleic acid and 34% of linoleic acid), whereas the remaining 1% contains very active biological compounds such as Vitamine E, Carotenoïds, Sterols and Polyphenols. The above composition of argan oil is behind the many health benefits that are described in the literature, mainly on the cardiovascular system, pain-associated osteoarthritis and other metabolic parameters. In the present work, we report data on the improvement of clinical and metabolic parameters in patients upon argan oil consumption. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Introduction:</span> (1) Argan oil consumption is known to have the following properties: Lipid lowering effect in dyslipidemic patients; (2) Prevents prothrombotic complications in patients; Antidiabetic and antihypertensive effect in animal models; (3) Modulate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in animal models 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Aim of the study:</span> To investigate the effects of argan oil consumption on pain and metabolic syndrome in knee osteoarthritis patients, and to check its effects on oxidative stress and lipid profile in hemodialysis patients.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Results:</span> As reported in the published articles below in reference’s section, consumption of argan oil during 5 to 8 weeks, resulted in:

    <span class="label">-</span>
    <p>an improvement of metabolic syndrome parameters, pain score and walking difficulties in rheumatology patients.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">-</span>
    <p>Improvement of blood lipids and atherogenic lipid ratios, as well as oxidative stress parameters in hemodialysis patients.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Conclusions:</span> (1) Argan Oil can be used as a therapeutic «green medicine» in various health issues. (2) Promotion of clinical studies on Argan Oil should help understanding more of its health benefits in other pathologies. (3) Medical investigations on Argan Oil health benefits should boost all Argan oil-related activities such as women cooperatives associations, organic farmers, and Argan Oil quality assurance.
