  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methods:</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil was extracted by hydro distillation using clevenger apparatus and was analyzed for chemical constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Larvicidal activity was recorded after 12 and 24h of post-exposure against three mosquito species, 
   <span class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span>. Dead larvae were identified when they failed to move after probing with a needle in the siphon or cervical region. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values for three mosquito larvae were calculated by Probit analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analysis revealed that essential oil contains 23 different constituents. Out of these 23 constituents, major constituents identified were n-tetracosane (39.18%), n-eicosane (30.04%), tetratriacotane (2.97%), 7-octadecanal (2.81%), and tricosane (2.31%). Essential oil from leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Coccinia grandis</span> exhibited significant larvicidal activity against 
   <span class="italic">An. stephensi</span> with LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values 39.41ppm and 123.24ppm, respectively. This was followed by 
   <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</span> with LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values of 48.20ppm, 131.84ppm and 52.80ppm, 135.48ppm, respectively after 24h of exposure.
