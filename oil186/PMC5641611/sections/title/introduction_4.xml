 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquitoes are responsible for a number of human health problems causing illness and death throughout the world in both children and adults. They are vector for many diseases such as malaria, filariasis, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and west Nile virus infection in tropical and subtropical countries (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Anupam et al. 2012</a>). Malaria is a deadly disease and globally about 3.3 billion peoples are at the risk of it. About 198 million cases of malaria and 0.58 million deaths occurred globally in 2013 (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">WHO 2014</a>). Of the six malarial vector species, 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</span> is the main mosquito vector responsible for malaria in urban areas of India (
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Senthilkumar et al. 2009</a>). Dengue fever is caused by mosquito vector species, 
  <span class="italic">Ades aegypti</span> in its epidemic areas affecting millions of people and thousands of deaths per year all over the world (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Service 1996</a>). Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> is a vector for lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, in India. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms 
  <span class="italic">Wuchereria bancrofti</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Brugia malayi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Br. timori</span> of which, first is found to be more endemic in Indian subcontinent. According to 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">WHO (2009)</a> more than 1.3 billion people spread over 72 different countries worldwide are threatened by it. Collectively, these mosquito mediated diseases are responsible for long term suffering, morbidity and high socio economic burden on society (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Ramaiah et al. 2000</a>, 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Intirach et al. 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficient control of these diseases would require a two-pronged strategy, (i) prompt treatment with effective medicines and (ii) vector control based prevention strategies. Injudicious use of medicines, particularly antimalarial drugs, has resulted in development of resistance by the malarial parasite and enhanced casualties in endemic areas (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Intirach et al. 2012</a>). Mosquito management therefore, offers a better and practical alternative for controlling diseases mediated by them. Mosquito adulticides, causing temporary reduction in population are good but do not offer a lasting solution. Mosquito larvae being delicate, less mobile and more concentrated in their natural habitat offer a much simpler and efficient point of intervention and control (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Rutledge et al. 2003</a>, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Dharmagadda et al. 2005</a>). However, there are reports of development of resistance and behavior changes in adult mosquitoes and larvae towards these chemicals (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Mittal et al. 2004</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">WHO 2006</a>). Moreover, they adversely affect the environment, causing soil, air, water pollution and harm the beneficial non target organisms (
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Dharmagadda et al. 2005</a>). Plant extract including essential oils or insecticides from botanical origin are attractive alternatives because they contain high amount of various bioactive compounds, many of which are selective and have little or no harmful effects on non-target organisms and environment (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Rutledge et al. 2003</a>, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Dharmagadda et al. 2005</a>). Essential oil is natural volatile substances found in many plants. Essential oils isolated from plant are generally a mixture of many constituents, primarily biologically active monoterpenes (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Govindrajan 2010</a>). Traditionally, they have been used for flavor enhancement in food, odorants in fragrances, pharmaceuticals and confectionary industries (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Zhu et al. 2001</a>). Of late, they have received considerable attention as potentially active, human and environment friendly bio insecticides (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Cheng et al. 2003</a>). There are several reports on larvicidal activity of essential oil from neem, basil, citronella, lemon, eucalyptus, pine etc (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Cheng et al. 2003</a>, 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Amer and Mehlhorn 2006</a>, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Dua et al. 2009</a>). The resistance against plant derived insecticides has not been reported so far (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Kannathasan et al. 2011</a>).

  <span class="italic">Coccinia grandis</span> (family Cucurbitaceae) is a unique tropical plant, commonly known as ‘little gourd’, growing abundantly and widely all over the India. It is a fast growing perennial climbing shrub with white flowers. It grows several meters long and forms dense mat that readily cover shrubs and small trees. It is well known for its hypoglycemic activity (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study was focused on the chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of 
  <span class="italic">Coccinia grandis</span> leaf essential oil against vectors of malaria (
  <span class="italic">An. stephensi</span>), dengue (
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span>) and filariasis (
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span>). To the best of our knowledge it is the first report on the larvicidal activity of 
  <span class="italic">Coccinia grandis</span> leaf essential oil against the three mosquito species.
