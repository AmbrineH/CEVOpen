 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil was extracted by hydro distillation using clevenger apparatus and was analyzed for chemical constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Larvicidal activity was recorded after 12 and 24h of post-exposure against three mosquito species, 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span>. Dead larvae were identified when they failed to move after probing with a needle in the siphon or cervical region. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values for three mosquito larvae were calculated by Probit analysis.
