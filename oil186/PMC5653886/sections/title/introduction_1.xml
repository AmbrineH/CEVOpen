 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerns regarding the safety of chemical preservatives and the negative reactions of consumers against these components have led to an increasing interest in the use of natural preservatives, such as plant EOs and probiotics.

  <span class="sup">,</span>

  </span> Some of the most considerable aspects of the functions of plant EOs are the pathogen growth inhibition, delaying food spoilage and the improvement of organoleptic quality. Using natural products as antibacterial compounds can reduce health hazards and economic losses that have been produced by foodborne microorganisms.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>
  </span> The EOs and their components are known to be active against a wide variety of microorganisms, including gram-negative
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>
  </span> and gram-positive bacteria.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>
  </span> Gram-negative bacteria are shown to be generally more resistant than gram-positive ones to the antagonistic effects of EOs because of the presence of lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among these products, lemon balm (
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinalis</span>, Lamiaceae) is a medicinal plant and used for the treatment of headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, nervousness, and rheumatism. It is an antibacterial and antifungal agent.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>
  </span> Previous studies exhibited synergistic effects of 
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinalis</span> with some preservatives like sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and sodium nitrite.

  <span class="italic">Moldavian dragonhead</span> (
  <span class="italic">Dracocephalum moldavica</span>) is also consumed commonly as a food-related product with medicinal properties; it is effective against liver and stomach disorders, headaches and congestion.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objectives of this study were (1) to study the chemical constitution of hydro-distilled EOs of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica </span>(2) to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica </span>EOs by disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution assays against 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella </span>
  <span class="italic">typhimurium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes </span>(3) to evaluate antioxidant capacity of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica </span>EOs by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-Azinobis 3-ethylbenzo thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and Î²-carotene bleaching tests and to find effective natural agents for protection against oxidation changes and pathogenic bacteria of food.
