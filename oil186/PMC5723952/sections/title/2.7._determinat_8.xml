 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flavonoid content was determined spectrophotometrically, on the basis of Al(III)-flavonoid complexes formation. Quercetin was used as the standard flavonoid, and the cited procedure was applied with little modification [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. Aliquots (0.1–0.5 mL) of the working quercetin solution (100 μg/mL) or diluted extract samples and ethanol (up to 2 mL alcoholic mixture) were introduced in a series of 5 mL-calibrated flasks. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of 10% aluminum chloride, 0.1 mL of 1M potassium acetate solutions, and water were added to each sample to make the total volume of 5 mL. The mixtures were homogenized and left aside for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the absorbance was measured at 427 nm against reagent blank (for each sample, a blank mixture was prepared, without adding AlCl
  <sub>3</sub>). The total flavonoid content of the vegetable materials was calculated in terms of quercetin equivalents per gram of dry vegetable material (mg QE/g), by applying the regression equation of the calibration curve
