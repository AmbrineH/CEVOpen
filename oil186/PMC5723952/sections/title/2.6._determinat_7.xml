  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>] was used to determine the total polyphenolic content. Aliquots (0.1–0.5 mL) of the working gallic acid solution (50 μg/mL) were put into a series of 5 mL-calibrated flasks. Then, 2.5 mL of 10% the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added. The mixtures were incubated in darkness for 5 min. Then, 2 mL of 7.8% sodium carbonate solution was added to each sample, and the total volumes were brought to 5 mL with distilled water. After homogenization, the mixtures were incubated in darkness for 30 min before measuring absorbance at 760 nm against blank solution (obtained without adding gallic acid). A standard calibration curve was prepared in the concentration range of 1–5 μg/mL gallic acid. For determination of the total phenolic content in the extracts, an aliquot of each diluted extract was used instead of gallic acid, and the F–C procedure was applied. The total phenolic content was calculated in terms of gallic acid equivalents per gram of dry vegetable material (mg GAE/g), by applying the regression equation of the calibration curve
