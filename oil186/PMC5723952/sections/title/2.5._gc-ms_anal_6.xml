 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analyses were carried out with a Thermo Electron system (Focus GC chromatograph coupled with a Polaris Q ion trap mass detector). A DB-5MS capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm of film thickness) was used with helium as carrier gas (1 mL/min). GC oven was programmed at an initial temperature of 60°C for 3 min. The temperature was increased up to 200°C at the rate of 10°C/min, kept constant for 2 min, and then increased up to 240°C at the rate of 12°C/min and held at 240°C for 2 min [

The electronic impact ionization mode was 70 eV, and the detection was performed in the range of 35–300 amu (full scan mode). The identification of the components was carried out using Xcalibur® software, NIST Mass Spectral Library, and MS literature data. Retention indices (RIs) of the compounds were determined relative to the retention times of

For GC-MS analysis, the hydrodistilled essential oil was diluted in hexane (1 : 100) and 1 µL was injected. A Triplus HS Autosampler (Thermo Electron) was used for headspace analysis, an amount of 1 g of inflorescences or leaves being introduced in a sample vial (20 mL size) and sealed with silicone rubber septum and aluminium cap. The headspace vial containing the plant material was heated to 80°C for 10 min, and 500 μL of the headspace gas was injected into the column. The GC-MS analysis was performed in the same way as for essential oils.
