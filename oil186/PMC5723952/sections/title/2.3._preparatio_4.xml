 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infusion, decoction, and maceration were applied on three aerial parts of the plant, namely, petals, seeds, and leaves. Before infusion and decoction, the weighed amount of dry vegetable material (1 g) was soaked with a small volume of cold bidistilled water and left aside for 10 min. This preliminary procedure allows the plant cells to expand and thus to release their active ingredients when preparing the infusion or decoction. The infusion was prepared by adding 50 mL of bidistilled boiled water to the wet vegetable material. The mixture was covered with a watch glass, left to stand for 15 minutes. The decoction was made by boiling the wet plant material with 50 mL of water for 10 min. After that, the mixture was left aside for 15 min. The hydroalcoholic extract was prepared by macerating 0.5 g of the vegetable material in 50 mL of 70% ethanol for 7 days, in dark, at ambient temperature. Then, each plant extract was filtered through a filter paper. The filtrate was quantitatively transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and brought to the mark with bidistilled water (in the case of infusion and decoct) and with 70% ethanol (in the case of macerate), to obtain the diluted extracts. Parts of the obtained filtrate extracts were stored at −45°C for further analyses. The essential oil was isolated from dried inflorescences, by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus, for 4 h, using a standard procedure [

  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub> and stored at +4°C. The quantity of essential oil from plant was expressed in percentage (v/w), as an average of the values obtained from five extractions.
