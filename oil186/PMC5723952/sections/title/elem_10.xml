  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Results of GC-MS Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analysis revealed that the number of volatile components of the hydrodistilled essential oil of inflorescences was different from that of the dry plant material (leaves and inflorescences) undergoing headspace extraction. 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1"> Table 1</a> shows the relative content of volatile compounds from leaves, inflorescences, and essential oil of inflorescences of 
   <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span> growing in Romania, expressed as percentage from the total area. Thus, using headspace, twenty-two compounds were identified in leaves accounting for 99.0% of the total identified components, with α-pinene (46.0%), β-phellandrene (24.6%), sabinene (9.6%), and germacrene D (6.1%) as the main components. The flowers of 
   <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span> contained thirty-three components (98.6%), with the same principal constituents, but in different percentages: α-pinene (40.1%), germacrene D (24.0%), β-phellandrene (13.9%), and sabinene (9.7%). The total number of identified components of the essential oil of inflorescences was forty-one, representing 95.9% of total areas. The same components were the main volatile compounds of the essential oil, with β-phellandrene (26.09%), germacrene D (21.6%), α-pinene (16.3%), and sabinene (12.0%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the GC-MS analysis, one can conclude that 
   <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span> is an important source of α-pinene. This hydrocarbon monoterpene is known to possess anxiolytic and sedative properties [
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. It also acts as a bronchodilator. It was reported that this terpene has the property to reduce the size of cancerous tumors [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major part of the reported studies concluded that polyphenols (flavonoids being the largest family of polyphenolic compounds) are the principal compounds responsible for the antioxidant activity of the tested plant extracts [
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2"> Table 2</a> presents the TPC and TFC of the obtained extracts (infusion, decoct, and hydroalcoholic macerate of different aerial parts of 
   <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum TPC and TFC values were obtained by maceration of the vegetable materials followed by decoction and infusion. All extraction procedures showed maximum values of TPC and TFC in petals. A comparison between infusion and decoction shows that decoction is more efficient than infusion in polyphenol extraction. This behavior could be explained as follows. Both infusion and decoction are thermal procedures suitable for extracting heat-stable compounds leading to differences in the total phenolic content of decoct and infusion. The higher concentration of the total phenolic content in decoct than in infusion, obtained by heating the water-vegetable mixture for a long time (15 min), could be explained as follows: breakdown of cellular constituents as well as hydrolysis of tannins takes place. The degradation of complex phenolic tannins as well as the enzymatic or nonenzymatic oxidation process leads to supplementary content of phenolic compounds in decoct. At the same time, during the decoction, the Maillard reaction takes place, producing new phenolic compounds [
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, comparing the three applied procedures of extraction (infusion, decoction, and maceration), maceration seems to be more efficient than infusion and decoction for extracting polyphenols (70% ethanol was chosen for maceration, being the most used solvent for extracting phenolic compounds from plants). This behavior could be caused by possible complex formation of some phenolic compounds, possessing more phenol groups or having higher molecular heights than the phenolic in water. These compounds seem to be soluble in hydroalcoholic extract. Also, the content of more nonphenol compounds, such as terpene, organic acids, sugars, and soluble proteins, in infusion than in macerate could interfere in the TPC assay. It may also be caused by the possible complex formation of some phenolic compounds in the macerate extract that are soluble in ethanol-water mixture. These phenolic compounds may possess more phenol groups or may have higher molecular weights than the phenolics in the water extract [
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. As reported, a water-alcohol mixture used in the extraction procedure leads to an increase in swelling of the plant materials, assuring an intimate contact between the plant matrix and the solvent and consequently the improvement of the extraction yield [
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. In addition, the plant materials contain a large variety of phenolic compounds having different numbers of phenolic groups with different reactivities towards the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent [
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As about flavonoids, from the data reported in the literature, the major assays for the total flavonoids content determination are generally based of the absorbance of Al(III)-flavonoids compounds [
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>–
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The difference between the two mostly applied spectrophotometric methods is the reaction medium: (a) in the presence of NaNO
   <sub>2</sub>, in alkaline medium and (b) in the presence of CH
   <sub>3</sub>COOK or CH
   <sub>3</sub>COONH
   <sub>4</sub> (without nitrite). In our work, the spectrophotometric method in the absence of nitrite was used. This last one method can be only used to determine the content of flavonols (quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, and morin) and luteolin (from flavones family) [
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. As about correlation between TPC and TFC, it was found to be significant in the case of infusion and maceration (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). On the basis of literature data, such a correlation indicates that flavonoids represent an important part of the phenols in plant extracts [
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. The results in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> show that infusions and macerates obtained from petals and leaves seem to contain significant percents of flavonoids.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. Free Radical Scavenging Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned, polyphenolic and flavonoid compounds are considered to have significant antioxidant properties mainly due to their important content in hydroxyl groups. These substances are able to act as radical scavengers because phenolic hydroxyl groups are good H-donating antioxidants, which scavenge reactive oxygen species and stop the production of new radicals. The stable DPPH· radical is often used to assess the radical scavenging activity of many biological active compounds. DPPH· has the property to accept an electron from an antioxidant. This redox reaction leads to the decrease of the violet color of the DPPH· radical. The total reaction antioxidant-DPPH· leads to a yellow-colored solution. A low EC50 value denotes a high scavenging activity. As observed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, the extracts obtained from petals present the lowest values of EC50 with a minimum in the case of macerate extract. As about relationship between EC50 and TPC values, generally, negatively linear correlations are reported in literature. But, there is not always a linear correlation between these two analytical parameters. In our study, negative linear correlations were obtained in the case of infusions and macerate extracts (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>). Cheynier et al. assumed that besides the radical scavenging, the antioxidant activities could also be attributed to other different mechanisms such as binding of transition metal ion catalysts or decomposition of peroxides [
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. At the same time, the radical scavenging activity of polyphenols depends on their molecular structure, respectively, on the availability of phenolic hydrogen and the possibility of stabilization of the resulting HO and NO radicals via hydrogen donation [
