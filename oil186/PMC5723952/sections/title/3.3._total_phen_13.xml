 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major part of the reported studies concluded that polyphenols (flavonoids being the largest family of polyphenolic compounds) are the principal compounds responsible for the antioxidant activity of the tested plant extracts [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2"> Table 2</a> presents the TPC and TFC of the obtained extracts (infusion, decoct, and hydroalcoholic macerate of different aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum TPC and TFC values were obtained by maceration of the vegetable materials followed by decoction and infusion. All extraction procedures showed maximum values of TPC and TFC in petals. A comparison between infusion and decoction shows that decoction is more efficient than infusion in polyphenol extraction. This behavior could be explained as follows. Both infusion and decoction are thermal procedures suitable for extracting heat-stable compounds leading to differences in the total phenolic content of decoct and infusion. The higher concentration of the total phenolic content in decoct than in infusion, obtained by heating the water-vegetable mixture for a long time (15 min), could be explained as follows: breakdown of cellular constituents as well as hydrolysis of tannins takes place. The degradation of complex phenolic tannins as well as the enzymatic or nonenzymatic oxidation process leads to supplementary content of phenolic compounds in decoct. At the same time, during the decoction, the Maillard reaction takes place, producing new phenolic compounds [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, comparing the three applied procedures of extraction (infusion, decoction, and maceration), maceration seems to be more efficient than infusion and decoction for extracting polyphenols (70% ethanol was chosen for maceration, being the most used solvent for extracting phenolic compounds from plants). This behavior could be caused by possible complex formation of some phenolic compounds, possessing more phenol groups or having higher molecular heights than the phenolic in water. These compounds seem to be soluble in hydroalcoholic extract. Also, the content of more nonphenol compounds, such as terpene, organic acids, sugars, and soluble proteins, in infusion than in macerate could interfere in the TPC assay. It may also be caused by the possible complex formation of some phenolic compounds in the macerate extract that are soluble in ethanol-water mixture. These phenolic compounds may possess more phenol groups or may have higher molecular weights than the phenolics in the water extract [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. As reported, a water-alcohol mixture used in the extraction procedure leads to an increase in swelling of the plant materials, assuring an intimate contact between the plant matrix and the solvent and consequently the improvement of the extraction yield [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. In addition, the plant materials contain a large variety of phenolic compounds having different numbers of phenolic groups with different reactivities towards the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As about flavonoids, from the data reported in the literature, the major assays for the total flavonoids content determination are generally based of the absorbance of Al(III)-flavonoids compounds [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>–
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The difference between the two mostly applied spectrophotometric methods is the reaction medium: (a) in the presence of NaNO
  <sub>2</sub>, in alkaline medium and (b) in the presence of CH
  <sub>3</sub>COOK or CH
  <sub>3</sub>COONH
  <sub>4</sub> (without nitrite). In our work, the spectrophotometric method in the absence of nitrite was used. This last one method can be only used to determine the content of flavonols (quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, and morin) and luteolin (from flavones family) [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. As about correlation between TPC and TFC, it was found to be significant in the case of infusion and maceration (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). On the basis of literature data, such a correlation indicates that flavonoids represent an important part of the phenols in plant extracts [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. The results in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> show that infusions and macerates obtained from petals and leaves seem to contain significant percents of flavonoids.
