 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil obtained from the medicinal and aromatic plants gained attention as a potential source in pharmaceutical and food industry due to its efficacy and safety. The volatile oils of leaf and seed kernel of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were analyzed by GC and GC-MS for its chemical composition. Isobutyl isothiocyanate was identified as a major chemical constituent in both leaf and seed kernel oil with 88.5 and 94%, respectively. Other chemical compounds in leaf oil were isopropyl isothiocyanate (10.2%), 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-butyl isothiocyanate (0.4%), and hexadecanoic acid (0.2%). Trace amount of sec-butyl isothiocyanate was also deducted in the leaf volatile oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. In seed kernel oil, 4.9% of isopropyl isothiocyanate, 0.5% of sec-butyl isothiocyanate, and 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-butyl isothiocyanate were identified. In addition, trace amount of n-tridecane, dihydro-Î±-curcumene, benzyl isothiocyanate, 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-pentadecane and hexadecanoic acid were also identified in the volatile oil of seed kernel. These compounds were not present in leaf volatile oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> except hexadecanoic acid (Afsharypuor et al., 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salehi et al. (
  <a rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120">2014</a>) studied the effect of salinity on volatile oil composition of shoot and root of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. Different levels of salinity 
  <span class="italic">viz</span>. 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 dS/m were used to treat the plants and the oil composition was examined by GC-MS. The results indicated that the salinity levels altered the quantity and composition of volatile oil. In control plants, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis (2-methyl propyl) ether was identified as the major compound (29.02%) in the shoots. But in roots, thiocyanic acid, phenylmethyl ester was the major compound. Benzyl isothiocyanate (29.6%) was identified as the major compound in the root samples of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> in all salinity levels. In shoots of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>, isobutyl isothiocyanate was identified as the major compound at 2 and 4 dS/m. Despite in other salinity levels n-butylisothiocyanate was identified as the major compound.
