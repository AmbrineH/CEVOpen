  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> is a deciduous tree belonging to the family of Moringaceae. It is a fastest growing tree among the other 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> species (Abd El-Wahab, 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1995</a>) with 3–10 m height and grayish green bark adapted to high aridity. The leaves are 30–40 cm long, alternate, obovate and deciduous. One of the unique features of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> is the falling of their leaflets when the leaves mature, leaving leaf rachises naked (Robiansyah et al., 
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">2014</a>; Olson et al., 
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2016</a>). The plant has axillary inflorescence with much branched panicle (18–30 cm long). Flowers are 10–15 mm long, hermaphrodite, zygomorphic, pentamerous, and pinkish white in color with white sepals. A single tree of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> may produce up to 1,000 pods per year and length of the pods may vary from 20 to 40 cm. Each pod contains 8–15 ovoid, un-winged, trigonous seeds (Afsharypuor et al., 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2010</a>). Another unique feature of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> is the formation of root tuber in the seedling phase (Munyanziza and Yongabi, 
  <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">2007</a>).
