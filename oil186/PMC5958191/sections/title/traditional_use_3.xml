  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaf extract is rubbed over skin to treat paralysis and skin rashes (Ghazanfar and Al-Al-Sabahi, 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">1993</a>). The pod oil is used to treat the convulsions or infantile paralysis in the northern region of Oman (Miller and Morris, 
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">1988</a>). Its seeds are most commonly used to control diabetes in Sultanate of Oman (Al-Kahtani, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">1995</a>; Reddy et al., 
  <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">2015</a>). It is also effectively used for the diabetes related symptoms such as hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in the Indian sub continent. The young leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> are used traditionally in folk medicine as antioxidant and wound healing in Arab countries. The bark juice is also used as disinfectant (Marwah et al., 
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">2007</a>) and also to treat fever, headache, constipation, back and muscle pains, slimness, burns and labor pain (Boulos, 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2000</a>; Elbatran et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2005</a>; Tahany et al., 
  <a rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135">2010</a>). The leaves are used for wound healing (Nawash and Al-Horani, 
  <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">2011</a>) and seeds are used for abdominal pain (Van der Vossen and Mkamilo, 
  <a rid="B141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B141">2007</a>). The roots and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> are mixed together with water and used to treat hypertension, malaria, asthma, stomach disorders, diabetes, and to expel a retained placenta (Mekonnen et al., 
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">1999</a>). Traditionally, the oil of this plant is used to treat skin problems such as freckles, itches, and scabies (Al-Dhaheri,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to their medicinal importance, 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> has significant nutritional importance. The young leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> can be used as a vegetable (Al-Dhaheri, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2016</a>). The immature seeds are eaten in India and mature seeds are consumed either roasted or fried in Malawi (FAO, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">1988</a>; Elbatran et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2005</a>; Afsharypuor et al., 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2010</a>). In traditional herbal medication, the seeds of the plant are mixed with other herbs and used as food for anti-malnutrition (MPCP, 
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">2006</a>). In addition, 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> is one of the important native trees in the UAE as it has cultural, spiritual, and religious connections. Locally, the leaves of the plant are used to flavor the meat during smoked meat (tanour) preparation. This traditional practice is still followed by the native people of the UAE (Al-Dhaheri, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2016</a>).
