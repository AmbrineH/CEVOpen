  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the initiation and progression of number of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, aging, and cirrhosis (Taniyama and Griendling, 
   <a rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137">2003</a>). The previous studies indicated that, extracts from plants could prevent or delay the above mentioned diseases owing to their redox properties, which allow them to act as free radical scavengers, reducing agents, and hydrogen donors (Robards et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hypertension is a cardio vascular disease and it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Various anti-hypertensive drugs have been developed for the treatment of hypertension. But the drugs showed efficacy along with associated side effects (Alamgeer et al., 
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">2017</a>). Investigations on edible and medicinal plants remain important since it has potential benefits (Kalia, 
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2005</a>). Based on the edible importance as well as the traditional uses, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was investigated on blood pressure and oxidative status in hypertensive rats induced with dexamethasone. Systolic blood pressure, thymus weight, body weight, plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration, plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power were measured after the treatment. The results of the prevention study proved that the extract of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> prevents the rise of systolic blood pressure at 400 mg/kg dose level. Whereas, the reversal study indicated that 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract failed to lower the SBP in dexamethasone induced hypertension in rats. The oral administration of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract had no significant effect on the loss of thymus weight and also the extract was botched to prevent the body weight changes. In contrast, Rouhi-Broujeni et al. (
   <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">2013</a>) reported that the hydroalcoholic extract from the seeds of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> decreased the mean body weight. In the prevention study, treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg of extract prevented the rise of H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> concentration. Whereas, in the reversal study, a dose of 400 mg/kg 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract reduced the elevated plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration. In prevention as well as reversal study, the rats administrated with 400 mg/kg of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract significantly reduced the plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power (Safaeian et al., 
   <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">2015</a>). So, the antihypertensive activity might be linked with the availability of antioxidant molecules present in 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. The antioxidant molecules showed significant role in reducing the level of blood pressure (Duarte et al., 
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">2001</a>; Jalili et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The liver is an important organ and plays vital functions in the human body by regulating many biochemical pathways (Sharma et al., 
   <a rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124">1991</a>). Hepatotoxicity caused by certain drugs/antibiotics, chemicals, microbial infections, and consumption of alcohol is a major concern. Protection of liver using medicinal plants is the best alternative and many plants were reported for anti-hepatotoxicity effect. The seed oil of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was used for its proteceive effect against doxorubicin induced hepatotoxicity in mice. The reduction in caspase-3 immunoreactivity and apoptotic index were noted in 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seed oil treated mice. Seed oil with the dose of 150 mg/kg treatment reduced the liver damage induced by doxorubicin (Sliai and Abdel-Rahman, 
   <a rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128">2016</a>). The seed oil of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was studied along with other two 
   <span class="italic">Moringa</span> species for liver tissue oxidative stress state in high fat diet induced liver damage. Hepatic marker enzymes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were analyzed after the treatment. The results indicated that glucose, total serum cholesterol, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and body weights significantly increased in the rats fed with high fat diet. The post administration of seed oil was significantly improved the liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose content (Elabd et al., 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2017</a>). The hepatoprotective effect of ethanol leaf extract of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> through oral administration showed that the extract significantly decreased the activities of serum hepatic marker enzymes. The effect of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaf extract on oxidative stress markers of acetaminophen induced hepataotoxicity showed that the administration of extract was successful in replenishing the reduced glutathione level in the liver, blood, and brain. In the meantime, the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were reduced significantly in the rats intoxicated with acetaminophen. The superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities enhanced in successful way when the 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaf extract was administrated (Azim et al., 
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2017</a>). In literature, triterpenoids have been reported as one of the most important anti-hepatotoxic agents. In the past few decades, more than 350 triterpenoids have been reported for hepatoprotective potential (Xu et al., 
   <a rid="B147" ref-type="bibr" href="#B147">2018</a>). So, structure-based investigations are advised to isolate a potent hepatoprotective agent from

   <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">2006</a>). Thus, plants with medicinal importance are the promising source of lipid lowering active molecule. Hydroalcoholic extract of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seeds were studied for lipid lowering activity on hyperlipidemic rats (Rouhi-Broujeni et al., 
   <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">2013</a>) by determining the profile of serum lipid, malondyaldehide, level of thiol, antioxidant capacity, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ferritin and atherogenic index. The results revealed that the extract of 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> significantly reduced the lipid levels such as total cholesterol of plasma, level of LDL-C and VLDL and increased the level of HDL-C in hyperlipidemic rats which is comparable with the lipid lowering activity of the control drug, atorvastatin. Also the level of thiol and carbonyl in the rats administrated with 
   <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract were same as drug treated rats. The high level of antioxidant capacity and a decreased atherogenic index were also observed in the rats treated with

   <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2011</a>). The results revealed that the aqueous and ethanol extracts significantly reduced the acute inflammation induced by fresh egg albumin. At a dose level of 300 mg/kg, aqueous and ethanol extracts reduced the inflammation by 72.96 and 81.01%, respectively at the third hour after the oedema was induced. Whereas, the control drug diclofenac at the dose level of 100 mg/kg reduced the inflammation by 100% at the third hour.

A significant cytotoxic potential was observed against all the cell lines tested and activity was dose dependent manner. One milligram of the seed oil showed the highest cytotoxic potential against the tested cell lines. Cell viability decreased to 24.65, 24.18, 42.51, 46.57, and 32.11% and the IC

Insulin was administrated intranasal were treated as positive control. The results on the memory performance showed that intranasal administration of the extract improved the functions of memory close to the positive control insulin. The subchronic administration of the extract at the dose of 25 mg/kg showed significant differences at the Zeitgeber time 3:00 on memory and learning. Whereas, subchronic administration had no significant difference on memory and learning at the Zeitgeber time 15:00. Also it was observed that, in acute administration, there was no locomotor activity observed after intranasal administration of single dose of
