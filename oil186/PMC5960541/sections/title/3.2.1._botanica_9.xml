 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a large annual plant, 1 to 2 meters high, hairy and rough, with strong odor. The stem is erect and simple. The leaves are opposite, petiolate, and palmatised, made of 5 to 7 segments toothed and acute. The flowers are green, insignificant in appearance, and dioecious [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sown in May and harvested in September hemp is an excellent rotating head. Thanks to its deep and much branched roots, it improves the soil structure, increases the water capacity of the soil, and protects it from hydromorphy. Sown last among spring crops, hemp grows very rapidly from 2.5 meters to 3.5 meters between May and September.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruit (chennevis) is an ovoid achene. Examined under the microscope, the sheet shows on both sides numerous hairs, 1 cell, with smooth wall and curved end. Some have a bulge at the base, due to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals (cystoliths); they overlap each other like fish scales. The secretory hairs, rare in the case of the leaves, are more numerous on the bracts of the female inflorescence: multicelled pluricellular hairs often detached from its globular 8-16-cell head [
