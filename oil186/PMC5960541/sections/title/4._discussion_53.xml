 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plant poisoning affects all regions of Morocco, with a difference in number or percentage, which can be explained by the nature of the vegetation present in each region, as well as the climate that plays an important role in the proliferation of these plants. And It does not spare any age group (newborn, infant, walker, child, teenager, adult, and senior).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1980 to 2013, the region of Casablanca recorded the maximum frequency of poisoning with a population of 1119 cases followed by the Meknès-Tafilalt region with 760 cases. These intoxications occurred in urban areas in 82% of cases and 18% in rural areas; the majority of intoxications occurred at home with 50.2%.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2015, the most represented region was Chaouia-Ouardigha 19.9%, followed by Rabat-Salé-Zemmour-Zaer 18.6% and then Meknès-Tafilalt 15.5% and Fès-Boulemane 10.6%. These intoxications occurred especially in urban areas 54.4%.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most effective way to manage plant poisoning begins with the identification of the plant and its toxic potential. Identification is made by scientific name, common name, common vernacular names, and knowledge of environmental factors that modulate plant toxicity (growth, harvest season, and climate).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In hospitals, the precise questioning on the circumstances of intoxication makes it possible to evaluate intoxication and the delay between the ingestion of the plant and the medical consultation remains determining to save the life of a patient in state of intoxication. Finally, the toxicity must be studied for all plants, even wild plants and indoor plants, parks, and gardens that can be dangerous.</p>
