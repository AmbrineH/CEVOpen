  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Castor is a dioecious, herbaceous, or arboreal species, annual or perennial depending on climatic conditions. The branching stem bears large palm-lobed leaves (5 to 12 lobes), saw-toothed, the petiole, and the underside, which are, in some varieties, purple in color. All flowers are in clusters of cymes, males with numerous stamens with branched fillet and females with tricarpel ovaries and long reddish styles. The fruit is a euphorbia capsule bristling with spikes. The seed usually has a smooth, shiny integument, usually marbled with red, black, or brown. With a fleshy prominence, the caruncle extends the upper extremity; it leaves a prominent line, clearly visible on the ventral side [

Morocco also once had large castor plantations whose seeds were exported to Europe for the manufacture of airplane oils and synthetic textiles. These plantations have now disappeared, but the harvests of seeds on the wild plant continue for export [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Castor seeds contain about 50–70% of an oil, a triglyceride whose fatty acid chains are composed of almost 90% ricinoleic acid, which is remarkable consistency. Oleic and linoleic acids are the other two significant compounds, although present in much smaller quantities: they represent, respectively, about 4 and 3% of the fatty acid chains. The other very minor compounds are palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, which each represent less than 1%. It is noted that pure ricin is not available [
