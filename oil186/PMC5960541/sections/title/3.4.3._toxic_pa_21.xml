 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids like hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and atropine. Because of their pharmaceutical importance, they have been studied in detail by biochemists [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of alkaloids contained in different parts of the plant varies according to the age, the climate, and the region. The plant retains its toxicity after desiccation [
