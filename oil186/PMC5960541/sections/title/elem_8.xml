  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a large annual plant, 1 to 2 meters high, hairy and rough, with strong odor. The stem is erect and simple. The leaves are opposite, petiolate, and palmatised, made of 5 to 7 segments toothed and acute. The flowers are green, insignificant in appearance, and dioecious [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The male flowers are gathered in panicles and the female flowers are grouped into compact cymes mixed with leafy bracts. The fruit is an ovoid achene [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sown in May and harvested in September hemp is an excellent rotating head. Thanks to its deep and much branched roots, it improves the soil structure, increases the water capacity of the soil, and protects it from hydromorphy. Sown last among spring crops, hemp grows very rapidly from 2.5 meters to 3.5 meters between May and September.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruit (chennevis) is an ovoid achene. Examined under the microscope, the sheet shows on both sides numerous hairs, 1 cell, with smooth wall and curved end. Some have a bulge at the base, due to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals (cystoliths); they overlap each other like fish scales. The secretory hairs, rare in the case of the leaves, are more numerous on the bracts of the female inflorescence: multicelled pluricellular hairs often detached from its globular 8-16-cell head [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cannabis, one of the most common drugs on the illicit market, is grown all over the world and increasingly in local production in European countries, the United States, and Canada. Its resin form (hashish) is produced in about 60 countries and its main sources are North Africa and the countries of Southwest Asia [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographical distribution of this plant is very wide, since it can adapt to all environments. This plasticity is accompanied by variations in the general habit of the plant as well as changes in the chemical composition and in the pharmacological activity. This notion of ecological adaptation today leads to a great diversification of the species [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plant contains toxins; the most important ones of them are tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol. This is why it belongs to the category of toxic plants of therapeutic interest.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During acute intoxication, the initial phase is characterized by a period of mild euphoria and well-being and then a period of mental confusion with hallucinations and hate attacks that can lead the addiction in the worst attacks. Deadly poisoning remains exceptional [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">(1) Active Ingredient</span>. Nearly sixty natural cannabinoids have been identified in the plant. They are non-nitrogen phenol derivatives of benzopyran. The main ones are cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol, Δ9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Δ8-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC), and Δ8- and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acids.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main psychoactive component of cannabis is THC, a major psychodysleptic, more active in its levorotatory form.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to cannabinoids, cannabis smoke contains many other substances: carbon monoxide, phenols, acrolein, acetaldehyde, toluene, vinyl chloride, cresols, cyanides, acetone, ammonia, benzopyrene, benzanthracene, dimethylnitrosamine, methylethylnitrosamine, and so on, which also exhibit toxicity.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">(2) Chemical Structure</span>. CBD has the same chemical formula and molecular weight as THC (C
   <sub>21</sub>H
   <sub>30</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>, 314.46 g/mol), although its molecular structure is slightly different (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Like THC and most other lipids, CBD is hydrophobic and lipophilic, which means that it does not dissolve in water and cannot be converted into an aqueous emulsion but dissolves in the fat (as well as in most organic solvents such as butane and alcohol).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an acid medium, CBD is cyclized (it forms a new carbon ring) to become THC. In an alkaline medium (in the presence of water), CBD is oxidized to become cannabidiol-hydroxyquinone, which has been the subject of few studies to date but may have an inhibitory effect on liver enzymes (liver) that are vital for the metabolism of ingested drugs.</p>
