  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a dioecious tree, with aromatic evergreen leaves and small yellow flowers in clusters. It can reach a dozen meters high and be centenarian. Only females bear fruit. The tree bears fruit after 8 years and can continue producing for more than 60 years. The ripe fruits are picked at the time of the dehiscence of the pericarp.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruit is an ovoid capsule. It includes a thick, fleshy pericarp, which is eaten once confit, and a seed. The seed is surrounded by a laced aril, which gives the spice called mace. It has a thick integument and lignified shell. Nutmeg can be marketed in shell, or in albumen removed from its hull. This albumen is ruminated, which gives the many curved lines that we see in section. In the kitchen, it is used as a spice.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nutmeg is a tree producing nutmeg and is a tropical tree native to the Banda Islands in the Maluku archipelago in Indonesia and is now grown in various tropical climate regions, including the West Indies and Grenada. Production reaches 30 to 40% of world production [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is formerly known since fragments of nutmeg had been found in some sarcophagi of ancient Egypt. After the discovery of the Indian route, the Arabs introduced it to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th century in Europe.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All parts of the plant are toxic, a toxicity that varies depending on the part used (mace, essential oil, etc.), dose, and individual sensitivity.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In small doses, nutmeg and mace are safe (in medical or culinary use). But, in excessive doses, they are hallucinogenic and toxic.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consuming two whole nuts can be fatal; myristicin is the substance responsible toxicity and hallucinogenic effects. In addition, isolated safrole is carcinogenic in high doses.</p>
