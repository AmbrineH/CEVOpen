 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC analysis was carried out on an Agilent Technoloies-7890A gas chromatograph with a split/splitless injector (280
  <span class="bold">°</span>C), split ratio of 1 : 50 and a flame ionization detector (290
  <span class="bold">°</span>C). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas (1 ml min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and the capillary column used was a DB-5 (30 m ×  0.32
  <span class="bold"> </span>mm, film thickness 0.25 µm). The column oven temperature was kept at 60°C for 3
  <span class="bold"> </span>min and heated to 210°C with a 3°C min
  <span class="sup">−1</span> rate, then increased to 240°C with 20
  <span class="bold">°</span>C min
  <span class="sup">−1</span> rate and the final temperature held for 8.5
  <span class="bold"> </span>min. Relative percentage amounts were calculated from the peak area without the use of correction factors.

  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes as a standard. The compounds were identified by comparison retention indices (RI, DB5) with data reported in the literature and by comparison of their mass spectra with the Wiley GC/MS library, Adams library, mass finder 2.1 library data published MS [
