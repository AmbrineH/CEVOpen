   <span class="italic">P. lentiscus</span> were collected at the flowering stage from the mountains of Ouled Driss in Souk ahras (36°21′N, 8°07′E, 800 m) during 2013. The sample was dried in the shade away from light at room temperature. After drying, the sample was cut to very small parts with analytical mill, used for the extraction of essential oil. The identification of the investigated specie was confirmed by Laboratory of Valorization of Natural Biological Resources (Setif, Algeria), where a voucher specimen was deposited in a botanical collection.
