 <p id="par0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC analysis was performed on a 6890 series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) standard model with Flame Ionization Detectors (FID) using the following conditions: fused silica capillary column with a polar stationary phase HP-INNOWax (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d, 0.25 μm film, polyethylene glycol). Helium used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, injector and detector temperature are 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The splitless injection mode was used with injection volume of 1 μl diluted in hexane 1%. The oven temperature was programmed at 60 °C for 8 min, and then progressed to 270 °C at 2 °C/min.</p>
