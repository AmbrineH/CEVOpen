 <p id="par0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activities of PLEO were evaluated with four systems to establish authenticity, using tow synthetic antioxidants positive controls (BHT and Ascorbic acid). Potency was assessed by measuring the IC
  <sub>50</sub> or Trolox/GAE equivalent and the results are reported in 
  <a rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table" href="#tbl0015">Table 3</a>. The order of antioxidant capacity was Ascorbic acid &gt; BHT &gt; PLEO.

 <p id="par0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the results which have been obtained, the tested samples were able to reduce the DPPH radical and scavenging the Superoxide radical with IC
  <sub>50</sub> equal to 640 ± 0.16 μg/ml and 760 ± 0.125 μg/ml for DPPH and SOD assay respectively. Different parts and constituents from 
  <span class="italic">P. lentiscus</span> have been shown 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> radical scavenging properties [
  <a rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0185">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0190">[38]</a>]. Using the DPPH scavenging activity assay, it was found that all of the 
  <span class="italic">P. lentiscus</span> extracts in solvents, except for the chloroform extract, have a high radical scavenging activity (90%) equivalent to that of the standard, BHA (89%). The ethanolic and aqueous fractions from the ethyl acetate extract have high scavenging activities with values of 78 ± 0.93% and 90.29 ± 0.29%, respectively [
  <a rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0195">39</a>]. In 2007, Barra et al. [
  <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">40</a>] conducted a study which showed that the PLEO exhibited radical scavenging activity ranged between 0.52 and 4.61 mmol/l.

 <p id="par0150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest reducing power ability (μg GAE equivalent/g) and scavenging ability on ABTS radicals (μmol Trolox equivalent/mg) were observed also in the following order; ascorbic acid &gt; BHT &gt; PLEO. From our data, it appears that the values in the present study were comparable to those of Ascorbic acid and BHT. While comparing our present results of this assay with the literature already published, we found very few reports on the antioxidant activity of PLEO. We are the first evaluated the reducing power, ABTS and Superoxide radicals scavenging ability of PLEO.</p>
