 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tyrosinase inhibition colorimetric assay was carried out according to the method, as described [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Each essential oil was dissolved in DMSO to obtain concentration of 20 mg/mL. These stock solutions were diluted to 600 μg/mL concentration in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Arbutin acid was prepared in similar way and used as positive control. 700 μL of each sample solution or positive control were combined with 300 μL of mushroom tyrosinase (333 Unit per mL in phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). After incubation at 20–22 °C for 5 min, 1100 μL tyrosine (2 mM) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 492 nm using the spectrophotometer Genesys 10S UV–vis (Thermo Scientific, USA). Percent inhibition of tyrosinase activity was calculated according to the formula: inhibition (%) = 100-(W
  <sub>sample</sub>/W
  <sub>blank</sub>) × 100, where W is absorbance at 492 nm. W
  <sub>blank</sub> is absorbance of control reaction (containing all reagents without test compound).
