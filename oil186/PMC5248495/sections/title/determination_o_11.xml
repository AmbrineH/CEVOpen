 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Free radical scavenging ability of the essential oils was tested using ethanol solution of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Catechin was used as a positive reference. Sample solution contained 125 μL (1 mM) DPPH, 375 μL ethanol and 500 μL of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations). In the control solution the test-solution was replaced by ethanol. The absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 514 nm.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula: Radical scavenging activity (%) = Ac–As/Ac × 100, where Ac is absorbance of control (DPPH without the addition of test solution), and As-the absorbance of the sample.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IC
  <sub>50</sub> calculated denote the concentration of investigated samples required to decrease the DPPH absorbance at 514 nm by 50%.
