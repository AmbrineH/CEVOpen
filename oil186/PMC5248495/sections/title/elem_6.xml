   <span class="italic">thyrsiflor</span>a, and

   <span class="italic">citriodorum</span>) were grown from the seeds sown in the greenhouse, with subsequent transplantation of the seedlings to the same field, in the Kotayk Region of Armenia, where they have been growing side by side, at an elevation of 1600 m above the sea level. Plant materials were collected during blossoming period (July–August, 2014). The plant materials were identified at the Institute of Botany, National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Yerevan (Armenia). The plants were not included in the herbarium as there were cultivated species and not typical for the flora of Armenia. The samples of basil cultivars are available at the Department of Microbiology &amp; Plants and Microbes Biotechnology, Biology Faculty, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils were extracted from air dried plant material (aerial parts only) by hydro-distillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus and lasted 3 h. The distilled essential oils had been dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored at 4 °C in dark airtight bottles until further analysis [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination of essential oil chemical composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gas chromatography (GC) mass selective (MS) analysis of the essential oils was performed using a Hewlett–Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph, fitted with a fused silica HP – 5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, in thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature varied from 40–250 °C with the scanning rate of 3 °C/min. Helium (purity 5.6) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The GC was equipped with Hewlett–Packard 5972 Series MS detector. The MS operating parameters were ionization voltage 70 eV and ion source temperature 250 °C. The diluted samples of essential oils (1/100, v/v in HPLC methanol) of 1 μL had been injected manually. To avoid overloading the GC column, the essential oils were diluted 1:100 (v/v) in methanol. The identification of peaks was tentatively carried out based on library search using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-2013. Relative Retention Index (RRI) was calculated for HP-5MS column. For RRI calculation a mixture of homologues 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C9-C18) was used under the same chromatographic conditions as for analysis of the essential oils.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the essential oils was determined by the agar diffusion method [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. This method was preferred over the dilution method because of low solubility of essential oils in water and in meat peptone broth. The following concentrations of essential oils were used: 150; 100; 50; 25; 12.5; 6.25 μL/mL; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent. The 100 μL of each oil solution was introduced to the wells in the agar with test microorganisms. Different Gram-positive (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selected pieces of nutrient medium from the zones of microorganism growth absence were transferred to the nutrient medium corresponding to each microorganism and then they were incubated for 2–3 days at appropriate temperature to determine the bacteriostatic or bactericidal action of the oils. The action of oils is evaluated as bacteriostatic in case of renewed growth of test-microorganisms after the re-cultivation.</p>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Catechin was used as a positive reference. Sample solution contained 125 μL (1 mM) DPPH, 375 μL ethanol and 500 μL of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations).

These stock solutions were diluted to 600 μg/mL concentration in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Arbutin acid was prepared in similar way and used as positive control. 700 μL of each sample solution or positive control were combined with 300 μL of mushroom tyrosinase (333 Unit per mL in phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). After incubation at 20–22 °C for 5 min, 1100 μL tyrosine (2 mM) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 492 nm using the spectrophotometer Genesys 10S UV–vis (Thermo Scientific, USA). Percent inhibition of tyrosinase activity was calculated according to the formula: inhibition (%) = 100-(W
   <sub>sample</sub>/W
   <sub>blank</sub>) × 100, where W is absorbance at 492 nm. W
   <sub>blank</sub> is absorbance of control reaction (containing all reagents without test compound).
