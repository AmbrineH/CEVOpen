 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the essential oils was determined by the agar diffusion method [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. This method was preferred over the dilution method because of low solubility of essential oils in water and in meat peptone broth. The following concentrations of essential oils were used: 150; 100; 50; 25; 12.5; 6.25 μL/mL; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent. The 100 μL of each oil solution was introduced to the wells in the agar with test microorganisms. Different Gram-positive (

  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> MDC 5233 (Microbial Depository Center, Armbiotechnology Scientific and Production Center, Armenia; laboratory control strain) and Gram-negative (

  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> GRP3 (Soil and Water Research Institute, Iran) bacteria and ampicillin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> dhpα-pUC18 were used. Bacterial cultures were grown on Mueller-Hinton agar. Ampicillin (25 μg/mL) as a positive control and DMSO as a negative control were used. The yeasts (

  <span class="italic">Debariomyces hansenii</span> WT (French National Institute for Agricultural Research, France; laboratory control strain) were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 h at room temperature. As the positive control fluconazole (25 μg/mL) was used. Data were expressed in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selected pieces of nutrient medium from the zones of microorganism growth absence were transferred to the nutrient medium corresponding to each microorganism and then they were incubated for 2–3 days at appropriate temperature to determine the bacteriostatic or bactericidal action of the oils. The action of oils is evaluated as bacteriostatic in case of renewed growth of test-microorganisms after the re-cultivation.</p>
