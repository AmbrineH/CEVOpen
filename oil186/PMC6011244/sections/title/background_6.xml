 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Garlic (
  <span class="italic">Allium sativum</span> L.) has been widely used as a foodstuff and, for many centuries, has also been used as a traditional medicine due to its perceived effects in preventing and curing ailments [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. China has 33.3 million square meters devoted to cultivating garlic and produces more than 500 million tons of garlic, accounting for ½ of the total area of cultivated garlic in Asia and 1/3 of the total area of cultivated garlic in the world [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Several organosulfur compounds present in garlic oil have been shown to possess numerous biological activities. The four most important organosulfur compounds, considered to be the major biological agents, are diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and allylmethyl trisulfide [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. A series of biological benefits, such as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], antioxidant potential [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>], and antimicrobial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], have been reported. The pungent fractions of garlic are mostly sulfur-containing moieties, while its two chemical groups, namely, flavonoids and ALK (EN)-based cysteine sulfoxides (ACSOs), have marked effects on human health [

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Onion (
  <span class="italic">Allium cepa</span> Linn.) is also one of the oldest cultivated plants, with its cultivation dating back to before 5000 BC. World onion production has increased by at least 25% over the past 10 years to the current output of approximately 44 million tons, making it the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Onion is rich in sulfur-containing compounds and is used as a foodstuff, a flavoring, a condiment and folk medicine. According to traditional Chinese medicine, onions’ special features are warm and hot tastes, together with functions such as warming the lungs to reduce phlegm, warming the stomach during digestion, detoxifying and destroying intestinal worms, decreasing swelling and soreness, and decreasing blood pressure and blood lipids. As a result, onions are used for expelling worms in children, curing rheumatoid arthritis, treating the swelling and pain associated with athlete’s foot or dermal ulcers, dysentery, pertussis, insomnia and other conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Onions contain a considerable number of compounds that are highly beneficial for human health and that have been reported to have anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on diabetic rats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. ACSOs are also some of the active components in onion oil. The main components of onion oil are sulpho compounds, including propane disulfide, disulfide propylene, S-methyl cysteine, and others [

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patients with dyslipidemia are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the main cause of premature death and has been a major cause of disability and ill health in recent years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. In China, the situation is very serious, and the number of patients with dyslipidemia has reached 160 million, with annual numbers of disability and death originating from dyslipidemia-associated diabetes, stroke, cerebral infarction, hemiplegia, or myocardial infarction also increasing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. As a result, it is important to find reasonable and effective ways to prevent, control, and improve dyslipidemia to provide significant reductions in atherosclerosis and cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Obesity is one of the most prevalent heath conditions that may foster various diseases, such as dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. There have been few studies concerning the lipid-lowering and anti-obesity properties of garlic oil and onion oil prior to the current study. The objectives of this study were to explore the influence of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in dyslipidemia model rats, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of dyslipidemia through a dietary approach, and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion.
