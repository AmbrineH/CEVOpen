 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120~ 150 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center in Zhejiang, and the license number was SCXK (ZHE) 6008–0033. They were housed six per cage in a room with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and an ambient temperature of 22 ~ 25°C. All rats were fed a pelletized commercial chow for 7 days after arrival. Hyperlipidemia was induced in the rats by feeding them a high-fat diet based on the AIN-93 semisynthetic diet; the detailed ingredients of the diet are shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The obesity model was judged to be successful when the body weight in the intervention groups was 10% higher than that in the control group [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. The mineral mix and vitamin mix were followed the recommended doses in AIN-93 M [

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the body weight and serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), ninety-six male rats were randomly allocated into eight groups, including the normal control group (NC); the hyperlipidemia model group given water (HFD-A); the hyperlipidemia model group given Tween 80 (HFD-B); the low, moderate and high dose garlic oil groups (GO-L, GO-M, and GO-H, treated with 11.6 mg/kg·bw/d, 46.3 mg/kg·bw/d, and 92.6 mg/kg·bw/d, respectively); and the low and high dose onion oil groups (OO-L and OO-H, treated with 46.3 mg/kg·bw/d and 92.6 mg/kg·bw/d, respectively).</p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The garlic oil and onion oil were dissolved in 1% Tween 80 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and administered to the rats every day by intragastric administration for 60 days. The HFD-A group and the NC group were prepared to evaluate the success of the hyperlipidemia model, while the HFD-B group was used to eliminate the effects of tween-80 on the rats and to demonstrate that Tween 80 had no effect on the hyperlipidemic rats.
