   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. For the garlic oil, fresh garlic cloves were chopped, soaked in 3.5-fold distilled water at 35 °C for four hours, and then subjected to hydrodistillation in essential oil testing equipment for 2 hours. To attain the onion oil, fresh bulbs were chopped, soaked in 1.5-fold distilled water at 35 °C for 2.5 h, and then subjected to hydrodistillation in essential oil testing equipment for 2.6 h. All of the essential oils obtained were dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in the dark at room temperature until use. The chemical composition of the garlic and onion oil preparations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). DADS and DATS accounted for 64.7% of the composition of the garlic oil, while sulfur nitrogen compounds made up 80% of the composition of the onion oil.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120~ 150 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center in Zhejiang, and the license number was SCXK (ZHE) 6008–0033. They were housed six per cage in a room with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and an ambient temperature of 22 ~ 25°C. All rats were fed a pelletized commercial chow for 7 days after arrival. Hyperlipidemia was induced in the rats by feeding them a high-fat diet based on the AIN-93 semisynthetic diet; the detailed ingredients of the diet are shown in Table

The liver, kidney and adipose tissues were weighed, immediately placed on ice bags, and then stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. The naso-anal length (distance from nose to anus) of the animals was also measured on the 60th day before the animals were sacrificed. The animal experimental protocols were conducted according to guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Southeast University.
