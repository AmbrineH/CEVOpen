  <div class="title">Effect of LEO on phosphorylation of MAPK in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.8 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 18 h, and the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/μl) in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) for 30 min. The levels of p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38 and p38 were determined using Western blot method.
