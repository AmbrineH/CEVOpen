 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the study demonstrate that LEO exhibits significant inhibitory effects on the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α. These effects were accompanied by inhibition of the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κB.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nerolidol, the major component of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Peperomia serpens</span>, has been shown to inhibit carrageenan-induced paw and ear edema in mice (Pinheiro et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">29</a>]). Fonseca et al. (2016[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]) demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of nerolidol via its inhibitions of carrageenan-induced paw edema formation and LPS-stimulated IL-6 and IL-1β production in peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activities of α-humulene and (-)-trans-caryophyllene have been demonstrated via their inhibition of the production of different inflammatory mediators in carrageenan-treated rats (Fernandes et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>]). In addition, other minor compounds present in LEO, such as α-pinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene, dl-limonene, geraniol, and bornyl acetate, have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities (Chen and Viljoen, 2010[
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>]; d'Alessio et al., 2013[
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>]; Rufino et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">33</a>], 2015[
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">34</a>]; Wu et al., 2004[
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">41</a>]). Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activity of LEO could be attributed to its major constituents or a synergetic action among the constituents present in the oil.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Macrophages are activated by LPS produce pro-inflammatory factors, such as NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, iNOS, and COX-2 (Korhonen et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>]). For this reason, we selected LPS as an inflammatory stimulant for the study. The production of NO by iNOS due to stimulation with LPS plays an important role in inflammation (McCann et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">26</a>]). Similar to NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub> is an inflammatory mediator generated at inflammatory sites by COX-2, which is involved in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Lipsky, 1999[
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>]; Rocca and FitzGerald, 2002[
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]). Thus, reducing the levels of NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, iNOS, and COX-2 may be an attractive target for confirming anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are known to contribute to inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>]). Hence, we measured the effects of LEO on the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and the production of NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with LEO inhibited the production of NO and PGE
  <sub>2</sub> by reducing LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2. Moreover, LEO reduced LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production. Other studies have similarly reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of essential oils is associated with the suppression of mediators such as PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, NO, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2, and iNOS (Yoon et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">42</a>][
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">43</a>]). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MAPKs are the major components of the signaling pathway that leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, it is known that MAPKs play an important role in inflammatory signaling in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Hommes et al., 2003[
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>]; Nakano et al., 1998[
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">27</a>]). Furthermore, p38 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in LPS-induced macrophage responses (Bhat et al., 1998[
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>]). In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK is thought to be implicated in the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in LPS-induced macrophage responses (Ajizian et al., 1999[
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>]; Bhat et al., 1998[
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>]). Other studies have reported that JNK is primarily implicated in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Chan and Riches, 1998[
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>]; Uto et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">38</a>]). Therefore, we assessed the MAPK signaling pathway to elucidate the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of LEO in LPS-activated macrophages. The results showed that pretreatment with LEO resulted in a significant suppression of JNK, ERK, and p38 phosphorylation in the LPS-activated macrophages.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NF-κB is a mammalian transcription factor that regulates many genes, including those involved the expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are important in immune and inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Barnes and Karin, 1997[
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>]). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is present as a quiescent form bound to the inhibitory protein IκB in the cytosol (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000[
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>]). Upon stimulation with LPS, IκB is degraded, which permits the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex, where it binds kb sites and activates the gene transcription of iNOS, COX-2, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Surh et al., 2001[
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">36</a>]). In our studies, LEO attenuated IκB-α degradation and suppressed NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. This suggests that it inhibits the activation of inflammatory mediators by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway during the activation of macrophages.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory activity of LEO is evidenced by its inhibition of the production of NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, and other cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) via regulation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. These results suggest that the development of substances that modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators can provide a molecular basis for developing functional foods for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases.
