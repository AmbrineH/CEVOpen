 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the phosphorylation of IκB and its subsequent degradation are essential steps in NF-κB activation by LPS, we examined the effect of LEO on these processes in a Western blot analysis. Our results showed that LEO significantly decreased the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α in the LPS-activated cells (Figure 5
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">(Fig. 5)</a>). NF-κB plays a critical role in the inflammatory response; therefore, we further investigated whether LEO blocks NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated cells. Our results showed that LEO dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation. These findings suggest that LEO attenuates NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκB-α degradation, which further inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators.
