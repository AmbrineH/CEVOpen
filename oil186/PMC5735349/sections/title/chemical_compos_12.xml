 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition and retention indices of the constituents of LEO are presented in Table 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a> and Figure 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">(Fig. 1)</a>. A total of 15 volatile constituents were identified, representing 63.73 % of the composition of LEO. The main constituents of LEO were nerolidol (18.73 %), caryophyllene (14.41 %), α-humulene (7.73 %), germacrene-D (4.82 %), and α-pinene (4.47 %). We initially conducted a cytotoxicity test via an MTT assay (Figure 2A
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>) and found that LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) was not cytotoxic to the RAW264.7 cells; therefore, we used the oil at concentrations of 0.01-0.04 % in subsequent experiments.
