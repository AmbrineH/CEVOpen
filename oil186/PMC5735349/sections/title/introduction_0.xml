 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prolonged inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>]). Inflammation is caused by pro-inflammatory mediators, including both pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, and pro-inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E
  <sub>2</sub> (PGE
  <sub>2</sub>), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Ljung et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">24</a>]; Walsh et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">39</a>]). Therefore, inhibition of these inflammatory mediators is an important target pathway in the treatment of diseases with anti-inflammatory components.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB) regulates a variety of genes associated with immune and acute-phase inflammatory responses. The activation of NF-κB due to pro-inflammatory stimulation is indicated by rapid phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitors of kappa B (IκBs) (Rajapakse et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">30</a>]). Freed NF-κB dimers from this process translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of target genes (Lee et al., 2003[
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>]). They then induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α (Makarov, 2000[
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>]; Yoshimura, 2006[
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">44</a>]). Recent studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of phytochemicals occurs through blocking of the NF-κB signaling pathway (Ham et al., 2015[
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>]; Hsieh et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14</a>]). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are one of the major kinases involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, stress responses, differentiation, and immune defense (Liu et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">23</a>]). MAPKs comprise three major subgroups, namely, p38 MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Their activation plays an important role in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and in the production of cytokines (Rajapakse et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">30</a>]; Rao, 2001[
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">31</a>]). Therefore, MAPK and NF-κB may be effective as anti-inflammatory agents.

  <span class="italic">Lindera erythrocarpa</span> is widely distributed in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and China (Sun and Chung, 1988[
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">35</a>]). 
  <span class="italic">Lindera</span> species, including 
  <span class="italic">L. strychnifolia</span>,
  <span class="italic"> L. lucida</span>,
  <span class="italic"> L. chunii</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">L. aggregate</span> are important medicinal plants. The fruit and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">L. erythrocarpa</span> are used in folk medicine for treating digestive disorders, thirst, pain, and neuralgia. They are also used as antidotes and diuretics (Hong et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>]; Oh et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">28</a>]; Sun and Chung, 1988[
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">35</a>]). Recently, 
  <span class="italic">L. erythrocarpa</span> was reported to suppress adipogenesis and melanin synthesis, attenuate obesity, as well as exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal activities (Hsieh and Wang, 2013[
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>]; Hwang et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a>]; Kumar et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>]; Wang et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>]). Essential oils extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants are known to have biological effects, most notably anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activities (Chaieb et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]; Pinheiro et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">29</a>]). These properties are a driving interest in the use of essential oils in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries (Chaieb et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]; Lang and Buchbauer, 2012[
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>]; Tumen et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">37</a>]). However, the mechanism by which 
  <span class="italic">L. erythrocarpa </span>essential oil (LEO) exerts its anti-inflammatory effect has not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LEO and its constituents on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
