 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated by Western blotting whether inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators by LEO is mediated by the MAPK pathway. The results indicated that LEO inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">(Fig. 6)</a>). These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of LEO is mediated by inhibition of LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs.
