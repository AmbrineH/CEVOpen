  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition and retention indices of the constituents of LEO are presented in Table 1
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a> and Figure 1
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">(Fig. 1)</a>. A total of 15 volatile constituents were identified, representing 63.73 % of the composition of LEO. The main constituents of LEO were nerolidol (18.73 %), caryophyllene (14.41 %), α-humulene (7.73 %), germacrene-D (4.82 %), and α-pinene (4.47 %). We initially conducted a cytotoxicity test via an MTT assay (Figure 2A
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>) and found that LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) was not cytotoxic to the RAW264.7 cells; therefore, we used the oil at concentrations of 0.01-0.04 % in subsequent experiments.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of LEO by evaluating the production of NO and PGE
   <sub>2</sub> in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 2B
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>, NO production was substantially higher in LPS-treated cells than in the untreated cells. However, LEO suppressed NO production in the LPS-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 0.04 % LEO to the cells caused a reduction in LPS-induced NO production by 86.1 %. Moreover, results of the PGE
   <sub>2</sub> assays revealed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of PGE
   <sub>2 </sub>production by LEO in the LPS-activated cells. PGE
   <sub>2</sub> production was inhibited by 54.1, 65.8, and 71.8 % by LEO at concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %, respectively (Figure 2C
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Western blot analyses were used to determine whether the inhibitory activity of LEO on the production of NO and PGE
   <sub>2</sub> was related to the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2. The data shown in Figure 3
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">(Fig. 3)</a> demonstrate that the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 in the LPS-stimulated cells increased when compared with the untreated control. However, LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) inhibited LPS-induced increases in iNOS and COX-2 levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the inhibitory effects of LEO on the production of NO and PGE
   <sub>2</sub>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further investigated the effects of LEO on the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 4
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">(Fig. 4)</a>, the production of IL-6 and TNF-α was considerably increased by LPS but significantly inhibited by LEO in a dose-dependent manner.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of LEO on the NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the phosphorylation of IκB and its subsequent degradation are essential steps in NF-κB activation by LPS, we examined the effect of LEO on these processes in a Western blot analysis. Our results showed that LEO significantly decreased the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α in the LPS-activated cells (Figure 5
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">(Fig. 5)</a>). NF-κB plays a critical role in the inflammatory response; therefore, we further investigated whether LEO blocks NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated cells. Our results showed that LEO dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation. These findings suggest that LEO attenuates NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκB-α degradation, which further inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated by Western blotting whether inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators by LEO is mediated by the MAPK pathway. The results indicated that LEO inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">(Fig. 6)</a>). These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of LEO is mediated by inhibition of LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs.
