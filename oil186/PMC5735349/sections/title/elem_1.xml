  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaves of 
   <span class="italic">L. erythrocarpa</span> were collected from Namwon (a region in Jeju Island, Korea) in May 2014 and LEO was extracted by hydrodistillation. Briefly, approximately 300 g of fresh 
   <span class="italic">L</span>.
   <span class="italic"> erythrocarpa</span> leaves was immersed in 3 l of distilled water in a 5-l flask. Subsequently, the obtained essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and stored in a sealed vial at 4 °C until tested. The LEO yield was approximately 0.067 % (v/w).

   <span class="italic">L</span>.
   <span class="italic"> erythrocarpa</span> leaves was carried out using a GC (Agilent 6890, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) connected to an MS (Agilent 5975). The GC was equipped with a DB1-HT column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.1 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 to 100°C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and then from 100 to 230 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, after which it was held at 230 °C for 5 min. The detector and injector temperatures were 280 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.5 ml/min and the split ratio was 1:10. For the sample injection (split less), 10 μl of LEO was diluted in 500 μl of CH
   <sub>2</sub>Cl
   <sub>2</sub> and 1 μl of this solution was injected for analysis. Identification of the compounds was done by comparison of their mass spectra with reference spectra in the Wiley libraries. The GC-MS retention indices were also calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C6-C31).

The amount of nitrite that accumulated in the culture medium was measured and used as an indicator of NO production. Briefly, 100 μl of cell culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of 1 X Griess reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was then measured at 540 nm. A fresh culture medium was used as the blank in every experiment.

After incubation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. The cell lysates were then isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ^°C. Protein concentration in the supernatants was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and all proteins were adjusted to an equal protein content. Aliquots of the lysates (20~30 μg protein/lane) were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12 % bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using an iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen). The membranes were immersed in 5 % non-fat skim milk, which was used as a blocking solution and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) at 4 °C for 24 h. After incubating, the membranes were washed several times with Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Cell Signaling Technology) for 90 min. After washing, immunoactive proteins were detected using the WEST-ZOL (plus) Western Blot Detection System (iNtRON Biotechnology, Gyeonggi, Korea).</p>
