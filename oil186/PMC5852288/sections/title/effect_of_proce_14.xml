  <span class="italic">Theobroma cacao</span> beans were ashed at 550 Â°C and the ash boiled with 10 mL HCl (10%). After filtration, the following mineral elements: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K) and iron (Fe) were, determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Varian 220FS Spectra AA, Les Ulis, France). Phosphorus (P) was determined by colorimetry, using the vanado molybdate, following the AOAC method 965.17
