 <p id="p0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proximate composition of 
  <span class="italic">Theobroma cacao</span> beans was determined by evaluating the following parameters: Moisture, fat, ash and protein contents, using the standard methods described by AOAC 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">[20]</a>. The moisture content was evaluated by drying cocoa beans in the oven at 103 °C until constant weight, according to the AOAC method 925.40 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">[20]</a>. The ash content was obtained by incineration of the beans at 550 °C, following the AOAC procedure 924.05 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">[20]</a>. The Nitrogen (N) content was determined using the micro-Kjeldahl, as described in the AOAC procedure 984.13. The protein content was then calculated as N x 6.25. The lipid contain was determined on a Soxhlet apparatus using hexane, following the AOAC 963.15 method 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">[20]</a>. The total carbohydrate content was determined by difference as reported by Onyeike et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">[21]</a>. This technique involves adding the total values of crude fat, proteins, moisture and ash constituents of the sample and subtracting it from 100. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
