 <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Freshly fermented cocoa beans (4 Kg) were divided into two different groups (G1 and G2). The first group (G1) was dried in an electric air-dried oven at 45 °C for a period of 48 h. The dried beans were then divided into 05 sub-groups of 200 g each (SG0, SG1, SG2, SG3 and SG4). SG1 and SG2 samples were traditionally roasted in cooking pot by continuous stirring for 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5</span>
  <span class="italic">min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> respectively. The temperature between the heat source and cooking pot was ranged between 200–220 °C. SG3 and SG4 were also roasted, but in the oven at 180 °C for a period of 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> respectively. SG0 served as dried control and was coded 
  <span class="italic">DCB</span>. G2 was extracted fresh and served as unprocessed control and was coded 
  <span class="italic">FCB</span>.
