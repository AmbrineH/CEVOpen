 <p id="p0105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TBA test is an easy and quick technique widely used in the assessment of the secondary oxidation state of oils and fats. It especially gives an idea on the concentration of malonaldehyde present, which is one of the secondary oxidation products of oils and fats 
  <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">[26]</a>. The changes in TBA value of cocoa bean oil samples are presented in 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span> which previously exhibited the highest peroxide values have also showed highest TBA values (4.11 and 3.81 ppm respectively) compared to the controls

  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> (0.84, 1.35, 1.22 and 2.02 respectively). This is the proof that the amount of malonaldehyde significantly increases (p &lt; 0.05) during traditional roasting. Malonaldehyde is generally obtained from the decomposition of hydroperoxides under the effect of heat 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">[13]</a>. The traditional roasting temperature might catalyze the formation of these products by enhancing the decomposition of primary oxidation products. These results are in accordance with those of Tenyang etÂ al

  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">[11]</a> who showed that the amount of secondary oxidation products significantly increases with roasting time and temperature.
