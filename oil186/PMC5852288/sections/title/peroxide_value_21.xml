 <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The determination of the peroxide value of oils generally inform on their primary oxidation state, characterized by the formation of hydroperoxides which are the main oxidation products [
  <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">13</a>]. The changes in peroxide value of cocoa bean oil samples are presented in 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. A significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in PV was registered in almost all the processed samples compared to the controls 
  <span class="italic">(FCB</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DCB)</span>. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the PV of controls 
  <span class="italic">(FCB and DCB)</span> and that of 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>. Among the processed samples, 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) primarily oxidized compared to 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> respectively. Apart of 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> who exhibited a PV higher than the recommended value which is 10 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/Kg 
  <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">[25]</a>; all samples have presented a PV in the accepted range 1–10 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/Kg. This indicates that the formation rate of hydroperoxides was elevated with traditional roasting than oven roasting. It has been demonstrated that, heat facilitates the initiation of lipid oxidation which leads to the formation of free radicals, which can easily react with molecular oxygen and form hydroperoxides at the propagation stage 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">[24]</a>. So, the high PV of traditionally roasted cocoa beans oil indicates its poor resistance towards peroxidation during storage. These results are in line with those reported by Tenyang et al. 
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">[11]</a>, who showed that the peroxide values of oils extracted from two varieties of sesame seeds was increasing with the roasting temperature and time.
