 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of the present study indicate that, traditional roasting significantly reduce the polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity of cocoa beans. The analysis of oil showed that both oven and traditional roasting significantly affect the peroxide and TBA values of cocoa beans oil. However, traditional roasting is the most severe treatment. Oven and traditional roasting for 10 min decrease the iodine value of cocoa beans oil, but increase their acidity. The proximate composition of 
  <span class="italic">Theobroma cacao</span> beans was also significantly affected by the roasting techniques. Oven and traditional roasting significantly increase the ash content of cocoa beans, but reduce its protein concentration. All the cooking techniques increase the carbohydrate content of these beans, while slightly decreasing their lipid content. Traditional roasting increases the iron, phosphorus and sodium contents of cocoa beans. Oven roasting preserve the potassium content of the beans while traditional roasting leads to its significant reduction. All these treatments significantly reduce the concentration of calcium, but increase that of magnesium.
