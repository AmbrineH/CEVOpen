 <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The changes in proximate composition of cocoa beans during processing are presented in 
  <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>. The moisture content obtained in this study varies from 3.98 to 6.40% and is similar to that reported by Ajala and Ojewande 
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">[28]</a>. These authors reported that the amount of moisture in cocoa beans falls between 4.96 and 7.00% during drying at different temperatures. A significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in moisture content of cocoa beans was registered with 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min, DTRCB 10 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> compared to the control 
  <span class="italic">(DCB)</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>. However, no difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the amount of moisture of 
  <span class="italic">DCB</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>. High temperatures generally contribute to the reduction of the moisture content of foods to a minimum value. Abiola and Tewe 
  <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">[29]</a> have reported that, the key factors for long shelf life of cocoa powder are the reduction of its moisture content which will reduce the water activity and inhibit several chemical reactions and biological activities which can reduce the quality of food. From the same table (
  <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>), it appears that the amount of ash varied from 7.25 to 9.15%. Similar range was reported in cocoa beans by Ndjife et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib30">[30]</a>. No significant difference was observed between the ash content of the control 
  <span class="italic">(DCB)</span>, 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>. However, the total ash content of 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) compared to those above mentioned. This suggests that oven and traditional roasting increase the amount of ash in cocoa beans. These results are in agreement with those of Amaiz et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">[31]</a> who demonstrated that, the ash content of cocoa beans was increasing with roasting. However, these results were not in accordance with those of Ajala and Ojewande 
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">[28]</a> who showed that the ash content of cocoa beans decreases with the elevation of the temperature.

 <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the macronutrients composition showed that cocoa beans are rich in lipids (38.16–41.23%), proteins (15.54–17.91%) and carbohydrates (27.67–30.78 %). The amount of lipids was similar to that reported by Amaiz et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">[31]</a> who showed that, the lipids content of cocoa beans varied between 45.42 and 46.27%. Those of proteins and carbohydrates were closed to the data reported by Rucker 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">[4]</a> who demonstrated that the protein and carbohydrate content of cocoa beans fall in the ranges 18–19% and 45–55% respectively. Generally, the amount of lipids was significantly reducing (p &lt; 0.05) with the treatments. These results are in agreement with those reported by Amaiz et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">[31]</a>. These results are in line with those reported by Amaiz et al

  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">[31]</a> and Ajala and Ojewande 
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">[28]</a> who have proven that the amount of lipids of cocoa beans reduces with processing. Similar tendencies were observed with the protein content of these samples. This can be attributed to the involvement of proteins in non-enzymatic browning reactions. Similar results were obtained by Ajala and Ojewande 
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">[28]</a> during drying of fermented cocoa beans. Concerning the total carbohydrates content, its amount was significantly increasing (p &lt; 0.05) in the oven and traditionally roasted cocoa beans samples compared to the control. These results are not in agreement with those of Ihemeje et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">[32]</a> who demonstrated that the amount of carbohydrate of walnut seeds significantly decreases (p &lt; 0.05) with the treatments. However, they are in accordance with those of Tenyang et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">[11]</a> who showed that roasting of white sesame seeds at 120 °C for 30 min considerably increases its carbohydrates content.
