  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">[16]</a>. A total of 4.5 mL of 0.002% alcoholic solution of DPPH was added to 0.5 mL of different concentrations (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 μg/mL) of samples and standard solutions separately, in order to have final concentrations of products of 25–200 μg/mL. The samples were kept at room temperature in the dark and after 30 min and the absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 517 nm. The absorbance of the samples, control, and blank was measured in comparison with methanol. The antioxidant activity (AA) was calculated according to the formula:
