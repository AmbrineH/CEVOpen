 <p id="p0110" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degree of unsaturation of oils and fats is generally measured through the determination of the iodine value. Generally, during lipid oxidation, the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids are attacked by free radicals, resulting in the reduction of the number of unsaturation 
  <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">[27]</a>. The changes in IV of cocoa bean oil samples are presented in 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. A significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in Iodine value was registered in 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> compared to 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min, DORCB 5 min</span> and controls 
  <span class="italic">(FCB and DCB)</span>. This indicates that traditional and oven roasting for 10 min significantly alter (p &lt; 0.05) the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids of cocoa bean oil. However, the iodine values of 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span>, were similar (p &gt; 0.01) to those of 
  <span class="italic">controls (FCB and DCB)</span>, meaning that these oil samples were less affected by the treatment. It is however important to note that the iodine values obtained in this work were ranged between 30–35 gI
  <sub>2</sub>/100 g as recommended by the regulation 
  <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">[25]</a>. These results are in agreement with those reported by Djikeng et al

  <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">[9]</a> who demonstrated that heating of palm olein at 180 °C significantly reduce its iodine value.
