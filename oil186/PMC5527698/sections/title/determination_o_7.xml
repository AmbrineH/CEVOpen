 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in 96-well microplate using the microdilution assay according to Balouiri

  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>] with slight modifications. Bacteriological agar at 0.15% (w/v) was used as an emulsifier of the EO in the culture medium. For bacteria, the EO was serially diluted in Muller-Hinton broth supplemented with agar to obtain final concentrations ranging between 8% and 0.007% (v/v). The 12
  <span class="sup">th</span> well was considered as growth control (free-EO control). Then, 50 μl of bacterial inoculum, previously prepared and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland, were added to each well to reach the final concentration of 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/ml. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, 10 μl of resazurin was added to each well as bacterial growth indicator. After a further incubation at 37°C for 2 h, the bacterial growth was revealed by coloration change from purple to pink.
