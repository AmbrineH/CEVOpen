 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EOP treatment also inhibited proliferation of the CHO-K1 cell line; however, this cytotoxicity was only significant at 500 μg/mL. No significant cytotoxicity was observed up to 250 μg/mL in growth inhibition of CHO-K1 cells after 24 h of treatment (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191797.g003" href="#pone.0191797.g003">Fig 3</a>). The in vitro cytotoxicity activity of EOP showed IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 266 and 100 μg/mL in CHO-K1 cells and trophozoites, respectively, which may indicate selectivity of the EOP treatment at concentrations up to 250 μg/mL. The results enumerated above demonstrate that EOP is an important resource for future drug development, and its therapeutic potential against various infectious entities merits further study and analysis.

   <p>Cell proliferation in CHO-K1 was investigated by the MTT assay, and metronidazole was used as a positive control. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM of the viabilities of CHO-K1 cells in three independent experiments. (*) indicates a difference between the treatments in CHO-K1 cells. The differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. VC = vehicle control; MTZ = metronidazole.</p>
