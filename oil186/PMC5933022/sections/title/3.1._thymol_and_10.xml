 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography technique provides the industry and science with simplicity, speed, and efficiency for the characterization and quantification of components of essential oils. The instrument most commonly used for identification of the components is a mass spectrometer (MS), while for quantification of the organic compounds it is a flame ionization detector (FID) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantitative determination of the two main components of the thyme by GC-FID method was applied for the oil and for the oleogels. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2"> Figure 2</a> demonstrates that thymol and carvacrol peaks were well resolved from each other and displayed excellent peak symmetry and separation efficiency. The concentrations of thymol (9.61 mg/mL) and carvacrol (0.07 mg/mL) were determined in the essential oil. Quantitative analysis of oleogel containing thyme essential oil showed that thymol concentration decreased by 30% and carvacrol concentration decreased by 10% from the initial amount.
