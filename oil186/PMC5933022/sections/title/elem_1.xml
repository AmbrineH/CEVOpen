  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oleogel was produced from essential oil of thyme, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Germany), olive oil, obtained from Henry Lamotte GmbH (Germany), and colloidal anhydrous silica Aerosil 200, obtained from Degussa AG (Germany). For identification of active compounds in oleogels thymol and carvacrol were used, which were obtained from Carl Roth GmbH &amp; Co. Kg (Germany). For HPLC analysis, acetonitrile was used, which was obtained from Chromasolv (USA). Antifungal activity of oleogels was performed on Mueller-Hinton broth II agar, obtained from BBL (USA), and culture

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gels were prepared by stirring (150 RPM) Aerosil with paraffin and olive oils for 5 min to obtain a homogenous transparent mixture. Essential oil of thyme was added to the oleogel as active substance with antimicrobial activity at a concentration of 0.1% w/w.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-FID analyses were carried out on gas chromatograph GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, USA). Compounds were separated on Crossbond™ 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane Rxi®-5 ms, 30 m × 0,25 mmi.d., df 0,25 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>m (Restek, USA) capillary column. The injection volume was 1 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l, with a split ratio of 1 : 100. Ultra-high-purity helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant column flow rate of 1,29 ml/min. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 290 and 310°C, respectively. Samples were diluted individually with methanol before GC analysis. The identification of main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) was performed by comparing their retention times of the chromatographic peaks to the reference standards. The main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) were quantified using GC-FID chromatographic data and equations of linear regressions (

   <span class="sup">2</span> ≥ 0.9999) of calibration graphs (area versus concentration of standard). The initial temperature of column was set as 70°C, at which it was held for 2 min. The temperature of the column was programmed from 70°C to 250 at a rate of 20°C/min.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the oleogels with essential thyme oil was determined using
   <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> ATCC 60193 culture. Determination was performed by dilution method on plates of solid medium (Mueller-Hinton broth II). Standard fungus culture was cultivated for 20–24 hours at 35–37°C temperature on Mueller-Hinton agar. The suspension is made from the harvested culture in physiological sodium chloride (0.9%) solution, standardized with
   <span class="italic"> McFarland</span> standard indicator, which measures the turbidity of the suspension in the test tube. Microbial suspensions are standardized when the indicator shows a value of 0.5 (this means that 1 ml of the microbial suspension contains 1.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> microbial cells). 1 ml of the oleogel was transferred with the sterile pipette into a sterile graduated cylinder, which is mixed with 10 ml of molten rigid Mueller-Hinton medium and transferred to a Petri dish. Concentration of essential oil of thyme ranged from 0.01 to 0.3%. The antifungal effect of investigated gels on
   <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> culture was evaluated after 24 h and compared with control (gel without essential oil).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The preliminary formulation of the oleogel was prepared for the suitable lower 5% and upper 8.5% limits of colloidal silica concentration for the gelation of oils. The experimental design is conducted by using Design-Expert® 6 (version 6.0.8, Stat-Easy Inc., Minneapolis, USA). A set of mixtures was formed using response surface design central composite criterion. The experimental mixture design was applied to study the effect of two-component system—colloidal silica—on the response variables: firmness, cohesiveness, consistency, and index of viscosity. The set of mixtures is shown in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.6. The Texture Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The texture profile analysis of the formulated oleogels was conducted using a TA.XT.plus (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Godalming, Surrey, UK) texture analyzer. Back extrusion test was performed. The back extrusion rig (A/BE) is comprised of a sample container that is centrally located beneath a disc plunger. The disc plunger performs a compression test that extrudes the product up and around the edge of the disc. This test measures the consistency of viscous food products and semisolid pharmaceutical or cosmetic products. When a trigger force of 5 g has been achieved, the disc plunger begins to deform the sample to a specified distance (5 mm) after which the probe returns to its starting position. The maximum force represented as a peak on the graph measures firmness; the higher the value, the firmer the sample (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The area under the positive part of the graph indicates sample consistency (work done to hardness 1); the higher the value, the thicker and the higher the consistency of the sample. As the probe returns to its starting position, the initial lifting of the weight of the sample on the upper surface of the disc produces the negative part of the graph resulting from back extrusion. This gives an indication of the cohesiveness and resistance of the sample to separate (flow off) from the disc. The maximum negative force on the graph indicates sample adhesive force; the more negative the value is, the more “sticky” the sample is. The area under the negative part of the graph is known as the adhesiveness (energy required to break probe sample contact) and can give an indication of the cohesive forces of the molecules within the sample. The higher the value, the more energy required to break the probe sample contact as the probe withdraws from sample. All tests were conducted at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) and repeated three times.
