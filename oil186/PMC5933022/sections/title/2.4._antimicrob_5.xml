 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the oleogels with essential thyme oil was determined using
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> ATCC 60193 culture. Determination was performed by dilution method on plates of solid medium (Mueller-Hinton broth II). Standard fungus culture was cultivated for 20–24 hours at 35–37°C temperature on Mueller-Hinton agar. The suspension is made from the harvested culture in physiological sodium chloride (0.9%) solution, standardized with
  <span class="italic"> McFarland</span> standard indicator, which measures the turbidity of the suspension in the test tube. Microbial suspensions are standardized when the indicator shows a value of 0.5 (this means that 1 ml of the microbial suspension contains 1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> microbial cells). 1 ml of the oleogel was transferred with the sterile pipette into a sterile graduated cylinder, which is mixed with 10 ml of molten rigid Mueller-Hinton medium and transferred to a Petri dish. Concentration of essential oil of thyme ranged from 0.01 to 0.3%. The antifungal effect of investigated gels on
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> culture was evaluated after 24 h and compared with control (gel without essential oil).
