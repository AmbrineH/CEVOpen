  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography technique provides the industry and science with simplicity, speed, and efficiency for the characterization and quantification of components of essential oils. The instrument most commonly used for identification of the components is a mass spectrometer (MS), while for quantification of the organic compounds it is a flame ionization detector (FID) [
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantitative determination of the two main components of the thyme by GC-FID method was applied for the oil and for the oleogels. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2"> Figure 2</a> demonstrates that thymol and carvacrol peaks were well resolved from each other and displayed excellent peak symmetry and separation efficiency. The concentrations of thymol (9.61 mg/mL) and carvacrol (0.07 mg/mL) were determined in the essential oil. Quantitative analysis of oleogel containing thyme essential oil showed that thymol concentration decreased by 30% and carvacrol concentration decreased by 10% from the initial amount.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimental design conducted the set of component mixtures for the oleogels with 0.1% essential oil of thyme formulations (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). Evaluation of mechanical properties by texture analyzer was performed as response. Back extrusion test determines firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency and shows what force (g) is achieved. All parameters of the oleogels increased linearly with the increase in the gelator, colloidal silica concentration (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Formulations numbers 1, 2, and 3 contained lowest amount of gelator; accordingly, the force used for the determination of texture parameters was up to 250 g. Another group of formulations contained 6.75% of colloidal silica; the texture parameters were of medium values; used force was up to 800 g. Formulations with the highest amount of gelator needed higher force (up to 1400 g) to determinate firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency. Mechanical properties of oleogel depend on the gelator concentration: firmness, cohesiveness, and consistency increased with the increase in the colloidal silica amount. Index of viscosity in all determinations varied from 19.12 ± 0.6 to 89.99 ± 4.5 g and did not show high correlation with amount of oleogel components.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goals of tested parameters were determinate for the design of optimal formulation: maximum cohesiveness, firmness, consistency, and medium index of viscosity. Oleogel for topical application has to be with good adhesive properties for better permeation to the skin.
   <span class="italic"> Design-Expert</span>®
   <span class="italic"> 6</span> program calculated the optimal composition of the oleogel mixture, containing thyme essential oil 0.1%, colloidal silica 8.50%, paraffin oil 25.01%, and olive oil 66.39%. The lack of fit (
   <span class="italic">F</span> value &lt; 0.0001) implies that the model is significant and the optimum mixture was suggested with the highest desirability of 0.810.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optimal oleogel formulation of stated composition was produced and evaluated. It was clear light yellow colour gel with smell of thyme. pH value of oleogel matched human physiological pH value and varied from 6,29 to 6,48. Texture parameters were determined and listed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between the texture parameters and amounts of oleogel components, colloidal silica, and paraffin oil was evaluated as well. Correlation analysis between main components of oleogel and texture parameters was performed using Spearman's rank coefficient. Colloidal silica as the most important component due to the gelation ability showed high influence on the texture parameters. Correlation coefficients between the amount of Aerosil and cohesiveness, consistency, firmness, and index of viscosity were 
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.978, 
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.977, 
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.966, and

   <span class="italic"> Candida albicans </span>strain on solid medium and colonial morphology differed from control, especially in size, and the smallest colonies were detected in the presence of thyme oil with concentration of 0.125% [
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Concentration of thymol in the essential oil varies from 20% to 54% in all species of thyme and
   <span class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris</span> as well. Plenty of results of biological activity dependence on concentrations of active substances are published. According to the results of quantitative analysis of oleogel, which demonstrated decreasing concentration of active ingredients, and antimicrobial test results of this study, it was decided to formulate oleogels with 0.1% of essential oil of thyme.
