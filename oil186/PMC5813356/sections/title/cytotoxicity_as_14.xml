 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A tetrazolium salt colorimetric method has been used to determine survival of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) as described by Bero et al., 2009, with minor modifications [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay is based on the conversion of MTT into formazan crystals by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in living cells. The solutions of essential oils were prepared in DMSO at 20 mg/ml. The essential oils and compounds were firstly diluted in medium in eight serial threefold dilutions (0.5-100 μg/ml, 3 wells/concentration) in 96-well microtiter plate. Secondly, 20 μl of diluted solutions were transferred to 180 μl of 5 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> cells previously incubated during 24 h. Finally, after 72 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by a 10% MTT solution (3 mg/ml in PBS) in fresh medium and after 45 min, the medium was replaced again by 100μl of DMSO added to solubilize formed formazan crystals. Absorbance was recorded at 570 and 620 nm on a SpectraMax M2e (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer. Camptothecin was used as positive control at an initial concentration of 25μg/ml. Assays were performed in duplicate to calculate the CC
  <sub>50</sub>. The selectivity index (SI), expressed by the CC
  <sub>50</sub>/IC
  <sub>50</sub> ratio [
