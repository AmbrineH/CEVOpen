  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> oils were determined in CHO cells using MTT assay. The obtained finding indicated significant cytotoxicity of the essential oils and the tested pure compounds on CHO cells with CC
  <sub>50</sub> range from 27.79 to &gt;100 μg/ml (Table

  <span class="italic">R</span>-(+)-limonene (CC
  <sub>50</sub> = 29.65 μg/ml) and LSEO 2013 (CC
  <sub>50</sub> = 27.79 μg/ml) had the highest cytotoxic effect on cells compared to the other samples. LEO 2013, LEO 2015, SEO 2015, LSEO 2015 and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>-(-)-limonene exhibited a similar low cytotoxic effect (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05).

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selectivity index (SI) for LEO extracted in 2013 and 2015 and LSEO 2013 were 4.86, 4.15 and 4.29, respectively, showing that they were less toxic on CHO cells than 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> parasites. However, in all cases, they are lower than 10, the minimum value defined for the selection of an anti-parasitic hit [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Thus these oils could perhaps be used safely at therapeutic concentration in short term treatments but 
  <span class="italic">R</span>- (+)-limonene (SI=1.79) cannot be considered as a drug candidate for the development of anti-leishmanial agents.
