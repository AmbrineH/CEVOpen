 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of the constituents was based on comparison of retention times with those of reference data or pure compounds based on their LRIs with the series of n-hydrocarbons. Moreover, identification of compounds also used gas chromatography-chemical ionization mass spectrometry, using methanol as the chemical ionizing gas [

The identified constituents were quantified by the normalization procedure using FID data.
