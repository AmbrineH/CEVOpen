 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Literature review showed variation between chemical compositions, depending on the location and stages of development of 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span>. Reports from Oman [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], Iran [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] and the United Arab Emirates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] showed a difference between the major compounds. The comparison of the chemical composition from the different parts of our 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> with that of 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> from Oman showed that the main compounds varied [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Indeed, the main compounds of 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> from Oman were beta-phellandrene (23.3%), limonene (12.6%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (12.3%), beta-caryophyllene (11.6%), myrcene (11.3%), and alpha-phellandrene (10.9%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Another study showed that the main constituents of the EO from the aerial parts were limonene (27.3%) and α-pinene (21.9%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Furthermore, the composition of the EO varied also according to the collecting season.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> collected in May 1997 and 2001 from the United Arab Emirates showed that the major compounds were α-phellandrene (10.7–32.9%), β-caryophyllene (6.3–12.8%), β-pinene (7.6–8.0%), limonene (4.0–9.6%) and δ-3-carene (5.5–6.0%). However, the oil distilled from plants collected in April (1998) had as major components linalool (15.0%), linalyl acetate (10.6%), β-caryophyllene (9.7%) and α-terpineol (6.7%) [

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversion and degradation reactions can be involved in these changes because of the metabolic relation between terpenoid biosynthesis and the effect of different factors such as temperature or light. This was already observed i.e. for laurel and fennel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The differences in composition observed between our results and those of the previous works might be related to the analyzed plant part (leaves, stems, leaves+stems and aerial part), the geographic origin of the populations, the ecological conditions in which they grow and also chemical instability or transformation, but may also suggest the existence of a new chemotype.
