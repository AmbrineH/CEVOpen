 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results showed that the chemical composition varied according to the year of collection. Though major compounds remain almost the same, qualitative and quantitative variations in the composition of the EOs can be observed between the two years of collection, with some minor compounds identified only in one type of samples. Variation in the composition were also observed in the re-analyzed volatile oils, showing stability concerns. The essential oils and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>-(+)-limonene showed moderate anti-leishmanial activity. Their IC
  <sub>50</sub> range from 6.48 to 50.28 μg/ml. Cytotoxicity assays for theses volatile extracts, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>- (+)-limonene and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>- (-)-limonene on CHO cells showed relatively potent cytotoxicity with a selectivity index &lt;10. Their CC
  <sub>50</sub> range from 27.79 to 82.56 μg/ml.
