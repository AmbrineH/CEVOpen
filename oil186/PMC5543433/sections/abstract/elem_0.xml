  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we assessed chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 
   <span class="italic">C. limon</span> essential oil (
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO) with its preservative effect against 
   <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> inoculated in minced beef meat. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the major components of the obtained 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO. The antioxidant activities of this 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO were determined according to the β-carotene bleaching assay, as well as by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For antimicrobial activity, agar well diffusion method was used and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as well as the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined. The in situ effect of the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was evaluated through physicochemical parameters (pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as against 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> in minced beef meat model.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty one components were identified in the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO and the two dominant compounds were limonene (39.74%) and β-Pinene (25.44%). This 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) of 15.056 μg/ml and a strong β-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120 min of incubation with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> of 40.147 μg/ml. The MICs varied from 0.039 to 1.25 mg/ml for Gram positive bacteria and from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/ml for Gram-negative bacteria. The meat preserving potential of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was investigated against 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>. 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO successfully inhibited development of 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> in minced beef meat. The application of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO at a 0.06 and 0.312 mg/g, may open new promising opportunities for the prevention of contamination from and growth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>, during minced beef meat storage at 4 °C. Additionally, during storage period, physicochemical values (pH and TBARS) were higher in control meat than treated meat with 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO suggesting an efficient antioxidant activity of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO.
