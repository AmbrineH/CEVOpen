 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty one components were identified in the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO and the two dominant compounds were limonene (39.74%) and β-Pinene (25.44%). This 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) of 15.056 μg/ml and a strong β-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120 min of incubation with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 40.147 μg/ml. The MICs varied from 0.039 to 1.25 mg/ml for Gram positive bacteria and from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/ml for Gram-negative bacteria. The meat preserving potential of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was investigated against 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO successfully inhibited development of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> in minced beef meat. The application of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO at a 0.06 and 0.312 mg/g, may open new promising opportunities for the prevention of contamination from and growth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>, during minced beef meat storage at 4 °C. Additionally, during storage period, physicochemical values (pH and TBARS) were higher in control meat than treated meat with 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO suggesting an efficient antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO.
