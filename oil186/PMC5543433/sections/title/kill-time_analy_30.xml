  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on viable counts of 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117

 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Controlling 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> in food has become a major preoccupation in the food industry and storage. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the efficacy of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO to repress the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117 in raw minced meat beef under storage at 4 °C. Therefore, the effect of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117 was investigated to confirm its effect and clarify its action mechanism. The kinetics was performed using different concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO (2 MIC and 3MIC). As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, at day 0, the number of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> was found to be the same for all meat samples (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Over the storage period at 4 °C, numbers of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> were higher in untreated samples than treated samples with 0.06 and 0.312 mg of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO /g of raw minced meat beef: at a concentration of 2 and 3 MIC, growth of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> count was reduced by 2.5 log cycles after 4 and 6 days of storage at 4 °C respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).

 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Equally, the storage time had a significant effects (

  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO at 0.06 and 0.312 mg have a significant effect (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) on the growth of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>. The number of 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> remains below a significant value (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) till the end of the experiment (10 days). In fact, the addition of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO at 2 and 3 MIC could substantially delay 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) during raw minced meat beef storage at 4 °C.
