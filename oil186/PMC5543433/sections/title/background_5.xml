  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> are the most important crops in the world in terms of production according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), with 240,780 million metric tons produced in 2013 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> plants are grown in many countries all over the world and among the major African citrus-producing countries is Tunisia. Thus, 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> would be considered as one of the most economically important crops in Tunisia. The genus 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> belongs to the 
  <span class="italic">Rutaceae</span> family that comprises of about 140 genera and 1300 species and, for instance, 
  <span class="italic">Citrus limon</span> (Lemon) is among important species of genus 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Essential oils were composed of many valuable natural products that may be described as mixtures of hydrocarbons, oxygenated compounds and nonvolatile residues. They include terpenes, sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, alcohols, esters and sterols [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> plants constitute one of the main sources of essential oil, which are extensively studied for their potential uses in the food industry [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foods contaminated with 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</span> O157:H7 and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> has been reported as the causal agents of foodborne diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. One of the most important psychrotrophic food pathogens related to anaerobically packed cooked meat products and shelf-life failures of conserved foods is 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span>. This organism is the causal agent of listeriosis, a disease that can be serious and is often fatal in susceptible individuals, caused by eating contaminated food [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Thus, to prevent contamination during the production, sale and distribution and to extend the shelf life time of raw and/or processed foods, synthetic additives should be used. However, there is a strong debate about the safety aspects of these chemical preservatives since they are considered responsible for many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes as well as residual toxicity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Thus, a growing attention is being paid to plants and herbs naturally derived compounds as a new alternative to prevent the proliferation of microorganism and protect food from oxidation. Generally, little information exists on the in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oils against food-borne pathogens in meat. To the best of our knowledge, the antimicrobial activity of 
  <span class="italic">Citrus limon</span> essential oil (
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO) against a wide range of food-associated microorganisms (bacteria, moulds, and yeasts) has not been studied. The purposes of the present work were (i) to evaluate the chemical composition of Tunisian lemon EO (
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO) by GC-MS, (ii) to study in vitro the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO, (iii) to assess the effect of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on physicochemical of raw minced beef meat stored at 4 °C, and (iv) to determine the efficacy of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO in inhibiting 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> growth in raw minced beef meat during refrigerated storage.
