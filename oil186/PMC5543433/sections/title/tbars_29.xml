 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TBARS values represent the content of secondary lipid oxidation products, mainly aldehydes and carbonyls of hydrocarbons, which cause off-aromas in meat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Over the storage period, TBARS values were higher in control samples (C) than treated samples (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The lowest TBARS values (0.55 ± 0.12 mg of malonaldhyde/kg) were achieved by treatment T4 after 10 days. It has been reported that an index of 2 was considered the limiting threshold for the acceptability of oxidised beef [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. These results indicated that 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO/BHT (T
  <sub>4</sub>) exhibited higher antioxidant performance compared with 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO treatments (T
  <sub>1</sub> and T
  <sub>2</sub>). However, antioxidant effects of BHT at 0.01% (T
  <sub>3</sub>) can not be ignored. Furthermore, those treated samples (T1, T2 and T3) were noted to remain below the detection limit (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The antioxidant performance of 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> EO could be attributed to their phenolic contents found in leaves [
