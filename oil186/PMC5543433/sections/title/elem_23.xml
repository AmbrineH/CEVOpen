  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil obtained from the fresh flowers of 
   <span class="italic">C. limon</span> by hydrodistillation had a light yellow colour. The oil yield was 3% (volume/fresh weight). The 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty one different components were identified in the EO of 
   <span class="italic">Citrus limon</span>. The identified components, with their relative percentages and the retention time, are given in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The analyses revealed a complex mixture of the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO consisting mainly of hydrocarbon monoterpene, oxygenated monoterpene and nitrogen compounds. Nine major detected components were found to be: β-Pinene (25.44%), Limonene (39.74%), Linalool (2.16%), α-Terpineol (7.30%), linalyl acetate(3.01%), Acétate geranyl (3.03%), Nerolidol (6.91%), Acetate neryl (1.74%) and Farnesol (4.28%). The minor components (&lt; 1%) were identified as: α-Pinene (0.46%), Sabinene (0.44%), Myrcene (0.36%), 1,8-cineol (0.54%), cis-linalool oxide (0.53%) and Geranial (0.43%). In our experiment, the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO isolated from Tunisian lemon samples contains the above-mentioned four predominant ingredients with different percentage. On the other hand, Ahmad et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] reported that also limonene was the major chemical constituent in Indian oil. However, our results were different percentage from the reported one. From our experiment we observed that the percentage of chemical composition and predominant ingredients was not constant. The percentage of active ingredients in the essential oil from the natural samples is depends on geographical distribution as well as the environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, altitude, hours of sunshine, etc. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. On the other hand, the activities such as biological and chemical activities are always depends on the active ingredients in the oil [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. The active ingredient such as limonene, α-pinene, β-pinene and β-myrcene are used in perfumes industry, flavorings and medicines as a local antiseptic and anesthetic [

  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants with radical scavenging property and antioxidant capacity are useful for medicinal applications and as food additive. So, in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging method by comparing with the activity of the Ascorbic acid as a known antioxidant. The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH
   <span class="sup">.</span> by donation of hydrogen atom or an electron [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. If the extracts have the capacity to scavenge the DPPH free radical, the initial blue/purple solution will change to a yellow colour due to the formation of diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of the different 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to those of ascorbic acid, used as positive control, and appreciated by the determination of the IC
   <sub>50</sub> values. As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, DPPH test revealed that the free radical-scavenging activity was a dose dependent manner. From the analysis of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, we can conclude that the radical-scavenging activity of the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO and positive controls ascorbic acid increased with increasing concentration (

  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity may be ascribed to the presence of the same chemical components. Monoterpenes found in this essential oil may act as radical scavenging agents. It seems to be a general trend that the essential oils which contain monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes have greater antioxidative properties [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. These activities may be attributed to the presence of 1,8-cineol, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene found in 
   <span class="italic">C. limon</span> essential oils. Essential oils are quite complex mixtures constituted by several tens of components, and this complexity makes it often difficult to explain the activity pattern. For this reason, many reports on the antioxidant potentials of the essential oils often refer to concepts such as synergism, antagonism and additivity.
  </p>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monoterpene hydrocarbons; particularly terpinolene, α- and γ-terpinene, could also be taken into account for the antioxidative activity observed, but obviously, none has stronger than that of oxygenated monoterpenes. The presence of strongly activated methylene groups in these molecules is probably the reason for this behavior. On the other hand, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives have very low antioxidant activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The findings above showed the presence of natural antioxidant property in 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO, which are better than that of BHT, a very efficient synthetic antioxidant agent which is widely used in food technology. Basically, interest has increased noticeably in the research of naturally occurring antioxidants for use in foods or medicinal materials as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, which are being limited because of their possible toxicity [

  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies investigating the action of essential oils against food spoilage organisms and food borne pathogens agree that, generally, essential oils are slightly more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. That Gram-negative organisms are less susceptible to the action of antibacterials is perhaps to be expected, since they possess an outer membrane surrounding the cell wall, which restricts diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through its lipopolysaccharide covering. However, our results show that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to the investigated oil, with a range of 0.039 to 1.25 mg/ml than Gram-negative bacteria in the range of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/ml, which has been confirmed and extended in the present studies. From a comparison of our results with values reported in the literature, it is interesting the oil showed an antimicrobial effect in the concentration range as the most active essential oils [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The antimicrobial activity of essential oils is believed to be associated with phytochemical components. Essential oils are volatile and odorous principles of plant secondary metabolism which have wide applications in food flavoring and preservation industries [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Recently, some researchers have reported that monoterpene or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives, which are the major components of essential oils, exhibit potential antimicrobial activities [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. These findings strongly supported the results of this study as the essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">C. limon</span> s was also found to contain these components, which confirmed its efficacy as natural antimicrobial agent.
  </p>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity was evaluated against 
   <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> sp., 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> sp. and 
   <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span>. Results showed a strong inhibitory effect of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on the growth of 
   <span class="italic">A. niger</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> with inhibition zone diameters of 26 mm and MIC values of 0.625 and 0.312 mg/ml respectively (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Also, the 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO exhibited an antifungal activity against 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> sp. and 
   <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> sp., which are responsible for spoilage of many foods. The maximal inhibition zone diameters were 17–21 mm and MIC values ranged from 0.625 to 1.25 mg/ml (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). The high antifungal activity may be attributed to the presence of the said chemical components in the essential oil. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of 
   <span class="italic">C. limon</span> apparently related to its terpenes type components such as pinene, myrcene and limonene (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), since there is a relationship between the chemical structures of the most abundant oils and their antimicrobial activities. Limonene has been shown to have strong antifungal properties [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Although the mechanism of action of terpenes is not fully understood, it is thought to involve membrane disruption by the lipophilic compounds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. The essential oils containing terpenes are also reported to possess antimicrobial activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], which are consistent with our present studies.

  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Controlling 
   <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> in food has become a major preoccupation in the food industry and storage. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the efficacy of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO to repress the growth of 
   <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117 in raw minced meat beef under storage at 4 °C. Therefore, the effect of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on 
   <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117 was investigated to confirm its effect and clarify its action mechanism. The kinetics was performed using different concentrations of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO (2 MIC and 3MIC). As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, at day 0, the number of 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> was found to be the same for all meat samples (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Over the storage period at 4 °C, numbers of 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> were higher in untreated samples than treated samples with 0.06 and 0.312 mg of 
   <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO /g of raw minced meat beef: at a concentration of 2 and 3 MIC, growth of 
   <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> count was reduced by 2.5 log cycles after 4 and 6 days of storage at 4 °C respectively (Fig.
