 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Radical scavenging activity of the different fractions was determined using DPPH radical as a reagent according to the method of Kirby and Schmidt with some modifications [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Briefly, 1 ml of a 4% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) solution of DPPH radical in ethanol (PubChem CID: 702) was mixed with 500 μl of sample solutions (different concentrations). The mixture was incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease of the absorbance at 517 nm. Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates higher free radical scavenging activity. Ascorbic acid was used as standard. DPPH radical scavenging activity (%) was calculated according to the formula: DPPH radical scavenging activity (%) = [(OD
  <sub>blank</sub> − OD
  <sub>sample</sub>)/OD
  <sub>blank</sub>] × 100.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OD
  <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents except the tested compound. OD
  <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test compound. Extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
