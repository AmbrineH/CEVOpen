 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feed was analysed as described previously [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref010">10</a>]. Feed dry matter was determined by oven drying at 105°C, ash by ashing at 550°C [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref011">11</a>], and fat by extraction with petroleum ether in a Soxtec 1045 apparatus (Tecator, Höganäs, Sweden). The crude fibre content was analysed according to AOAC official methods [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref012">12</a>]. The crude protein content of the feed was assayed using a Kjeltec Auto 1030 (Tecator, Höganäs, Sweden). Feed calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were determined after ashing of the samples. The total P in the diets was analysed using a vanadate-molybdate reagent [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref013">13</a>]. The calcium content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Solar M6 instrument (TJA Solutions, Cambridge, UK). The phytate P contents of the diets were determined using a capillary isotachophoretic method [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref014">14</a>]. Total lipids were extracted from the diets, hepatic tissue and breast muscle with 2:1 chloroform-methanol according to Folch et al. (1957) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref015">15</a>]. Alkaline trans-methylation of FAs was carried out according to ISO 5509. An HP 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed DB-23 capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) was employed to determine the FA profile. The Cr content in ileal samples was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Solaar M6 instrument (TJA Solutions, Cambridge, UK).
