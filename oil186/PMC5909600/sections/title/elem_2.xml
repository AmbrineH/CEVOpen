  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment was conducted on 240-day-old Ross 308 cockerels. The chickens were randomly allocated to four groups of 60 birds each and housed in pens (2 x 1.1 m) on wood shavings, with 20 chickens per pen. The experimental room was provided with gas heating and ventilation with a temperature-controlled fan. Each pen was equipped with 7 nipple drinkers, 3 pan feeders and a feed hopper. The temperature in the room at arrival was 32°C and gradually decreased to 20°C as the birds reached 28 days of age. The light cycle consisted of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness. In the 1
   <span class="sup">st</span> group (control), the fat supplement was substituted with wheat starch. The following fat sources were used: rapeseed oil (2
   <span class="sup">nd</span> group), lard (3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> group), and palm oil (4
   <span class="sup">th</span> group). Rapeseed oil and refined palm oil were supplied by Fabio Produkt, Ltd. (Jičín, Czech Republic), and lard was purchased from a local shop. All supplements were added at 60 g/kg diet. Chromic oxide was mixed with the diets at 3.0 g/kg and used to measure the ileal digestibility of fatty acids. The chickens were fed one type of diet from the start to the end of the experiment (days 1–28 of age); the diets differed in the source of fat.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stabilized liver tissue samples (20 mg) were extracted for total cellular RNA using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was examined spectrophotometrically using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to estimate the RNA concentration and purity. Total RNA was used as a template for one-step PCR using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). The RT-PCR mixtures contained 5 μL of 2x QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Mastermix, 0.4 μL of QuantiTect RT Mix (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), 0.3 μL of each forward and reverse primer (0.3 μM), and 1 μL of RNA template. The total RNA was diluted one hundred-fold to reduce possible inhibitory effects, and each reaction contained approximately 10–20 ng of RNA. The total volume was brought to 10 μL per reaction with an appropriate amount of RNase-free distilled water. The QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit contained ROX as a passive reference dye. Real-time PCR and data analysis were performed on 384-well plates using a 7900HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50°C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 15 min and 40 PCR cycles with denaturing at 94°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72°C for 15 seconds. Each sample was measured in triplicate. After PCR amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed.
