 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At 28 days of age, all chickens were weighed. Five cockerels with an average live weight within the group were selected from each replication (15 birds/group) and slaughtered by decapitation. These chickens were eviscerated, and their livers were removed and stored at -70째C until further analysis. The left breast muscle (

  <span class="italic">pectoralis major</span>) was excised and stored at -18째C for later analysis. Abdominal fat pads were collected. The contents of the ileum between the Meckel's diverticulum and the ileo-caecal-colonic junction were collected and pooled for 3 birds to yield 5 samples per treatment. Samples were freeze-dried and used for the determination of the FA, fat, and Cr
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> concentrations. The livers were excised, and approximately 0.2 g tissue samples were immediately submerged in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), followed by overnight storage at 4째C. The remaining liver tissue was kept at -20째C until analysis.
