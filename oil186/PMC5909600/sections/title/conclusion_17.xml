 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, three fat supplements with different fatty acid profiles were compared in the diets of broiler chickens. The digestibilities of the fatty acids in rapeseed oil and lard were higher than that in palm oil. The use of rapeseed oil in the diets of broiler chickens provided the optimum composition of fatty acids in the breast meat and fat. The mRNA expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism is consistent with this opinion.</p>
