 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, the scientific literature has paid attention to the relationship between saturated fat in diets and the mortality rate. According to a meta-analysis published in 2015 [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-15-00651">12</a>], the correlation between the consumption of saturated fats and all-cause mortality is zero. This consideration is confirmed by the PREDIMED study [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-15-00651">40</a>] conducted in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Unsaturated trans fats are the only fatty acids associated with an increased risk. In literature, different studies have evaluated the effect of various dietary fats on coronary mortality: in particular, in 2016 The NutriCODE group showed that a favourable impact (âˆ’11%) on coronary mortality would be obtained by adequately increasing polyunsaturated-fat omega-6 consumption, while the reduction of saturated fats within 10% indicated by the guidelines would only translate to a reduction of 1% in the same coronary mortality. On a global scale, the reduction of saturated fats would produce results of modest importance [

The evaluation of the effects of palm oil on cardiovascular health and on all-cause mortality is more complex for the lack of specific data. The only relevant indirect data is the absence of correlation between the levels of palmitic acid absorption and coronary risk in a study of American nurses, at least for consumption up to 10% of total calories [
