In 2016, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) produced a document on the risks related to the consumption of refined vegetable oils. In particular, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) warned of the presence of substances formed during the production process, particularly when vegetable oils are refined at high temperatures (approximately 200 Â°C); the oils undergo partial hydrolysis of triglycerides with glycerol oxidation, leading to the formation of 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) and 2-mono-chloropropanediol (2-MCPD) [

The highest levels of these compounds were observed in palm oil, but the majority of refined vegetable oils contain considerably large quantities. Interestingly, while refined palm oil might contain high amounts of MCPD, raw palm oil might be considered healthy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2012, the Codex Alimentarius recommended the use of technological adjustments to reduce the levels of 3-MCPD in the finished product. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that there was no evidence to suggest that 3-MCPD is not genotoxic, and the same agency had already classified glycidol in the 2a group (i.e., probably carcinogenic to humans) in 2000 [

In a careful review of the scientific literature, we focused on nutritional characteristics and health effects of the use of palm oil with regards to children, seeking to determine whether there is evidence that justifies fears about the health effects of palm oil.
