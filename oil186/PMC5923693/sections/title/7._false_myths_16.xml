 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After careful evaluation of the literature, we reviewed the portrayal of palm oil role in mass media. Biscuit packaging seems to project the notion of better quality by quite simply adding the label “without palm oil”, suggesting that the absence of palm oil makes any food more desirable and safer for one’s health. This conception a mistake. To date, there is no evidence that palm oil is a threat to be avoided; it is more relevant to understand the amounts written on the label, paying attention to the quantity of saturated fats contained in the food, rather than which fat is used. Eliminating palm oil does not guarantee the greater quality of the product. Therefore, it is necessary to debunk some myths and state some truths.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is false that palm oil is dangerous for one’s health. The balance between saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fats does not make it more damaging than other fats. The warning to not exceed total saturated fat limits remains valid [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the fact that palm oil contains toxic substances, it is true that according to the EFSA, toxic substances like GE, 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD can be found in palm oil. These contaminants derive from the transformation processes used: they are not part of the oil’s makeup, but rather consequences of production process errors [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is false that substituting palm oil with other oils is an advantage for the consumer. It depends on the fat with which it is substituted and on the total percentage of saturated fats contained in the product [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, it is only partially true that palm oil is bad for the environment. Palm oil is one of the most profitable resources of tropical regions, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, allowing for economic development. However, environmental damage does exist: from 1990 to 2014, Indonesia lost an extended forestland area with considerable damages inflicted by deforestation. Therefore, in 2013 The Palm Oil Innovations Group set the goal of improve respect for the environment, avoiding deforestation and mistreatment of workers [
