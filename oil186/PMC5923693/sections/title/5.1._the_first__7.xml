 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dietary fats represent the main energy source during the first years of life, and they perform a crucial role in nurslings’ growth and development, especially for premature neonates, because they are among the constituents of the nervous and retinal tissue.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The newborn must immediately switch the main source of calories form glucose (placenta) to fats (breast milk) [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-15-00651">24</a>]. The composition of human milk is adapted to the needs of newborns and thus represents the gold standard on which to base infant formulas. In the absence of breast milk, formulas play a crucial role in ensuring the correct intake of nutrients.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In human milk, unsaturated fatty acids, including optimal percentages of essential fatty acids (α-linolenic and linoleic), are more prevalent than saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids, 50% of which consist of palmitic acid, account for 40% of total fat. Moreover, the particular stereospecific distribution of the different fatty acid triglycerides guarantees advantageous absorption. The differences between breast milk versus bovine milk are essentially qualitative; this is the reason why bovine milk is enriched with oleic acid and saturated lauric, myristic and palmitic acids [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-15-00651">24</a>]. In breast milk, palmitic acid is esterified at the sn-2 position, while in formulas it is often found in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions, leading to less absorption and more solid faeces, which are typical in artificial breastfeeding.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vegetal oils that are rich in saturated fatty acids, including some tropical oils (such as palm and coconut oils), are used for formulas in order to increase their energetic value [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-15-00651">25</a>]. In addition, the inter-esterification process induces favourable effects in infant formula, as the absorption of palmitic acid increases [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-15-00651">25</a>]. Recently, Sanders has demonstrated that palmitic acid in sn-2 can reduce postprandial lipemia, confirming the joint FAO/WHO study of 2008 [
