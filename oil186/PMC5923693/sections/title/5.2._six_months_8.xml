 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weaning is an important dietary change: the caloric contribution of lipids decreases from 50 to 35–40% at 24 months owing to a progressive increase in the amount of carbohydrates, which will continue into adulthood [

It is difficult, however, to determine the specific metabolic effects of a particular fatty acid and how much it influences the lipid profile in subsequent life phases. It is still difficult to understand the roles of various factors (i.e., gender, degree of excessive weight, distribution of body fat, level of motor activity, composition of macronutrients in the diet) on the optimal dietary lipid profile [
