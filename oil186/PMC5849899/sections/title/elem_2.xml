  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using industrial boilers, EOs of thyme leaves was extracted by hydrodistillation method in which the EO extraction efficiency was equal to 1.1%. The extraction efficiency for thyme has been previously reported as 1.66% (Moosavy et al., 
   <a rid="fsn3557-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3557-bib-0015">2008</a>), which was generally influenced by many factors, such as the plant leaves to water ratio, time, and temperature of extraction process. Initially, thyme was sun dried and the EO was extracted using hydrodistillation method in semi‐industrial boilers (manufactured by Kashan‐Iran Taghtiran Co.). For extraction of thyme EO, the proportion of water to dry leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Zataria multiflora</span> was 800/100 (l/kg). Furthermore, the EO of clove was purchased from a Shargh Osareh Co. (Chenaran Industrial Estate, Mashhad, Iran). Oil extraction efficiency (weight basis) was calculated from the following equation (Shukla, Kumar, Singh, &amp; Dubey,
