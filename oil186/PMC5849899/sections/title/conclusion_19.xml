 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study it was found that EOs of thyme and clove have antifungal activity, so clove EO in PDA and PDB media and Iranian white cheese completely prevented the growth of 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production. EO of thyme also with lower inhibitory potential compared with clove EO decreased 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production. It was found that the inhibitory potential of each of the EOs in the PDB medium is more than PDA medium, plus deterrence potential of EOs of thyme and clove in a food environment was more than laboratory culture media. Finally, due to strong antifungal effects of EOs of thyme and clove, they can be used as a mold inhibitor in food. However, it is necessary that further studies to be done in the field of economic value and organoleptic effects of each of the EOs in the food.
