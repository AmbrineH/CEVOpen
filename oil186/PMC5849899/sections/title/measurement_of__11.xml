  <sub>1</sub> in food samples
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, high‐performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the level of aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> in each treated samples of EOs in PDA and PDB medium. For this purpose, 50 μl of condensed sample and various dilutions of the standard solution were spot on the chromatography plates coated with silica (G‐HR type, 20 × 20 cm and unsaturated with a thickness of 25 mm). The solvent system composed of ether, methanol, and water with volume ratios of 96, 3, and 1, respectively, were used to separate all four components of aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub>. The solvent system was poured in the tank and the door was closed. After development of the plates to 1.5 cm from the edge of top of the plate, chromatography plates were removed from the tank, and dried under the hood. To confirm the presence of aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub>, trifluoroacetic acid was sprayed on the plates. The spots were examined under ultraviolet light and their exact location was marked with a needle. The marked locations were completely scraped and transferred to test tubes. To each tube, 2 ml of methanol was added and kept in the refrigerator. The tubes were then removed from the refrigerator and after mixing for 5 min they were centrifuge at 330
  <span class="italic">g</span>. The aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> content of spots which was dissolved in methanol (supernatant phase) was carefully collected by micropipette and transferred to small containers and their absorption at 365 nm was read and compared with the standard curve to detect the amount of aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> content.
