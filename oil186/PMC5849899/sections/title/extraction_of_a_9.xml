  <sub>1</sub> test. Culture medium content was completely transferred to 100 ml beaker and 8 ml of chloroform–water mixture with ratio of 1–15 were added to the beakers, and beakers’ content was mixed for 20 min. Then the reaction mixture was filtered by filter paper and permeated into second series of beakers. The remaining solids were returned to first series of the beakers, and all steps were repeated with 7 ml of solvent mixture. Finally, the filter paper was washed with 1–1.5 ml of chloroform, and all permeate obtained were collected in the second series of the beakers. Beakers were completely dried and washed with 3 ml of methanol and the collected solutions were poured in a special container with a lid that prevented the evaporation of methanol (Mayer, Färber, &amp; Geisen,
