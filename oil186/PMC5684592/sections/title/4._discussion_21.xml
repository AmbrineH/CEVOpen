 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since weight loaded swimming is an ideal experimental model to evaluate the antifatigue capacity [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>], the length of time to swim to exhaustion indicates the degree of fatigue [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows that the time to exhaustion for rats in the fatigue group was significantly shorter than for those in the control group, indicating that the model was valid. EOM treatment remarkably prolonged the time to exhaustion in rats compared with the other three groups, suggesting that EOM has antifatigue effects superior to those of PEO.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under normal conditions, glycogen in the liver and muscle is broken down into glucose, and glucose supplies energy to exercising muscles via blood circulation. Energy use leads to the reduction of serum glucose, and the level of blood glucose is a key factor for evaluating the time to exhaustion due to exercise [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows that the EOM reduced glucose consumption, which indicates it could decrease the depletion of the energy source.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BLA is glycolytic product of carbohydrate under anaerobic conditions, and glycolysis is the principal pathway that provides an energy source for intensive exercise for a short time [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. The increase of the BLA concentration and the consequent lactic acidosis observed in skeletal muscles during exercise were the major cause of muscle fatigue [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. The results of the present study showed that EOM treatment reduced the BLA and improved glucose metabolism.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BUN is a metabolic product of proteins and amino acids and is a blood biochemical parameter related to fatigue. In general, the body will breakdown proteins only when it cannot get enough energy from glucose and fat. Therefore, BUN is often used to assess the physical load on the body. It is often used as a sensitive experimental index to evaluate exercise tolerance. The less adapted an animal is to exercise, the more the BUN level increases [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. The results of the present study showed that EOM treatment reduced the serum BUN level and indicated that the EOM had a positive effect on enhancing endurance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stress should be responsible for muscle fatigue [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. The antioxidant system in the body is weak in exercise-fatigue conditions [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>], and the SOD and GSH-Px activities are generally considered indicators of the capacity of the antioxidant defensive system [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an end-product of the radical-initiated oxidative decomposition of cell membrane lipids, so it is frequently used as a biomarker of oxidative stress [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. Figures 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" href="#fig6">6</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">7</a> show that, compared with the control group, the SOD activity decreased but the serum MDA level increased in the fatigue group. Additionally, the data showed that EOM treatment reduced the serum MDA and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px after swimming to exhaustion. The present study showed that the muscle could have been assaulted by ROS after exercising to exhaustion. It additionally suggested that the antifatigue effect of the EOM probably occurred via protection of the cell membrane by preventing lipid oxidation due to the modification of the GSH-Px and SOD activities.
