 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physical fatigue will occur sooner or later depending on the type of exercise. Physical fatigue is commonly defined as the inability to sustain or maintain voluntary activity, and it is considered to be associated with a physiological decline [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Several theories have been proposed to explain physical fatigue, including the “exhaustion theory,” the “radical theory,” and the “clogging theory.” The “exhaustion theory” proposed that depletion of energy stocks within the body, such as glucose or glycogen, could lead to fatigue. However, the “clogging theory,” that is, the excessive accumulation of blood lactic acid (BLA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), would cause metabolic disorders that would eventually result in the fatigue. The “radical theory” hypothesizes that intensive exercise could produce an imbalance between the body's oxidation system and its antioxidation system. Muscle cells have defense mechanisms that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and protect cells against exercise-induced oxidative injury [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>–
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. Recovery from exercise-induced fatigue requires repairing the damage that has occurred in the body and eliminating the metabolic products that accumulated during exercise [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are complex mixtures of strongly odoriferous volatile compounds that are synthesized in various plant organs and have diverse ecological functions [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Aromatic essential oils are frequently considered as potential new treatments [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>] for various disorders, including fatigue. For instance, Jaradat et al. [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>] showed that the inhalation of the
  <span class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</span> flower essential oil could improve athletic performance.
  <span class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</span> (L.), also known as orange or sweet orange, is a small tree in the family Rutaceae. The peel oil has antibacterial, antioxidant, or anxiolytic properties [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>–
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>], and the key compound it contains is d-limonene (73.9–97%), along with various amounts of linalool, geraniol, and nerol [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. A previous study showed that treatment with orange peel essential oil decreased oxidative injury by decreasing the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes in subjects [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>], and these effects may help prevent physical fatigue.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raudenbush et al. [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>] showed that peppermint aroma was effective on perceived physical workload, temporal workload, effort, and anxiety. Peppermint (
  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span>) is a popular herb that can be used in numerous forms (i.e., oil, leaf, leaf extract, and leaf water). The leaf oil has the most uses; it has a variety of therapeutic properties and is used in aromatherapy, bath preparations, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and topical preparations [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. Menthol (29%) and menthone (20–30%) are the major components of the peppermint leaf essential oil [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. Inhalation of peppermint essential oil improved the lung capacity and inhalation ability in healthy participants; thus Meamarbashi and Rajabi speculated this effect supply more oxygen to the brain, which could be effective in continuing physical performance [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosemary has been used in traditional medicine as a stimulant, and it has been considered as one of the most effective herbs for treating physical and mental fatigue [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Rosemary (
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> L., Lamiaceae) is a woody perennial herb, and the highest quality essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. officinalis</span> L. is obtained from the leaves. Rosemary essential oil consists mostly of monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineole (43.77%), camphor (12.53%), and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (11.51%) [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. Most pharmacological effects of rosemary are a consequence of the high antioxidant activity of its main chemical constituents, which has been mainly attributed to its major diterpenes, carnosol, and carnosic acid, as well as to the essential oil components [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> (L.), or clove, is a dried unopened flower bud of
  <span class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum</span> (L.) Merr. &amp; Perry (Family Myrtaceae) [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. The essential oil extracted from the dried flower buds of cloves is used as a topical application to relieve pain and to promote healing and is also used in the medical, fragrance, and flavoring industries [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. The major component of clove essential oil is considered to be eugenol with lesser amounts of 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene and eugenyl acetate. Eugenol is the primary constituent that has high antiradical activity [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. In addition to antioxidant activity, clove essential oil increases the content of antibody-forming lymphocyte cells in the spleen [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That is, clove essential oil may powerfully protect the cellular structure from being attacked and damaged after exercising to exhaustion.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exercise-induced fatigue is characterized by two signs: deterioration of performance is the primary sign, and tiredness/exhaustion is the secondary sign. A mixture of four essential oils may be used to treat exercise-induced fatigue: two stimulant essential oils, one relaxing essential oil and a balancing essential oil. Peppermint essential oil can increase alertness and mental clarity and decrease the perceived physical workload [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. Rosemary essential oil inspires energy and stimulates vitality [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Orange essential oil is known for its calming and soothing properties that relax the muscles [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. As a balancing essential oil, clove essential oil significantly increases the free radical scavenging capacity of the other oils, thus preventing oxidative injury during fatigue. In addition, peppermint and orange essential oils evaporate more quickly than rosemary essential oil, and clove oil volatilizes the slowest, so appropriate proportions of each oil can create a lasting balance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that peppermint essential oil, which is most widely used to prevent fatigue, significantly improves exercise performance [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Therefore, peppermint essential oil was used as a positive control in the present study, and its effects were compared to the therapeutic effects of the experimental essential oil mixture. The aim of this study was to assess the antiphysical fatigue effects of supplementation with the essential oil mixture by inhalation on the time to exhaustion, blood glucose, BLA, and other biochemical parameters.
