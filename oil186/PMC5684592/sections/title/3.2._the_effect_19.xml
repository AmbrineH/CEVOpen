  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows that the time to swim to exhaustion for the fatigue group was shorter than that for the control group (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). However, the time to swim to exhaustion of the EOM group was significantly longer than for the other three groups (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05 or 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01).
