  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>
 </div>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine morphological changes, we analyzed bright field images of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> in stationary and logarithmic phases exposed to sublethal concentrations of CNB oil for 24 h. Stationary phase 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> RSY150 cells exposed to sublethal CNB were oval and swollen, with distinct changes in chitin distribution, but with normal budding compared to control cells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>a, d). Epifluorescence images of stationary phase control RSY150 show an even distribution of chitin around the cell wall and septal region (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>a, d). In contrast, cells treated with CNB oil at 62.5 μg/mL (1/2 MIC) had an increase in chitin content in the lateral cell wall and more intense staining at septal regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>a, d). This effect was absent at lower concentrations (31.625 μg/mL; 1/4 MIC) of CNB oil.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the effects of CNB oil on metabolically active cells were distinct. Logarithmic phase cells exposed to CNB oil for 4 h at MIC and 1/2 MIC had intense chitin staining in the bud neck region and uneven lateral cell wall staining (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>b, e) compared to control cells that stained evenly at the bud and lateral wall. We also observed an increased frequency of elongated cells during exposure to CNB oil at MIC, which became less prominent at 1/2 MIC (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Figure S2a, b). The clinical isolate from blood, on the other hand, showed overall stronger staining than RSY150, with increased intensity at the bud neck upon exposure to CNB oil at MIC and 1/2 MIC (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Figure S3a). In contrast, the genital clinical isolate having a similar MIC to RSY150 showed a normal chitin distribution (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Figure S3b).

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the altered phenotype during CNB exposure at sublethal levels, we studied the impact of CNB on hyphal growth. During hyphal induction (10% serum) in the presence of CNB oil, growing hyphae had intense chitin staining at their growing tips. The intensity of chitin staining was higher in cells treated at MIC and decreased progressively as a function of CNB oil concentration, at 1/2 MIC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>c, f). At 1/4 MIC CNB the intensity of CFW staining was comparable to control, however hyphal width remained the same.
