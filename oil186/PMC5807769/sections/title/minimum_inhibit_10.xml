  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], with slight modifications. Briefly, 100 µl of CNB oil (stock concentration 1000 µg/mL) was serially diluted in triplicate in the wells of flat-bottom polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). A suspension (OD

  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> (2.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> cells/mL) in YPD was added, with appropriate positive (amphotericin B) and negative (
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> only in media) controls and a blank (CNB oil in media) included. The microtiter plates were sealed with parafilm prior to incubation at 30 °C to avoid oil evaporation, and the OD
  <sub>600</sub> recorded after 24 h (Biotek Epoch; Northern Vermont, USA). The endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound resulting in total inhibition (MIC 100%) of growth, compared to the growth in negative control wells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The MICs for cinnamaldehyde (stock concentration 450 μg/mL) and linalool (stock concentration 9.85 mg/mL) were also tested for RSY150 and RSY35 [
