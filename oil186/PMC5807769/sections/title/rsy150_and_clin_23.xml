  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> respond differently to CNB oil
 </div>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative susceptibilities of the RSY150 strain and clinical isolates to CNB oil were determined using a broth microdilution method. The planktonic growth of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> lab strains (ATCC 64548 and RSY150) was effectively inhibited by 125 μg/mL CNB oil, whereas the clinical strain isolated from blood and the ATCC 10231 strain were more resistant and required higher concentrations (250 μg/mL) of CNB oil to produce an inhibitory effect. This clinical strain isolated from blood was selected for detailed analysis and further experiments. Clinical isolates from blood and genital infections displayed varying susceptibility to CNB oil. In general, a blood isolate was resistant to CNB oil with a MIC of 500 μg/mL, whereas one genital strain was more resistant to CNB oil with a MIC at 1000 μg/mL and the other more susceptible with a MIC of 125 μg/mL. The data is summarized in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. RSY35, a mutant strain for microtubule motor protein Kar3, showed growth inhibition at 125 μg/mL of CNB oil. Similarly, the growth of RSY150 and RSY35 was inhibited by cinnamaldehyde with a MIC of 112.5 μg/mL. Both strains showed identical response to linalool with MICs at 2.46 mg/mL.
