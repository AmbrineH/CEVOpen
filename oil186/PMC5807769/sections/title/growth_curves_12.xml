  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, an overnight culture of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> RSY150 diluted to contain 2.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> cells/mL (OD
  <sub>600</sub> of 0.001) was treated with CNB oil (62.5, 31.25 and 15.1 µg/mL corresponding to 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC) in separate wells of a microtiter plate in triplicate and incubated at 30 °C [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. The OD
  <sub>600</sub> was measured at 30 min intervals for 24 h using a BioTek Synergy HTX multi-mode microplate reader (Northern Vermont, USA). Media with CNB oil was used to determine background absorbance for three independent experiments.
