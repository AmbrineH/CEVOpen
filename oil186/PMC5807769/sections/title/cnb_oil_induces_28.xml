 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RSY150 strain expressing both Tub2-GFP-and Htb-RFP was imaged by LSCM to visualize the mitotic spindle in dividing cells exposed to CNB oil. In untreated cells, the spindle varied in length for the control RSY150 strain, but it consistently spanned the distance between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a) and nuclear migration was normal. In contrast, these well-defined mitotic spindles were missing in RSY150 cells exposed to CNB oil at MIC. Furthermore, Tub2-GFP fluorescence in these cells consistently failed to show the wild type pattern of spindle formation between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>b). Instead, Tub2-GFP often had reduced fluorescence in cells undergoing nuclear division, with only several fluorescence spots visible, indicating disruption of the mitotic spindle. Cells exposed to sub MIC CNB oil had reduced spindle defects, with most of the cells in recovery phase and observed as fluorescent patches or aggregates of tubulin (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>c).

Control cells showed normal spindle formation during mitosis (arrow heads) whereas the MIC treated cells had a majority of dividing cells lacking a mitotic spindle (small arrow heads).

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RSY150 cells grown to the mid logarithmic phase and exposed to oil for 4 h were imaged by LSCM to view patterns of nuclear division and tubulin distribution in the parent cells and the bud. Budding cells with a single nucleus were considered to be pre-mitosis, representing those in the G1 or S phase. Cells with nuclei traversing the parent and budding cells were considered to be in the anaphase stage of mitosis. Finally, cells having separate nuclei in both parent and budding cells were considered to be at a post-mitotic phase, G2/M. For RSY150 control cells, 52% of the population was in the G1 or S phase; 36% of the cells had undergone mitosis; and the final 10% were in anaphase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>b, c). On the other hand, RSY150 treated with MIC of CNB oil displayed noticeable differences in cell cycle distribution, with 39% having not begun mitosis, 48% having completed mitosis, and 14% in anaphase, still undergoing nuclear division (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>c). Cells treated with 1/2 MIC were at GI phase (38%), whereas the dominant number of cells were at G2/M phase, with no change in the number of cells undergoing anaphase. Cells treated at MIC with CNB oil showed extended cells with pseudohyphal formation, however the effect was less pronounced in cells treated at 1/2 MIC, where large budding cells were observed (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Figure S2a, b). The data clearly indicate that CNB oil induces tubulin depolymerisation leading to cell cycle arrest at anaphase.

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cinnamaldehyde treated 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> showed similar morphological features to CNB oil treated cells (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>: Figure S4), with depolymerized tubulin, resulting in an absence of mitotic spindles. Overall the effect was more pronounced in cinnamaldehyde treated cells as compared to those treated with CNB oil. Cells exposed to cinnamaldehyde at MIC showed a significantly increased percentage of cells in anaphase (15.8%) as compared to control (9.6%), whereas RSY150 cells exposed to linalool were arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as previously reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. There was complete disruption of the cell wall at MIC after 4 h, with cells having depolymerized tubulin compared to controls, however the cells showed some tubulin fluorescence at 1/2 MIC, with intact cell walls (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>: Figure S4).
