   <span class="bold">b</span> The number of colonies on the CR and CFW plates show a dose dependent effect that decreases as a function of oil concentration. The 1/2 MIC CNB oil was more effective than 1/4 MIC, with a significant difference ** between 1/2 MIC oil treatment compared to untreated controls (p &lt; 0.05). The cell count was normalized with treated cells grown on YNB media agar only.

   <span class="italic">SSU81, CRH, DFG</span> and 
   <span class="italic">VPS</span>) were exposed to a twofold increasing dilution of CNB oil in a MIC assay, showing overall sensitivity to the CNB oil and indicating a moderate cell wall stress response
