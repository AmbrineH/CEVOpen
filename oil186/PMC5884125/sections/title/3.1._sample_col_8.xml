  <span class="sup">3</span>/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>, measured using EM50 Digital data logger, and pH was measured by Jenway 3505 pH meter as 8.5. The viscosity of the heavy crude oil from the well head, which contaminated the soil, was estimated as 4.57°API using RheolabQC Rotation Viscometer. The eTPH of the soil samples ranged within 3.2–4.8%.
