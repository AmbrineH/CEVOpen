  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from cultivable spore-forming bacteria by boiling suspended soil samples in 10 ml distilled water at 90°C for 30 min to kill all the vegetative cells and enrichment of the bacteria in Bushnell-Haas media (BH media) containing 1% heavy crude oil. The flasks inoculated with the boiled sample supernatant were incubated at 40°C for 24 h and plated on fresh BH agar plates to obtain pure cultures. The gDNA from the isolates and the soil samples was isolated using PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.). The nucleic acid concentration and purity were measured by Thermo Fischer NanoDrop™ 2000/2000 c spectrophotometer.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultivable spore-forming bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing using 27F and 1492R universal primers as described previously [
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], where briefly the genomic DNA was extracted using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.), and the amplification was performed using T100™ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGen). The BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems™) was used for de novo sequencing. The sequencing was done using 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Hitachi) at Central Analytical and Applied Research Unit (CAARU), Sultan Qaboos University, and was submitted to NCBI GenBank USA. The dendrogram was constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) methods, respectively, using PHYLIP, the Phylogeny Inference Package program. The ML program uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at different sites [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The metagenomics analysis of all the 10 soil samples was done following the instruction manual of the Ion PGM System. The total gDNA extracted from the soil samples was amplified using 16S Primer Sets targeting hypervariable V4 region: 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3′). The PCR procedure was with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, 25 cycles of denaturation for 30 sec at 95°C, annealing at 58°C, extension at 72°C for 20 sec, followed by holding at 72°C for 7 min and a final hold at 4°C for ∞. The amplified product was purified using Agencourt® AMPure® XP Reagent and 70% ethanol. The DNA input for library preparation was calculated using Agilent® 2100 Bioanalyzer® and the library was prepared using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit, following the user instructions. The pooled short amplicons were end-repaired using 5x End Repair Buffer and End Repair Enzyme and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent and 70% ethanol. Barcoded libraries were prepared using Ion Xpress™ Barcode Adapters 1–16 Kit. The adapters are ligated using DNA Ligase and the nicks were repaired using Nick Repair Polymerase. The DNA template for Ion PGM System was prepared using the Ion PGM Template OT2 400 Kit and the Ion OneTouch™ 2 System following the instructions in Ion PGM Template OT2 400 Kit User Guide. And the library was sequenced using the Ion Personal Genome Machine® (PGM™) System and the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 Kit.</p>

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were formed at 97% similarity (3% divergence) using UCLUST after removing singleton sequences [
