  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A quantity of 25 g of the sample was weighed in a sterile bag and 225 ml of a 0.14% peptone water diluent solution was added and homogenized with a stomacher for 2 min. From the mixture, a series of dilutions for microbial culture were prepared in the form of 1:10 according to the type of microorganism (Pexara, Metaxopoulos, &amp; Drosinos,

   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>. The coagulase test was performed as follows: the suspicious colonies were transferred to tubes containing 0.3 ml of heart and brain juice and mixed well, and then cultured on a tryptic soy agar diagonal agar using a culture loop. Both the liquid and solid cultures were incubated for 24–18 hr at 37°C. Solid culture was used for storage for confirmatory tests, if necessary. To a culture medium, about 0.5 ml of plasma was added and mixed, the tube containing the culture was re‐incubated at 37°C and were examined for clot formation at intervals of up to 6 hr, and in case of clot formation, 4+ and 3 +  clots were reported as positive coagulase (Downes &amp; Ito,
