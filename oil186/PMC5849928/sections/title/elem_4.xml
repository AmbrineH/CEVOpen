  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, three microorganisms were used: 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> ATCC14028, 
   <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 65138, and 
   <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> O157: H7. The microorganisms were collected from the Iranian Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. At first, bacteria were cultured in a Muller‐Hinton Agar medium for 18 hr at 37°C. The re‐culture was then taken from the first culture and kept at 37°C for 18 hr. The second culture was mixed to form a stoic with a ratio of 1–5 with sterile glycerin. In 100 μl volumes, It was kept at −20°C in eppendorf tubes, in 100 μl volumes. (Hosseinzadeh et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequent concentrations of the anise essential oil (100, 125, 150, 175, 200, etc.) were prepared in Muller‐Hinton medium containing 5% Dimethyl Sulfoxide. In this method, plates of 96 houses were used with round holes and 300 μl volume. Then, 100 μl of essential oil was transferred to each well and 20 μl of bacterial suspension was added. The contents of each well were mixed for 2 min by the Shaker‐equipped Plate Reader. Then, light absorption was read using a plate reader at zero and at 630 nm length. Plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hr and after completing the incubation, cloudiness or lack of cloudiness were observed in the wells and light absorption was read using Plate Reader at the wavelengths (Hosseinzadeh et al.,
