 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparation of chitosan‐based films</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chitosan powder (Sigma Aldrich‐America) with high molecular weight was dissolved in 1% acetic acid to give a 2% solution. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for one night and was filtered using filter paper No. 3 after addition of glycerol (0.5 ml per g of chitosan) as a plasticizer and tween 80 as an emulsifier for 30 min at room temperature, then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 using zinc. After adding the desired concentrations of AEO (v/v% 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0) was homogenized using homogenizer at 12000 g for 2 min and films were molded in Teflon‐coated dishes and dried for 36 hr at 25 ± 2°C. Prepared films were stored for 48 hr before the test in a desiccator containing sodium bromide (25 ± 2°C and 50 ± 2% RH). (Moradi, Tajik, Razavi Rohani, &amp; Oromiehie,
