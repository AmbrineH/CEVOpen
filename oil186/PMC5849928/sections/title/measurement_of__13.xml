 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stretching experiments were performed using the Instron Universal Testing Machine. The covers were cut in rectangles of 9 × 1 cm. The distance between the jaws was 5 cm and the speed of the jaws was 30 mm/min. Factors including peak force at tearing point, percentage of increase in length at tearing point (change in sample length divided by initial multiplication factor of 100) were achieved using D882‐91 method (American Test and Materials Association) from force curves according to deformation. The tensile strength of the coatings was calculated from the following equation (ASTM,
