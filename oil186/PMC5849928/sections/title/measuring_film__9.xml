 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thickness of the samples was measured with a digital micrometer (0.001Â mm, Mitutoyo made in Japan). Measurements were repeated at five points of each sample. The average thickness was calculated and used to determine the tensile strength and permeability to water vapor (ASTM,
