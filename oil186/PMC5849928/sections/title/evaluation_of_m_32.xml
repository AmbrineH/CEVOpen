 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moisture is one of the important factors in the quality of food. The results of moisture content in this study (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0001">1</a>a) showed that by increasing time, moisture content decreased significantly in all treatments (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; .05). The reason for the decrease in moisture content of the samples is the effect of proteolytic enzymes on proteins and their conversion to free amino acids and, consequently, their inability to retain moisture. The reduction in moisture content of the samples, in addition to weight loss, reduces soluble proteins, increases oxidative changes, changes the nature of the protein, changes color and, consequently, reduces product quality (Beklevik, Polat, &amp; Özogul,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At all times, the lowest moisture content was observed in control treatment, and changes in moisture content were decreased by adding the coating and essential oil. The highest moisture content was observed in chitosan + essential oil (1.5% and 2%) (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). In fact, it can be stated that the use of the transfer coating slows down the moisture between the burger and the atmosphere and allows it to control the moisture content of the uncoated treatment. Control of surface moisture content by edible coatings can significantly reduce the growth of microorganisms and the speed of their destructive reactions, thus increasing the storage time of foods (Ozdemir &amp; Floros,
