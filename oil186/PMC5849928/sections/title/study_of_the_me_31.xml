 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanical properties of a film such as tensile strength and elongation break determine its ultimate application. Tensile strength is checked through the maximum stress required to tear the film during the tensile test (Noronha, Carvalho, Lino, &amp; Barreto, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0033">2014</a>). The results for the spatial features of the film are shown in Table 
  <a rid="fsn3544-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3544-tbl-0003">3</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The addition of AEO to chitosan film increased the film tensile strength, with increased essential oil concentration, so that the highest increase in film tensile strength was observed in film chitosan + AEO 2% (21.38 MPa). Also, the results of maximum elongation break before the tear point was similar to that of the film tensile strength, so that the highest tensile strengths were observed in the chitosan + AEO 2% (12.32%) (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). The reason for this was that a strong interaction between the chitosan polymer and the AEO led to the creation of throughout connections and thus reduced the free volume and molecular mobility of the polymer. This phenomenon leads to the creation of a plate‐like structure and the arrangement of these plates as layers on one another increases the tensile strength (Hosseini et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0020">2009</a>). Also, the hydrophilicity and high molecular weight of phenolic compounds of the essential oil, reduce the effects of softening in the film and increase the tensile strength of the essential oil films (Adams, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0003">2007</a>).
