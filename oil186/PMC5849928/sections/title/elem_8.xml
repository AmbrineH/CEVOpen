  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thickness of the samples was measured with a digital micrometer (0.001 mm, Mitutoyo made in Japan). Measurements were repeated at five points of each sample. The average thickness was calculated and used to determine the tensile strength and permeability to water vapor (ASTM,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film pieces were cut in 3 × 3 mm and each was weighed. The measured value was placed as the initial weight. Sample pieces were then placed in an oven at 90°C until the final dry weight. Samples were then weighed and the value was considered as dry weight (Hosseini, Razavi, &amp; Mousavi,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To carry out this experiment, ASTM No. 96 E was used (ASTM, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0006">1996</a>). Water was poured into the cell permeability measurement for testing. Afterwards, the cell surface was coated with molten paraffin. Cells were placed inside the desiccators containing silica gel. Water at 25°C produces 100% moisture. The difference in humidity on the two sides of the coating at 25°C makes the gradient of a steam pressure equal to 2.337*10
   <span class="sup">3</span> psi. Changes in cell weight over time were measured using a digital scale with a precision of 0.0001 g. In all samples, by drawing the cell weight change curve relative to time, a straight line (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After weighing, the film pieces were put into 50 cc of distilled water and stirring was done for 6 hr at a temperature of 25°C. Then the film and water mixture was filtered in a filter paper that has already reached constant weight and was accurately weighed. The filter paper was placed at 110°C with the sample to reach constant weight. The solubility of films in water is calculated as follows: (Hosseini et al.,
