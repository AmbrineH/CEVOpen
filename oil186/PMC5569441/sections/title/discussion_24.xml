 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results in this study demonstrated anti-depressant-like activity of cinnamon in mice treated with the essential oil of cinnamon (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) with shorter duration of immobility in both FST and TST as compared to the control animals, during a 14-day regimen. These tests frequently used in animal studies, force animals to combat two different stressful situations (floating or hemodynamic stress) and show a difference in some cases (
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>). Although oil at the three applied doses showed antidepressant-like activity data of dose response was not the same as in FST, it showed a U-shape pattern of activity, while in TST it had a linear relationship. The same results were reported in the Bai 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. study on the antidepressant effect of imipramine (
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>). It seems that involved neurochemical pathways of these famous behavioral tests are not the same.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the EPM test, based on natural avoidance of mice for open area, animals spent more time in the closed area. However, animals receiving cinnamon 2 mg/kg for 14 days exhibited an anti-anxiety like effect by spending more time and more entries to the open arm of EPM.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Locomotor activities of animals decreased but had no significant difference in relation to the control group in the open field test. Consequently, cinnamon seems to have no effect on overall locomotion compared with vehicle-treated controls. Reference drug, diazepam belonging to benzodiazepines has been used for anxiety disorders; however, sedative, amnesic and dependence-inducing characteristics in repeated administrations limit its safe prescription (
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress has been highlighted in the pathogenesis of psychologic disorders such as anxiety and depressive disorders (
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>, 
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trans-cinnamaldehyde, an organic compound that gives cinnamon its flavor and odor is responsible for many biological activities observed with cinnamon. It has been reported that cinnamaldehyde constitutes 65 to 80% of cinnamon bark (
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>, 
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>). GC-MS analysis indicated that polyphenols contents were higher than other constituents in the sample essential oil of cinnamon and main polyphenolic compounds measured were trans-cinnamaldehyde, turmerone, and 
  <span class="italic">O-</span> cinnamaldehyde diethyl acetal (87.32%, 3.31%, and 2.34%, respectively). Anti-inflammatory effect of turmerone has been reported to be via microglia activation inhibition (
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a>). Trans-cinnamaldehyde represented neuroprotective activity in a model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in rats via suppressing protein levels of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway (
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>). In an investigation by Sahib, antidiabetic activity of cinnamon in poorly controlled diabetic patients was associated with increased serum levels of antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and decreased levels of malondialdehyde as a marker of lipid peroxidation in the cinnamon treated group (
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consequently, one of the potentially involved pathways in antidepressant and antianxiety activity might be antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of cinnamon, however, it needs further experimental studies to elucidate this hypothesis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another mechanism playing an important role in the molecular neurobiology of depressive disorder is decreased monoamine function in the brain, known as monoamine hypothesis (
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a>). Intravenous cinnamalde-
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">hyde increased adrenaline secretion via activating thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, mainly expressed in the sensory neurons, and induced secretion of adrenaline via the CNS (
  <a rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref39">39</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important factor in the pathogenesis of major depression is the reduction of neurotrophic factors such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">40</a>). Cinnamon and its metabolite sodium benzoate have been shown to increase the level of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, which may be of benefit for the treatment of depressive disorders (
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">41</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although cinnamon is a safe drug, a report of intraoral allergy to cinnamic aldehyde has been reported (
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">40</a>, 
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">41</a>). As a result, it should be considered with caution in patients with increased sensitivity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to a meta-analysis study, combination therapy has shown better outcomes in the treatment of depressed and anxious patients (
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">42</a>), adding cinnamon to conventional drugs would be of worth in future experimental and clinical studies for add-on or single therapy of depressed patients.
