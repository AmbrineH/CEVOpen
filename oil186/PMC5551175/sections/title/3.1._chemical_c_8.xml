 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the essential oils hydrodistilled from the six Cameroonian medicinal and aromatic plants is reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t001">Table 1</a>. In the essential oil obtained from neem leaves, a total of thirteen components were identified, accounting for 98.3% of the total composition. The oil was almost entirely composed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.4%), with germacrene B (74.0%) and γ-elemene (18.3%) as the predominant components. The minor constituents were (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (2.4%) and β-elemene (0.9%). This work represents one of the few studies on the chemical composition of neem leaf essential oils. Neem trees have been largely investigated for the oil obtained by mechanical pressure or solvent extraction from their seeds. Earlier, El-Hawary et al. [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-14-00737">46</a>] studied the composition of Egyptian neem leaves, reporting β-elemene (33.39%), γ-elemene (9.89%), germacrene D (9.72%), caryophyllene (6.8%), and bicyclogermacrene (5.23%) as the major compounds, while Dastan et al. [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-14-00737">47</a>] found γ-elemene (20.8%), germacrene B (20.3%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene (13.5%), hexadecanal (12.8%), and methyl linoleate (10.5%) as the major compounds in neem leaf oil from Iran.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of fifty-nine components were identified in the essential oil of alligator pepper, accounting for 99.4% of the total composition. The oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (83.3%), with 1,8-cineole (58.5%) and α-terpineol (19.4%) as the major compounds. Monoterpene hydrocarbons gave a minor contribution (14.9%), with β-pinene (7.1%) and α-pinene (2.0%) as the most representative compounds. Interestingly, sesquiterpenoids, which are reported as volatile marker compounds of alligator pepper, were detected in only low levels here (0.6%). The chemical composition of the 
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> seed essential oil showed a significant variability depending on the geographic origin and genetic characteristics of the samples. For example, samples from Nigeria exhibited humulene (26.23%), (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-ocimene (23.22%), (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (19.17%), and (
  <span class="italic">S</span>)-2-heptyl acetate (16.22%) as the major volatile constituents [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-14-00737">24</a>]. On the other hand, the seeds from the Central African Republic contained high levels of β-pinene (&gt;30%) and about 50% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-14-00737">48</a>], and an oil sample from Cameroon was made up of β-caryophyllene (8.5%), α-humulene (31.3%), and their epoxides (17.9% and 27.7%, respectively) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the essential oil from African cardamom leaves, accounting for 99.3% of the total composition. This oil was mainly made up of monoterpene hydrocarbons (59.8% in leaves), accompanied by lower amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (20.0%), oxygenated monoterpenes (11.0%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (8.4%). The major compounds were sabinene (43.9%) and (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (16.6%), whereas other components occurring at noteworthy levels were β-pinene (5.8%), terpinen-4-ol (3.7%), and α-pinene (2.4%). This study was the first report on the leaf essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">A. daniellii</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">C. anisata</span> was characterized by high levels of phenylpropanoids (84.0%), which were mainly represented by (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-anethole (64.6%), with minor contributions by (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-methyl isoeugenol (16.1%) and methyl chavicol (2.0%). Terpenoids constituted a minor part of this oil, being represented mostly by 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (2.9%), γ-terpinene (2.4%), myrcene (2.0%), and germacrene D (2.2%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> seeds, a total of forty-nine volatile components were identified, accounting for 76.0% of the oil’s composition. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant constituents (50.6%), with geraniol (18.2%), terpinen-4-ol (7.5%), linalool (4.0%), and umbellulone (3.8%) as the most representative compounds. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes gave a lower contribution (12.1%), with none of the identified components exceeding 1.8%. Among other components occurring in the oil, it is worth noting the presence of ligustrazin (5.1%), elemicin (3.0%), and decanoic acid (2.8%). To our knowledge, no previous research has reported the chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> seed essential oil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirty-five volatile compounds, all belonging to the sesquiterpene class (94.3%), were identified in the root essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> (54.7% sesquitepene hydrocarbons and 39.6% oxygenated sesquiterpenes). The major compounds were tricyclic sesquiterpenoids, which are characterized by multiple rearrangements of the caryophyllene cation [

  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (6.3%). The cameroonan-7-α-l, is responsible for the patchouli-like smell of the root oil [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-14-00737">52</a>]. The reported composition was quite consistent with that previously reported by Menut et al. [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-14-00737">49</a>] for root samples collected in Cameroon.
