 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds with multitarget actions, the antitrypanosomal effects of which are largely unknown and barely explored. On this basis, we decided to test the in vitro inhibitory effects of a pool of essential oils taken from medicinal and aromatic plants growing in Cameroon. Some of them are known for their traditional uses in the treatment of infectious diseases and malaria [
  <a rid="B53-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-14-00737">53</a>,
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-14-00737">54</a>] and, in the case of the Neem tree, also against 
  <span class="italic">T. b. brucei</span> [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the chemical analysis performed, they exhibited different chemical profiles characterized by diverse functionalized groups such as monoterpene hydrocarbons (African cardamom), oxygenated monoterpenes (
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>), and phenylpropanoids (
  <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>). In this context, the main aim of our work was to identify the chemical scaffolds of possible natural lead compounds against trypanosomiasis. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Testing the essential oils obtained from Cameroonian plants, we obtained various degrees of inhibition on 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> proliferation, varying from not active (
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), to moderately active (
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span>). Notably, the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values on 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> were 7.65, 10.50, and 15.21 µg/mL for the essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span>, respectively (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>). Furthermore, the most active oils were also evaluated for the growth inhibitory effects on Balb/3T3 cells as a reference. No effect on mammalian cells was observed with concentrations as high as 100 µg/mL, showing a noteworthy selectivity against 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> in comparison to mammalian cells, with selectivity indexes above 6.57 in all cases.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibitory effects on 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> exhibited by the three essential oils highlights three classes of active compounds, i.e., monoterpene hydrocarbons (for 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (for 
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">E giganteus</span> also contains high amounts of oxygenated compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxicity of monoterpene hydrocarbons against 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> can be attributed to the high hydrophobicity of this class of compounds, which are able to easily cross the cell membrane, causing the destabilization of phospholipid bilayers and the alteration of their permeability, leading to cell damage and death [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-14-00737">44</a>,
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-14-00737">55</a>]. Among these compounds, the most abundant was sabinene (43.9%) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>) which showed an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value against 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> of 5.96 µg/mL, which is close to that of the African cardamom essential oil (7.65 µg/mL) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>). Another component of this oil with detectable antitrypanosomal activity was β-pinene, showing an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 11.4 µg/mL. The antitrypanosomal activity of sabinene was already reported in a previous study, although its mechanism of action on the protozoal cell has not been elucidated [
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-14-00737">56</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> as well as 
  <span class="italic">A. daniellii</span> essential oils contained the bicyclic sesquiterpene (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>), which exhibited good inhibitory properties on 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 8.25 µg/mL). However, the content of this component is only 6.3% in 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> and can therefore not explain the good activity of this essential oil. It is rather tricyclic sesquiterpenes that are the major constituent. This is the first report documenting the antitrypanosomal activity of the tricyclic sesquiterpenes-containing 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> essential oil. The latter was a rich source of compounds such as silphiperfol-6-ene, presilphiperfolan-8-ol, presilphiperfol-7-ene, and cameroonan-7-α-l with an unusual skeleton (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>) [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-14-00737">26</a>]. To date, these compounds have not been biologically investigated. Previously, the tricyclic sesquiterpene ledol was suggested to be responsible for the trypanocidal properties of 
  <span class="italic">Hagenia abyssinica</span> (Bruce ex Steud.) J.F.Gmel. essential oil [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-14-00737">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the other pure compounds, 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol were inactive against 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>), and this also explained the lack of activity of the 
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> essential oils, which are dominated by these compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the leaf essential oil from the neem tree, which showed an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 15.21 µg/mL, can be a source of sesquiterpenes such as germacrene B and γ-elemene. Since this oil is completely dominated by sesquiterpenes (97.4%), it can be assumed that they are responsible for its antitrypanosomal activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate their mode of action and the possibility of them acting as lead compounds for the discovery of antitrypanosomal drugs.
