 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the nutritional composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. The present study indicated that the kernels contain high levels of protein and lipid. The mineral composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels reveal a very good source of fundamental minerals and micronutrients. Furthermore, the kernels can be considered as a potential dietary source of linoleic and oleic acid. From a nutritional point of view, our present results suggest that 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels have a high nutritional value and may contribute to a healthy diet. The utilization of kernels as a by-product from processing of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> fruit will generate applications as a source of food supplement ingredients for essential fatty acids and can represent an alternate source of protein in the food and feed industry. Ongoing studies on the quality aspects of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels will also include bioaccessibility and bioavailability to substantiate the nutritional value and potential health effects of this unexploited by product.
