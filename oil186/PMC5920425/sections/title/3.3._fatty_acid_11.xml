 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Fatty Acid Composition</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acids can be considered the main constituent of all oils and may include saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids [
  <a rid="B25-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-07-00060">25</a>]. Besides providing high-quality food, vegetable oils can also provide essential nutrients that have a particular clinical significance. PUFA are present in membrane phospholipids in some tissues and can also act as precursors for prostaglandin hormones [
  <a rid="B28-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-foods-07-00060">28</a>]. On the other hand, SFA are reported to increase cardiovascular disease risk and sometimes can potentiate the risk of cancer and autoimmune disorders [
  <a rid="B29-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-foods-07-00060">29</a>]. The principal fatty acid components in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels were palmitic (SFA, 12%); oleic (MUFA, 29.3%); and linoleic (PUFA, 50.2%) acids (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t002" href="#foods-07-00060-t002">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SFA are reported to impact human health by increasing the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, some of the SFA are also reported to increase the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and some of them have little or no significant role in increasing or decreasing the LDL and HDL cholesterol levels [
  <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. The main SFA found in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are myristic (0.09%), palmitic (12%), stearic (7.2%), arachidic (0.76%) and behenic (0.4%) acid. The level of myristic acid in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is only 0.09%. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unsaturated fatty acids can exist in 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>- or 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-configuration. 
  <span class="italic">Cis</span>-configuration is found in naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, while 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-configuration is the result of processing. 
  <span class="italic">Cis</span>-unsaturated fatty acids are known as potent inducers of adiposomes also referred to as lipid droplets and they have important roles in cell signaling, regulation of lipid metabolism and control of the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators [
  <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. The MUFA present in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are palmitoleate (0.2%), oleate (29.3%) and ecosenoate (0.11%). Among the MUFA, oleic acid is the most abundant one found in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Oleic acid has been reported to act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. The anti-inflammatory mechanism includes down-regulating cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase through the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B [
  <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. Oleic acid may promote insulin resistance which is contrary to the PUFA which protects from insulin resistance [
  <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. Oleic acid has also been reported to attenuate blood pressure and risk of developing hypertension [
  <a rid="B32-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-foods-07-00060">32</a>]. The potential use of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels as a dietary source of oleic acid in reducing the risk and attenuating hypertension requires further investigation. Previous reports on some of the seeds and kernels of the family Combretaceae had reported oleic acid as the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid found in this family [
  <a rid="B33-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-foods-07-00060">33</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential PUFA are α-linolenic (18:3, 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-3) and linoleic acid (18:2, 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-6), from which other important PUFA are derived. Recently, essential fatty acids (EFA) have been considered as functional food components and nutraceuticals [
  <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. Documented roles of EFA include cardioprotective effect (due to their considerable antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic effects), the fluidity of biological membranes, the function of membrane enzymes and receptors, modulation of eicosanoids production, blood pressure regulation and metabolism of minerals [
  <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. EFA are also reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and some other serious diseases due to their complex effects on concentrations of lipoproteins [
  <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. Linoleic acid is an unsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that plays a critical role in the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the central nervous system (CNS) and retina [
  <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>]. A deficiency can cause skin scaling and hair loss [
  <a rid="B34-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-foods-07-00060">34</a>]. Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the only PUFA found in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels (50.2%). Therefore, it can be suggested that 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels can be used as a potential dietary source of linoleic acid which can increase the systemic pool and subsequently help nourish the CNS and retina. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WHO recommends that total daily energy intake derived from omega-6 PUFA should be 5–8% and from omega-3 PUFA 2% for an adult male. Studies on the seeds of 
  <span class="italic">T. bellirica</span> have reported that 40% of the seed is oil and 35% is protein and major fatty acids were linoleic (31%), palmitic (35%) and oleic (24%) acids and the authors have suggested that kernels could be used as a dietary source of linoleic acid [
  <a rid="B35-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-foods-07-00060">35</a>]. Reported studies on various plants of 
  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> genus included that 
  <span class="italic">T. glucausens</span> contains palmitic acid (34.9%), myristic acid (0.1%) and stearic acid (4.8%), seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. superba</span> contains behenic acid (C22:0; 1.2%) and the oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> contains stearic acid (5.8%), myristic acid (1.21%) and arachidic acid (1.3%) [
  <a rid="B33-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-foods-07-00060">33</a>]. Variations in the fatty acid composition is very common in plants and may be due to a number of reasons including but not limited to soil composition, climate, and specific geographical locations etc. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutritionally, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in edible oils and fats is very important. High levels of saturated fatty acids are desirable to increase oil stability. However, SFA become nutritionally undesirable, because high levels of saturated fatty acids are considered to increase the concentration of LDL, affecting the ratio of LDL to HDL and promoting vascular smooth muscle proliferation [
  <a rid="B36-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-foods-07-00060">36</a>,
  <a rid="B37-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-foods-07-00060">37</a>]. The ratio of UFA/SFA for 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is 4, which can be considered favorable for reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications [
  <a rid="B36-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-foods-07-00060">36</a>]. Again, the relationship between saturated and polyunsaturated FA content is an important parameter for determination of the nutritional value of oils which is expressed as P/S index. Oils and fats with a P/S index &gt; 1 are considered to have nutritional value. Several studies indicate that a higher P/S index means a smaller deposition of lipids in the body. The P/S indexes of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels and some other common oils and fats are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t005" href="#foods-07-00060-t005">Table 5</a>. The P/S index of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was 2.45, while safflower oil is 10.55 and coconut fat is 0.005. The fatty acid composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is comparable to the composition of soya bean oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t005" href="#foods-07-00060-t005">Table 5</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are suggestions to reduce the SFA in the diet to suppress the risk of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, it is important to note that SFA reduction itself cannot suppress the risk. Mostly, reduction of SFA and TFA with their simultaneous replacement by PUFA could lead to a reduction of the risk of CHD. The SFA content of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was 20.4%, having a very low amount of myristic acid. Based on our results, it can be concluded that the SFA of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are unlikely to have detrimental health effects by increasing the LDL cholesterol level. Moreover, the kernels were a good source of linoleic acid suggesting 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels as a valuable source of EFA that can be used in feed and food.
