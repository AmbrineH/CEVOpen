 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fatty acid profile of oil samples were determined by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Briefly, the fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by transesterification, using 2% sulfuric acid in methanol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Analysis were performed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), serial number 7890A, coupled to a flame ionization detector, using a capillary column DB-225 (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The initial column temperature was 160 °C for 2 min, then increased to 220 °C (5 °C/min) and maintained for 10 min. Nitrogen was used as mobile phase with flow rate 1.5 ml/min. The temperature of the injector and detector were maintained at 230 °C and 250 °C respectively for 20 min. The identification of fatty acid was based on the comparison of retention time with that of standard reference fatty acid methyl esters performed under same conditions.
