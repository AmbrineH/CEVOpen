Fleshes were cooked between 80 and 85 °C in a household autoclave containing water on Kinderbo gas type plate for 20 min. The obtained fish was pressed to separate the liquid from the solid phase. The resulting pressed juice was decanted for 45 min and centrifuged 15 min at 5400 rpm/min [

   <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> fleshes were dried 24 h in an oven at 45 °C. Samples were further ground to yield a fine powder. 100 g powder was mixed with 500 ml hexane, macerated and stirred three times within 24 h. Upon maceration, the homogenate was filtered and concentrated under vacuum using rotary vapour (40 °C). The resulting extract was placed in an oven at 35 °C for 2 days to remove residual solvent, weighed and stored at 4 °C until used [
