 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food is a source of hazards which can be either biological or chemical. Biological hazards are most frequent due to the regular ingestion of microorganisms and toxins, causing food intoxication in one out of three persons nowadays [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Food intoxications have a large social impact and have caused many diseases including typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, brucellosis, botulism, cholera [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. To limit the incidence of these diseases, antibacterial extracts including plants have been used [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. These substances sometimes produce harmful effects. Fatty acids are natural constituents of foods with no side effect on human health. They are the main constituents of edible oils and confer to their stability countless nutritional and biological properties. Fish oils are good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. The ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids of fish oils are known for their therapeutic properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Previous studies highlighted the antibacterial activity of polyunsaturated fatty acids from several fish oil species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. They could be an alternative of dietary supplement against bacteria responsible for food poisoning diseases.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cameroon is located in one of the largest river basins in the world. Its aquatic fauna is abundant and diversified. However, there are few data on fish oil composition [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] and their antimicrobial activities had almost not yet been initiated. 
  <span class="italic">Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hepsetus odoe</span> are widespread in the tropical regions. 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> belongs to Claroteidae family. It is highly commercial, marketed fresh, smoked or dried, and apart from being a cheap source of highly nutritive protein, it also contains other essential nutrients required by the body [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> is usually found near the banks of rivers in heavy vegetation, but can also be found in swampy environments, lagoons and backwaters. It bears a striking resemblance to the European pike. It is however, the only member of its genus [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
