 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extraction yields of 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oils were 6.52% and 5.8% respectively, for the cooking-pressing methods and maceration. The extraction yield of 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> was 4.31% by cooking-pressing method. According to Linder et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], fishes with oil content less than 5% are lean fishes, those containing 5 to 10% are semi fatty fishes and beyond 10% are considered fat. Therefore, 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> with a yield of 5.8% - 6.52% is a semi fatty fish unlike 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> which is a lean fish (yield of 4.31%).
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The acid value is a measure of the amount of free acids present in a given amount of fat. 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil extracted by maceration method had the highest amount of free acids compared to that of the cooking-pressing method. This increase might be related to the extraction process. However, the acid values of 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils extracted by cooking-pressing method remain in the standard (less than 3 mg KOH/g of oil) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. This was not the case with 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil extracted by maceration. The oil’s iodine value reflects its susceptibility to oxidation. A decrease is generally attributed to the destruction of double bonds, polymerization or split [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils, extracted by cooking-pressing method had higher iodine values compared to 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil extracted by maceration. This could be due to the fact that unsatured bonds present in 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils obtained by cooking-pressing method were not affected during extraction. Therefore, the cooking-pressing method could be the best method of oil extraction of these two fishes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peroxide value measure the amount of hydroperoxide; the primary product of oxidized fats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oil extracted by cooking-pressing method showed the highest peroxide value while that extracted from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> showed the lowest. The high content of hydroperoxides in 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> sample compared to those extracted from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> revealed its deterioration caused by the alteration of unsaturated fatty acids into hydroperoxides [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The anisidine value reflects the secondary oxidation products, specifically 2-alkenals and 2.4-dienals unlike thiobarbituric acid value which allows highlighting the malondialdehydes which characterise the last steps of fatty acid oxidation. 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil extracted by maceration presented an oxidation rate which is approximately four times higher than that of oils extracted by the cooking pressing method. Moreover, the oil extracted from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> by maceration exhibited the highest thiobarbituric acid value compared to the oils extracted by cooking-pressing method, reflecting last step of this oil’s oxidation. However, thiobarbituric acid values obtained with oils extracted from the two fishes regardless of the method fell within the standard range since values were below 10 μmol MDA/Kg fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the various oil indexes, it appears that 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil extracted by maceration was the most affected. Oils from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> obtained by cooking-pressing method showed quality indexes within the standards, meaning that they were of good quality. Nevertheless, alternative extraction methods need to be carried out in order to preserve these oils.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> extracted by cooking-pressing method exhibited the lowest rate of monounsaturated fatty acids, this reflects its low rate of oleic acid (C18:1). Oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> obtained by cooking-pressing method revealed high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to maceration. Instead, low rate of polyunsaturated fatty acid in 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil obtained by maceration was observed and could be due to the absence of lignoceric, cetoleic arachidonic acid and low rates of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. These fatty acids could have been oxidized and converted into hydroperoxides and malondialdehydes. This is in line with the previous result showing that the oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> obtained by maceration was more affected during the extraction process.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oils extracted from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> revealed high rates of ω-3, ω-6 and monounsaturated fatty acids. The high ω-3/ω-6 constitutes their peculiarity unlike those from 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella longiceps</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella fimbriata</span> which are two fatty fishes from India [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major compounds identified in 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils were saturated fatty acids with palmitic acid being the most represented. They were followed by monounsaturated fatty acids predominantly oleic acid and followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids mostly linolelaidic acid. This repartition is quite different to that reported with the chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella longiceps</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella fimbriata.</span> Indeed, results revealed with both fishes oil composition showed that the major compounds identified were unsaturated fatty acids with a predominance of C20:5 (EPA) and C 22:6 (DHA) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. They are also different from 
  <span class="italic">Eusphyra blochii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus bleekeri</span> marine fish oil where dienoic and trienoic fatty acids were found in trace amount. The findings are nevertheless similar to those reported with these marine fishes, where palmitic acid was one of the major saturated fatty acid found, oleic and palmitoleic fatty acids were the major constituents of monounsaturated fatty acids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cod liver oil is the most marketed fish derived oil for its nutritional value. EPA and DHA, its main constituent are beneficial to health. According to previous studies, they among others, ameliorate visual and cerebral functions. They are also used for regulation of some metabolic and physiological dysfunctions and have positive effects on skin, hair, nails and teeth. The oils studied also contain EPA and DHA fatty acids in significant proportions, therefore could have similar properties.</p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polyunsaturated (PUFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids have been known to provide varied health benefits such as minimizing inflammation and/or acting as antioxidants. Recent studies highlighted n-3 PUFA and their ester derivatives antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including 
  <span class="italic">S. mutans, C. albicans, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">P. gingivalis</span>. The major n-6 PUFAs, (linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid), the n-7 MUFA, palmitoleic acid, the n-9 MUFA and oleic acid (OA) were found to be responsible for this activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oils from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> revealed MIC values ranging between 8 and 64 mg/ml, reflecting their activities against bacteria responsible for food poisoning.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil composition of this two fish species were found to contain significant amounts of PUFA including linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid which could explain their antimicrobial activity. Similar results were earlier reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil from 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> obtained by cooking-pressing method showed activity on seven of the eight tested bacteria compared to those from 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> obtained by cooking -pressing and maceration methods which revealed activity on six and four tested bacteria respectively. On the other hand, the best activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil obtained by cooking-pressing method compared to that obtained by maceration was noticed. Differences in antibacterial activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oils could be attributed to oxidation of PUFA responsible for the activity through the maceration method. Moreover, the proportion of the PUFA responsible for the activity in the mixture may also be associated with the activity, explaining the differences between 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils obtained with same procedure.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria including 
  <span class="italic">S. parathyphi</span> A, 
  <span class="italic">K. pneumoniae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> are responsible for food intoxications. In addition to suffering and death, these bacteria cause considerable economic losses [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. parathyphi</span> A are two microorganisms responsible for food intoxication and typhoid fever respectively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. They were sensitive to 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oils, thereby indicating that these oils are potent antibacterial agents which could serve either as dietary supplements to fight against food infections caused by these bacteria or cooked in these forms to combine nutritive and curative properties of the fishes.
