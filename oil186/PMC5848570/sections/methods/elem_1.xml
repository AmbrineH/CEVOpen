   <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> were collected in Yabassi, Cameroon. They were stored in ice and transported to the laboratory. Identification was made by ichtyologists of the Laboratory of Fisheries Resources at the Institute of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. The average lengths of these two fishes were 41.96 ± 9.78 cm and 31.00 ± 0.50 cm respectively for 
   <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H. odoe</span>. Their average weights were 446.06 ± 67.67 g (

   <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twelve kilograms of each fish were washed and the undesirable parts including heads, intestines and gills were discarded. Fleshes were cooked between 80 and 85 °C in a household autoclave containing water on Kinderbo gas type plate for 20 min. The obtained fish was pressed to separate the liquid from the solid phase. The resulting pressed juice was decanted for 45 min and centrifuged 15 min at 5400 rpm/min [

    <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> fleshes were dried 24 h in an oven at 45 °C. Samples were further ground to yield a fine powder. 100 g powder was mixed with 500 ml hexane, macerated and stirred three times within 24 h. Upon maceration, the homogenate was filtered and concentrated under vacuum using rotary vapour (40 °C). The resulting extract was placed in an oven at 35 °C for 2 days to remove residual solvent, weighed and stored at 4 °C until used [

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fatty acid profile of oil samples were determined by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Briefly, the fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by transesterification, using 2% sulfuric acid in methanol [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Analysis were performed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), serial number 7890A, coupled to a flame ionization detector, using a capillary column DB-225 (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The initial column temperature was 160 °C for 2 min, then increased to 220 °C (5 °C/min) and maintained for 10 min. Nitrogen was used as mobile phase with flow rate 1.5 ml/min. The temperature of the injector and detector were maintained at 230 °C and 250 °C respectively for 20 min. The identification of fatty acid was based on the comparison of retention time with that of standard reference fatty acid methyl esters performed under same conditions.

A series of two fold dilutions were performed to obtain final concentration range of 0.5 to 64 mg/ml in a total volume of 100 μl/well. Each well was further diluted with 100 ml inoculum.
