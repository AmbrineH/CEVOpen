 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Nanotechnology, the science of study and use of structures at nanoscale, is a promising tool for producing novel materials with biomedical applications. Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) has been extensively investigated in various scientific disciplines. Silver in the form of silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine has been widely used to cure bacterial infections associated with burns. SNPs are considered as a potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral and antiprotozoal compound and it is also reported to have anti-inflammatory activities.

  </span> Synthesis and use of SNPs as a new generation of antimicrobial agents would be a fascinating and economical tool to solve drug resistance. Microorganisms display different responses to nanoparticles which is related to differences in the bacterial structure and the composition of the cell wall.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Essential oils (EOs), as a plant secondary metabolites, are volatile aromatic compounds extracted from different parts of plants. For centuries, EOs have been used in medicine, perfumery, cosmetics and food. They are primarily used in medicine, but in the nineteenth-century, EOs have found their importance to impart aroma and taste ingredients.

  </span> Lamiaceae is a family of plant with more than 230 genera, which distributed nearly worldwide. It contains many well- known species with fairly similar properties in botanical characteristics and applications, including 
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Thymus caramanicus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Zataria multiflora</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ziziphora clinopodioides</span> and

  <span class="italic">Zataria multiflora</span> Boiss is an important medicinal plant, distributed in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The main antimicrobial compounds of 
  <span class="italic">Zataria multiﬂora</span> Boiss essential oil (ZEO) are thymol, carvacrol, and p-cymene. The plant also contains tannins, flavonoids, saponins and some bitter substances.
  <span class="sup">

  </span> Among the phenolic compounds, thymol is the most characteristic chemical substance of ZEO which founds in leaves, flowers, and roots at various amounts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The practical advantage of antimicrobial combinations has been comprehended for over 50 years. Combinations of two antimicrobial agents with a different mechanism of action, may enhance antimicrobial activity especially where resistance to a single agent develops by bacteria. Also, due to synergy or additive interaction, the combination of drugs allows utilizing lower antimicrobial concentration, reducing the harmful side effects and increasing treatment efficacy.

  </span> Tackling public health issues occur by the growing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, proposes new antimicrobial formulation based on the combination of older antimicrobials with a rich source of new agents, such as natural products.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>
  </span> Simultaneous use of EOs and other antimicrobial compounds with great disinfectant properties has a high priority since using EOs in high concentrations make some unpleasant organoleptic changes in food and also on food contact surface when used as a sanitizing compound. Owing to the possible synergistic properties, combined use of EO with SNPs as a sanitizing mixture for food plant sanitation has been proposed.

  </span> The combined application of nanoparticles with EO has been reported.

  </span> To understand the combined antimicrobial and biofilm removal properties of SNP and ZEO, their effects on two important bacterial pathogens, 
  <span class="italic">Staph aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm.</span> Typhimurium was investigated as a guideline for a possible application of formulated solution in sanitation schedule.
