Peptone water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and agar, Agar-agar, and resazurin sodium were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO., USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The plant,

   </span> Two-fold serial dilutions of ZEO were prepared in 0.1% peptone water containing 0.15% agar (to make a stable emulsion of EO in peptone water), whereas dilutions of SNP were made in 0.1% peptone water. The wells of a microplates with U-bottom were poured by 160 μL of LB and 20 μL of the bacterial suspension with OD
   <sub>600</sub> = 0.1 to reach a suspension with 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/ mL in each well. Then, 20 μL either ZEO or SNP concentrations were added into the desired wells to achieve final concentrations of 312 to 5000 μg/ mL for ZEO and 62.5 to 2000 μg/mL for SNP. For every experiment, three controls, including LB alone, LB with bacteria and LB containing treatment agents without bacteria were used. The plate was mixed on a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by using 0.01% (w/v) resazurin sodium salt solution as explained previously. To determine MBCs, 10 µL from each well was inoculated into LB agar at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The MBC was determined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agents that produces 99.99% inhibition in the initial population of microorganism. MBC: MIC ratio, which describes the relationship between the minimum 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> bactericidal concentration and the MIC of antimicrobial agents, were also investigated.

The microplates were prepared by dispensing 160 μL of LB and 20 μL of the logarithmic suspension of bacteria and 10 μL of different concentration of both antimicrobial agents into each well. Then, plates were kept in a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by resazurin reduction. MICs of the individual antimicrobials and all of the combinations were used to calculate Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of ZEO and SNP and FIC index using the following formula:
