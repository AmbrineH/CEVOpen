 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The inhibitory effects of ZEO and SNP alone and in combination against 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium were investigated using microtiter plate assay. For 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span>, the MIC values of ZEO and SNP were 1250 and 25 μg/mL and for 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium the values were 2500 and 25 μg/mL, respectively. In all cases, MBC values were similar to MICs. The ZEO was found to be more effective on gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria whereas SNP displayed similar antibacterial activity on both bacteria. The MICs for SNP - ZEO combination were 0.78 and 12.5 μg/ mL against 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium, respectively. ZEO-SNP combination inhibited 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium at 625 μg/ mL. Based on the FICI scale (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>), the combination displayed a synergistic action on 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> (FICI=0.81) and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium (FICI= 0.75).
