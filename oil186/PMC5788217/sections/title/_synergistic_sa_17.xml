 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The purpose of this experiment was to achieve a best effective concentration of SNP and ZEO as a sanitizing solution. To assess the disinfectants efficiencies, MIC and OIC concentrations were determined. The reductions in the 
  <span class="italic">Staph</span>. 
  <span class="italic">aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium counts after 15 min exposure to MIC and various OIC concentrations were shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>. A reduction of 100% was achieved for both bacteria after 15 min exposure to ZEO. A similar reduction was also found for OIC concentration. Whereas, less than 0.4 log
  <sub>10</sub> CFU/ mL reduction was observed for the samples treated with SNP in alone.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> As shown by 260 nm absorbing material measurements, SNP displayed an antimicrobial activity after a long time of exposure (at least after 1 h) compared with ZEO. In comparison with 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium had higher resistance to SNP. Additionally, no significant reduction (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) was observed in the microbial counts of 1/2OIC and 1/4OIC with SNP treated samples.
