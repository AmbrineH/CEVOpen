 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show the antibacterial and antibiofilm potential of PAEO and carvacrol against the 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> standard strain and, especially, against oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>. Considering that 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> is a plant used in popular medicine practices in Brazil, more studies on the in vivo antibacterial and toxicity are recommended.
