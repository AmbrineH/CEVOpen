 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antibiofilm activity was determined by microtiter-plate technique [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] with crystal violet (CV) assay, counting viable cells in Colony Forming Units (CFU) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. In order to determine the PAEO and carvacrol action in the biofilm, plates were subjected to optical density microplate reading (Molecular Devices -SpectraMaxParadigmMulti-Mode) at a wavelength of 570Â nm. Activity was found in concentrations that failed to display the adhesion of crystal violet in any of the wells.
