 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carvacrol (88.17%) was the major component in the PAEO. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 28 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains (80%) and 12 strains (34.3%) were oxacillin and vancomycin-resistant (OVRSA). From the 28 resistant strains, 7 (25%) showed resistance plasmid of 12,000 bp. All strains (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) were sensitive to PAEO and carvacrol, with inhibition zones ranging from 16 to 38 mm and 23 to 42 mm, respectively. The lowest MIC (0.25 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and MBC (0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) values were observed when carvacrol was used against OVRSA. When a 0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> concentration of PAEO and carvacrol was used, no viable cells were found on 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> biofilm.
