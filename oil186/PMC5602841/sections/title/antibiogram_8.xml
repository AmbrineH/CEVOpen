 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As screening for the selection of drug-resistant strain for Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and antibiofilm activity, all strains (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility profile by disk diffusion method using Mueller Hinton Agar [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The following antibiotics discs were used: oxacillin (1 μg), penicillin G (10 U), ampicillin (10 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftriaxone (30 μg), cefepime (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg), vancomycin (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), and chloramphenicol (30 μg). Antimicrobial susceptibility was detected by analyzing the inhibition zones, measured and compared according the standards set by the CLSI (2012) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] which classify the strains as sensitive, intermediate or resistant.
