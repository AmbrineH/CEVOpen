 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between the activities of the essential oils and the pure constituents, as well as the results of lethality kinetics, were the basis for the determination of synergistic/antagonistic effects among the compounds tested. If synergistic effects are found, the combination of the compounds involved can provide effective biological activity at lower concentrations [
  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00025">19</a>]. In the present report, 26 binary combinations were tested against larvae (III instar) (

  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t007" href="#insects-09-00025-t007">Table 7</a>), of which 20 presented a significant synergistic effect (
