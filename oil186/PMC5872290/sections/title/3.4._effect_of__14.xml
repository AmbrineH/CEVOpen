 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To demonstrate the effect of essential oils and their constituents on short-term exposures, dose–response kinetics was undertaken. In the present study, cases of instantaneous death were observed within 20 min of exposure. The essential oil of anise can eliminate 100% of larvae in 120 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL, while LC
  <sub>50</sub> is 5 µg/mL; on the other hand, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, which is the major component of anise essential oil, does not remove 100% of the larvae even at concentrations higher than its LC
  <sub>50</sub> (

Similarly, the Mexican oregano essential oil can eliminate 100% of the larvae in 20 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL. Similar results were obtained with carvacrol, one of its major components; however, thymol, another essential oil constituent, only eliminates 36% of larvae in 120 min (
