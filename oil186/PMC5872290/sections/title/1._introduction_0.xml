 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large proportion of human population is exposed to infectious diseases spread by mosquitoes, including 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Aedes</span> spp., which are vectors of parasitic diseases [
  <a rid="B1-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-insects-09-00025">1</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> Say is a vector of lymphatic filariasis. The disease is widely distributed in tropical regions, with around 150 million people infected, ranking filariasis as one of the main causes of global morbidity [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00025">2</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> is present in tropical areas, a household pest in many urban settings, and widely reported as a vector resistant to registered insecticides [
  <a rid="B3-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-insects-09-00025">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical areas are more prone to vector-borne parasitic diseases and the risk has increased due to the intensification of globalization [
  <a rid="B4-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-insects-09-00025">4</a>]. Changes in climatic conditions due to global warming have promoted favorable conditions (temperature and humidity) for the development of mosquito populations, including hematophagous species. Poor sanitary conditions for water storage intended to household use, as well as unsanitary management of urban solid waste, can increase mosquito populations in urban and rural areas [
  <a rid="B1-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-insects-09-00025">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the intensive use of synthetic insecticides in mosquito control programs has created resistance in the insect population [
  <a rid="B5-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-insects-09-00025">5</a>], undesirable effects on other insects [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00025">6</a>] and negative impacts on the environment [
  <a rid="B7-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-insects-09-00025">7</a>]. Although the use of insecticide is the main method in the global effort for mosquito control [
  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00025">8</a>], vector-borne diseases are persistent due to mosquitoes resistant to traditionally used insecticides [
  <a rid="B9-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-insects-09-00025">9</a>] and lack of effective vaccines [
  <a rid="B10-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-insects-09-00025">10</a>]. The resistance of mosquitoes to synthetic insecticides has led to an interest in natural products with potential insecticidal activity, especially those derived from plants, which are considered valid alternatives to conventional synthetic pesticides to control a variety of insect pests and vectors. In this context, the essential oils and their constituents have received much attention as potentially useful bioactive compounds against insects [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00025">11</a>]. The complex and variable mixtures of bioactive compounds with different modes of action, offered by plants, may lessen the chance of resistance in mosquito populations [
  <a rid="B12-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-insects-09-00025">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are heterogeneous mixtures of organic chemical compounds from different chemical families [
  <a rid="B13-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-insects-09-00025">13</a>]; many have a terpenoid backbone, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Low molecular weight aliphatic compounds, acyclic esters or lactones may also be present [
  <a rid="B14-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-insects-09-00025">14</a>]. Chemical composition of essential oils is affected by factors such as plant species and subspecies, geographical location, harvest time, part of the plant used and the extraction methods used to obtain the essential oil [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00025">15</a>]. Several studies have reported the larvicidal action of medicinal plants and their essential oils against insect vectors of 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> genera, as well as 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> (L.) [
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00025">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-insects-09-00025">17</a>]. Furthermore, there are many secondary metabolites found in most of those plants that are considered to have insecticidal properties [
  <a rid="B18-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-insects-09-00025">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00025">19</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this paper is to determine, by laboratory bioassays, the larvicidal activity of seven essential oils on third instar larva and pupa of 
  <span class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus.</span> Essential oils tested include cinnamon (
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</span> J. Presl), Mexican lime (
  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantifolia</span> Swingle) cumin (
  <span class="italic">Cuminum cyminum</span> Linnaeus), clove (
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry), laurel (
  <span class="italic">Laurus nobilis</span> Linnaeus), Mexican oregano (
  <span class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</span> Schauer) and anise (
  <span class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</span> Linnaeus)
  <span class="italic">.</span> Larvicidal effect and synergistic behavior of the major components present in the essential oils included in the study are also tested.
