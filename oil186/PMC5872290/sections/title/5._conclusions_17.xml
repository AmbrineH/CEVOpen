 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the high larvicidal activity of essential oils and their constituent compounds make them potential substitutes for traditionally used chemical compounds in larval and pupal stages of mosquito control programs. The essential oil is readily available and the cost constraint can be overcome by the low value of the LC
  <sub>50</sub>. The larvicidal activity of Essential oils shows that it is not necessary to use the pure active compound, since the complex mixture of compounds present in essential oils are effective as larvicide.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, their principal constituents are low molecular weight compounds and therefore easily synthesized and the study of the pure components is essential to elucidate the larvicidal and insecticidal mechanism of action of essential oils and their constituents.</p>
