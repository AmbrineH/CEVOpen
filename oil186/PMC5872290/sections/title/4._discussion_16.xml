 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils can be used as part of insecticides that can affect disease-related insect vectors, but with low impact on the accompanying insect fauna [
  <a rid="B29-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-insects-09-00025">29</a>,
  <a rid="B30-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-insects-09-00025">30</a>]. There are reports on essential oils with insecticidal and inhibitory oviposition capacity against 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> [
  <a rid="B28-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-insects-09-00025">28</a>]. The potential biological activity of the different essential oils varies according to plant species, its origin and its composition [
  <a rid="B31-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-insects-09-00025">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-insects-09-00025">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the larvicidal activities evaluated on instar III, there were no differences among the essential oils studied, except for the cinnamon essential oil (
  <span class="italic">C. verum</span> J. Presl), which has a variation on LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values. Results included in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t002" href="#insects-09-00025-t002">Table 2</a> demonstrate that the essential oils tested can effectively control 
  <span class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</span> pupae and larvae, and the effect can be the result of the interaction of the many compounds found in each essential oil, many in small or trace quantities, or can be attributed mainly to major components. To answer the latter question, the larvicidal and pupaecidal activity of the chemical compounds reported as major constituents of the essential oils tested were analyzed, and the results are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t003" href="#insects-09-00025-t003">Table 3</a>. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lethal concentration tests (LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub>) provide information on the concentration of a given compound to decrease a population by 50% and 90%, respectively. Usually the effect is not linear; therefore, it is important to determine both values. In the determination of those values, at least three replicates are needed for each concentration in the analysis, and this is the reason for the report of confidence intervals (provided in parenthesis in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t002" href="#insects-09-00025-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t003" href="#insects-09-00025-t003">Table 3</a>). However, it is not possible to assess differences among the essential oil or the main components, so the analysis of larval mortality was also included in this work. The essential oils and their main components included in this study also showed a high effectiveness with respect to mortality upon exposure of 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> larvae to water contaminated with lethal doses (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t004" href="#insects-09-00025-t004">Table 4</a>): in most cases, deaths occurred after short-term exposures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of larval mortality demonstrated that the activity of anise essential oil and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole are statistically similar to the activity of Temephos, while 
  <span class="italic">L. nobilis</span> L. essential oil and its main component (eucalyptol) were less effective. Cinnamaldehyde, the major component of cinnamon essential oil, showed higher LC
  <sub>50</sub> compared to the essential oil, suggesting that there are antagonistic effects of some components present in cinnamon essential oil. On the contrary, cuminaldehyde the major constituent of cumin essential oil, is more active than the essential oil. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eugenol and eucalyptol, by themselves had better activity than the essential oil where they are present. In some cases, such as with eucalyptol that is present in bay laurel essential oil, the larvicidal activity doubles when the molecule is pure. This suggests that the other constituents of the essential oil have antagonistic interactions with eucalyptol. The low larvicidal activity of eucalyptol (1,8-cineol) has been reported previously against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> [
  <a rid="B33-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-insects-09-00025">33</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</span> [
  <a rid="B34-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-insects-09-00025">34</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> [
  <a rid="B35-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-insects-09-00025">35</a>], however it has been shown to be effective as a repellent in foods and highly effective as an ovipositional repellent [
  <a rid="B33-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-insects-09-00025">33</a>], however the effect did not last for more than 30 min [
  <a rid="B36-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-insects-09-00025">36</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limonene has a larvicidal activity similar to the essential oil of Mexican lime against stage III larvae of 
  <span class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</span>. Its activity doubled when the molecule was evaluated as a pure compound on pupae. This suggests that other components of the essential oil have an antagonist effect with limonene or that the compound is more effective against larvae in a more mature stage. These results demonstrate the importance of studying the components of the essential oils separately, as different studies could rule out some important molecules because the oil as a whole has seemingly unimportant biological activities. Eleni et al. [
  <a rid="B37-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-insects-09-00025">37</a>] reported the larvicidal activity of limonene rich essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Citrus auranitium</span> subsp. bergamia against 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span>; the oil displays a LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 58.73 mg/L. On the other hand, 
  <span class="italic">Mentha longifolia</span> essential oil, containing 20% limonene, has been reported as larvicidal against 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> with a LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 78.28 mg/L after 48 h of exposure [
  <a rid="B38-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-insects-09-00025">38</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are multiple plant species collectively known as Oregano, including plants from the Verbenaceae and the Lamiaceae families, that have in common the presence of thymol and carvacrol in different proportions, but with similar odor and flavor characteristics [
  <a rid="B22-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-insects-09-00025">22</a>] and, as such, are comparable in biological activities. In this study, the essential oil of Mexican oregano (
  <span class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</span> Schauer) has carvacrol as its major constituent (57%), followed by thymol as the second major compound. There is no difference between the larvicidal activity of carvacrol and the essential oil of Mexican oregano, but the larvicidal activity of thymol is significantly lower. The only structural difference between carvacrol and thymol is the position of the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with respect to the largest aliphatic chain (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00025-f001" href="#insects-09-00025-f001">Figure 1</a>); this demonstrate the importance of the aliphatic chain and its proximity to other functional groups.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are numerous reports on the insecticidal activity of the essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> species; major components such as carvacrol, thymol, γ- terpinene and terpinen-4-ol are reported with fumigant and repellent activity rather than contact toxicity [
  <a rid="B39-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-insects-09-00025">39</a>]. Cetin and Yanikoglu determined the insecticidal activity of essential oils from two species of Origanum (
  <span class="italic">Origanum onites L.</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Origanum minutiflorum</span>) on the third and fourth instar larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens L.</span>: the LC
  <sub>50</sub> values were 24.8 and 73.8 µg/mL, respectively [
  <a rid="B40-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-insects-09-00025">40</a>]. The authors attribute the larvicidal activity to carvacrol, as also suggested in this report. However, it is important to note that other studies have reported that oregano essential oil with high levels of thymol have an effective deterrent oviposition activity against 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> females [
  <a rid="B41-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-insects-09-00025">41</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding essential oils derived from plants of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Lippia</span>, this study is the first to report the activity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</span> Shauer. Vera et al. evaluated the activity of 
  <span class="italic">Lippia alba</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lippia origanoides</span> against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> [
  <a rid="B42-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-insects-09-00025">42</a>]. These two essential oils contained carvone and carvacrol as major components, and presented LC
  <sub>50</sub> values of approximately 50 µg/mL. In addition, the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Lippia gracilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lippia sidoides</span> have been evaluated against 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> [
  <a rid="B43-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-insects-09-00025">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-insects-09-00025">44</a>]. Gleiser and Zygadlo evaluated the activity of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Lippia turbinata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lippia polystachya</span> against 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> larvae [
  <a rid="B45-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-insects-09-00025">45</a>]. Both oils presented α-thujone as the major component and showed no relevant larvicidal activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The larvicidal efficiency of anise essential oil as well 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, has been previously reported [
  <a rid="B46-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-insects-09-00025">46</a>]. Waliwitiya et al., Pavela and Sousa et al. evaluated the activity of 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles atroparvus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> respectively, finding relevant LC
  <sub>50</sub> values [
  <a rid="B47-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-insects-09-00025">47</a>,
  <a rid="B48-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-insects-09-00025">48</a>,
  <a rid="B49-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-insects-09-00025">49</a>]. This study confirms the activity of 
  <span class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</span> L. essential oil, but it shows that 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole does not eliminate the larvae as quickly as it does the essential oil, even though both have similar LC
  <sub>50</sub> values. This suggests that there are interactions with other components that are present in the essential oil at lower or even trace concentrations. Therefore, it is always important to analyze the activity of the complete essential oil and their major components, since the presence of compounds different than the main components, can present synergistic or antagonistic effects. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most relevant synergistic effects are observed against larvae with the combination of 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anetol and limonene and the combination of 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole and β-myrcene against pupae. These effects may be responsible for the rapid larvicidal activity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. anisum</span>. Synergistic effects are also observed when mixing carvacrol and thymol, the main constituents of 
  <span class="italic">Lippia berlandieri</span> essential oil. However, none of these compounds has additive effects on the activity when they are mixed with 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene. The only antagonistic effect was observed with the limonene–pinene combination, which may be related to the difference in activity between 
  <span class="italic">C.aurantifolia</span> essential oil and limonene against pupae.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanism of action with which the essential oils exert their larvicidal activity is not completely described. Pratti et al. suggest that instant death is due to severe damage of Malpighian tubules, since they are responsible for the excretion, not only of electrolytes and metabolites, but also of the high volume of water naturally present in insect larvae environment [
  <a rid="B50-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-insects-09-00025">50</a>]. There are reports suggesting that spice essential oils have neurotoxic poisoning-type effect on insects, similar to the ones produced by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, by inhibition of the of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) [
  <a rid="B51-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-insects-09-00025">51</a>]. In a comparative study of the vapor action of essential oils from plants of the Lamiaceae family on 
  <span class="italic">R. dominica</span> adults, it was observed that the essential oils inhibited about 65% of AChE activity, while limonene lowered only 2% of the enzymatic activity [
  <a rid="B52-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-insects-09-00025">52</a>]. Furthermore, these authors found that the essential oils significantly increased the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (even at very low concentrations), which suggests a possible action on octopamine. Similar results were obtained by Enan in flies and cockroaches exposed to eugenol and α-terpineol [
  <a rid="B53-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-insects-09-00025">53</a>]. In silico studies have demonstrated that terpenes can interact with AChE of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>, by joining a hydrophobic site of the enzyme, with an interaction with glycine 412, 409, abd 412 and isoleucine 413 amino acids [
  <a rid="B54-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-insects-09-00025">54</a>]. Another proposed mechanism of action has been presented by Priestley et al., who suggest that thymol acts on GABA receptors of 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</span> [
  <a rid="B55-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-insects-09-00025">55</a>].
