 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oviposition deterrent test was done using the method described by Xue et al. [
  <a rid="B25-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-insects-09-00025">25</a>]. The percent of effective repellency for was calculated using the formula:
  <div class="disp-formula">
   <span class="italic">ER</span> (%) = ((
   <span class="italic">NC</span> − 
   <span class="italic">NT</span>)/(
   <span class="italic">NC</span> + 
   <span class="italic">NT</span>) × 100
   <span class="label">(1)</span>
  </div> where 
  <span class="italic">ER</span> is the percent of effective repellency; 
  <span class="italic">NC</span> is the number of eggs in the control sample; and 
  <span class="italic">NT</span> is the number of eggs in treatment bowl. 
  <span class="italic">ER</span> was determined and transformed to arcsine square root values for analysis of variance.
