   <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> were collected at the Ein Gedi Botanical Garden. The plant was identified and collected by Nativ Dudai. Plant parts were placed within a Clevenger-type apparatus for 1.5 h and the essential oil was hydro-distilled. The commercial samples were produced by a steam distillation apparatus and supplied by the grower Mr. Guy Erlich from his plantation at Almog (near the Dead Sea), Israel.

The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), 30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter, with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm. The carrier gas was helium, with a column head pressure of 552 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. Injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature program was set for an initial temperature of 50 °C and increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 5%

The oven temperature began at 50 °C, and was then gradually raised to 120 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min. After reaching 120 °C, the oven temperature was increased to 200 °C at 2 °C/min intervals and kept at this temperature for 5 min. Helium was the carrier gas, and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min. Samples were diluted to 3%

Relative enantiomer percentages were determined based on peak areas.
