 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of essential oils from the stems, leaves, and fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Commiphora gileadensis</span> have been shown to be rich in monoterpenoids, but a dearth of sesquiterpenoids, in contrast to previous reports of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> essential oils; there is apparently wide variation in 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> volatiles. The enantiomeric distribution of monoterpenoids showed little variation between the different essential oil samples of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span>, contrasted markedly from 
  <span class="italic">Boswellia</span> spp. essential oils.
