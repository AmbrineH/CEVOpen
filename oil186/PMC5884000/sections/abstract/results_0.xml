  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of investigations on 
   <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil showed its therapeutic potential in treatment of sinusitis by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihistaminic, immune-modulator, antimicrobial and analgesic effects. The use of 
   <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil can inhibit the inflammation of sinuses and respiratory airways, microbial infections and finally help the patients suffering from clinical symptoms of sinusitis such as coryza, nasal congestion, headache, neck pain, earache and toothache.
