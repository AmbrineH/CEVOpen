 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</span> (CC), 
  <span class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</span> (PG) and 
  <span class="italic">Vetiveria zizanioides</span> (VZ) are commonly used topically to prevent mosquito bites and thus the risk of infection by their vectored pathogens such as arboviruses. However, since mosquito bites are not fully prevented, the effect of these products on the level of viral infection remains unknown.
