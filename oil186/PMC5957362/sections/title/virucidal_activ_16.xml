 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the virucidal activity, each essential oil at concentrations 0.1×CC
  <sub>10</sub> or 1×CC
  <sub>10</sub> was mixed with the RRV-T48 strain (1×10
  <span class="sup">5</span> PFU) during 1 h at 37°C. The residual infectivity was titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells with a serial of ten-fold dilutions. For the entry assay, Vero cells monolayers were pre-treated 3 h at 37°C with the essential oils. The residual infectivity of RRV-T48 strain was then titrated by plaque assay with a serial of ten-fold dilutions on the pre-treated Vero cells. All the experiments were performed in triplicate from five independent experiments and controls consist in RRV-T48-infected Vero cells without treatment with the essential oils.
