 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) related to neglected tropical diseases has become a global health public concern [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref001">1</a>]. The discovery of novel prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against arboviruses remain a continuous goal aimed to counter emerging virus or new viral strains [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref002">2</a>]. Ross River virus (RRV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus, family 
  <span class="italic">Togarividae</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref003">3</a>]. The RRV incubation period in humans was estimated to be from 7 to 9 days [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref004">4</a>] and like the well-known Chikungunya virus that belongs to the same viral family, it typically causes fever, rash and polyarthralgia [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref006">6</a>]. RRV is endemic in Australia where it is the most common mosquito-borne pathogen with an average of 5000 cases annually [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref008">8</a>]. After the major outbreak in the Pacific area in 1979 and 1980, serological studies revealed the silent circulation of RRV in the Fiji islands [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref009">9</a>] and more recently in French Polynesia [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref011">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two biological characteristics distinguish RRV from other alphaviruses: more than 40 species of mosquitoes can act as its vectors, thus, providing a large number of potential amplification cycles, and numerous warm blood host (mainly marsupials) support this virus’s replication [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref012">12</a>]. This provides numerous opportunities for RRV to infect humans and initiate outbreak foci [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref013">13</a>]. Indeed, during 2017, a large outbreak was observed in the South-West Region of Australia with more than 2 thousand cases reported in less than 2 months. Because the infection lead to very painful and debilitating joint, up to months after the initial onset, the disease has a direct impact on health services and calls for direct responses from the Australian authorities [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref014">14</a>]. Consequently, RRV for which no efficient treatment is available, remains a major focus of basic research, and necessitates on-going surveys by the Australian health services [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref018">18</a>]. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) has been proposed as an efficient therapeutic target to alleviate RRV-induced arthritis but to date only pentosan sulfate, initially approved for the treatment of cystitis in U.S., is available [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref020">20</a>]. In an 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> re-evaluation of 40 plants species used in Australian folk medicine, inhibition of RRV-induced cytopathic effect (25–50%) was observed with the ethanolic extract of 
  <span class="italic">Myoporaceae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporaceae</span> species [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref021">21</a>]. Essential oils are natural complex mixtures and their antiviral properties are due to complementary and overlapping mechanisms, as assumed for herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus and yellow fever virus. To date, the anti-infective properties of essential oils, though of growing interest, have not been explored for RRV [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref022">22</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In arboviruses-related control measures, a number of essential oils are exploited as topical repellents to reduce the incidence of mosquito bites [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref025">25</a>]. However, as yet these have not been investigated for antiviral activity at the site of infection, the skin, where they could be absorbed percutaneously. Such additional benefits of skin-applied essential oils may offer a great opportunity to control the early stages of infection, even when their repelling action fails. 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Vetiveria zizanioides</span> (family: Poaceae) and 
  <span class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</span> (family: Geraniaceae) are distributed worldwide and their essential oils (denoted hereafter as CC, VZ and PG, respectively), are readily available and have notable mosquito repellent properties [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref026">26</a>]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> of these three common essential oils at non-cytotoxic concentrations against RRV. We assessed their effects on both virus entry using the wild-type of RRV-T48 strain (RRV-T48) and viral replication using a recombinant RRV expressing 
  <span class="italic">Renilla reniformis</span> luciferase (RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc).
