 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each essential oil was characterized by an accurate quantification of their terpenoid content. PG yielded the least-toxic extract (CC
  <sub>50</sub> &gt; 1000 Î¼g.mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). For the RRV-T48 strain, the monoterpene-rich CC and PG essential oils reduced the cytopathic effect but did not display virucidal activity. The time-of-addition assay using the gene reporter RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc showed that the CC and PG essential oils significantly reduced viral replication and infectivity when applied prior, during and early after viral adsorption. Overall, no significant effect was observed for the low monoterpene-containing VZ essential oil.
