 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to get further understanding of the key pathway in the ingredient-target-pathway network, the nodes associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), which contained 8 ingredients, 50 proteins and 150 connections. Degree values of the network were also evaluated as mentioned above. Interestingly, eugenol (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 47) and geraniol (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 46) were also key nodes with much higher degree values, whereas ⟨
  <span class="italic">k</span>⟩ of the network was only 5.08. This result supported the importance of eugenol and geraniol for

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eugenol has been reported to protect neuronal cells from excitotoxic and oxidative injury [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Neuroprotective efficacy of eugenol was also found in acrylamide-induced neuropathy in rats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Geraniol showed a neuroprotective effect in an acrylamide model of neurotoxicity in 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Additionally, geraniol was reported to be beneficial for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease associated with neuromuscular disability. These reports further confirmed that eugenol and geraniol played an important role in the neuroprotective effect of
