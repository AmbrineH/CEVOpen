 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although geraniol and eugenol together accounted for only 1.5% of the

  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>), these two compounds showed potential of strong bioactivity and acceptable cytotoxicity at the level of quantity according to previous reports. Geraniol originated from geranium essential oil was reported to show 312.5 μg/mL minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against many species of bacteria such as 
  <span class="italic">E. coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Yersinia enterocolitica</span>. Moreover, 100 μg/mL strong activity of geraniol was also found against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</span> [

  <sub>50</sub>) for the anti-HSV effects of eugenol were 25.6 mg/mL and 16.2 mg/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2 respectively, together with a maximum dose of 250 mg/mL for cytotoxicity test in the mouse model [
