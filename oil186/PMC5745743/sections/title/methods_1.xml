 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we analyzed the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> by GC-MS. A complex network approach was applied to investigate the interrelationships between the ingredients, target proteins, and related pathways for the essential oil. Statistical characteristics of the networks were further studied to explore the main active ingredients and potential bioactivities of
