Short average path length and relatively high clustering coefficient suggested that the pathway-based protein association network had small-world property. This property demonstrated that the network was consisted of many small, but highly connected modules which combined in a hierarchical manner, and exhibited as larger, less cohesive units [

Furthermore, they were also screened as key proteins of the pathway-based protein association network. Consistency of the results indicated that the two proteins were not only associated with most ingredients and pathways, but also closely related to other target proteins of the essential oil.
