 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proteins are crucial for herbal medicines to achieve therapeutic effects in vivo. In order to explore potential bioactivities, we collected target proteins for the selected ingredients of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil. A total of 191 target proteins were obtained (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>), including ornithine decarboxylases, adenosine receptors, hydroxyacid oxidases, and so on. It suggested that this essential oil might have various bioactivities. In addition, we excluded ingredients with no hit targets. Only 44 ingredients were reserved for further study (Additional file

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pathway analysis was applied on target proteins of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil for further interpretation, and the results showed that these proteins were involved in 70 biological pathways (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>), calcium signaling pathway, nitrogen metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, cytochrome P450, and so on. These pathways were critical in several important biological processes such as signal transduction, drug metabolism and energy metabolism, which indicated that
