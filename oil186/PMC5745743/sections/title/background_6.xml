  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span>, also known as sweet olive or fragrant olive, is one of the most famous flowers in China due to attractive color and strong fragrance. Various varieties of 
  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span> flowers have been developed, and divided into four groups, Semperfloren, Thunbergii, Latifolius and Aurantiacus [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. The cultivation and production of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> group was more abundant than those of other groups [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. This variation is considered to have higher market value and widely used in food chemistry [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>].

  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span> flowers have been used as folk medicine for a long time in the treatment of rheumatism, cough and stomachache [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Extracts of 
  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span> flowers have been reported to exhibit various bioactivities both in vitro and in vivo. Water extract of the flower showed a potential to suppress TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in human lung fibroblasts cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Acetonic extract of the flower exhibited antioxidant activity and melanogenesis inhibitory effect in murine melanoma cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Ethanol extract of the flower was reported to have neuroprotective and free radical scavenging effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Moreover, it also showed the ability of reducing allergic airway inflammation and oxidative stress in mice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>].

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil is the volatile oil extracted from plants with strong aromatic components and distinctive odour, which has been widely used as a major raw material of perfume or cosmetic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The essential oil is an excellent source of bioactive compounds, and exhibits various activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Therefore, it is considered to be partly responsible for the biomedical functions of plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Previous reports about 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil were mainly focused on its chemical composition. A broad group of low-molecular compounds were found in this essential oil, including linalool oxide, ocimene, 2,6-octadien-1-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-2-butanone, 3,7-dimethyl-
  <span class="italic">β</span>-ionone, and so on [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. However, the main active ingredients and bioactivities of this essential oil were still not fully elucidated.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main causes for difficulties in the bioactivity study of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil is the complexity of its chemical composition. Recently, complex network approach has emerged in the pharmacological researches, which was also known as “network pharmacology” or “system pharmacology” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. This methodology holds a significant potential for extracting biological information from large amounts of chemical data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], and enables to predict the target profiles and pharmacological actions of herbal compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. For instance, Chandran et al. performed a network to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of 
  <span class="italic">Withania somnifera</span>, and revealed a series of novel bioactive immune target combinations. Chen et al. constructed a multi-parameter network model on the basis of three important parameters to tentatively explain the anti-fibrosis mechanism of herbal medicine 
  <span class="italic">Sophora flavescens</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Luo et al. used systems pharmacology strategies for anticancer drug discovery based on natural products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. In addition, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xueshu.baidu.com/s?wd=author%3A%28Gogoi%20B%29%20&amp;tn=SE_baiduxueshu_c1gjeupa&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;sc_f_para=sc_hilight%3Dperson" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Gogoi</span> et al. developed a network pharmacology-based virtual screening of natural products from 
  <span class="italic">Clerodendrum</span> species for identification of novel anti-cancer therapeutics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. These studies demonstrate that complex network approach has real potential for bioactivity study of natural products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we applied the complex network method to evaluate the main active ingredients and bioactivities of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil. GC-MS was used to analyze ingredients of this essential oil. An ingredient-target-pathway network was constructed, and that statistical characteristics of the network were calculated to determine the key nodes. The nodes associated with the key pathway were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork to explore the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, a pathway-based protein association network was also built to investigate interrelationships between target proteins of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var.
