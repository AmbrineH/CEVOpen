 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A noticeable variation was observed in the percentage yield of the hydro distilled essential oils (EOs) samples, taken at four seasons (winter, spring, summer, and autumn), The essential oil was pale yellow with a characteristic odour, and produced an irritating sensation in the eyes. The yields of essential oils in different seasons were 0.02–1.3% for leaves and 1.2–4.8% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span> for rhizomes. However, in previous reports the yields of essential oils in 
  <span class="italic">A. gramineus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. calamus</span> from different regions have been reported to range from 1.0 to 3.5% [
  <a rid="B31-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-medicines-04-00081">31</a>,
  <a rid="B38-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-medicines-04-00081">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-medicines-04-00081">39</a>]. In the present study, the yield showed the highest percentage (4.8%) during the summer in all accessions, whereas during autumn and winter the yields obtained were only up to 0.02%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC/MS showed marked variation in the major ingredients of oils prepared in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The composition of the essential oils differed quantitatively and qualitatively according to the time of collection. A detailed comparative analysis of all the oils with different seasons has been recorded in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t001" href="#medicines-04-00081-t001">Table 1</a>, with phenyl propanoids in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00081-f001" href="#medicines-04-00081-f001">Figure 1</a>, while the class composition is in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t003" href="#medicines-04-00081-t003">Table 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t004" href="#medicines-04-00081-t004">Table 4</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils were dominated by phenylpropanoids, and were detected in all the accessions in all seasons but in different quantities. Interestingly, the 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-asarone content was highest in winter (57.0–90.6%) and lowest in summer, except Bhimtal, in which spring has the lowest content; whereas the 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-asarone content was highest in summer and lowest in winter in all the accessions. On the basis of major components (phenyl propanoids) analysis by cluster analysis, as in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00081-f002" href="#medicines-04-00081-f002">Figure 2</a>, it was observed that there were little difference in principal components like 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-asarone, 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>-isoelemicin, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-asarone, etc., both altitude-wise and season-wise.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over 78–96% of constituents were identified in both ACLEO and ACREO. The major constituents identified in both the oils in all four seasons were 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-methyl isoeugenol, 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>-isoelimicin, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-asarone, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-asarone, etc., but with different respective yield. Both ACLEO and ACREO exhibited similar qualitative diversity in terms of terpenoid composition, but their quantity varied in different seasons. However, the constituents, viz., limonene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-humulene, 2,4,5-trimethoxy benzoic acid, and heptadecanol, could be detected only in ACLEO, whereas elimicin and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-calacorene were detected only in ACREO.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of essential oils might be due to different altitudes, environmental conditions, and the developmental stage/season of the plant materials, which is in agreement with results reported earlier [

  <a rid="B42-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-medicines-04-00081">42</a>]. In terms of class composition, the monoterpenoids in ACLEO from all three accessions in four different seasons ranged from 0.2 to 15.7%, mainly represented by limonene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span> oscimene, linalool, bornyl acetate, etc. The sesquiterpenoids ranged from 2.6 to 16.6% with E caryophyllene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span> elemene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> copaene, calarene, 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> methyl isoeugenol, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> humulene, spathulenol, germacrene D, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> cadenene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> calacorene, etc. The marker class of, phenyl propanoids, ranged from 36.9 to 90.8%, mainly represented by 
  <span class="italic">α</span> asarone, 
  <span class="italic">β</span> asarone, 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> isoelimicin, elimicin, etc. (

  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t003" href="#medicines-04-00081-t003">Table 3</a>). Similarly, in ACREO the monoterpenoids ranged from 0.1 to 9.5%, and sesquiterpenoids from 0.6 to 9.4%, while phenyl propanoids ranged from 60.8 to 82.4% in three accessions for the four seasons. The essential oil composition of rhizomes from our laboratory has already been reported. The essential oil was found to possess significant antibacterial and antihelmintic activity [

  <a rid="B32-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-medicines-04-00081">32</a>]. It has also been reported that asarone and sesquiterpenoids were the major constituents in two phylogenetically different accessions [
  <a rid="B38-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-medicines-04-00081">38</a>]. Patra and Mitra [
  <a rid="B43-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-medicines-04-00081">43</a>] and Tamas et al. [
  <a rid="B44-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-medicines-04-00081">44</a>] have also reported acoramone and phenylpropane derivatives like 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-asarone, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-asarone, 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-asarone, isoeugenol, and methyl ether in essential oils. The components reported earlier were also identified, besides some other constituents, but in different quantities. Seasonal along with altitudinal variation in both rhizomes (ACREO) and the aerial part (ACLEO) are reported here for the first time, demonstrating the qualitative and quantitative diversity of constituents in the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. calamus.</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the essential oils isolated in different seasons exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity in a dose-dependent manner (5 µL/mL–25 µL/mL) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t005" href="#medicines-04-00081-t005">Table 5</a>). The radical scavenging potential of ACREO and ACLEO from three altitudes in the form of their IC

  <sub>50</sub> = 28.37 µg/mL) &gt; catechin (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 28.48 µg/mL). The antioxidant power of EOs might be attributed to their hydrogen donating ability to DPPH free radicals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> reducing activity at selected dose levels of 5–25 µg/mL, the EOs exhibited dose dependent reducing power activity. The RP

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the dose-dependent response for chelating activity for all the Eos (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00081-t005" href="#medicines-04-00081-t005">Table 5</a>) exhibited the following order of IC

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOs from 
  <span class="italic">A. calamus</span> exhibited good in vitro antioxidant activity, which might be because of the mixture of essential oils containing mono and sesquiterpenoids and the synergetic effects of the constituents. This is proven by a report that says that antioxidant capacity is affected by other bioactive compounds and could involve synergistic effects [
  <a rid="B45-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-medicines-04-00081">45</a>]. Several reports have shown in vitro antioxidant properties of many natural products, including essential oils. Antioxidants are believed to be directly anti mutagenic. In vitro physicochemical assays characterize most of them as antioxidants. However, the published report shows that in eukaryotic cells, essential oils can act as pro-oxidants, affecting inner cell membranes and organelles like mitochondria, and are usually non-genotoxic, and hence the beneficial effects of essential oils are due to pro-oxidants’ effects on the cellular level [
  <a rid="B46-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-medicines-04-00081">46</a>]. The anticancer and antioxidant properties of certain medicinal herbs are used to treat trauma over a longer period of time, which is promising.

  <a rid="B49-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-medicines-04-00081">49</a>], which might be due to its antioxidant activity. In folk medicine the herb 
  <span class="italic">A. calamus</span> has been used as a wound healing agent for many years, which has been proven scientifically by reporting the significant wound-healing activity of aqueous extracts in the animal model of excise wound healing, and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro [
