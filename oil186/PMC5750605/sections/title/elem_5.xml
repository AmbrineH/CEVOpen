   <a rid="B35-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-medicines-04-00081">35</a>]. Briefly, the tested samples (5–25 μL/mL) were added to 5 mL of a 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH. Finally, the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. Ascorbic acid was used as the standard antioxidant. Inhibition of free radical by DPPH in percent (IC %) was calculated using the equation. IC% = (A
   <sub>0</sub> − A
   <sub>t</sub>)/A
   <sub>0</sub> × 100, where A
   <sub>0</sub> = the absorbance value of the control sample, A
   <sub>t</sub> = the absorbance value of the test sample, and IC = inhibitory concentration. The radical scavenging activities of essential oils were discussed in terms of their IC
   <sub>50</sub> values.

   <sub>3</sub> [FeCN
   <sub>6</sub>]. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 50 °C. After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid was added to the mixtures, followed by centrifugation at 650 rpm for 10 min. The upper layer (1 mL) was mixed with 5 mL distilled water and 1 mL of 0.1% ferric chloride and the absorbance of the resultant solution was measured at 700 nm. Reducing power % = (A

   <sub>0</sub> × 100, where A
   <sub>0</sub> = the absorbance value of the control sample and A
