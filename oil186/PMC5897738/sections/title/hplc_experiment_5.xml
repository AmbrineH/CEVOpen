 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HPLC experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20AD Liquid Chromatograph (SPD-M20A diode array detector, CBM-20A controller, SIL-20AC
  <sub>HT</sub> autosampler, DGU-20A
  <sub>5R</sub> degasser unit, CTO-20AC column oven) using a Kinetex 5 μm C-18 100A (150 mm × 4.6 mm) with a gradient of 0,01% trifluoroacetic acid in H
  <sub>2</sub>O (A) and acetonitrile (B) as follows: 0–5 min 25% B, 14 min 28% B, 15 min 70% B, 16 min 70% B, 16.5 min 25% B, and 20 min 25% B. The flow was 1.2 ml/min, column oven temperature was 55°C. Detection was carried out within the range of 190–800 nm. For quantification, chromatograms were integrated at 344 nm. The reference standards and the evaporated extracts were dissolved in MeOH, filtered through a PTFE syringe filter and injected in volumes of 5 or 10 μl. Calibration curves were established for all the four reference standards.
