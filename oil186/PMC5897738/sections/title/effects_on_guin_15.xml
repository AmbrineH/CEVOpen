 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of the RC extract and the essential oil were tested on guinea pig urinary bladder strips as well. RC crude extract evoked concentration-dependent contraction at 20 and 200 μg/ml (

  </span> and 
  <span class="bold">Figure

  </span> for 200 μg/ml). The solvent of the extract had no contractile effect on the bladder (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4). The effect of the 200 μg/ml extract was diminished (approximately halved) by 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> capsaicin pretreatment (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the relaxant effect of the crude extract, the bladder strips were sub-maximally pre-contracted with histamine (1–3 μM). Atropine and tetrodotoxin were present in the bathing fluid. Since excitatory purinergic mechanisms are present in the bladder, α,β-methylene ATP desensitization (10 + 10 μM for 10 min each) was also performed. RC crude extract had no effect at a concentration of 20 μg/ml, whereas a concentration of 200 μg/ml induced 58.3 ± 4.6% relaxation (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 7 and 8, respectively). The solvent itself (1 μl/ml DMSO) exerted no effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Roman chamomile essential oil caused no contraction in a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Similarly to the extract, RC oil exerted a moderate relaxing effect on the pre-contracted bladder: 17.9 ± 6.1% and 34.1 ± 5.8% relaxation was evoked with 1 and 10 μg/ml, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 7 and 6, respectively.
