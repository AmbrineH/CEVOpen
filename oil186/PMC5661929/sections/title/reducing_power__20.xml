 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reductive potential of studied samples was determined according to the method reported by Bounatirou, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Different sample concentration (1 mL) were mixed with 1 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 mol/L, pH 6.6) and 1 mL of potassium ferricyanide K
  <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
  <sub>6</sub> (10 mg/mL). After incubation at 50 °C for 20 min, 1 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10 mg/mL) was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, FeCl
  <sub>3</sub> (10 mg/mL) was added to the upper layer and left to stand for 10 min before the measurement of the absorbance at 700 nm on UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-190). The amount of sample providing 0.5 absorbances was determined from the graphical of absorbance at 700 nm. BHT was used as the control.
