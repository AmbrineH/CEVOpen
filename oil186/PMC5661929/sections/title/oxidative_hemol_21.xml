 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methods of assessment of hemolytic activity, focus on the study of the potential damage caused by hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>) in erythrocyte membranes. The anti-hemolytic activity of the essential oil was determined following the method reported by Lalitha and Selvam, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] with modifications [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Whole fresh human blood from healthy person (15 mL) was collected in EDTA tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 
  <span class="italic">g</span> at 4 °C. The plasma was removed and obtained red blood cells (RBCs) was suspended in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4). The erythrocytes were washed 3 times with PBS and finally re-suspended in PBS to obtain a solution at 4%. One milliliter of this suspension was mixed with different concentrations (10–100 μg/mL) of the essential oils and methanolic extract and added to 7.5 mM of H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> prepared in PBS. After incubation with agitation for 120 min at 37 °C, the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 1000 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 5 min. Finally, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm on UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-190). Vitamin C was used as the reference (5–30 μg/mL).
