 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aroma compounds were isolated using two methods (Headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD)) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bioactive phenolic compounds were identified by mean of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD). Reducing power, hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>) scavenging and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays were used to investigate antioxidant activity. Anti-hemolytic activity was evaluated using H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>-induced hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC).
