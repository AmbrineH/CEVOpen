 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analyses were performed in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) with a Varian ProStar HPLC System (Varian 330/ Vis Detector and Varian 230 SDM) and C18 column (Zorbax, 4.6 mm × 250 mm). The mobile phase consisted of acetic acid (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B). The gradient was composed of 0% (B) for 2 min; 50% (B) until 30 min and 80% (B) for 5 min. The methanolic extracts were utilized in the concentration of 1 mg/mL. The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min and the volume injected was 40 μL. The detected compounds were identified by comparing their retention time with those of injected authentic standards from Sigma-Aldrich and the use of DAD spectra (200–600 nm).</p>
