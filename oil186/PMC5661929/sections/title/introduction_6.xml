 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All over the world, plants are known as a source of nutrients, flavoring additives, oxygen, decoration and biologically active components. The curing effects of plants derived from bioactive substances that are named secondary metabolites which include phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, coumarins and other metabolites. These compounds can be synthesized by different plant parts (leaf, root, fruit, flower and stem bark). These metabolites can exert many biological effects including anti-thrombogenic, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, antifungal and antioxidant proprieties [

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural products have been found to have the ability to prevent damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These free radicals have been associated with various diseases, such as cardiovascular, liver injury, atherosclerosis, and cancer diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. In addition, ROS have been implicated in DNA mutations, lipid peroxidation and protein damage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Therefore, many researchers have intensified search to characterize new antioxidant compounds from plant sources usable for clinical applications [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> forms part of the Pittosporaceae family and includes 200 species which are distributed in the temperate and hot zone of the Earth. 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> species have been used in folk medicine of many countries in the world. 
  <span class="italic">P. glabratum</span> from Chine has been used for the treatment of hypertension [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] and the bark of 
  <span class="italic">P. neelgherrense</span> as antivenom [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">P. undulatum</span> from Portugal has been used to repair muscles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Australian people used 
  <span class="italic">P. phylliraeoides</span> to treat sprains and eczema [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. This genus provides an excellent source of essential oil components such as monoterpenes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes among others compounds. Plant 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> discovered by the Europeans, is about 2–3 m high, the leaves are dark green, flowers have a smell similar to orange flowers and the black seeds are enclosed within the encapsulated fruits. Previous studies on the composition of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation procedure, have indicated the presence of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene as the major component of the flowers for species growing in Iran [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. This plant has been demonstrated to possess many pharmaceutical properties. Moon and Park [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], reported its protective effects against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, El Dib et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], determined that the n-butanol fraction from 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> leaves possess antimicrobial activity and cytoprotective effects against breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and colon carcinoma cancer cell lines. However, data on the antioxidant activities of seed essential oils from this plant are insufficient. Hence, the aim of the present research is to determine nutritional value, phenolic compound and biological activities of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> methanolic extract. The aroma compounds composition of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> seeds were also identified by headspace solid phase microextraction and hydrodistillation coupled to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and their antioxidant and anti-hemolytic capacities were studied.
