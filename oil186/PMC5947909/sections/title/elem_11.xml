  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a> shows spectra of non-heated and heated samples of desi ghee excited at λ
  <sub>ex</sub>: 280 nm. In this figure, standard deviation is plotted at each fluorescence spectrum of heated samples which appears as shaded area and its small value confirms the repeatability of data. The samples were heated at a temperature of 140, 150 with egg, 150 without egg, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. The purpose of this experiment was to find possible changes in fluorescence spectra of desi ghee heated at different temperatures for 5 minutes during which cooking/frying of food is usually carried out but it also depends upon the quantity of the material and heating sources.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear from 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a> that vitamins A, E and CLA contents apparently present from 380–500 nm sustained with heating at temperature of 140–150°C and started to deteriorate for further heating as a result of thermal oxidation. The spectral variations in the molecular composition of desi ghee heated at 150°C with egg and without egg are almost same which explains that the presence of egg for frying does not affect its molecular composition to a large extent. At temperatures above 150°C band at 552 nm which is assigned to oxidative products[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref011">11</a>] shows a gradual upward increase in its intensity with an increase in temperature starting from 160°C and becomes maximum at 250°C. Similarly, fluorescence band at 620 nm may also be assigned to oxidative products because its trend of intensity rise is similar as observed in case of fluorescence emission band at 552 nm however, it is not reported in literature. Actually, as temperature goes above 150°C primary oxidation products produced which are unstable and immediately decomposes to secondary oxidation products with the rise in temperature like alcohols, saturated &amp; unsaturated aldehydes and epoxy compounds are reported[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref039">39</a>]. In case of desi ghee heating in present study, possibly similar type of compounds appear with heating as temperature goes above 150°C, primary oxidation products started to appear with heating and decomposes to secondary oxidation products at 180–200°C with prominent spectral variations indicating severe damage to the natural ingredients of desi ghee. When temperatures increase from 200–250°C final oxidation products such as aldehydes and ketones produced with a rancid smell form the desi ghee and spectra at this temperature appear to be different from all the rest. Fluorescence bands at 390, 440, 460 and 490 nm show a gradual decrease in intensity as temperature goes above 150°C indicating the thermal oxidation of monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and CLA isomers. Also, In the first region of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a> from 350–490 nm, an overall decrease in intensity of the peaks can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of fat soluble vitamins K, D and E and while in the later region from 490–650 nm an overall increase in the intensity can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of vitamin-A isomers with the vital evolution of oxidative products at 552 and 620 nm. Isomers of CLA present in large concentration shows deterioration in both regions with the rise in temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed to classify different overlapping spectral signatures which are hard to observe by naked eye. PCA is a non-supervised statistical procedure which uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of uncorrelated variables named principal components. These principle components are not correlated and are orthogonal to one another. These principal components are calculated based on the variance in the data and when plotted as a scatter plot, they nicely separate different set of data. First two or three components usually give maximum information about the variance in the data[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref040">40</a>] sets and if they are completely orthogonal to each other, then their score plot between PC1 and PC2 separate both components. In PCA score plot shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g004" href="#pone.0197340.g004">Fig 4</a>, heated samples from 140–150°C are not separable from the non-heated one which show stability of buffalo ghee for said temperature range for a heating time period of 5 minutes. Ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg clustered a little away from samples heated at 150°C without egg near samples heated at 160°C which explains the possible oxidation of ghee samples due to egg contamination. But it does not show a very strange behavior and lies near the samples heated from 140–150°C without egg. Even samples heated at 160 and 170°C are lying close to non-heated or heated from 140–150°C samples. In contrast, samples heated at 180°C and above clustered far from the non-heated or heated from 140–150°C and can be observed in the fluorescence spectra in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a>. Desi ghee samples heated at 200 and 250°C clustered on negative side of the PCA score plot showing very different behavior from the rest and also appear very different in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a>. Therefore, the temperature ranges from 140–170°C may be considered as safe for frying/cooking in order to preserve molecular composition of desi ghee during cooking.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to illustrate that PCA classification is based upon its loading vectors, two samples heated at 150 and 200°C were selected with prominent spectral differences to produce their PCA scatter plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</a> and their loading vectors in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5A</a> shows Fluorescence spectra of ghee samples heated at 150 and 200°C and evidently explains that Fluorescence emission bands at 400, 435 and 452 nm show variations in intensity/shapes of bands which are induced as a result of heating. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5B</a> illustrated that the samples heated at 150°C are clustered in the positive side and samples heated at 200°C in the negative side of the PC1 axis which follows from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref041">41</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5C</a> shows PC1 loadings and corresponding labelling of bands. It is clear from PC1 loadings that Fluorescence emission bands at 400 and 435 nm are loaded positively while at 552 nm are loaded negatively which shows that heating at 200 induces prominent changes in these molecules as compared to heating at 150°C. Therefore, it can be concluded that PC1 mainly separates the two-data set with maximum variance of 100% while PC2 gives only noise. This shows that PC1 and PC2 are independent of each other which causes the separation of both types of data when score plot is produced. It means that features identified in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g004" href="#pone.0197340.g004">Fig 4</a> are also feature in the loadings of PC1.
