 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence spectra of non-heated buffalo ghee recorded with different excited wavelengths from 250–430 nm is displayed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001" href="#pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</a>. Analysis of ghee spectra evidently suggests the selection of excitation wavelengths at 280 and 410 nm where they fluoresce maximum spectral information for studying the heating effects on its molecular composition. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001" href="#pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</a> shows prominent fluorescence bands at 380, 440, 490, 552, 635, 660, 671 and 708 nm. The fluorescence band at 380 nm in buffalo ghee accounts for fat soluble vitamins and also shows traces of carotenoids and this band also appears in buffalo milk so verifying the presence of these ingredients [

  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref026">26</a>]. Bands at 440 and 490 nm are associated to isomers of CLA and vitamin A respectively. Fluorescence band at 552 nm is assigned to oxidation product which evolved due to heating during extraction process. The region from 620–700 nm can be assigned to chlorophyll[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the comparison of assignments of fluorescence bands in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001" href="#pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</a>, fluorescence spectra of non-heated desi ghee along with spectra of vitamins A, D, E, K and CLA obtained at excitation wavelengths of 280 nm is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g002" href="#pone.0197340.g002">Fig 2</a>. CLA is reported for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, anticancer attributes, help strengthen the body immune system and general human health[

  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref027">27</a>] which is a very common problem across the world. Desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk has high concentration of CLA which acts as an antioxidant[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref003">3</a>]. Fluorescence spectra of CLA at λ
  <sub>ex</sub>: 280 nm gives a broad band emission spectra form 350–600 nm centered roughly at 460 nm, which may be assigned for Isomers of CLA. Spectra of CLA completely overlaps with the desi ghee spectra giving rise to the fact that CLA isomers are widely present in buffalo ghee which is in accordance with literature[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to World Health Organisation (WHO) about 45% of vitamin A deficient and xerophthalmic women and children habitat in south and southeast Asia[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref028">28</a>]. Pakistan is also facing many health problems including deficiency of vitamin A which lead to the effects like anemia, eye retinal disparity and diarrhea[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref029">29</a>]. Fluorescence spectrum of Vitamin-A shows its strong overlapping with spectra obtained from buffalo ghee which is obvious from the fact that buffalo milk is rich with vitamin A[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref004">4</a>]. Its concentration in the buffalo milk has been reported as 340 IU.mL

  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref030">30</a>]. Therefore, an adequate quantity of buffalo ghee in daily food can be helpful to eradicate deficiency of this vitamin.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vitamin E is one of the most important lipid soluble nutrients and its severe deficiency can cause cystic fibrosis, chronic cholestatic liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia, short bowl syndrome and can have severe effects on central nervous system of human body[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref031">31</a>]. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and help maintain cell bioactivity in human body[

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g002" href="#pone.0197340.g002">Fig 2</a> shows vitamin E spectra in the form of a broad band from 350–600 nm covering almost half of desi ghee spectra which confirm its presence in buffalo ghee as buffalo milk fat contains high level of natural antioxidant tocopherol(vitamin E)[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref030">30</a>]. Daily use of buffalo ghee can provide human with the requirements of vitamin E and may prevent them from several diseases.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emission spectrum of vitamin K cantered at 385 nm covers the shoulder of buffalo ghee spectrum. Vitamin K help stop bleeding by rapid coagulation of blood[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref034">34</a>] and its deficiency increases the risk of bone fracture[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref035">35</a>]. Therefore, its adequate quantity in daily food becomes vital for human health and ghee is one of the good sources available for this vitamin.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g002" href="#pone.0197340.g002">Fig 2</a> shows fluorescence spectra of vitamin D, where a prominent emission band appears at 375 nm when excited at 280 nm and shows its presence in buffalo ghee. The deficiency of vitamin D can cause cardiovascular diseases and rickets[
