  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g006" href="#pone.0197340.g006">Fig 6</a> shows a nice comparison between fluorescence emission spectra of non-heated buffalo ghee with vitamin A, D, E, K and CLA excited at λ
  <sub>ex</sub>: 410 nm. Fluorescence emission band positions of non-heated desi ghee and vitamins are different from emissions excited at 280 nm. This shift/change in emission bands possibly explain the wavelength dependence behaviour of fluorophores present in buffalo ghee under different excitation wavelengths. With excitation wavelength of 410 nm, non-heated buffalo ghee shows prominent fluorescence bands at 450, 460, 476, 490, 635, 660 and 671 nm. These emission spectra can be divided into two regions: region one can be assigned to emission band from 430–560 nm centered roughly at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin-A, bands at 450 and 460 nm are assigned to vitamin E and D, band at 476 assigned to Vitamin-K contents and band at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin A respectively. In second region from 620–700 nm, the peaks at 635, 660, 671 and 700 nm are assigned to chlorophyll contents.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" href="#pone.0197340.g007">Fig 7</a> shows comparison of fluorescence spectra of non-heated and heated desi ghee samples with all the vitamins and CLA. Desi ghee samples were heated from 140–250°C along with ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. It can be observed that samples heated at 140, 150°C without egg, 150°C with egg and 160°C are not separable apparently from non-heated samples in the first region from 430–550 nm. This observation leads to the fact that desi ghee retains its vitamins and CLA composition up to a temperature of 160°C for a heating time of 5 minutes. In second region 620–700 nm samples hated at 140°C are not separable from non-heated ones. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more oxidation of chlorophyll as compared to samples heated at 150°C without egg and 160°C which appear mainly in the form of change in color of desi ghee. This increase in oxidation corresponds to the contamination induced by egg during frying process. Samples heated at 170°C shows rise in intensity in first region and decrease in the second region. An appreciable spectral change occurs for the samples heated at 180°C with a shift in whole band towards higher wavelength values in the first region and a complete oxidation of chlorophyll contents in the second region. The natural ingredients undergo thermal oxidation which fluoresce in the form of broad bands and shifted towards higher wavelength values. In fact, valuable ingredients of buffalo ghee start to deteriorate as temperature rise above 150°C as a result of thermal oxidation with the initiation of primary to secondary oxidation products and finally end at final products like ketones and aldehydes at smoke temperature[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref039">39</a>]. Spectral changes at 180°C possibly explain the evolution of secondary oxidative products and this trend continues for the temperatures of 200 and 250°C as can be observed from 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" href="#pone.0197340.g007">Fig 7</a>. Fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee heated at 200°C shows a prominent shift towards higher wavelength showing maximum oxidation of valuable contents like vitamins and isomers of CLA as compared to non-heated ghee samples. Heating of desi ghee at temperature of 250°C induces further changes in the molecular composition of ghee leading to the evolution of final products like ketones and aldehydes with rancid smell. It shows a complete deterioration of natural molecular ingredients of desi ghee.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g008" href="#pone.0197340.g008">Fig 8</a> is a PCA scatter plot where non-heated ghee samples clustered with samples heated at 140°C. Samples heated at 150 and 160°C clustered nearer to the non-hated ones as compared to samples heated at 150°C with egg. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more deterioration as compared to heated at 140–160°C due to possible contamination during frying process. Ghee samples heated above 170°C shows a separating trend from the rest. Samples heated at 180, 200 and 250°C clustered away from the rest showing prominent deterioration in the natural molecular structure of desi ghee. These finding confirms the oxidation of desi ghee that started at a temperature of 170°C and induces small spectral variations up to 180°C. Buffalo ghee loses most of its natural ingredients at a temperature of 200°C and turned to rancid material like aldehydes and ketones as final products at 250°C as clearly visible in PCA plot. Therefore, temperature range from 140–170°C is defined as safe for cooking/frying purposes using desi ghee and up to 180°C with small deterioration in its natural ingredients.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For more detailed analysis, two heated samples at 150 and 200°C were selected to produce their fluorescence spectra, PCA scatter plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 and loading vectors as shown in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009" href="#pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9B</a> shows PCA score plot where samples heated at 150°C clustered in the positive side while samples heated at 200°C are clustered in the negative side of the PC1 axis which follows from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively as shown in loadings of PC1. Evidently, positive loadings can be observed at fluorescence bands appearing at 460 and 660 nm and negative loadings at 545 nm. PC1 explains the maximum variance (100%) between two data set. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009" href="#pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9D</a> shows PC2 as compared to PC1 where maximum variance has been explained. These features show a relative intensity change with the rise of temperature which is due to the oxidation of valuable lipid nutrients, vitamins and isomers of CLA at high temperatures of 200°C as compared to 150°C. The spectral changes associated with PC1 and PC2 are not correlated, therefore score plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 completely separate both data set. This explanation therefore suggested that the classification of different data groups shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g008" href="#pone.0197340.g008">Fig 8</a> is based on the molecular changes which appeared due to heating of ghee samples. These findings suggest that temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be used for safe frying/cooking with buffalo ghee without undergoing appreciable changes in its natural molecular structure and food ingredients also remain safe under proper heating conditions.
