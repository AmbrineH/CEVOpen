 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heating introduces prominent effects on the natural molecular composition of desi ghee due to thermal oxidation of fats, vitamins and CLA isomers. Desi ghee retains its molecular composition to a temperature range which is investigated in this study by fluorescence spectra which are recorded by using excitation wavelengths 280 and 410 nm as explained in the following paragraphs.</p>

In this figure, standard deviation is plotted at each fluorescence spectrum of heated samples which appears as shaded area and its small value confirms the repeatability of data. The samples were heated at a temperature of 140, 150 with egg, 150 without egg, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. The purpose of this experiment was to find possible changes in fluorescence spectra of desi ghee heated at different temperatures for 5 minutes during which cooking/frying of food is usually carried out but it also depends upon the quantity of the material and heating sources.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear from 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a> that vitamins A, E and CLA contents apparently present from 380–500 nm sustained with heating at temperature of 140–150°C and started to deteriorate for further heating as a result of thermal oxidation. The spectral variations in the molecular composition of desi ghee heated at 150°C with egg and without egg are almost same which explains that the presence of egg for frying does not affect its molecular composition to a large extent. At temperatures above 150°C band at 552 nm which is assigned to oxidative products[
   <a rid="pone.0197340.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref011">11</a>] shows a gradual upward increase in its intensity with an increase in temperature starting from 160°C and becomes maximum at 250°C. Similarly, fluorescence band at 620 nm may also be assigned to oxidative products because its trend of intensity rise is similar as observed in case of fluorescence emission band at 552 nm however, it is not reported in literature. Actually, as temperature goes above 150°C primary oxidation products produced which are unstable and immediately decomposes to secondary oxidation products with the rise in temperature like alcohols, saturated &amp; unsaturated aldehydes and epoxy compounds are reported[
   <a rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref039">39</a>]. In case of desi ghee heating in present study, possibly similar type of compounds appear with heating as temperature goes above 150°C, primary oxidation products started to appear with heating and decomposes to secondary oxidation products at 180–200°C with prominent spectral variations indicating severe damage to the natural ingredients of desi ghee. When temperatures increase from 200–250°C final oxidation products such as aldehydes and ketones produced with a rancid smell form the desi ghee and spectra at this temperature appear to be different from all the rest. Fluorescence bands at 390, 440, 460 and 490 nm show a gradual decrease in intensity as temperature goes above 150°C indicating the thermal oxidation of monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and CLA isomers. Also, In the first region of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a> from 350–490 nm, an overall decrease in intensity of the peaks can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of fat soluble vitamins K, D and E and while in the later region from 490–650 nm an overall increase in the intensity can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of vitamin-A isomers with the vital evolution of oxidative products at 552 and 620 nm. Isomers of CLA present in large concentration shows deterioration in both regions with the rise in temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed to classify different overlapping spectral signatures which are hard to observe by naked eye. PCA is a non-supervised statistical procedure which uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of uncorrelated variables named principal components. These principle components are not correlated and are orthogonal to one another. These principal components are calculated based on the variance in the data and when plotted as a scatter plot, they nicely separate different set of data. First two or three components usually give maximum information about the variance in the data[
   <a rid="pone.0197340.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref040">40</a>] sets and if they are completely orthogonal to each other, then their score plot between PC1 and PC2 separate both components. In PCA score plot shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g004" href="#pone.0197340.g004">Fig 4</a>, heated samples from 140–150°C are not separable from the non-heated one which show stability of buffalo ghee for said temperature range for a heating time period of 5 minutes. Ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg clustered a little away from samples heated at 150°C without egg near samples heated at 160°C which explains the possible oxidation of ghee samples due to egg contamination. But it does not show a very strange behavior and lies near the samples heated from 140–150°C without egg. Even samples heated at 160 and 170°C are lying close to non-heated or heated from 140–150°C samples. In contrast, samples heated at 180°C and above clustered far from the non-heated or heated from 140–150°C and can be observed in the fluorescence spectra in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a>. Desi ghee samples heated at 200 and 250°C clustered on negative side of the PCA score plot showing very different behavior from the rest and also appear very different in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" href="#pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</a>. Therefore, the temperature ranges from 140–170°C may be considered as safe for frying/cooking in order to preserve molecular composition of desi ghee during cooking.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5B</a> illustrated that the samples heated at 150°C are clustered in the positive side and samples heated at 200°C in the negative side of the PC1 axis which follows from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively[

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g005" href="#pone.0197340.g005">Fig 5C</a> shows PC1 loadings and corresponding labelling of bands. It is clear from PC1 loadings that Fluorescence emission bands at 400 and 435 nm are loaded positively while at 552 nm are loaded negatively which shows that heating at 200 induces prominent changes in these molecules as compared to heating at 150°C. Therefore, it can be concluded that PC1 mainly separates the two-data set with maximum variance of 100% while PC2 gives only noise. This shows that PC1 and PC2 are independent of each other which causes the separation of both types of data when score plot is produced. It means that features identified in

   <sub>ex</sub>: 410 nm. Fluorescence emission band positions of non-heated desi ghee and vitamins are different from emissions excited at 280 nm. This shift/change in emission bands possibly explain the wavelength dependence behaviour of fluorophores present in buffalo ghee under different excitation wavelengths. With excitation wavelength of 410 nm, non-heated buffalo ghee shows prominent fluorescence bands at 450, 460, 476, 490, 635, 660 and 671 nm. These emission spectra can be divided into two regions: region one can be assigned to emission band from 430–560 nm centered roughly at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin-A, bands at 450 and 460 nm are assigned to vitamin E and D, band at 476 assigned to Vitamin-K contents and band at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin A respectively. In second region from 620–700 nm, the peaks at 635, 660, 671 and 700 nm are assigned to chlorophyll contents.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" href="#pone.0197340.g007">Fig 7</a> shows comparison of fluorescence spectra of non-heated and heated desi ghee samples with all the vitamins and CLA. Desi ghee samples were heated from 140–250°C along with ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. It can be observed that samples heated at 140, 150°C without egg, 150°C with egg and 160°C are not separable apparently from non-heated samples in the first region from 430–550 nm. This observation leads to the fact that desi ghee retains its vitamins and CLA composition up to a temperature of 160°C for a heating time of 5 minutes. In second region 620–700 nm samples hated at 140°C are not separable from non-heated ones. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more oxidation of chlorophyll as compared to samples heated at 150°C without egg and 160°C which appear mainly in the form of change in color of desi ghee. This increase in oxidation corresponds to the contamination induced by egg during frying process. Samples heated at 170°C shows rise in intensity in first region and decrease in the second region. An appreciable spectral change occurs for the samples heated at 180°C with a shift in whole band towards higher wavelength values in the first region and a complete oxidation of chlorophyll contents in the second region. The natural ingredients undergo thermal oxidation which fluoresce in the form of broad bands and shifted towards higher wavelength values. In fact, valuable ingredients of buffalo ghee start to deteriorate as temperature rise above 150°C as a result of thermal oxidation with the initiation of primary to secondary oxidation products and finally end at final products like ketones and aldehydes at smoke temperature[
   <a rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref039">39</a>]. Spectral changes at 180°C possibly explain the evolution of secondary oxidative products and this trend continues for the temperatures of 200 and 250°C as can be observed from 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" href="#pone.0197340.g007">Fig 7</a>. Fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee heated at 200°C shows a prominent shift towards higher wavelength showing maximum oxidation of valuable contents like vitamins and isomers of CLA as compared to non-heated ghee samples. Heating of desi ghee at temperature of 250°C induces further changes in the molecular composition of ghee leading to the evolution of final products like ketones and aldehydes with rancid smell. It shows a complete deterioration of natural molecular ingredients of desi ghee.

Samples heated at 150 and 160°C clustered nearer to the non-hated ones as compared to samples heated at 150°C with egg. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more deterioration as compared to heated at 140–160°C due to possible contamination during frying process. Ghee samples heated above 170°C shows a separating trend from the rest. Samples heated at 180, 200 and 250°C clustered away from the rest showing prominent deterioration in the natural molecular structure of desi ghee. These finding confirms the oxidation of desi ghee that started at a temperature of 170°C and induces small spectral variations up to 180°C. Buffalo ghee loses most of its natural ingredients at a temperature of 200°C and turned to rancid material like aldehydes and ketones as final products at 250°C as clearly visible in PCA plot. Therefore, temperature range from 140–170°C is defined as safe for cooking/frying purposes using desi ghee and up to 180°C with small deterioration in its natural ingredients.

These features show a relative intensity change with the rise of temperature which is due to the oxidation of valuable lipid nutrients, vitamins and isomers of CLA at high temperatures of 200°C as compared to 150°C. The spectral changes associated with PC1 and PC2 are not correlated, therefore score plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 completely separate both data set.
