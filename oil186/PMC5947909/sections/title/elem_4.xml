 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-4, Horiba scientific, Jobin Yvon, USA) with xenon light source has been employed to record the fluorescence spectra from all heated and non-heated desi ghee samples. Buffalo ghee samples in molten form were poured in a square cuvette and the emission spectra were recorded. In order to record closely spaced emission spectra, width of slits was fixed at 3 nm for excitation and 2 nm for emission monochromators. A fresh non-heated desi ghee sample was excited with different wavelengths from 250 to 430 nm with steps of 10 nm. The excitation bands from 250–320 nm and 330–430 nm result in emission spectra of similar shape of corresponding range, are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001" href="#pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</a>. Among these excitation wavelengths, two excitation wavelengths at 280 and 410 nm with maximum spectral information were selected to record the emission spectra of the ghee samples which were heated at temperatures of 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C. For each excitation wavelength, 10 emission spectra were recorded from each sample to eliminate any instrumental and human error. Similarly, fluorescence spectra from the samples of vitamins A, D, E, K and CLA were recorded using excitation wavelengths of 280 and 410 nm. For vitamins and CLA, three spectra for each were recorded and their average was plotted for each wavelength to eradicate any instrumental or human error.
