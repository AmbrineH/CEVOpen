 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of the essential oil components was carried out by high-resolution gas chromatography analysis, in the analytical laboratory, at Tropical Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI)-Arusha. The injection volume was 2 μl composed of 1.6 μl of a solution of essential oil (40 μg/ml) and 0.4 μl of a solution of hydrocarbon series of C
  <sub>7</sub>-C, as an internal standard, both in n-hexanes as a solvent. The gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-GC-MS-system used consisted of a gas chromatograph, Thermo Scientific® Ultra GC coupled to a mass spectrometer, Thermo Scientific®
  <span class="bold">.</span> The fused silica capillary column used was a DB-5 J &amp; W Scientific (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm). Helium was the carrier gas, and the column temperature program was increased by 3 °C per minute between 60 and 240 °C. The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV at a scan rate of 0.84 scans/s and at the range m/z 40–500. The retention times of sample components and a mixture of n-alkanes from C
  <sub>7</sub>-C, coinjected into the GC-MS system under the same temperature program was used for the calculation of the Arithmetic Retention Index - AI - and the Kovats Retention Index (KI) [
