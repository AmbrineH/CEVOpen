 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine environments continue to be exposed to oil pollution events as oil and gas production activities continue to expand [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Accidental and operational releases of crude oil remain a threat to marine biota, including fish, therefore monitoring activities play an important role. Atlantic cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) is a commonly used fish species in environmental monitoring in the North Atlantic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. For this species, the adverse effects of oil exposure, in particular, the damage caused by petrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) − a class of compounds found in crude oil and oil products − is well documented [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. In addition, several biomarkers of petrogenic PAH exposure are well-established for this species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. PAHs found in crude oil are well-known carcinogens due to their ability to form DNA and protein adducts following their primary metabolism in the liver [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Liver enzymes initiate the excretion process of PAHs by transforming them into more water soluble conjugated metabolites, which are sometimes more toxic than their corresponding parent PAHs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The conjugated metabolites are then excreted via the bile into the intestinal tract. The fate of conjugated metabolites in the intestinal tract and their effect on the gut microbiota is still under investigation. It is generally assumed that conjugated biliary PAH metabolites either (1) pass through the gut unchanged and are eliminated via feces, or (2) are hydrolyzed spontaneously, reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and transported to the liver via the portal vein (enterohepatic recirculation) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Considering the metabolic diversity of the gut microbiota, conjugated metabolites could also undergo biotransformation as a result of bacterial activity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Moreover, there might be mechanisms that exacerbate the toxic effects of pollutants by for example reactivating conjugated biliary metabolites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Studies on the potential interactions between biliary metabolites and gut microbiota in fish are scarce, and most microbiota studies have so far been carried out on mammals, e.g., mice and humans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Their results indicate that gut microbiota can indeed be actively involved in biotransformation of environmental pollutants. Such biotransformation may influence the detoxification process and alter the fate of xenobiotic compounds. At the same time, these pollutants can in return influence the composition of the gut microbiota.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species composition, richness and diversity of the fish gut microbiome has been studied extensively in fish species that are interesting for the aquaculture industry mainly with the interest of improving fish health through enhanced feed. Commonly used methods include cultivation and/or molecular profiling with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Based on the increasing use of next-generation sequencing techniques a diverse gut microbiome composition has been detected in fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. While next-generation sequencing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] indicated changes in the intestinal community of a freshwater fish (goldfish, 
  <span class="italic">Carassius auratus</span>) upon exposure to an environmental pollutant (pentachlorophenol), studies investigating such effect in marine fish are lacking. Herein, we report the effect of oil exposure on the intestinal microflora in Atlantic cod. The aim of this study was to assess the potential shift in gut bacterial community composition of Atlantic cod due to oil exposure. The intestinal bacterial community composition, as analyzed by Illumina sequencing of V4 amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, was compared among gut microbiota of fish after a 28-day exposure to four levels of oil concentration (i.e., no oil, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L). Results from biological effect measurement, i.e. PAH metabolite analysis in fish bile, were used to confirm metabolic uptake of oil by the fish [
