 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical analysis was carried out in order to assess PAH content of the Troll C crude oil and of samples taken from the header tank on day 14 and 28 (Intertek West Lab AS, ISO28540:2011). In the Troll C crude oil, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) PAHs were quantified, while in the header tank, 25 PAH compounds and groups of compounds were measured.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Morphometric measurements, i.e., length, total weight of fish and liver weights, were recorded for all sampled specimens. General physiological indices were calculated as follows [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]:

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Condition Index (CI) = (weight (g)/[length (cm)]
  <span class="sup">3</span>) × 100.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepatosomatic Index (HSI) = [liver weight (g)/fish weight (g)] × 100.</p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PAH metabolites in bile were determined by two methods, the semi-quantitative fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) analysis of bile samples was conducted as described by Aas et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Bile samples were diluted in 50% methanol and analysed using a Lumina fluorescence spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The concentration of PAH metabolites was expressed as mg pyrene fluorescence equivalents (PFE)/mL bile.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis was carried out as previously described [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. In brief, the OH-PAHs were extracted with ethylacetate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated prior to sylilation with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSFTA). Trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers of OH-PAHs were analysed using an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with a CP-Sil 8 CB-MS (Varian) column. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV in selected ion mode (SIM).
