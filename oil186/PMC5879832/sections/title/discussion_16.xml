 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crude oil from the Troll platform, one of the largest oil fields on the Norwegian continental shelf, was used in order to investigate changes in GI microbial community composition of Atlantic cod upon a 28-day exposure, mimicking an environmental oil spill scenario. Chemical analysis showed that Troll C crude oil, similarly to other crude oils used in exposure studies of Atlantic cod, e.g., North Sea crude, contained significant amounts of PAHs.</p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, this study showed that a 28-day exposure to Troll C crude oil at 0.01–0.1 mg/L resulted in no fish death and no significant changes in morphological parameters. This confirmed previous findings where no changes in CI and HSI were observed after 3-weeks exposure to produced water at 0.125% (total PAH 0.102 μg/L) in Atlantic cod [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Generally, a high CI and a high HSI indicate good health in fish and HSI in particular is considered the most sensitive growth indicator of fish. Nevertheless, CI can take up to several months prior to showing significant change due to environmental stressors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Sub-lethal doses of crude oil were previously demonstrated to cause declining HSI, however, such effects are not always observed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following exposure to petrogenic PAHs, a wide range of conjugated oxidation products are accumulated in the bile of Atlantic cod [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. In this study, an increased level of PAH metabolites, showing a dose-response pattern, was found in bile samples of oil exposed fish. Bile metabolite measurement is considered as a sensitive tool for assessing exposure to oil and also produced water containing PAHs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Several laboratory and field studies documented significantly elevated bile metabolite levels even at very low exposure concentrations similarly to the experiment presented here. PERMANOVA and NMDS analysis of GC-MS measured PAH metabolite concentrations in fish bile showed a dichotomy between the two lower (0.0 and 0.01 mg/L oil) and the two upper (0.05 and 0.1 mg/L oil) exposure levels. Based on these results, statistical analyses performed on the GI microbial community was done on pooled data, i.e., on data combined into lower and upper exposure groups.
 </p>
 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OTU richness with numbers ranging from 133 to 720 OTUs identified in the 12 cod microbiomes were similar to that observed in analysis of 11 specimens of wild-caught Atlantic cod, where the number of OTUs per sample ranged from 40 to 228 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. A significantly higher number of OTUs (1850) were detected in 20 specimens of juvenile Atlantic salmon (salmon parr) at a similar sequencing depth [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Despite a relatively long time (28 days) spent under laboratory conditions, Shannon and Inverse Simpson indices varied greatly among individuals. Given the assumption that identical environmental conditions and feeding routines are expected to homogenize GI microbial communities this result was perhaps unexpected. Nevertheless, the ranges were somewhat narrower (Shannon: 0.54–2.30 and Inverse Simpson: 1.31–5.14) when compared to 11 specimens of wild-caught Atlantic cod kept under laboratory conditions for 12 days (Shannon: 0.30–3.07 and Inverse Simpson: 1.09–11.18). Large inter-individual variation in the intestinal microbial composition has been observed in other studies as well [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] including GI microbial communities of a group of identically reared sibling zebrafishes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Based on results emerging from next-generation sequencing studies of fish GI tract microbiota, the idea that each individual harbors a unique microbial ecosystem is being constantly reinforced [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Such high inter-individual variability has already raised the question of experimental reproducibility of exposure studies, which may be affected by the influence of highly variable fish associated microflora [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. However, implications of this variability in terms of functional variability of the GI tract microbiome and host-microbiome interactions is yet unknown.
 </p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study presented here, the microbial contents of the entire GI tract were used from fishes that were starved 7 days prior to sampling. It is well known that different alimentary components harbor distinct microbial communities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>] and that starvation influences the composition of GI tract microbiota [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In future studies, it is preferable to collect intestinal contents based on a prior visual assessment of the alimentary anatomy.
 </p>
 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the phylum level, pentachlorophenol (PCP) exposure of goldfish for 28 days resulted mainly in increase in 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> abundance and reduction of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span>/
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> ratio [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. We did not observe such effect of oil on Atlantic cod in this study. Here, both 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> were present in lower relative abundances among upper exposure level individuals. Another recent study, which examined the effects of radio-labeled graphene nanoparticles of different size in adult zebrafish, also found that microbial communities were affected, and the size of the graphene nanoparticles seemed to be an important factor in determining the composition of GI tract microbiota [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. While bacterial community composition of control fish (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4) and large nanoparticle exposed fish (n = 4) were similar, significant differences were observed in the gut microbiota composition of the small nanoparticle exposed fish (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4) based on NMDS analysis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The intestinal bacterial community in our three control samples resembles that found in 11 cod individuals from the inner Oslo fjord [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], as it is dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Vibrionales</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidales</span>, followed by 
  <span class="italic">Clostridiales</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Desulfovibrionales</span>. The large proportion of 
  <span class="italic">Vibrionales</span> (median: 55%) in our samples is close to what is observed by Star et al. (median: 50%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] and is also in agreement with findings in other marine carnivores [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Further, members of the most abundant orders have previously been reported in Atlantic cod [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Although the comparison with the Oslo fjord samples is based on a small sample sizes, the similarity between these communities indicates that our laboratory setting did not alter the species composition drastically compared to those found in wild populations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span> is a member of the recently discovered phylum Deferribacteres, and bacteria belonging to this group are considered acetoclastic iron-reducers. Iron is a nutrient that often limits bacterial growth, and animals typically try to reduce biologically available iron in order to avoid bacterial infections. Interestingly, it was found earlier, that exposure of juvenile Atlantic cod to HDF200 base oil (containing PAHs) for 30 days, resulted in downregulation of serotransferrin, a glycoprotein involved in iron-binding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Lower levels of serotransferrin could result in higher levels of biologically available iron affecting microbial community composition in the cod gut.
 </p>
 <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phylum 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacteres</span> is present -albeit at low levels of relative abundance- in both the Oslo fjord cod [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] and our control and low-level individuals. Nonetheless, here we find that it is the sole order that significantly increased in relative abundance with increasing oil exposure levels. 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span> has a wide environmental distribution and members have been found in hydrothermal vent communities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], the gut microbiota of the hydrothermal shrimp 
  <span class="italic">Rimicaris exoculate</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>] and in rodents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. Yet interestingly this order has also been found in high abundance in subsea petroleum reservoirs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. Moreover, it also occurs in relatively high abundance (19.2%) in biodegraded crude oil samples while it is absent in non-biodegraded samples from the same site [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. This implies that 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacteres</span> species thrive under oil exposed conditions. A recent metagenomic study of succession in a petroleum reservoir detected gene clusters encoding the pathway for anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic compounds in bins assigned to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Flexistipes</span> (
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. This could suggest that other genera in the 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span> might be capable of breaking down aromatic hydrocarbons as well. However, since none of the described species within the 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacteres</span> are implicated in the active breakdown of complex recalcitrant hydrocarbons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>], it is of interest to see the results of such experiments. Until then, we have to be cautious to interpret that our findings are due to catabolism of aromatic compounds by 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span> species found in the Atlantic cod gut microbiome. Nonetheless, the 
  <span class="italic">Deferribacterales</span> metabolize small molecules that are also abundant in the gut, such as monosaccharides, amino acids, short chain fatty acids in the presence of a suitable electron donor such as iron and nitrate. Therefore, when PAH exposure triggers higher iron concentrations in the cod gut, these bacteria could metabolize more of the small molecules and outcompete others. Our results provide another line of evidence suggesting that specific members of this order thrive in an environment exposed to oil, regardless of the presence of extant, complex microbial communities.
