  <a rid="B13-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-07-00041">13</a>] of the various propolis preparations in various solvents led to the identification of ~30 compounds in each sample (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" href="#foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</a>), accounting for ~60–70% of the total molecular species. Identification was performed through the comparison of chromatographic retention times, and MS and tandem MS spectra, with the literature and with commercially available standard compounds, where possible. UV acquired at 260 nm and MS profiles are illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00041-f001" href="#foods-07-00041-f001">Figure 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00041-f002" href="#foods-07-00041-f002">Figure 2</a>, respectively, for the different propolis extracts. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" href="#foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</a> also reports the quantitative data obtained with a UV detector by using a real commercially available standard or standard compounds possessing quite similar spectroscopic properties (for example, for quantitation of the various pinobanksin derivatives). The remaining unidentified part could be mainly represented by the family of triterpenoids and a small fraction of glycosylated derivatives [
  <a rid="B11-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-07-00041">11</a>]. In fact, triterpenoids are abundant and very common in all vegetable forms and they are generally present in any kind of extract [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ESIT12 is a micronized product composed of propolis extract from a raw sample to produce a highly pure propolis free of wax and other possible contaminants supported by sucrose and silicon dioxide. The other four extracts were produced from the same propolis sample of ESIT12 but in different solvents, hydroalcoholic (80% ethanol/20% water), glycolic (98% propylene glycol), and glyceric solutions, and seed oil. As evident from 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" href="#foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</a>, besides their different preparation and solvents, all these extracts show a quite similar polyphenol composition, as well as a comparable percentage. ESIT12 is indeed richer in phenolic acids (caffeic, coumaric, ferulic, and isoferulic) than liquid preparations, ~10% vs. 0.5% (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" href="#foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</a>), mainly due to the specific and owner production procedure. Apart from this difference, all five extracts show the presence of pinobanksin, chrysin, pinocembrin, galangin, pinobanksin-3-
  <span class="italic">O</span>-acetate, pinobanksin-3-
  <span class="italic">O</span>-butyrate, and various other pinobanksin derivatives such as the main bioflavonoid species. Overall, flavones and flavonols range from ~20% up to ~36% in the glyceric extract, while flavanones and diidroflavonols are between ~28% and ~41% (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001" href="#foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides their quite similar composition, the total polyphenols content, phenolic acids and bioflavonoids, was different for the various preparations (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t002" href="#foods-07-00041-t002">Table 2</a>). In fact, glycolic and hydroalcoholic extracts were found to contain a greater polyphenol percentage (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t002" href="#foods-07-00041-t002">Table 2</a>). This is probably due to the capacity of different solvents to solubilize more species than others when using the same starting raw propolis for all preparations and a quite similar extractive process (not shown, an owner process of B Natural). In fact, the well-known high capacity of hydroalcoholic solution, generally 80% ethanol and 20% water, to solubilize a great percentage of polyphenols [
  <a rid="B10-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-foods-07-00041">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-07-00041">11</a>,
  <a rid="B13-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-07-00041">13</a>] was also confirmed in this study. Moreover, we also measured a high capacity of the glycolic solvent to solubilize a very high % of polyphenols with a quite similar composition when other solvents are used. This may be of some importance for finished products produced by using glycolic preparations of propolis. However, the antioxidant activity expressed as µg trolox equivalent/mg polyphenol was found to be quite similar for the various preparations, showing that all samples are able to exert antioxidant capacity and that this activity is strictly related to the polyphenols content for propolis products with a quite similar composition (
