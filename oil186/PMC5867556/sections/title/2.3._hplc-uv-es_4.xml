 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-performance liquid chromatography equipment was from Jasco (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (pump mod. PU-1580, UV detector UV-1570, Rheodyne injector equipped with a 20 µL loop, software Jasco-Borwin rel. 1.5). The phenolic acids and flavonoids from propolis were separated using a 250 × 4.6-mm stainless-steel column Discovery-C18 4 µm 80 Ä (from Sigma-Aldrich). The eluents were (A) 0.5% acetic acid and (B) acetonitrile. Separations were performed at room temperature by solvent gradient elution from 0 min at 50% A/50% B to 60 min at 100% B at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. A UV detector set at 260 nm was also used on-line with HPLC equipment.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An Agilent 1100 VL series mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was further used on-line with HPLC equipment. The electrospray interface was set in negative ionization mode with the capillary voltage at 3500 V and a temperature source of 350 °C in full scan spectra (200–2200 Da, 10 full scans/s). Nitrogen was used as a drying (9 L/min) and nebulizing gas (11 p.s.i.). Software versions were 4.0 LC/MSD trap control 4.2 and Data Analysis 2.2 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, 2–20 µL of samples were injected at a standardized concentration expressed as the total polyphenol content evaluated by a spectrophotometric assay according to Folin-Ciocalteau (see below) against a calibration curve performed by pure galangin.</p>
