 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenolic compounds are oxidized by Folin-Ciocalteau reactive (Sigma-Aldrich) and the blue colour produced presents a maximum absorption at 750 nm evaluated by a spectrophotometer against a specific blank. Briefly, 20 µL of the propolis extracts was added to 380 µL of ethanol and 100 µL of the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. Then, 200 µL of a saturated sodium carbonate solution and 4.3 mL water were added. The tubes were then allowed to stand at room temperature for 60 min before measuring the absorbance at 750 nm against the blank. The total polyphenolic content was expressed as galangin equivalents in % 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span> or mg/mL. The concentration of polyphenols in the samples was derived from a standard curve of galangin ranging from 5 to 60 µg (correlation coefficient &gt; of 0.9890).
