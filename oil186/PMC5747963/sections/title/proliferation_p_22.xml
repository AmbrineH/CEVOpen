  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-13-175" href="#f4-ijn-13-175">Figure 4</a>. Nanoparticles suspension and nanoparticles suspension containing 5% w/w pull were diluted at 1/100 and their proliferation properties compared. The nanosystems were characterized by proliferation properties not significantly different than those of the control (GM). In comparison with GM, 5% w/w pull solution (dilution 1/100) was able to significantly enhance cell proliferation. All nanosystems containing 5% w/w pull solution were characterized by a relevant improvement of proliferation properties; with the exception of NLC s/e, based on sesame oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil, all nanoparticles determined an enhancement of cell growth significantly higher than that of standard growth conditions (control, GM) (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.05). NLC o/e, based on olive oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil, was characterized by the best performance in terms of proliferation enhancement properties.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of olive oil seems to favor cell proliferation: this result could be due to the high content of oleic acid, a fatty acid previously described for its good proliferation properties:
