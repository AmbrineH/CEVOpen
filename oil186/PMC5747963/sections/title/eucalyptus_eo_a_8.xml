 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Loading of eucalyptus EO in lipid carriers was determined by means of head space solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (according to eucalyptus oil – 07/2010:0390, Eur Ph. 9.0 Ed monograph). The following HSSPME experimental parameters were used: sample amount, 100 µL; water addition, 10 mL; fiber polydimethylsiloxane (100 µm); extraction temperature, 40°C; extraction time, 30 min; desorption temperature, 280°C; desorption time, 5 min.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One hundred-microliter aliquots of eucalyptus EO extracted from lipid nanoparticles and eucalyptus EO dispersed in an aqueous lecithin solution at the same concentration of lipid nanoparticles were separately injected.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis was effected on a Thermo Scientific DSQII single quadrupole GC-MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) (Xcalibur MS Software Version 2.1) equipped with a Restek Rtx-5 MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness), according to the following temperature program: 4 min at 60°C, then 10°C/min up to 220°C, held for 10 min; carrier gas helium, 1.0 mL/min; injector temperature, 280°C, splitless mode; transfer line temperature, 250°C; run time, 30 min. All mass spectra were acquired in electron-impact mode with ionization voltage equal to 70 eV; ion source temperature 250°C; acquisition mass range 35–500 Da.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The content percentage of each oil component was computed from the corresponding GC-MS peak area without applying any correction factor.</p>
