  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-175" href="#f1-ijn-13-175">Figure 1A</a> shows the results of SLN and NLC loaded with eucalyptus oil (e) or rosemary oil (r) and prepared by using olive oil (o), as liquid lipid, while

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Independent of nanoparticle composition, PS ranged from 220 to 300 nm and remained almost constant up to 3 months of storage. Similar results were obtained for PI that was close to 0.5, indicating nanoparticle populations characterized by a quite wide PS distribution, stable up to 3 months.</p>
