  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-13-175" href="#f2-ijn-13-175">Figure 2</a> shows the normalized bioadhesion parameter (ΔAUC/AUC) of all the nanosystems developed, nanoparticles suspension and nanoparticles suspension containing 5% w/w pull.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pull was characterized by good bioadhesive properties. Although all nanoparticles were stabilized lecithin and it is conceivable that their surface was coated by the same lecithin layers, different bioadhesion properties were observed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both SLN systems, either loaded with eucalyptus oil or with rosemary oil, were characterized by scarce bioadhesive properties. This result could be attributable to rigid structure of these nanoparticles, which impaired their interaction with the biologic substrates, preventing the formation of the bio-adhesive joint. On the contrary, all NLC formulations were characterized by good bioadhesive properties. The systems containing olive oil showed bioadhesion parameters significantly higher than those of the corresponding systems prepared by using sesame oil (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.05).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Olive oil contains 85% of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular 70% of monounsaturated (mainly oleic and palmitoleic acid) and about 15% of polyunsaturated ones (mainly linoleic and linolenic acid). On the contrary, sesame oil contains about 85% unsaturated acids; mono- and poly-unsaturated acids, which are present in comparable amounts (41% of polyunsaturated – linoleic acid and 39% of monounsatured – oleic acid).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These differences in composition could determine a different lipid packaging in nanoparticle core and a consequent modification of NLC flexibility. This could cause a different degree of interaction with the biologic substrate and consequently a different strength of the bioadhesive joint.
