  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In vitro biocompatibility Cytotoxicity test NHDF from juvenile foreskin (PromoCell GmbH, VWR, Milan, Italy) were used. Cells between the second and fifth passage were employed for all the experiments. As growth medium (GM) Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) and 200 IU/mL penicillin-0.2 mg/mL streptomycin (PBI International, Milan, Italy), was used.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fibroblasts were seeded in each well of 96-well plates (area 0.34 cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>) at a density of 10
   <span class="sup">5</span> cells/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Cells were grown for 24 h at 37°C in a 95% air/5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> atmosphere with 95% relative humidity to obtain subconfluence.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then cells were washed with saline solution and subsequently put in contact with 200 µL of each sample. Nanoparticle suspensions, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were diluted with GM in a 1/20, 1/40, and 1/100 w/w ratio. In the case of 1/100 dilution, nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were also examined and cytocompatibility was compared with that of 5% w/w pull solution diluted 1/100 with GM. Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as positive control (standard growth conditions). After 3 h contact, an MTT test was performed. This test is based on the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases of vital cells, which convert MTT to formazan. One hundred twenty-five microliters of MTT solution (Sigma Aldrich) at 0.25 µg/mL concentration in Hank’s buffered salt solution pH 7.4 was put in contact with each sample for 3 h. The reagent was then removed from each well and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (150 µL) to remove the samples and the unreacted MTT solution. After PBS removal, 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was put in each well and the absorbance was assayed at 570 nm by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Imark Absorbance Reader, Biorad, Milan, Italy), with a reference wavelength set at 655 nm. Cell viability was calculated as % ratio between the absorbance of cells treated with a sample and the absorbance of the cells kept in contact with the control, GM.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each well of a 96-well plate, 2×10
   <span class="sup">4</span> fibroblasts/well were seeded and grown 24 h to obtain subconfluence. Afterwards, cell substrates were put in contact with 200 µL of each sample. Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were diluted with GM in a 1/100 w/w ratio. Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as positive control (standard growth conditions). After 48 h contact, an MTT test was performed as previously described.
