 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each well of a 96-well plate, 2×10
  <span class="sup">4</span> fibroblasts/well were seeded and grown 24 h to obtain subconfluence. Afterwards, cell substrates were put in contact with 200 µL of each sample. Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were diluted with GM in a 1/100 w/w ratio. Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as positive control (standard growth conditions). After 48 h contact, an MTT test was performed as previously described.
