 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particle size (PS) and polydispersity index (PI) of all developed nanosystems were assessed at 25°C by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) at an angle of 90° (Beckman Coulter N5, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) after suitable dilution of samples with bidistilled and filtered water (0.22 µm, HA Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physical stability of nanoparticles was evaluated up to 90 days of storage at 2–8°C.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zeta potential of the more promising formulation was measured at 25°C (Nano ZSP, Malvern Instruments, Alfatest, Rome, Italy).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These nanosystems were also analyzed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Jeol JEM-1200 EX II, Basiglio, Milan, Italy) equipped with a TEM CCD camera (Mega View III, Jeol, Basiglio, Italy), after sample deposition on copper grids (Formavar/Carbon 300 mesh, Agar Scientific, Assing, Rome, Italy).</p>
