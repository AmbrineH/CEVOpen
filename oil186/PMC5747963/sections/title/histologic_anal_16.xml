 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 18th day treatment, the animals were killed, full-thickness biopsies were made in correspondence of the lesion area, and histologic analysis of the excised tissues was performed. A biopsy of intact skin was also taken for comparison. Tissue samples were bisected along the widest line of the wound, fixed for 48 h in 4% w/v neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with gradient ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (8 µm) were obtained using a Leitz microtome (Wetzlar, Germany) and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The slices were examined at 5× magnification under a light microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a digital camera.</p>
