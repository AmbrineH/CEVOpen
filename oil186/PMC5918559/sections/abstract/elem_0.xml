  <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infections of sheep with gastrointestinal parasites, especially 
   <span class="italic">Haemonchus contortus</span>, have caused serious losses in livestock production, particularly after the emergence of resistance to conventional anthelmintics. The search for new anthelmintic agents, especially those of botanical origin, has grown substantially due to the perspective of less contamination of meat and milk, as well as other advantages related to their cost and accessibility in less developed countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of essential oils of the plant species 
   <span class="italic">Citrus aurantifolia</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Anthemis nobile</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Lavandula officinalis</span> against the main developmental stages of the parasite 
   <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>.

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plant species were selected based on substantial ethnopharmacological information. Analysis of the composition of each oil by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated the presence of limonene (56.37%), isobutyl angelate (29.26%) and linalool acetate (35.97%) as the major constituents in 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span>, 
   <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> and 
   <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span>, respectively. Different concentrations of each oil were tested in vitro for their capacity to inhibit egg hatching (EHT), larval development (LDT) and adult worm motility (AWMT) using a multidrug-resistant strain of 
   <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> (Embrapa 2010). The IC
   <sub>50</sub> values obtained for the oils of 
   <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span>, 
   <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> and 
   <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> were 0.694, 0.842 and 0.316 mg/ml in the EHT and 0.044, 0.117 and 0.280 mg/ml in the LDT, respectively. The three oils were able to inhibit adult worm motility completely within the first 8â€“12 h of observation in the AWMT.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present results demonstrate significant anthelmintic activity of the three oils against the different developmental stages of 
   <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>. Furthermore, this study is of ethnopharmacological importance by validating the anthelmintic activity of the oils studied. Although new experiments are necessary, these data contribute to the development of pharmaceutical-veterinary products for sheep farming by opening up new therapeutic possibilities against gastrointestinal infections caused by 
   <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>.
