 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The egg hatch test (EHT) and larval development test (LDT) described below were carried out after the recovery of 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> eggs according to the method described previously [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Approximately 20 g of feces were collected from the rectal ampulla of monospecifically infected animals and immediately filtered under running water (37 °C) through sieves with a mesh size of 500, 150, 90 and 20 μm, respectively. The eggs retained on the last sieve were washed, centrifuged for 5 min at 1811× 
  <span class="italic">g</span> with distilled water, and recovered in super-saturated saline by simple flotation. After recovery, the eggs were stored on the 20 μm sieve for abundant washing with distilled water to produce a final and quantified aqueous solution of eggs.
