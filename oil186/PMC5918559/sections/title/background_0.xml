 <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infections of sheep with gastrointestinal parasites, especially 
  <span class="italic">Haemonchus contortus</span>, have caused serious losses in livestock production, particularly after the emergence of resistance to conventional anthelmintics. The search for new anthelmintic agents, especially those of botanical origin, has grown substantially due to the perspective of less contamination of meat and milk, as well as other advantages related to their cost and accessibility in less developed countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of essential oils of the plant species 
  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anthemis nobile</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lavandula officinalis</span> against the main developmental stages of the parasite 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>.
