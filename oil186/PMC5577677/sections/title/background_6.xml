 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the last few decades, the pork market has been subjected to several changes influenced by consumer demands, which have focused the production toward healthier, safer, and tastier meat. The intramuscular fat (IMF) is crucial for meat palatability, such as tenderness and juiciness, and is an important economic trait in pork production [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Besides the IMF amounts, consumers are becoming increasingly interested in food containing high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). PUFA are considered as functional ingredients to prevent cardiovascular disease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Hence, meat producers require producing and supplying meat that contains appropriately higher IMF and PUFA.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dietary methods to manipulate the fat quantity and composition of pork have been previously reported, including low-protein or lysine-deficient diets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. A reduced protein diet promoted pork with higher IMF percentage which was more monounsaturated and less polyunsaturated even when balanced with essential amino acids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. The tissue-specific increase of expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase could be one reason for higher de novo synthesis of fatty acids in muscle of pigs fed reduced protein diets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. However, unsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to oxidation than saturated fatty acids (SFA) and particularly vulnerable to peroxidative attack [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Moreover, the lipid oxidation in muscle is a major deterioration of nutritional and sensory properties of meat and meat products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Synthetic and natural antioxidants have been used to delay the lipid oxidation in pork [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Herbal feed additives and organic acid have been suggested as desirable alternatives to benefit growth performance of the pigs by improving the gut health. Oregano essential oil (OEO) contains the natural and volatile aromatic compounds that exert different biological actions, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Carvacrol and thymol, the two main phenolic derivatives that constitute about 81.9 and 3.5% of OEO, are principally responsible for the activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. In addition, other minor constituents such as γ-terpinene and ρ-cymene, two monoterpene hydrocarbons that constitute about 4.49 and 3.07% of OEO, respectively, also contribute to the activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. In our previous studies, we found that OEO can improve growth performance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], intestinal barrier integrity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], and antioxidant enzyme activities in the intestinal tissues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benzoic acid (BA), as a kind of organic acid, was authorized to be used in growing pigs at the dose of 0.5% to 1.0% by European Union in 2003 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Certain research has proposed that BA can improve the growth performance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], intestinal antioxidant capacity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], and microecological balance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. In addition, previous studies have reported that the combination of herbal essential oils with organic acid produced a synergistic effect on antibacterial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. However, there is little available information on the effects of long-term the combination of OEO and BA supplementation to a low-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet on antioxidant properties and fatty acid composition of pork production.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, we firstly evaluated the effects on meat quality of reducing the dietary protein concentration by one to three percentage units. Secondly, our objective was to investigate the effects of long-term OEO and BA supplementation to a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet on physical and chemical parameters, fatty acid composition, lipid stability, and sensory profile of
