 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eating quality characteristics were assessed in an acceptance test session according to AMSA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Thirty persons, with previous experience, were recruited from the staff and students of the Department of Animal Science in the Faculty of Animal Nutrition and Feed Regulation. They were typical consumers (25–50 years old) of pork. A practicing session was performed before the test to allow consumers to become familiar with the test procedure, evaluation form, and sample presentation format.

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 18 pork samples (6 animals per treatment) were evaluated, and each sample was evaluated five times. Meat pieces (2.5 cm thickness) of the three nutritional treatments were cooked, wrapped, cut, and kept warm prior to serving for acceptance test evaluation applying the method of Simitzis et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Three attributes (flavor, juiciness, and tenderness) were evaluated with a ten-point descriptive linear continuous scale (1–10) with larger scores indicating a more favorable rating. Overall acceptance was rated on a nine-point hedonic scale (1–9) ranging from dislike extremely to like extremely. Each sample assessment involved three samples that represented the nutritional treatments (NPD, LPD, and LPOB). The paneling room was kept free of nonsample odors, artificial lighting was used, and the temperature was kept constant (approximately 20 °C).
