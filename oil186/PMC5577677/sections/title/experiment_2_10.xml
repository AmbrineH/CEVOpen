 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 36 barrows (Large White × Landrace) with an initial body weight (BW) of 29.55 ± 1.27 kg were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 treatments with twelve replicates of one pig per replicate. Pigs were penned individually. The pig pens were kept in an environmentally controlled building with a temperature between 15 and 25 °C. All pigs were provided with ad libitum access to feed and water via semi-automatic individual feeders and nipple drinkers. Pigs in group I and group II were fed with the same NPD and LPD in Exp. 1, respectively, and group III received the same LPD supplemented with 250 mg of OEO and 1000 mg BA per kg of feed to substitute for aureomycin (LPOB). The OEO was provided by Meritech Bioengineering Company (Guangzhou, China). The components of OEO are shown in Additional file

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On day 98, six barrows per treatments were slaughtered at a live weight of 106.53 ± 3.55 kg. Fresh LT samples anterior to the 13th rib from the left side carcass were collected and used for the physical analysis. Meanwhile, the LT muscle was removed from the left side carcass at the last lumbar vertebra and frozen at −20 °C for 3 days until chemical composition, oxidative stability, sensory evaluation, and fatty acid composition analyses were carried out.</p>
