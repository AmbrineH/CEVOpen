 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Higher IMF content has potential sensory benefits, such as deposition of fat within the muscle could enhance meat quality, i.e., tenderness and flavor [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Different feeding strategies have been actively used in meat production to improve IMF [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Animal nutrition has a major impact on fat quantity and composition, as seen with low protein or lysine deficient diets that dramatically increase the level of IMF [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. In the present study, the results of Exp. 1 indicated that pigs can feed low protein diet reducing dietary protein concentration by one to three percentage units without affecting meat quality of pigs. However, numerically, the values of IMF increased 11.8% in the LPD group compared with the NPD group, indeed, the results of Exp. 2 demonstrated that the IMF level in LT muscle of pigs was increased by LPD compared with NPD. In some cases, the effect has been explained by the different slaughter age [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] and slaughter weight [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] between the two trials, which were greater in Exp. 2 than in Exp. 1. Normal growth conditions, fat deposition of pigs occurs mainly in the late stages of fattening [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Therefore, the effect of dietary treatment on IMF was reflected in Exp. 2. The same result was observed in pigs fed with reduced protein diets balanced with five amino acids from 40 kg to 115 kg live weight [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. On the other hand, meat from NPD and NPOB groups with high IMF content exhibited high b* values. Similarly, Alonso et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] reported that low-protein diets increased the yellowness values of LT muscle. Sensory profile results showed that the muscle steaks with the higher IMF content, from regime LPD, had the higher scores for tenderness which agree with the findings of other researchers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] who reported that feeding protein-deficient diets improved the tenderness. There is no previously published research concerning the effects of the administration of a combination of OEO and BA on IMF content in muscles. Noteworthy, blends of OEO and BA substitute for antibiotic in a reduced-crude protein diet can reduce IMF, marbling scores, b*
  <sub>45min</sub> value and tenderness of LT muscle in the present study. Some studies have suggested that the addition of OEO alone to the diet didn’t affect IMF content of animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Kelly et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] suggested that the average back fat thickness of the males was significantly (5%) increased as a result of aureomycin supplementation. Cho et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] used mice to demonstrate that subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment promotes adiposity. Therefore, the use of blends of OEO and BA instead of antibiotics may affect lipid metabolism in LT muscle.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] C18:1n-9 is the main product of de novo fat synthesis in the pig, and its concentration increases as the pig contains more IMF content. Wood et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] also reported that a low-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet increased the percentages of C18:1n-9 and decreased the level of of C18:2n-6. No data regarding fatty acid composition of pork derived from animals fed with a combination of OEO and BA can be found in the literature, and data regarding OEO alone are scarce [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>].

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lipid peroxidation is a natural phenomenon that has a significant effect on meat quality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. This study is the first to demonstrate that dietary supplementation with a combination of OEO and BA in growing-finishing pigs can beneficially increase T-SOD, GPx, and T-AOC activities in muscle which indicate an improved antioxidative capacity. These findings were in accordance with our previous studies reporting the positive effect of OEO on the activities of antioxidant enzymes in vitro and in vivo [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Concerning the possible effects of the BA, the dietary inclusion of 0.5% BA increased GSH-Px activities in the liver of piglets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. High antioxidative enzymes may protect the lipid from oxidative damage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The protection against lipid oxidation in the LPOB group was also confirmed by lower TBARS concentration and drip loss in the LPOB group during refrigerated storage at 4 °C. The protective effect of OEO, when used as a dietary supplement, on meat lipid oxidation has already been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. In contrast, Simitzis et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] did not find any effect on stored pig meat when different concentrations of oregano essential oils (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mL/kg feed) were added to the diet. Furthermore, the key to minimizing drip loss was to protect the integrity of cell membranes from freeze injury, which increases their permeability and results in leakage of sarcoplasmic fluid [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Dietary supplementation with OEO and BA may preserve the fluidity of the membranes, which could otherwise be adversely affected by oxidative changes in the phospholipids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. These results agree with previously published reports, in which to the drip loss appeared to in pigs fed with diets supplemented with OEO [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Therefore, results indicated that the LPOB diet improved the antioxidative status in LT muscle, extending the shelf life of meat.
