 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the physical parameters measurements were performed on 5 samples/group and 6 samples/group in Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, respectively. Marbling were scored using the National Pork Producer Council standards (marbling from 1 = devoid to 10 = abundant) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Measurements of pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem were performed on LT muscles using a pH meter (pH-STAR, SFK-Technology, Denmark). Meat color (MC) at 45 min and 24 h in Exp. 1 were measured for 3 times per sample on the cut surface using the OPTO-STAR meat color determinator (Matthäus). Color measurements (L*, a*, b*) in Exp. 2 were performed at 45 min postmortem from a mean of four random readings made with a chromameter (CR-300, Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan), previously calibrated against a white tile according to the manufacturer’s manual. Drip loss and Cooking loss were determined by the method described by Honikel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. For drip loss determination, fresh meat samples (approximate 40 g) were held in a plastic box on a grid parallel to the fibre direction. The weight loss percentages after 1 (Exp. 1), 2, 4, and 8 days of storage at 4 °C were calculated. For cooking loss determination, a fresh slice from each sample was weighed (approximate 145 g), placed in a plastic bag, and cooked to an internal temperature of 70 °C in a 75 °C water bath. The internal temperature was monitored during cooking with a handheld temperature probe. The cooked samples were cooled for 30 min, blotted dry, and weighed. Cooking loss was expressed as the weight change percentage at the end of cooking. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was determined in samples cooled at 4 °C for 24 h. Six cylindrical cores (10 mm × 10 mm) were removed from each sample parallel to the fiber direction, then, were sheared with a WBSF device attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 1011, Instron instrument, USA) with a 50-kg tension using a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min. The peak force (Newton/cm
