 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ear edema was induced by topical application of croton oil (200 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g 20/ear) diluted in 20 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l of acetone/water solution (vehicle) in the inner surface of the mouse right ear. The left ear received an equal volume of vehicle (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5–7 animals/group). LEO (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg/ear), dexamethasone (reference drug, 0.1 mg/ear), or vehicle was applied topically to the right ear 1 h before croton oil application. Six hours after application of the inflammatory stimulus, the mice were euthanized, and a 6 mm diameter plug was removed from both the treated and untreated ears. Edema was measured as the weight difference between the two plugs. The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM weight of the ears.
