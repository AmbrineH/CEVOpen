 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 39 volatile constituents in the leaf, stem, seed, rhizome and pod of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> essential oils were identified by GC-MS analysis (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t001" href="#medicines-04-00029-t001">Table 1</a>); oil yield of 1.0%, 0.65%, 1.3%, 1.1% and 0.55% were obtained, respectively. The percentage of identified components in the analysis ranged from 85.33 to 96.03% (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t002" href="#medicines-04-00029-t002">Table 2</a>). Individual oils displayed their unique chemical profile in quantity and quality characterized by a high amount of monoterpenoids (60.74–89.83%) and a relatively low level of sesquiterpenoids (3.73–30.5%). It was also observed that 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> volatile oils contain low amounts of oxygenated compounds in the leaf, stem, rhizome and pod (10.41–19.19%), with the exception of the seed oil, which is dominant in oxygenated constituents (72.63%) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t002" href="#medicines-04-00029-t002">Table 2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high content of 1,8-cineole, α-terpineol and β-pinene in the seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> in this study is likewise reported for the fruit oil of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> (25.5–34.4%), β-pinene (14.1–15.2%) and α-terpineol (9.9–12.1%) from S. Tome [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00029">6</a>]. Similarly, Adegoke et al. [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00029">5</a>] recorded 1,8-cineole (59.8%), β-pinene (13.2%) and α-terpineol (9.3%) in high proportions for 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> seeds from Nigeria; while 1,8-cineole (48.9%) was shown for 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> seeds from Cameroon [
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00029">4</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaf, seeds and rhizome of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> are the most frequently used plant portions and are implicated in folkloric claims. Therefore, the antioxidant assays were carried out on these targeted plant parts. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00029-f001" href="#medicines-04-00029-f001">Figure 1</a> is a presentation of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> leaf, seed and rhizome essential oils compared with the standard compound, ascorbic acid. The plot indicates the scavenging ability of the oils as a percent inhibition at various concentrations; the scavenging effect was concentration dependent. This was demonstrated by the volatile oils’ ability to act as a hydrogen atoms or electrons donor in the conversion of DPPH radical to DPPH-H. The seed oil exhibited the highest percent inhibition in the assay (77.96%, 100 µg/mL) compared with the leaf and rhizome oils (67.59% and 62.11%, respectively, 100 µg/mL), while ascorbic acid showed 91.00% inhibition. DPPH radical activity is usually presented with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for leaf, seed and rhizome oils were 58.5 µg/mL, 45.5 µg/mL and 72.0 µg/mL, respectively, while ascorbic acid showed a value of 20.5 µg/mL.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, the seed oil is shown to be dominant in oxygenated components, such as 1,8-cineole (53.44%) and α-terpineol (12.23%), as compared to the leaf and rhizome oils (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t001" href="#medicines-04-00029-t001">Table 1</a>). It is suggestive that 1,8-cinoeole and other oxygenated components of the seed oil may be responsible for the prominent radical scavenging effect; as a consequence, the antioxidant activity depends on individual oil composition. Similarly, α-terpineol, one of the constituents of 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus teretecornis</span> leaf volatile oil, was shown to be responsible for the observed antioxidant effect, though 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and β-pinene occurred as major constituents [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00029">21</a>]. Dongmo et al. [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00029">16</a>] reported a higher scavenging efficacy of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> seed volatile oils (1,8-cineole and linalool as the main oxygenated components) compared to the leaf oil. The leaf and rhizome oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. giganteum</span> have also been shown to demonstrate good antioxidant effects [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00029">8</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentration-dependent, ferric-reducing potential of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> oils and ascorbic acid (as a function of absorbance at 700 nm) is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00029-f002" href="#medicines-04-00029-f002">Figure 2</a>. The reducing capacity of the volatile oils and standard compound increased with a corresponding increase in concentration. The FRAP assay indicated the higher reduction ability of the rhizome oil, followed by the seed and leaf oils (1.454, 1.376 and 1.305, respectively, at 100 µg/mL). This is an indication of the 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> oil constituents’ ability to reduce the (Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span>) to (Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>) by electron transfer. The ferric ion reduction ability of ascorbic acid in the assay (100 µg/mL, 1.995) was relatively higher than the absorbance values for the volatile oils. The relatively moderate oxygenated proportion of the 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> rhizome oil may have afforded the observed antioxidant potency in the FRAP assay.
