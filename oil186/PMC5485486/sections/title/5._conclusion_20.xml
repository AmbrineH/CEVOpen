 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results obtained in this study showed that the molecular profile of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> grown in Morocco is slightly variable depending on the region where the plant was harvested.
  <span class="italic"> In vitro</span> tested essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> have a strong cytotoxic activity against P815 (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 6.60 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml), compared to MCF7 (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 34.72 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml) and VERO (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 32.90 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml). A moderate antibacterial activity on
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> ATCC 25922 and on
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> ATCC 25923 was recorded. However,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> ATCC 27853 strain was resistant to these essential oils. Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities depend on the chemical nature and interactions of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> essential oil's compounds. Further studies need to be conducted on apoptosis induction, genes expression (Bcl2, p53, Bax, Jun/Fos, etc.), and antitumor activity of the main compounds of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> essential oil to understand the involved molecular pathways.
