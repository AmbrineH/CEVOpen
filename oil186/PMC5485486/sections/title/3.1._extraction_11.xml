  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> features: appearance (mobile liquid, clear), color (yellow, more or less dark), characteristic odor (lemony, fresh), and density at 20Â°C (0.879).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among 72 peaks revealed by chromatography (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), 64 peaks (96%) were identified (according to National Institute of Standards and Technology database). Twenty-four among 64 peaks represent 80% of the essential oil compounds (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). Eight peaks were for unknown compounds and probably represent 4% of the essential oils.
