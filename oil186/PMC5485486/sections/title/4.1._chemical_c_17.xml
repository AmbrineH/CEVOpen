 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chromatographic spectra of different essential oils from different Moroccan regions revealed the same qualitative chemical composition with some quantitative differences. 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-spathulenol is the most abundant compound and represents 15% of the essential oil from Berkane region. trans-Caryophyllene oxide prevails in essential oils from all regions with an average rate of 14%. Ar-curcumene is found to represent 14% of the essential oils from Beni Mellal and Agadir regions and 11% of those from other regions. Neral represents 10% of the essential oil from Agadir region and 6% to 8% of those from other regions. cis-Verbenol represents nearly 8% of the essential oil from Agadir region and 4% to 6% of other essential oils. Paracymene was only present in the essential oil from Agadir region at 0.02%. 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-muurolene was only found at 0.04% in the essential oils from Beni Mellal and Demnate regions. 8-Cedren-13-ol was not found in the essential oil from Agadir and represented 0.01 to 0.05% of the essential oils from other regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major molecules dominating the chemical composition of essential oils are caryophyllene oxide, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-spathulenol, Ar-curcumene, neral, and cis-verbenol (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). Other products such as 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, isoledene, elemene, 1.8-cineole, copaene, and nerol are also present with variable ratios. Unlikely, limonene and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, which are compounds constantly found in
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> essential oils distilled in Morocco at proportions of 14% for the first and 3% for the second, are present in the studied essential oils in the present work at very low averaging rates of 0.02% to 0.5%. In fact, the compositions of the essential oils depend on the operating (drying, extraction methods) and on the harvest and the storage conditions [

  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition analysis of our essential oil was dominated mainly by Ar-curcumene (12.32%), caryophyllene oxide (13.68%), and spathulenol (12.38%). Other compounds were reported in the essential oil of Argentina which is rich in ketones (myrcenone 36.50%, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-thujone 13.10%), while limonene is only at 6.87% [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. The essential oil from Turkey contains citrals ranging from 17.90% to 27.10% and limonene of 16% [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The major compounds of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> from Portugal were geranial (26.80% to 38.30%), neral (20.80% to 29.60%), and limonene (5.70% to 20.60%) [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main compounds found in the present investigation were different quantitatively and qualitatively from those reported in the literature. The average rate of limonene and geranial was 17% and 9%, respectively, in different essential oils distilled from
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> grown in Morocco (leaves of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> harvested in May period), whereas the amount of the monoterpene (limonene) is only 0.52% and the terpene aldehyde (geranial) is not detected in the present study. However, the rates of sesquiterpenes (
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, Ar-curcumene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-elemene, etc.), terpene oxides (caryophyllene oxide), some monoterpene alcohols (cis-verbenol), and sesquiterpene alcohols (spathulenol) were higher in the present studied essential oils [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. It is interesting to note that limonene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, p-cymene, linalool, citral, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, and 1.8-cineole are common compounds of essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> Lippia</span> sp. and thought to be responsible for specific biological effects and properties attributed to the genus
  <span class="italic"> Aloysia</span> [
