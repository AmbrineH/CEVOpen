   <span class="italic">Tagetes minuta</span> has a long record of human use for the treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases. Most drugs used for diseases treatment are less efficacious with side effects and this brought the search for new treatment regimens mainly from medicinal plants.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis revealed 98 compounds in the EO flower of 
   <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> and β-Ocimene (14. 40%) was the major chemical constituents. The EO exhibited highest inhibitory effect against DPPH radical, followed by its effect on ABTS, while LP radical showed the least sensitivity with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 2.45 mg/mL, 2.76 mg/mL and 3.23 mg/mL respectively. The EO showed antibacterial activities against all test organisms with MIC value for 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">M. smegatis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">S. uberis</span> at 0.125 mg/mL and for

   <span class="italic">Vibrio</span> spp., 
   <span class="italic">E. cloacae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> at 0.06 mg/mL. The EO showed MBC against 
   <span class="italic">E. cloacae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> at 0.06 mg/mL at 0.5 mg/mL for 
   <span class="italic">S. uberis</span> and 0.125 mg/mL for
