 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ABTS test was determined following the modified method of Kannan et al., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Briefly, stock solutions was prepared by mixing two stock solutions (1:1 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/v) ratio of potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) and ABTS (7.0 mM), incubated in a dark cupboard for 720 min at ambient temperature. One microliter of ABTS+ solution was diluted by adding methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.708 ± 0.002 unites when measured at 734 nm with spectrophotometer. Briefly, 100 μL of the essential oil or standards prepared in methanol of various concentration ranging from 0.03–0.5 mg/mL was added into all the wells of microtiter plate starting from (C-H) in triplicates except for A (A1-A12) and B (B1-B12). Thereafter, 100 μL of ABTS+ solution was then added to all the wells starting from C-H and the solution was incubated for 7 min and absorbance was taken at 734 nm using spectrophotometer. The percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula stated above.
