 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Free radicals instigate oxidative damage and when this free radical in the body system is above the capacity of antioxidant, it results in oxidative stress which is implicated in many human diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Antioxidant is substance that helps to prevent oxidative damage when found in small amounts and is equivalent to an oxidizable substrate. Antioxidants aid in averting of diseases by scavenging radicals including lipid peroxyl (LP •), superoxide (O
  <sub>2</sub> •), nitric oxide (NO •) and hydroxyl (HO •) formed during metabolic activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The need for natural antioxidants is becoming imperative due to numerous health risk associated with synthetic antioxidants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Several in vitro assays such as DPPH, ABTS, lipid peroxyl and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) radicals have been used in evaluating antioxidants capacity of plants extracts which are designed based on quenching stable free radicals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Plants used traditionally are known to produce a wide range of compounds with therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, gastroprotective effects amongst others [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>].

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study has shown that the continuous use of synthetic antibiotics for a long period is one of the causes of bacterial resistant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. The treatment failures associated with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant

  <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis, Vibrio</span> Spp
  <span class="italic">.</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> have become a worldwide concern [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], which has heightened the search for alternative therapeutic agents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. The use of herbal medicine for the treatment of diseases has been stated by World Health Organization (WHO) and presently a lot of persons use herbal medicine for treatment of diverse disease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Plant extracts provide boundless opportunities for such option as well as in discovery of new drugs because of availability of potent chemical components present in their extracts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The active compound found in medicinal plants that exhibit therapeutic activities against pathogens have little or no side effects on the host cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Phytochemical compounds present in the essential oil (EO) of plants are diverse, complicated and are known to contain active antibacterial property [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>] and antioxidant properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Essential oils from medicinal plants contain naturally occurring antimicrobial compounds which have been shown to be effective in limiting the growth and survival of many pathogens [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. These essential oils from plant such as 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pogostemon cablin</span> and tea tree have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial potential [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], and this make EO appropriate option to synthetic antibiotics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>].

  <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> has been reported to have a long record of human use for insect repellent, treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. There has been heightened interest of late in plant-based natural products that have the ability to reduce free radicals formation and treating infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms. There is however scarce information on antibacterial and antioxidant properties as well as the chemical constituents of the essential oil flower of 
  <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> grown in Cala community, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa that is claimed to be potent against many infections. This study therefore aimed to evaluate antibacterial, antioxidant properties and the chemical constituents of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> flower grown in Cala community South Africa.
