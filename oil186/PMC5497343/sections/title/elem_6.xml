The tube containing essential oil and MH broth was used as sterility control. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MIC was measured by comparing the turbidity of the tubes containing bacteria and essential oil with the tube containing MH broth and essential oil only. MIC was expressed as the lowest concentration without bacteria growth (absence of turbidity). The viability of the bacteria strains screened was verified by inoculating 20 μL of aliquots of all the tubes after incubation of various concentration on MH agar plates using the spread plate method, incubated at 37 °C, for 24 h.
