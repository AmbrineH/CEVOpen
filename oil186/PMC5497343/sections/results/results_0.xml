 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis revealed 98 compounds in the EO flower of 
  <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> and β-Ocimene (14. 40%) was the major chemical constituents. The EO exhibited highest inhibitory effect against DPPH radical, followed by its effect on ABTS, while LP radical showed the least sensitivity with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 2.45 mg/mL, 2.76 mg/mL and 3.23 mg/mL respectively. The EO showed antibacterial activities against all test organisms with MIC value for 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">M. smegatis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. uberis</span> at 0.125 mg/mL and for 
  <span class="italic">L. ivanovii</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Vibrio</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">E. cloacae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> at 0.06 mg/mL. The EO showed MBC against 
  <span class="italic">E. cloacae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> at 0.06 mg/mL at 0.5 mg/mL for 
  <span class="italic">S. uberis</span> and 0.125 mg/mL for 
  <span class="italic">Vibrio</span> spp.
