 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present work, we also evaluated the anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t004" href="#pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t004">Table 4</a>). Acorenone B showed an inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE with IC
  <sub>50</sub> concentrations of 40.8 and 10.9 μg/mL, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-10-00084-f004" href="#pharmaceuticals-10-00084-f004">Figure 4</a>). These inhibitory potentials, even far from that of the reference compound donepezil (6.7 nM) versus AChE [
  <a rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">38</a>], are close to those previously published for galanthamine (2.2 µg/mL and 11.7 µg/mL) or other plant extracts [
