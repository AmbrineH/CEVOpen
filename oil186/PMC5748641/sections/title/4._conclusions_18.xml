 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical properties, chemical composition, biological activity, and enantiomeric distribution of the essential oil distilled from 
  <span class="italic">Niphogeton dissecta</span> were determined for the first time. Forty-one compounds, representing 96.46% of the total oil, were identified. The major compounds were acorenone B (41.01%), (E)-β-ocimene (29.64%), (3E)-butylidene phthalide (5.54%), and α-pinene (3.94%). The whole volatile fraction and its pure major constituent were assayed for two biological activities: inhibition of two bacteria strains and enzymatic inhibition against AChE and BChE. Concerning the first activity, the oil showed an MIC value of 10 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</span> and 5 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. No activity was detected for pure acorenone B. Concerning the enzymatic inhibition, the Essential Oil (E.O.) showed an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 11.5 μg/mL in the inhibition of BChE and no inhibition of AChE. On the other hand, acorenone B was active against both enzymes, with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 40.8 μg/mL for AChE and 10.9 μg/mL for BChE. The chiral analysis of the E.O. indicated the following enantiomeric distribution: (+)-β-pinene (86.9%), (−)-β-pinene (13.1%), (+)-sabinene (80.9%), and (−)-sabinene (19.1%).
