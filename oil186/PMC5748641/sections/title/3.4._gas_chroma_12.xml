 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical constituents of the 
  <span class="italic">Niphogeton dissecta</span> essential oil were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph, coupled to a 5973N mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter., 0.25 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). For the separation of the volatile constituents, the following temperature program was used: 5 min at 60 °C, 3 °C/min up to 165 °C, 15 °C/min up to 250 °C, and held for 10 min. The injector and detector temperatures were kept at 220 °C. The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector was operated in split mode, with a split ratio of 1:50. The acquisition mass range was set at 40–350 
  <span class="italic">m</span>/
  <span class="italic">z</span>. Ionization mode: electron-impact (70 eV). The essential oil was diluted 1:100 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span> in dichloromethane (Fisher Scientific, 99.9% purity) and 1 µL of the solution was injected.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the identification of the essential oil components, linear retention indices were calculated according to Van Den Dool and Kratz. They were determined with a homologous series of linear alkanes (C9 from BDH, purity 99%, and C10–C25 from Fluka, purity 99%).</p>
