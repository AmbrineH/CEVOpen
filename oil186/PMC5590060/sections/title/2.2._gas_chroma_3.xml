 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volatlie oils were subjected to GC-MS analysis on an Agilent system consisting of a model 7890 N gas chromatograph, a model mass detector Triple Quad 7000 A in EI mode at 70 eV (

The GC column was an HP-5 ms fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane stationary phase (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 9.7853 psi and flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Inlet temperature and MSD detector temperature was 250 °C. The GC oven temperature program was used as follows: 50 °C initial temperature, held for 5 min; increased at 6 °C/min to 190 °C for 20 min; increased 7 °C/min to 290 °C for 15 min; increased 7 °C/min to 300 °C for 10 mins. The sample was dissolved in dichloromethane, and 2 µL was injected (split ratio 10:1; split flow 12 mL/min).

The relative amount of each individual component of the essential oil was expressed as the percentage of the peak area relative to the total peak area. RI value of each component was determined relative to the retention times of a homologous n-alkane series with linear interpolation on the HP-5 ms column.
