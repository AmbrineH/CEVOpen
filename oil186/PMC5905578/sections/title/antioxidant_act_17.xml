 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The natural antioxidants from plants are becoming increasingly important, not only in the nutritional area (food preservation and stability) but also in preventive medicine [
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">80</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">Lamiaceae</span> family has been a focus of the research on antioxidant compounds due to its high polyphenol content [
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>]. Likewise 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> leaves are commonly used as a condiment for flavoring food, and as a source of antioxidant compounds employed in food conservation [
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidants play a major role in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with oxidative damage, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">80</a>,
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">83–84</a>]. Reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide and free radicals, such as superoxide anion (O
  <sub>2</sub>
  <span class="sup">•-</span>) and hydroxyl radical (HO
  <span class="sup">•</span>), are inevitably produced in living organisms resulting from metabolic processes or from external sources [
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>]. Continued exposure to free radicals in biological systems may cause functional and structural damage, aging and cell death [
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">85</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> studies were reviewed regarding the antioxidant activity of the main isolated compounds from rosemary, namely, carnosol, carnosic acid, rosmanol, rosmarinic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. Using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method, these bioactive compounds and the essential oil were validated for their antioxidant activity [
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86–88</a>]. Also, using the thiobarbituric acid, superoxide anion and lipid free radicals scavenging activity assays and Rancimat methods (determination of oxidative stability of fat), the bioactive compounds carnosol, rosmanol and epirosmanol have been reported to inhibit lipid peroxidation through the lipid free radical scavenging mechanism [
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>,
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">89–90</a>]. These studies have shown the antioxidant potential of rosemary phytochemicals, whose properties are closely related to other biological activities, such as cytoprotective and anticancer, primarily due to their ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> studies, there were only three different studies found until 2014 for the validation of 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> experimental results, using the essential oil and carnosic acid. These studies were performed using Wistar rats, and evaluated the catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide synthase activities, as well as lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species, in brain and heart tissues after diet supplementation with rosemary essential oil. This resulted in the decrease of oxidative stress, since dietary rosemary has the potential to quench free radicals, inhibit lipid peroxidation and improve the antioxidant status in rat tissues [

  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>,
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">91</a>].
