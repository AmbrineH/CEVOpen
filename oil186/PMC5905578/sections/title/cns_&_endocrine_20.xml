 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders in the world. Insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents are used to treat diabetes; however, these drugs do not cure the disease and have significant adverse effects [
  <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">112</a>]. Rosemary has been shown to decrease blood glucose in several 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> studies [
  <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">113</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> studies have reported an inhibition of gastric lipase in the stomach of Zucker rats, after treatment with high contents of carnosic acid, which resulted in an improve of the triglycerides profiles [
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>,
  <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">113</a>]. Therefore, carnosic acid together with carnosol, proved to be the most relevant compounds on glycemic control.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, there has been a growing trend of studies for new neuroprotective drugs from natural sources, which raises a new therapeutic hope [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diseases of the CNS (depression, Parkinson, Alzheimer, etc.) are incurable chronic conditions, and presumably that is why there has been an increasing number of studies in 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> over recent years, in an attempt to find new solutions. Regarding depression there are several studies reporting a decreasing immobility time and regulation of several neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) and gene expression in mice brain like TH, PC and MAPK phosphatase (MKP-1) [
  <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">115</a>,
  <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">116</a>]. These studies contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanism behind the antidepressant effect of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> and its major active compounds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosmarinic acid, however, seems to have potential against neurodegenerative diseases. It was found that this compound had cholinergic and neuroprotective effects and inhibited acetylcholinesterase [
  <a rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114">114</a>,
  <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">117</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding clinical trials, in 2010, Pengelly 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, repeated-measures crossover study to investigate possible acute effects of dried rosemary leaf powder on cognitive performance. This work reported significant speed of memory – a potentially useful predictor of cognitive function during aging, using rosemary powder at the dose normally used at culinary consumption. This work expands the value of future studies on effects of low doses of rosemary on memory and cognition [
