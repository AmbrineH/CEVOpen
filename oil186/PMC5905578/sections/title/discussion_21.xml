 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 286 articles were obtained from the searched databases, comprising 232 based on biological activities (knowing that some publications report more than one activity) and 275 based on biological activity regarding isolated compounds. Publications were excluded based on restricted access to abstract, research area on nutrition (food supplements or stability) and irrelevant or unreliable results on biological activities. This review allows us to connect the biological activities of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> isolated compounds under search with essential oils and/or extracts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this review, it can be concluded that 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> has a promising future especially in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, such as cancers, infectious diseases and CNS disorders. Interestingly, using the database from ClinicalTrials.gov with the same keywords under study, we found two clinical trials for rosmarinic acid and oleanolic acid, three studies for ursolic acid and none for carnosic acid or carnosol. These studies concern the topics of osteoarthritis of the knee, nasal polyps, GI tract, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome X, sarcopenia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, it is imperative to improve clinical studies of this medicinal plant, and learn from the traditional health practitioners that bear the knowledge of many generations of trial and error. The worldwide interest in the use of rosemary has been growing with its beneficial effects being rediscovered for the possible development of new drugs. Therefore, the need for new therapeutic agents with specific targets and less adverse side effects, supports the need to extend both the clinical and preclinical studies on 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> plants.
