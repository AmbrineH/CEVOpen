 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants are a good source of anti-inflammatory agents and the continuous search for new compounds, especially from plants with historically documented pharmacological effects, represents a huge pharmaceutical potential [
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Controlling the release of mediators in the inflammatory process is the main objective of anti-inflammatory drugs [
  <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">100</a>]. Pain and inflammation are related to wound healing and production of free radicals which could extend the inflammation process [
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">101</a>]. Thus, the inflammatory response and the oxidative damage are two main factors that induce cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases; however, polyphenols from some plants are able to reduce these problems [
  <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">102</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In folk medicine, rosemary is known for its therapeutic properties against abdominal pain and for the treatment of respiratory inflammatory diseases, such as bronchial asthma [
  <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">103</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some experimental studies have reported the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the essential oil and biologically active terpenes such as carnosic acid, carnosol, ursolic acid and betulinic acid, as well as rosmarinic acid, rosmanol and oleanolic acid [
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>]. In fact, it has been reported that they have antinociceptive activity, and that each individual triterpene showed a similar potency to that observed with ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>,
  <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">104</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> studies, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic studies were based on the evaluation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.), COX-1/COX-2, iNOS and evaluation of nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 macrophages cells [
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>,
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86</a>,
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">105–106</a>]. Also, studies concerning the antiatherosclerotic effects of rosemary have been developed, through the migration and matrix metalloproteinase activation of vascular smooth muscle cells. These studies reported that carnosic acid has an ability to suppress matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression through downregulation of NF-κB and therefore decrease the smooth muscle cells migration [
  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">107</a>,
  <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">108</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is apparent that the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities have been the most studied, and there is an attempt to explain these properties with several compounds of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span>, with carnosol the most investigated (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0004" href="#F0004">Figure 4</a>). These 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> studies have shown a potential application for the prevention of inflammatory diseases [
  <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">106</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At preclinical stages, the essential oil of rosemary has been used topically for muscular and rheumatic pains, evaluated using carrageenan-induced pleurisy and carrageenan-induced paw edema tests in rats. These studies suggested that the essential oil could remarkably decrease the induced edema in 1–4 h and significantly reduce the volume of pleural exudate, being both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive [
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>,
  <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">109</a>]. Also, new lead compounds obtained by rosmarinic acid derivatization have been tested for these activities. Particularly, the acetyl derivative can reduce the induced paw edema as well as the paw licks, suggesting a potential application of this compound as anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive agent [
  <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">109</a>]. Regarding clinical trials in this topic, there have been several studies since 2005. Lukaczer 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. reported the efficacy of ‘Meta050’ (a combination of reduced iso-alpha-acids from hops, rosemary extract and oleanolic acid), in patients with rheumatic disease. Patients with pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia were given 440 mg of ‘Meta050’, which doubled after 4 weeks in the majority of patients. This work reports a significant decrease in pain in arthritis subjects by 40–50%, but not for fibromyalgia subject scores [
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">110</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">ex vivo</span> clinical study performed by Minich 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. on pain relief used a combination similar to ‘Meta050’, but is here presented as NG440. The goal was to examine the clinical safety and efficacy of NG440. The report suggested that NG440 is safe for human consumption and that animal toxicity revealed no adverse effects, at daily dosages ≤250 mg/kg. According to these results, NG440 may serve as an alternative where specific COX-2 inhibitors have been traditionally used [
  <a rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111">111</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other work performed by Rosenbaum 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">105</a>] reported the use of triterpenes, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and micromeric acid as dietary supplements for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These compounds (obtained from different extracts of rosemary leaf), were able to decrease topical anti-inflammatory activity, which was tested using the croton oil ear test in mice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, it is not clear if any of these supplements can be effectively and safely recommended to reduce nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or steroid usage, thus, more research is required. More information is displayed in the tables in Supplementary material.</p>
