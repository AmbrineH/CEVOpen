 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medicinal plants as a source for drug development</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medicinal plants are a renewable source of compounds, providing an almost unlimited source of new and complex chemical structures [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Only some of these compounds were investigated or produced as synthetic drugs, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol and digoxin [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Examples of the discovery of new molecules from isolated compounds are irinotecan and topotecan (anticancer molecules), derived from an isolated compound from 
  <span class="italic">Camptotheca</span> spp. and thereafter from 
  <span class="italic">Mappia</span> spp. (camptothecin) [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, plants provide a desirable therapeutic effect with reduced risk of iatrogenic complications, such as side effects often associated with conventional medication [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. The combined treatment of herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may reduce some adverse effects of highly potent drugs [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a major limitation on the use of plants in the phytopharmaceutical area is the lack consistency in the levels of compounds present in the extract due to natural variability, leading to inconsistent results upon scientific validation [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. Also, a major limitation is the lack of reproducibility of the activity by more than 40%, when using plant extracts, as the activity detected often do not occur when the samples are re-extracted [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27–28</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. This problem is largely due to differences in the biochemical profiles of plants harvested at different times and locations, variations in the same genus plant and variations in the methods used for the extraction and determination of biological activity [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32–33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drug development from medicinal plants faces yet another challenge. The bioactive compounds are generally isolated in small quantities, being insufficient for all stages of development and production of a new drug [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Therefore, the collaboration between researchers in different areas is essential to determine whether the total synthesis or semisynthesis is possible from the active compound.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, the effectiveness and activity of a phytochemical sample does not often result from the action of only one compound which is linked to the natural variability, already discussed, but from a synergic effect of several compounds (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Panax ginseng</span>) [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32–33</a>]. In most cases, this limitation leads to different results, which are difficult to interpret and to be accepted by the scientific community.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the lack of regulation, PBMs can be adulterated and contaminated in countries where purity and quality control are negligent [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. In many cases, these adulterated products can cause significant health problems [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. Ayurvedic products are often prepared with inorganic active compounds, which when combined with environmental pollution (such as pesticides), can increase the content of heavy metals above the permissible limits [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Standardization defined as the normalization of a sample that can have a minimal amount of one or more compounds is yet another setback [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>]. Unfortunately, phytotherapy rarely satisfies the standardization norms [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. This is mainly due to the lack of information about pharmacologically active compounds, and to the plants not being grown in a controlled environment [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The variability of the content and concentration of constituents in a plant, together with the various extraction and processing techniques used by different manufacturers, lead to variability in the content and quality of marketed PBM [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The consistency in composition and biological activity are prerequisites for the safe and effective use of therapeutic products [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>].
