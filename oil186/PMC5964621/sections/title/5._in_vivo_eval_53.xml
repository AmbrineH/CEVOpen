 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the decades, just a few studies tried to find alternatives to the classical treatment of pain, such as the application of the Lamiaceae phytochemicals.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Marrubiin</span>, the broadly known diterpenoid lactone, has been associated with the bitter principle of the horehound (
  <span class="italic">Marrubium vulgare</span>, 
  <span class="italic">M. deserti</span> de Noe, 
  <span class="italic">M. alysson</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">M. thessalum</span>) and other traditionally important Lamiaceae species (
  <span class="italic">Leonotis leonurus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">L. nepetifolia</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Phlomis bracteosa</span>) [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>, 
  <a rid="B374" ref-type="bibr" href="#B374">374</a>–
  <a rid="B379" ref-type="bibr" href="#B379">379</a>]. According to recent literature, extensive pharmacological studies have revealed that 
  <span class="italic">marrubiin</span> shows a suite of activities such as antinociceptive, antispasmodic, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancerous, antioxidant, and antihepatotoxic [
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>, 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">71</a>–
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">73</a>, 
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">75</a>, 
  <a rid="B374" ref-type="bibr" href="#B374">374</a>, 
  <a rid="B376" ref-type="bibr" href="#B376">376</a>–
  <a rid="B378" ref-type="bibr" href="#B378">378</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over time, the antinociceptive profile of marrubiin was analyzed in some animal models of pain. De Jesus et al.'s [
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>] results showed that marrubiin reveals potent and dose-related antinociceptive effects in mice, whose calculated ID50 values (
  <span class="italic">μ</span>mol/kg, i.p.) were as follows: 2.2 in the writhing test, 6.6 (first phase) and 6.3 (second phase) in the formalin-induced pain test, and 28.8 when evaluated over the capsaicin test. These findings show that it is more potent than some other well-known analgesic drugs. The antinociception produced by the marrubiin is not reversed by naloxone when analyzed against the writhing test. Its exact mechanism of action remains however still to be determined, but the results suggest that marrubiin, like the hydroalcoholic extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. vulgare</span>, does not interact with opioid systems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analgesic activity success was obtained by reducing lactonic function of the 
  <span class="italic">marrubiin</span>, in the formation of marrubiinic acid and two esterified derivatives, which have shown significant analgesic effect on the writhing test in mice [
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>, 
  <a rid="B374" ref-type="bibr" href="#B374">374</a>]. The pharmacological studies specified that marrubiinic acid presents an important (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) and dose-dependent antinociceptive effect, against the writhing test, in intraperitoneal administration, with ID50 value of 12 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>mol/kg, being about 11-fold more active than the standard drugs used as reference, but less active than marrubiin [
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marrubiinic acid, given orally, at a dose of 50 mg/kg, produced a marked analgesic effect, reducing 76 ± 0.9% of the number of abdominal constrictions induced by acetic acid, which may recommend that it can be well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. However, it was not effective in abolishing pain in a nonopioid way, showing the lack of antinociceptive effects in the hot-plate test [
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>]. When verified against the capsaicin test, it provided more direct evidence of the analgesic potential on neurogenic pain, causing an inhibition of 37.3 ± 3.8% at 10 mg/kg of capsaicin-induced licking, signifying its involvement with the antagonism of vanilloid receptor [
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific mechanism underlying the antinociceptive action of marrubiinic acid has yet to be determined, but it is unlikely that it is associated with the interaction of opioid peptides. Although marrubiinic acid displayed lesser analgesic properties than marrubiin, it is more potent than some clinically used drugs. In summary, these results show that it could be used as a model to obtain new and more potent analgesic drugs [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2013, the analgesic activity of the aqueous extracts obtained from leaves (AEL) and stems (AES) of 
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span>, as well as its isolated compound—rosmarinic acid (RA)—were analyzed by Lucarini et al. [
  <a rid="B379" ref-type="bibr" href="#B379">379</a>]. The analysis is based upon abdominal constriction and formalin tests in mice. The extracts were used at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg·kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and the compounds were tested at 10, 20, and 40 mg·kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Orally administered AEL, AES, and RA were not significantly active at any of the doses tested during the abdominal constriction test; the acetyl ester derivative of RA presented significant analgesic activity. These data recommend that the analgesic effects of the acetyl derivative of RA function through a peripheral-mediated mechanism. The acetyl ester derivative of RA is theoretically applicable as a new lead compound for the management of pain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Takaki et al. [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>] investigated the antinociceptive effects of rosemary essential oil (REO) using the acetic acid-induced writhing and hot-plate tests in mice. REO is very common in folk medicine because of its antispasmodic, analgesic, antirheumatic, and carminative effects. In the hot-plate test, the administration of REO in doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg revealed unremarkable effects on response latency, whereas control injection of meperidine induced significant antinociceptive effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, the REO inhibited licking and shaking induced by formalin injections. Instead, at doses of 70, 125, and 250 mg/kg, REO displayed a substantial antinociceptive effect in the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test compared with control animals. The results suggest that REO possesses peripheral antinociceptive activity. Similarly, Martinez et al. [
  <a rid="B363" ref-type="bibr" href="#B363">363</a>] described the antinociceptive effect of this essential oil using a rat model of arthritic pain. The essential oil with intraperitoneal administration in doses of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg determined a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect, manifested as a remarkable reduction of the dysfunction in the pain-induced functional impairment model in the rat, mostly at high doses. Emami et al. [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>] indicate that rosemary essential oil can inhibit carrageenan-induced paw edema tests in rats and acetic acid-induced writhing model of visceral pain and hot-plate tests in mice, suggesting that rosemary essential oil possesses anti-inflammatory and peripheral antinociceptive activity [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>, 
  <a rid="B380" ref-type="bibr" href="#B380">380</a>, 
  <a rid="B381" ref-type="bibr" href="#B381">381</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investigations of the effects of carnosol as one of the constituents of rosemary essential oil extract have also shown that carnosol inhibited LPS-stimulated nitric oxide production (LPS (lipopolysaccharide)) in Raw 264.7 cells and reduced inflammation [
  <a rid="B382" ref-type="bibr" href="#B382">382</a>]. Moreover, carnosol inhibited proinflammatory leukotrienes in intact polymorph nuclear leukocytes [
  <a rid="B383" ref-type="bibr" href="#B383">383</a>], inhibited 5-lipoxygenase, antagonized mobilization of intracellular calcium ions, and inhibited cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2) in inflamed skin in male Balb/C mice [
  <a rid="B384" ref-type="bibr" href="#B384">384</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent work demonstrated that extracts from 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> can control pain by inhibiting its progression during a persistent noxious condition. As an essential characteristic, rosemary extract prevents damage to the nervous system. Thus, rosemary applies effects on the origins of neuropathic pain and offers a mean to directly modulate nervous signaling. The antineuropathic effects are mainly due to the terpenoid fraction in a mecamylamine-reversed manner, suggesting a pharmacodynamic role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [
  <a rid="B385" ref-type="bibr" href="#B385">385</a>, 
  <a rid="B386" ref-type="bibr" href="#B386">386</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Husseini et al. [
  <a rid="B355" ref-type="bibr" href="#B355">355</a>] analyzed the effects of 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> hydroalcoholic extract on pain induced by formalin and also cyclooxygenase (COX) type 1 and 2 activity in mice. The administration of the extract intraperitoneally in doses of 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 800 mg/kg, respectively, produces significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in the chronic phase of the formalin test and also in hot-plate test in mice with no noted effect on the acute phase of the formalin test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, this inhibitory effect is equal to the effects of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.). The extract in doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg significantly reduced heat-induced pain and also reduced COX activity in a dose-dependent manner, where the inhibitory effect on COX1 activity was 33% and on COX2 activity was 45%. Therefore, these results indicate that the possible mechanism of analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the extract may be through modulation of COX2 activity.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies [
  <a rid="B349" ref-type="bibr" href="#B349">349</a>] have also revealed that the extract of 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> leaves might inhibit the formalin-induced chronic pain, abdomen writhing, and carrageenan-evoked edema. High doses of the essential oils and polyphenolic fraction of 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> have similar effects by blocking acetic acid evoked pain [
  <a rid="B353" ref-type="bibr" href="#B353">353</a>]. This pharmacological activity could be derived from the contribution of various active principles composing the whole oil such as linalool, myrcene, and 1–8 cineole, previously proved to possess antinociceptive proprieties [
  <a rid="B387" ref-type="bibr" href="#B387">387</a>–
  <a rid="B389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B389">389</a>]. However, administration of the essential oil with naloxone, atropine, and mecamylamine could eliminate the analgesic effect of the extract, which indicates that the analgesic activity of the extract is dependent on cholinergic and opioid systems [
  <a rid="B349" ref-type="bibr" href="#B349">349</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antinociceptive and analgesic effects of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha</span> spp. (EOM) leaves and its major constituent, piperitenone oxide (PO), were investigated in mice [
  <a rid="B390" ref-type="bibr" href="#B390">390</a>]. After an oral administration of 200 mg/kg of EOM and PO, the antinociceptive activity was demonstrated by an important reduction in the acetic acid-induced number of writhings and the second phase of the formalin test, while in the similar range of doses, they did not interfere with the nociception associated with the hot-plate and tail immersion tests. The hot-plate and tail immersion tests are reported to be useful tests in discriminating analgesic agents acting primarily at the spinal medulla level and at higher central nervous system levels (positive results) from those acting through peripheral mechanisms (negative results) [
  <a rid="B391" ref-type="bibr" href="#B391">391</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings suggest that EOM and PO are acting by peripheral mechanisms. In addition, EOM caused a reduction in the paw licking time for the second phase of the formalin test, when administered at higher doses (100 and 200 mg/kg). At 100 and 200 mg/kg, PO reduced this second phase to 8.3 ± 2.7 s (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 12) and 3.0 ± 1.2 s (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 10), respectively. The antinociceptive activity induced by EOM and PO in the writhing and formalin tests was not altered by naloxone, demonstrating that their actions do not depend on opioid receptors [
  <a rid="B392" ref-type="bibr" href="#B392">392</a>], supporting the anti-inflammatory hypothesis for their mechanism of action. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that EOM and PO have an analgesic activity, which is probably indirect and attributed to the anti-inflammatory activity, which does not involve the central nervous system [
  <a rid="B393" ref-type="bibr" href="#B393">393</a>].
