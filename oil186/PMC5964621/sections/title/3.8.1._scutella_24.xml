  <span class="italic">Scutellaria lateriflora</span> L., also known as American skullcap, is a member of 
  <span class="italic">Scutellaria</span> genus and is native to North America and is best known for its sedative and anxiolytic effects. The plant is still widely used by herbal medicine practitioners for insomnia, nervous anorexia, headaches, depression, panic attacks, and fibromyalgia [
  <a rid="B164" ref-type="bibr" href="#B164">164</a>, 
  <a rid="B165" ref-type="bibr" href="#B165">165</a>]. Most often, it is prescribed as a tincture, although teas and tablets are also commercially available, with wide variability depending on the manufacturer and species of 
  <span class="italic">Scutellaria</span> used [
  <a rid="B166" ref-type="bibr" href="#B166">166</a>]. Although rare, possible side effects of chronic treatment include drowsiness, mild digestive upset, and vivid dreaming [
  <a rid="B165" ref-type="bibr" href="#B165">165</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first clinical study assessing skullcap's effect on mood was performed on nineteen patients and had positive results [
  <a rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167">167</a>]. In 2014, Brock et al. published the results of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial designed to assess the effect of a 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> extract on mood in healthy volunteers. Results indicated that global mood was significantly enhanced in individuals who received 350 mg of plant extract for two weeks without negative effects on energy and cognition [
  <a rid="B164" ref-type="bibr" href="#B164">164</a>]. Taking into account the fact that anxiety is a well-known enhancer of pain perception [
  <a rid="B168" ref-type="bibr" href="#B168">168</a>], 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> extracts could have clinical value as co-analgesics. Additionally, ethanolic and aqueous 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> extracts have been shown to have potent antioxidant effects, reducing ROS and lipid peroxides in tissue homogenates [
  <a rid="B169" ref-type="bibr" href="#B169">169</a>], most likely due to the flavonoids it contains.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> contains several active compounds such as baicalin (40 mg/g in a 50% EtOH extract), baicalein (33 mg/g in a 95% EtOH), GABA (1.6 mg/g in EtOH and H
  <sub>2</sub>O extracts), and glutamine (31 mg/g in H
  <sub>2</sub>O extract) [
  <a rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" href="#B170">170</a>]. Other flavonoids found in 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> include wogonin, oroxylin A, genkwanin, hesperetin, quercetin, rutin, naringenin, chrysin, and daidzein [
  <a rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167">167</a>]. While its anxiolytic effects are probably related to some of the flavonoids that bind to one of the serotonin receptors [
  <a rid="B171" ref-type="bibr" href="#B171">171</a>], 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span>'s antioxidant activity is most likely due to its content of baicalein and its glucuronide, baicalin.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Baicalein can be extracted from 
  <span class="italic">S. lateriflora</span> through alkali solution and acid isolation methods; for a high-purity extract (99.35%), hydrolysis of baicalin and column chromatography purification can be used [
  <a rid="B172" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172">172</a>]. As an isolated compound, baicalein has shown not only antioxidant activity but also significant anti-inflammatory activity in several 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> models, which has made it an interesting drug to be screened as an analgesic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One study used several extracts from a plant of the 
  <span class="italic">Scutellaria</span> genus and found that baicalein has a significant analgesic effect in the carrageenan-induced rat paw inflammatory model [
  <a rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" href="#B173">173</a>]. Similarly, baicalein was found to significantly decrease pain-related behavior and c-fos expression (a surrogate marker for pain intensity) in the spinal dorsal horn of animals exposed to painful stimuli [
  <a rid="B174" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174">174</a>]. A combination of baicalin and catechins was assessed in three widely used animal pain models and was found to have analgesic effects in visceral, nociceptive, and inflammatory pain [
  <a rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175">175</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Baicalin has also shown some efficacy in neuropathic pain: an 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> study on spinal nerve ligation rats showed that tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were reversed by intrathecal baicalin administration. Additionally, baicalin significantly enhanced the effect of morphine in neuropathic animals, most likely by suppressing histone deacetylase 1 expression in the spinal dorsal horn [
  <a rid="B176" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176">176</a>]. The compound was also shown to be effective in cancer-induced bone pain: both intrathecal and oral baicalin administration reduced cytokine expression and inhibited pain-related signals as assessed by behavioral and biochemical tests [
  <a rid="B177" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177">177</a>, 
  <a rid="B178" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178">178</a>] in an animal model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This compound most likely exerts its analgesic effects through modulating the inflammatory process. Baicalein's anti-inflammatory activity can partly be explained by its inhibitory effects on lipoxygenases—enzymes that play a key role in leukotriene and lipoxin synthesis, thus initiating the inflammatory response. Deschamps et al. found that baicalein inhibits both human platelet 12-lipoxygenase and human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase-1 [
  <a rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179">179</a>]. Additionally, Hsieh et al. showed that baicalein inhibits IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span> and TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> through modulation of the NK-κB pathway [
  <a rid="B180" ref-type="bibr" href="#B180">180</a>] while other authors found that it inhibits protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase [
  <a rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" href="#B181">181</a>] and COX2 gene expression [
  <a rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" href="#B182">182</a>]. Pretreatment with baicalein increased the concentration of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, and GSH in an 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> model of myocardial ischemic injury [
  <a rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183">183</a>] and protected cells against lipid membrane peroxidation [
  <a rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184">184</a>]. However, it is very likely that, taking into account the fact that baicalein is effective also in noninflammatory types of pain, it has other analgesic mechanisms as well. One hypothesis states that baicalein binds to the GABA
  <sub>A</sub> receptor, which has a modulatory effect on pain because GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. When directly injected into the central nervous system, baicalein has strong sedative and anxiolytic effects due to GABA binding [
  <a rid="B185" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185">185</a>]. Also, a recently published article indicated that through GABA modulation, baicalin could be used in orofacial pain modulation [
  <a rid="B186" ref-type="bibr" href="#B186">186</a>]. Another study also suggested that baicalein modulates both intracellular and extracellular calcium levels [
  <a rid="B187" ref-type="bibr" href="#B187">187</a>], which may play a role in cell signaling and pain transmission.
