  <span class="italic">Lamium</span> genus contains almost 40 herbaceous plants, some of which have been used as remedies for various conditions such as trauma, putrescence, paralysis, leucorrhoea, hypertension, or inflammation [
  <a rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" href="#B206">206</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">Lamium</span> species contain different concentrations of iridoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, benzoxazinoids, and essential oil [
  <a rid="B207" ref-type="bibr" href="#B207">207</a>], which vary according to species and geographical area of cultivation. Although widely used in traditional medicine, there are only few studies that investigate the potential analgesic effects of this genus. One study screened several plants of the 
  <span class="italic">Lamium</span> genus and concluded that 
  <span class="italic">Lamium purpureum</span> has potent antioxidant effects, being able to rapidly scavenge free radicals in several 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> assays [
  <a rid="B150" ref-type="bibr" href="#B150">150</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Another screening study assessed potential anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of different 
  <span class="italic">Lamium</span> species and concluded that 
  <span class="italic">Lamium garganicum</span> L. and 
  <span class="italic">L. purpureum</span> L. extracts are as effective as indomethacin, a reference anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, all extracts were prepared by methanolic extraction of air-dried and powdered aerial plant parts (25 g plant in 250 mL methanol), which was then concentrated to dryness, suspended in water, partitioned, and lyophilized. The study showed that 200 mg/kg body weight 
  <span class="italic">of L. garganicum</span> or 
  <span class="italic">L. purpureum</span> methanolic extracts alleviate inflammatory pain in a model of ear edema and in carrageenan-induced and prostaglandin E2-induced hind paw edema [
