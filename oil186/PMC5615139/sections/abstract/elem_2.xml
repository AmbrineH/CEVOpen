   <span class="italic">Curcuma longa</span> (turmeric) is commonly used as spice and also used to treat fever, cough and febrile convulsions in Nigeria. This study determined the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. longa</span> and evaluated its neuropharmacological activity in mice.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. longa</span> (EOCL) fresh rhizome was obtained by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition determined by GC–MS. Acute toxicity (LD
   <sub>50</sub>) profile of the essential oil was determined orally (p.o.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.); and the EOCL (50–200 mg/kg, i.p.) was evaluated for its behavioural, anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities using appropriate models in Albino mice (Vom Strain, Jos, Nigeria).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the oil showed the presence of 23 compounds with turmerone (35.9%) being the major component. The LD
   <sub>50</sub> values obtained for the mice were 2154 mg/kg, p.o., and 693 mg/kg, i.p.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOCL (50–200 mg/kg, i.p.) caused significant (p &lt; 0.01) inhibition of rearing {F
   <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 9} and locomotor {F
   <sub>(3,16)</sub> = 42} activity; decreased head dips in hole board {F 
   <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 4}; increased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated pus maze {F 
   <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 9}; prolonged total sleeping time {F 
   <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 21} induced by ketamine injection, and protected mice against pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major component of the essential oil of this 
   <span class="italic">C. longa</span> species was turmerone; the oil was slightly toxic orally but moderately toxic intraperitoneally in mice; exhibited significant anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities in mice.
