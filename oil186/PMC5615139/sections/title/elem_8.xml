They were acclimatized to the laboratory environment for 1 week, maintained under 12 h light/dark circle at temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and housed 5 mice per cage in a Plexiglas cage with wood shavings as beddings. The procedures were carried out between 9.00 and 16.00 h. The animals were fed with standard laboratory food for rodents (Top Feed, Benin-City, Nigeria) and water was made available 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>, however, feed was withheld overnight prior to the test and during the experiment. For each experiment, a mixture of both sexes was chosen randomly for the treatment groups. The animal experiment was carried out in strict compliance with National Institute of Health NIH, 1985 as being implemented by the OAU Research Committee through the Faculty of Pharmacy Postgraduate Committee.

   <a rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0075">[15]</a> via both oral and intraperitoneal routes. Three doses (10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg) of emulsified EOCL were administered to three different groups of mice (n = 3). In the second phase, doses of 1000, 2000, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the oral route because there was no mortality at 1000 mg/kg in this route; while 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the intraperitoneal route because there was 100% mortality at 1000 mg/kg in the first phase for this route. The animals were monitored for 2 h and incidence of mortality recorded after 24 h for each group. The LD
