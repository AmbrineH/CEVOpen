 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> (EOCL) fresh rhizome was obtained by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition determined by GC–MS. Acute toxicity (LD
  <sub>50</sub>) profile of the essential oil was determined orally (p.o.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.); and the EOCL (50–200 mg/kg, i.p.) was evaluated for its behavioural, anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities using appropriate models in Albino mice (Vom Strain, Jos, Nigeria).
