 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The open field area was constructed of plexiglass box (30 × 30 × 15 cm), with one transparent wall for direct observation, and three opaque walls which prevent distractions and the floor divided into sixteen squares of equal area 
  <a rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0080">[16]</a>. The OFT was used to evaluate the animal’s exploratory activity. The method used was as described by 
  <a rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0085">[17]</a> with slight modification. The novelty-induced behavioural effects scored were rearing (number of times the mouse raised its forepaws in the air or against the wall of the cage for 20 min) and locomotion (the number of squares crossed with all the fore and hind limbs within 10 min).
