 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results were presented in Mean ± SEM and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc test using Dunnett’s test using GraphPad InStat 3 and GraphPad Prism 5. The level of significance was set at 95% confidence interval (p &lt; 0.05) for all treatment carried out compared to control group. The results of the anticonvulsant tests for percentage mortality or protection were analyzed with Chi square (non-parametric), while the latency to convulsion and time of death after chemo-convulsant treatment were analyzed with ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test.</p>
