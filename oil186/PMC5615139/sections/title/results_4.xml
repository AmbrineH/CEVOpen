 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the oil showed the presence of 23 compounds with turmerone (35.9%) being the major component. The LD
  <sub>50</sub> values obtained for the mice were 2154 mg/kg, p.o., and 693 mg/kg, i.p.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOCL (50–200 mg/kg, i.p.) caused significant (p &lt; 0.01) inhibition of rearing {F
  <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 9} and locomotor {F
  <sub>(3,16)</sub> = 42} activity; decreased head dips in hole board {F 
  <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 4}; increased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated pus maze {F 
  <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 9}; prolonged total sleeping time {F 
  <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 21} induced by ketamine injection, and protected mice against pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions.
