 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Swiss-Webster mice (originally sourced from the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI, Vom, via Jos, Nigeria) of both sexes (18–25 g)) were bred and supplied from the Animal House, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, OAU. They were acclimatized to the laboratory environment for 1 week, maintained under 12 h light/dark circle at temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and housed 5 mice per cage in a Plexiglas cage with wood shavings as beddings. The procedures were carried out between 9.00 and 16.00 h. The animals were fed with standard laboratory food for rodents (Top Feed, Benin-City, Nigeria) and water was made available 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>, however, feed was withheld overnight prior to the test and during the experiment. For each experiment, a mixture of both sexes was chosen randomly for the treatment groups. The animal experiment was carried out in strict compliance with National Institute of Health NIH, 1985 as being implemented by the OAU Research Committee through the Faculty of Pharmacy Postgraduate Committee.
