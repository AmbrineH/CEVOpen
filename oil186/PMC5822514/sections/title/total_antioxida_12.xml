 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the essential oil and terpenes was evaluated according to the method described by Prieto 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>] An aliquot of 100 μL of sample solution was combined with 900 μL of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, and 4 mM ammonium molybdate) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico). For the blank, 100 μL of deionized water was used in place of the sample. The tubes were incubated in a boiling water bath at 95°C for 90 min. After the samples were cooled at room temperature, the absorbance of the aqueous solution of each sample was measured at 695 nm in the spectrophotometer (Genesys 10 UV, Thermo Scientific). The total antioxidant activity was calculated by the following equation:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TAC (%) = ([

  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>blank</sub>) × 100,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the sample mixed with the reagent solution, 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of deionized water mixed with the sample, and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the reagent solution mixed with water. Ascorbic acid (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) was used as positive control.
