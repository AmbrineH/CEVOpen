 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results related to the antioxidant capacity assays of the major terpenes from 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> essential oil show that thymol has the highest activity, reaching 83.38%, 98.29%, and 98.57% with 0.1 mg/mL by DPPH, ABTS, and TAC methods, respectively [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 2</a>]. Thymol was most efficient by DPPH method than BHT and showed a similar scavenging free radical activity determined by ABTS [Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">2a</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">2b</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, limonene, linalool, menthone, and pulegone exhibited low or almost null antioxidant activity determined by DPPH and ABTS methods, and this activity did not exceed the 25% at 1 mg/mL [Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">2a</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">2b</a>]. However, limonene presented the higher antioxidant activity (98.74%), followed by thymol (98.57%), linalool (75.88%), and ascorbic acid (62.43%) [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 2c</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results indicate that the terpenes present in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span>, obtained by hydrodistillation, exert a high free radical scavenging capacity, being the thymol the main responsible of this effect.
