 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of the aerial part from 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> obtained by hydrodistillation showed amber color with a mild aromatic odor. The average yield was 0.35% on fresh weight basis. The chemical composition of the oil is presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, in which the major terpenes are listed in order of their elution. A total of six constituents, representing 69.40% from the total oil, were identified by GC/MS. Results showed that the major compound was the monoterpene ketone pulegone, followed by linalool, thymol, limonene, caryophyllene, and menthone.
