 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main component found in the essential oil of the aerial part of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> was pulegone, followed by linalool, thymol, limonene, caryophyllene, and menthone. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> (1 mg/mL) showed a free radical scavenging activity close to that from the synthetic BHT or ascorbic acid. The thymol presented greatest antioxidant activity at 0.1 mg/mL and limonene showed a TAC at 0.01 mg/mL, while caryophyllene, linalool, pulegone, and menthone showed a lower antioxidant activity.
