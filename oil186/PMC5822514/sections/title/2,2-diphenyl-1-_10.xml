 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurement of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) radical scavenging capacity was carried out according to Karamać 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>] Briefly, two mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in methanol (Meyer, México) was mixed with 100 μL of different concentrations of essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> and using major pure terpenes in it (limonene, linalool, pulegone, menthone, thymol, and caryophyllene; Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL). After 20 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm with ultraviolet–visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometer (Genesys 10UV, Thermo Scientific). The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Radical scavenging capacity (%) = (
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>blank</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>sample</sub>)/
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>blank</sub>× 100,
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH mixed with essential oil or terpenes and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH in which sample has been replaced with methanol. All measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as the average value. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 1.0 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) was used as positive control.
