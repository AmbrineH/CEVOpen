 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the essential oil and major terpene quantification were realized using GC and GC/MS data techniques reported by Torres-Martínez 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>] 1 μL of the sample was injected into an Agilent Technologies (7890A) GC equipped with a mass detector (Agilent 5975C), which operated using helium as a carrying gas, with a flow of 1 mL/min, with a split injection (split 50:1) at a temperature of 250°C in HP 5MS nonpolar capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film), under the following conditions: initial temperature of 50°C, followed by a 5°C/min ramp to attain a temperature of 280°C during 1 min; another 25°C/min ramp to raise the temperature to 380°C, during up to 3 min. The runtime was 50 min. The MS operated at a flow speed of 1 mL/min, with an ionization voltage of 70 eV, at an interface temperature of 250°C, in a SCAN mode, and at a mass interval of 50–500 m/z.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The percentage of essential oil constituents was determined by integration of peak areas, the values shown correspond to the average value of three injections. The compounds were identified by comparison of their retention indices, relative to those of n-alkanes C8–C20, and by comparison with a library of mass spectra with the NIST02 mass spectral library (National Institute of Standards and Technology), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with those described by Adams.[
