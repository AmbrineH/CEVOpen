 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the inhibition NO production by 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil and compounds as described by Legault et al. [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00034">23</a>]. Control L-NAME was used as positive control. Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with essential oil or dissolved compounds in DMSO and then stimulated with 100 ng·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> LPS and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, we collected the cell-free supernatants and immediately determined the NO concentration using the Griess reaction. We read the absorbance at 540 nm using an automated Varioskan Ascent plate reader (Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA), and quantified the presence of nitrite by comparing with a NaNO
  <sub>2</sub> standard curve.
