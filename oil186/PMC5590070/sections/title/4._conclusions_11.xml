 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil from northern Quebec, QC, Canada, demonstrated that it was mainly comprised of oxygenated monoterpene such as camphor, borneol, and 1,8-cineole. The essential oil inhibited NO production (stimulated by LPS and induced by RAW 264.7). The compound α-humulene was, in part, responsible for this anti-inflammatory effect. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was, in part, due to α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide. Caryophyllene oxide (as well as camphor) was also responsible for antibiotic activity. Finally, 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil possesses interesting biological properties. This study reports, for the first time, the links between the compounds found in 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities. Additional investigations of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> should be carried out for its potential use for cosmetic or pharmaceutical purposes.
