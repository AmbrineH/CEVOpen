 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> obtained by steam distillation method was yellow with a distinct odor. The extraction yield obtained after 3 h was 0.23% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>). The refraction index was 1.4797, and the density measured using pycnometer was 0.92396 g·mL

  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t001" href="#medicines-04-00034-t001">Table 1</a> presents the chemical composition of the essential oil as determined by GC-FID analysis. The oil was mainly comprised of oxygenated monoterpenes such as camphor (30.48%), borneol (14.80%), and 1,8-cineole (10.80%). The essential oil also contained camphene (7.29%), bornyl acetate (5.53%), and α-pinene (4.43%). Our results confirm the findings of Collin et al. [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00034">17</a>] for

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the biological properties of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibiotic, and cytotoxic effects, in vitro using cellular models. Our results for anti-inflammatory activity (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002" href="#medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</a>), showed that the 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil inhibited NO production (induced by LPS) with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 72 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Evaluation of the anti-inflammatory properties of the main compounds present in the oil showed that the most active compound was α-humulene with an IC

  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002" href="#medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</a>). Fernandes et al. [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00034">27</a>] reported that α-humulene reduced rat paw edema that had been induced by carrageenan. It also inhibited COX-2 and iNOS expression. Moreover, the authors concluded that α-humulene might represent an important compound for the management and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00034">27</a>]. Other compounds, including α-terpinene, α-pinene, and β-pinene were also effective with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 30 to 46 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> while caryophyllene oxide also inhibited NO production induced by LPS with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 183 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. In a previous study, α-pinene was shown to inhibit NF-κB and JNK activation as well as the expression of iNOS [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00034">28</a>]. The anti-inflammatory properties of β-pinene and α-terpinene have also been reported [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> demonstrated antioxidant activity by significantly inhibiting the oxidation of DCFH induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide with an IC

  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002" href="#medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</a>). Using in vitro methods including DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, Shaparov et al. [
  <a rid="B32-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-medicines-04-00034">32</a>] also reported a moderate level of antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil. Unfortunately, the chemical composition of the oil was not analyzed and the compounds responsible for the activity were not identified. The antioxidant activity of essential oils is often attributed to terpenoids such as carvacrol, thymol, and eugenol [
  <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00034">33</a>]. However, our results for 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil showed two compounds, α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide, to be particularly effective having a respective IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 3.4 and 6.2 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. A moderate level of antioxidant activity for α-pinene, based on a DPPH assay, had been previously reported by Dai et al. [
  <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00034">34</a>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the antioxidant activity of caryophyllene oxide has been reported.

  <a rid="B32-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-medicines-04-00034">32</a>]. In our study, we used a new antibiotic assay developed to test hydrophobic compounds as described in the Material and Methods section [

  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002" href="#medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</a>, show that 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil was effective against

  <sub>50</sub> of 59 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 241 µg·mL

  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and

  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 50 µg·mL
