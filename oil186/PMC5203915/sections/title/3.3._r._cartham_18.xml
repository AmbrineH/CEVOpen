  <span class="italic">R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR Essential Oils Did Not Induce Cytotoxic Effect in Astrocytes
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxic effect of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> essential oil from hairy roots and the roots of soil-grown plants (range: 0–3200 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) after 24 h incubation with astrocytes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The viability of cells was decreased below 60% at the higher concentration of essential oils, above 1600
