  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> Hairy Roots and Roots of Soil-Grown Plants
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil yields of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> hairy roots (HR) and root of soil-grown plants (SGR) were 0.09% and 0.06% (dry weight, v/w), respectively. The essential oils were dark yellow.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparative analysis of essential oils from roots of soil-grown plants and hairy roots by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated that the chemical profiles of both essential oils were different. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1"> Table 1</a> presents the chemical constituents of essential oils with their relative percentage amounts and retention indices. In the SGR essential oil, 41 compounds were identified, representing 89.7% of the total oil while 44 compounds were detected in the HR essential oils, amounting to 81.9% of the total identified components (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sesquiterpenes, especially sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.7–62.2%), dominated in both essential oils (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). However, in SGR essential oil, aplotaxene (
  <span class="italic">all</span>-
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-heptadeca-1,8,11,14-tetraene) was the main constituent (27.3%). Among the sesquiterpenes, nardosina-1(10),11-diene was identified as the most dominant compound (20.7%) in this essential oil according to its mass spectrum and retention index [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The second significant sesquiterpene was dauca-4(11),8-diene (10.2%) whose MS was identical with literature data, and its RI on the Rtx-1 column differed from the RI available on DB-5 column [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. In addition, petasitene (4.3%) and
  <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
  <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene (4.2%) were presented in appreciable amounts in SGR essential oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HR essential oil was characterized by the high quantities of cyperene (18.2%), 13-norcypera-1(5,11(12)-diene (15.3%), and cadalene (7.2%) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The concentrations of these components were significantly higher (7-, 11-, and 12-fold, resp.) than those in the SGR essential oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). Additionally, the other major constituent of HR essential oil was 2,5,8-trimethyl-1-naphthol (9.6%) which was identified on the basis of MS (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>); however, this compound has not yet been found in nature and was probably an artifact. The major compounds identified in SGR essential oil such as nardosina-1(10),11-diene and dauca-4(11),8-diene, petasitene, and
  <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
  <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene were not detected in the HR essential oil, and aplotaxene was presented only in traces (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HR and SGR essential oils were poor in monoterpenes, both hydrocarbons (0.7–1.6%) and oxygenated (0–2.1%) compounds.</p>
