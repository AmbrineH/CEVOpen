  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine cytokine expressions. The human astrocytes (4 × 10
   <span class="sup">5</span>) were seeded in 6-well multidishes and were treated with 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL), only LPS (1 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL), or only 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils for 24 h, at 37°C, 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. The control cells were incubated in the culture medium for 24 h. RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Blirt, Poland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Reverse Transcription System (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) was used for cDNA synthesis according to the instruction of the manufacturer. PCR was carried out using the gene-specific primers for human (
   <span class="italic">β</span>-actin, IL-1
   <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span>). The products lengths were 509 bp, 93 bp, 296 bp, 425 bp, 476 bp, 292 bp, and 406 bp for 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-actin, IL-1
   <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span>, respectively. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55–65°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Further procedures are described in a previous study by Sitarek et al. [
