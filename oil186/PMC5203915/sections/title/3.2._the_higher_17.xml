  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR Essential Oils against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria Than against Yeasts
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), and the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of HR and SGR essential oils were investigated against the Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. It was found that both essential oils showed similar properties. The essential oils showed stronger antibacterial (MIC = 125–250 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) than antifungal activity (MIC = 625–1250 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The highest antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 125 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL was observed against
  <span class="italic"> Enterococcus faecalis</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. No significant difference in susceptibility was found between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). In order to address the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the samples, the MBC values were also evaluated. The MBC values are no more than four times the MIC values observed (
