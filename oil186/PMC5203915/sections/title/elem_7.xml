  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of HR and SGR essential oils and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The normal human astrocytes were placed in 96-well culture plates (4 × 10
   <span class="sup">4</span> cells per well) and were treated with various concentrations of HR and SGR essential oils (0–3200 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) or LPS (1 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) for 24 h. As a control was used the cells incubated in the culture medium, for 24 h. The MTT assay was carried out according to the previous study [
