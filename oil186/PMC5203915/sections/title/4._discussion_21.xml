 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study was to identify and quantitatively determine the constituents in the essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> Rhaponticum carthamoides</span> hairy roots (HR) and roots of soil-grown plants (SGR), to examine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of these essential oils in LPS-stimulated astrocytes, and to determine the antimicrobial potential of HR and SGR essential oils. This is the first report that describes the composition of HR essential oil and its biological potential. Some essential oil possesses many biological properties with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. Because the essential oils are lipophilic they may easily enter to cells, disrupt the membrane, and/or make it permeable [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil yield from
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR was higher than those from SGR, 0.09% and 0.06%, respectively. The oil yields were higher than those obtained previously from roots and rhizomes of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> from the Czech Republic (0.04%) [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] and similar to those from the roots and rhizomes of plants growing in Poland (0.07–0.11%) [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. In the present study, it was found that the essential oils from hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> differed significantly in their compositions. Qualitative and quantitative differences have also been observed between essential oils compositions from hairy roots and parent plant roots for other plant species [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> SGR and HR essential oils studied in this report, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated, 54.7 and 62.2%, respectively. The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were also the major group of the components in
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> essential oil obtained by Havlik et al. [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. In contrast, Geszprych and Weglarz [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>] found that oils from the roots and rhizomes of this species growing in Poland were abundant in monoterpenes. The SGR and HR essential oils in the present study were poor in both hydrocarbons (0.7–1.6%) and oxygenated (0–2.1%) compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major compounds of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in HR essential oil were cyperene (18%), 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene (15%), and cadalene (7%). The levels of these components were significantly higher than those evaluated in the SGR essential oil. Interestingly, Havlik et al. [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] found similar results for essential oil isolated from
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> roots and rhizomes of commercial material and also showed that 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene (22.6%) and cyperene (17.9%) were the major compounds in this essential oil. Cadalene was identified for the first time in
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> root essential oil in this work.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> essential oil from roots of soil-grown plants aplotaxene (27%), nardosina-1(10),11-diene (21%), dauca-4(11),8-diene (10%), petasitene (4.3%), and
  <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
  <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene (4.2%) were the major components which were not detected in the hairy roots essential oil. Aplotaxene has also previously been found to dominate in essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> roots and rhizomes by Havlik et al. [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. In addition, nardosina-1(10),11-diene and dauca-4(11),8-diene, petasitene, and
  <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
  <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene were found for the first time in the
  <span class="italic"> Rhaponticum carthamoides</span> root essential oil in the present study. In contrast, Geszprych and Weglarz [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>] found geraniol (17–18.3%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene (14.12–16.53%), and linalool (8.88–12.07%) to be main compounds in the essential oil of roots and rhizomes of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span>. However, geraniol and linalool were not identified in the HR and SGR essential oils examined in the present work. The differences between the chemical compositions of the essential oils obtained in this study and those of others may be attributable to environmental factors (geographical, climatic, and seasonal), development stage, genetic variability, and the conditions of in vitro cultures [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>–
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. Additionally, individual variability and chemotype exist within the same plant species, resulting in the differences in chemical compositions of the raw materials [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, although qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> SGR and HR essential oils, the biological activities, that is, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, of these essential oils were similar. We suspect that this may be due to similar activities of the major components of the SGR and HR essential oils. While it is known that the biological activity of essential oils may be related with the major compounds, their action might be changed by different interaction with the minor components [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Perhaps, the activity of the essential oils is also dependent on the constituents ratio.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils from hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants showed antimicrobial properties with higher antibacterial (MIC = 125–250 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) than antifungal (MIC = 625–1250 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) activities. The most susceptible bacteria strains were
  <span class="italic"> Enterococcus faecalis </span>(ATCC 29212) and
  <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </span>(ATCC 27853) with a MIC value of 125 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL. However, no significant difference in susceptibility between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria was found, although it is known that the latter are less sensitive to essential oils because their outer membrane contains hydrophilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS inhibits the penetration of membrane by the different hydrophobic compounds of the essential oils [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>, 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Essential oils and their hydrophobic components may disrupt the bacterial cell membranes by separating the lipids leading to inhibition of the functional properties of the bacterial cell [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. The strong antimicrobial activity (MIC = 32–256 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) also showed
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides </span>root and rhizomes essential oil from commercial available material [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] but with lower activity against
  <span class="italic"> E. faecalis </span>(ATCC 29212) (MIC = 265 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </span>(ATCC 27853) (MIC &gt; 512 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) than the root essential oils in the present study (MIC = 125 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL). A pure compound is usually used as a bactericide if the MBC is no more than four times the MIC value [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>] which was observed for
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR essential oils. Therefore, these essential oils may be effective as bactericidal agents.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> root essential oils may be associated with the presence of the major components of essential oils such as cyperene, 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene, and cadalene in the HR essential oil and aplotaxene, nardosina-1(10),11-diene, and dauca-4(11),8-diene in the SGR essential oil. To the best of our knowledge, the microbiological activities of these compounds have not been investigated. In literature, we only found that essential oils from
  <span class="italic"> Cyperus rotundus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> C. articulatus </span>containing cyperene as the main component showed antimicrobial effects against different strains of bacteria and fungi [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study also evaluates the anti-inflammatory activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR essential oils in LPS-induced astrocytes. Astrocytes are multifunctional glial cells in the central nervous system and can regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, control the release of antioxidant defences, and are associated with the immune response by the production of inflammatory mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prostaglandin E, and nitric oxide [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>–
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The inflammation causes neuronal death and brain injury. The activation of astrocytes leads to the release of neutrophic factors which regulate the survival and function of nervous tissue [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. Hence, the astrocytes are good cellular models in in vitro study to determine the potential anti-inflammatory effects of various agents, such as essential oils. The
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR essential oils did not inhibit the viability of astrocytes at concentrations between 0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL and 800 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is known as an inductor of inflammation in various cells, including astrocytes [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. LPS is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of astrocytes and the LPS treatment of astrocytes resulting in activation of transcription factor (NF-
  <span class="italic">κ</span>B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) which lead to the release of such inflammatory mediators as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span>) or the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. Oxidative stress and inflammation are connected with many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other nervous pathogeneses [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Many studies have previously reported LPS induction of various inflammatory mediators in astrocytes [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>, 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies have also indicated that natural plant secondary metabolites may be used for the prevention of inflammation and oxidative damage-related neurodegenerative diseases [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. In order to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of essential oils from
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants, astrocytes were treated with HR and SGR essential oils and stimulated by LPS for 24 h. It was found that HR and SGR essential oils possessed anti-neuroinflammatory activity and were able to suppress the levels of IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, and TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. In response to inflammation molecular signaling cascades are activated in astrocytes. IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span> and TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> are secreted during acute inflammation and are important for the production of IL-6 [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. However, the stimulation of IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span> causes astrocytes to generate and release vascular endothelial growth factor, which increases blood-brain barrier permeability and promotes leukocyte extravasation [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. IL-10, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, reduces of TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> level and shows neuroprotective effect by changes of intracellular calcium and mediates delay effects
  <span class="italic"> via</span> NF-
  <span class="italic">κ</span>B [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. In addition, in response to IL-10, astrocytes release transforming growth factor-
  <span class="italic">β</span> (TGF
  <span class="italic">β</span>) that suppresses the inflammation [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the chemical profile of both
  <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> root essential oils differed, these oils showed similar anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory effects of major compounds of HR and SGR essential oils have not yet been reported. Only, aplotaxene which was the dominant compound in SGR essential oil demonstrated an immunosuppressive effect by the inhibition of T cell activation
  <span class="italic"> via</span> the reduction of IL-2 and CD69 expression. However, aplotaxene inhibited MAPK activation and the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), NF-
  <span class="italic">κ</span>B, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR essential oils were able to protect astrocytes against oxidative stress by the reduction of intracellular ROS levels in LPS-stimulated cells. ROS production is activated by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) [
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>] and by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a side-product in the synthesis of prostanoids [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. It is known from literature that ROS can activate various signaling molecules such as protein kinase C, MAPK, and NF-
  <span class="italic">κ</span>B which play an important role in regulating the gene expression of various proinflammatory factors [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. The overproduction of ROS may lead to an increase of TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> level [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. This highlights the relationship between inflammation and oxidative stress.
