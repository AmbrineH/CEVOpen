 <p>Family Cupressaceae is the largest coniferous plant family. Essential oils of many species belonging to family Cupressaceae are known to have several biological activities specially antimicrobial activity. The essential oils from aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">Calocedrus decurrens </span>Torr.,
  <span class="italic"> Cupressus sempervirens stricta </span>L. and
  <span class="italic"> Tetraclinis articulata</span> (Vahl) Mast. were prepared by hydrodistillation. The chemical composition of the essential oils has been elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis. The prepared essential oils were examined against selected species of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species. Broth dilution methods were used to detect minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). Sixteen compounds were identified in the essential oils of both 
  <span class="italic">Calocedrus decurrens </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Cupressus sempervirens </span>L. and fifteen compounds were identified in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Tetraclinis articulata</span>. δ-3-Carene (43.10%), (+)-Cedrol (74.03%) and Camphor (21.23%) were the major constituents in the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Calocedrus decurrens</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cupressus sempervirens </span>L. and 
  <span class="italic">Tetraclinis articulata</span>, respectively. The essential oils showed strong antimicrobial activities against the selected microorganisms in concentration range 0.02 3- 3.03 µL/mL. This study could contribute to the chemotaxonomic characterization of family Cupressaceae. In addition, it proved that the essential oils under investigation possess potential antimicrobial properties.
