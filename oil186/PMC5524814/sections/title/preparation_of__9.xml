 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two types of extracts were obtained. Powdered air-dried plant material (0.5 g) was sonicated for 15 min with either 5 mL of ethanol/water (50/50, v/v) or 5 mL of dichloromethane. After centrifugation for 10 min, the extracts were filtered through a membrane filter of 45 μm and the supernatants, which were used as test solutions, were stored at 4°C till used.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reference solutions of eupatorin and rutin used for HPTLC analysis of dichloromethane and hydroalcoholic extracts, respectively, were prepared at a concentration of 3 mg/10 mL in methanol and stored at 4°C till used.</p>
