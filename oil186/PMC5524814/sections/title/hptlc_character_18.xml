 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the aim of setting a simple test allowing an easy distinction of plant material coming from different species, hydroalcoholic and dichloromethane extracts of the dried aerial parts of the taxa were analyzed by HPTLC according to the methods described in the experimental section. Two HPTLC systems with optimized mobile phases were developed for the analysis of each type of extract.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a> shows the HPTLC chromatograms of the hydroalcoholic extracts examined under UV light at 366 nm after derivatization with NPR and PEG-400 solution. With this system, the chromatographic profiles of 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis, S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. x 
  <span class="italic">hegelmaieri</span> were very similar to each other with only slight differences concerning the intensities of certain zones. The only remarkable difference is a fluorescent blue zone at Rf 0.4 present in the case of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>, which is not observed in 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> nor in 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. x 
  <span class="italic">hegelmaieri</span>. High similarity is also observed between 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. x auriculata</span>, which, nevertheless, could be distinguished from the former three thanks to the presence of one additional orange fluorescent zone in the lower third of the chromatogram and the much higher intensity of the lower of the two orange fluorescent zones present in the middle third. Finally, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
  <span class="italic">S. microphylla</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">microphylla</span> showed a clearly different chromatographic profile from all other taxa analyzed, mainly due to the presence, in the middle third, of one intense blue fluorescent zone (Rf 0.45) and a yellow fluorescent zone (Rf 0.49), which are absent in the other taxa. Thus, the fingerprints obtained with the hydroalcoholic extracts are not useful enough for the distinction of 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> from 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>. Although these two taxa have partially similar uses, they do not have overlapping distribution and the former constitutes a local resource for inland highland areas of Alicante province. For a potential commercialization and valorization of the traditional beverage “salvieta,” used only in this area, it is worth to set up a suitable HPTLC system for differentiating these two species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HPTLC analysis of dichloromethane extracts derivatized with anisaldehyde reagent and examined under daylight or UV 366 nm, provided characteristic fingerprints for most of the taxa analyzed, as it is shown in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>. All samples of 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> (SB1-SB5) showed a homogeneous fingerprint, which was similar to the one obtained with 
  <span class="italic">S. x hegelmaieri</span>, a hybrid of the former, botanically very close. These two taxa were clearly differentiated from the others by two zones observed at daylight, appearing in the lower part of the chromatogram (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>), at Rf 0.12 (red-brown) and Rf 0.19 (gray-blue). Furthermore, examination of the plate under UV light at 366 nm (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>) showed three blue fluorescent bands at Rf 0.12, Rf 0.14 and Rf 0.50 which were absent in the other taxa. Therefore, all these zones might be considered as specific markers for 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. x 
  <span class="italic">hegelmaieri</span>. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>, a blue-green zone in the middle third (Rf 0.45) of the chromatogram observed under white light (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>) appears to be characteristic of this taxon. This zone is also seen under UV light at 366 nm as a greenish gray zone (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). The fingerprints of the cultivated species 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis, S</span>. x 
  <span class="italic">auriculata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">S. microphylla</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">microphylla</span> showed visible differences after derivatization of the plates with anisaldehyde and observation under white light (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>).
