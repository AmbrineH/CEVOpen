  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil analyses were carried out by GC-FID and GC-MS using two fused silica capillary columns (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness) of different stationary phases: Supelcowax™10 and Equity™-1 (both from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-FID analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA, USA) model 6890 instrument, equipped with a HP GC ChemStation data processor software (version A.07.01), using the following analytical conditions: carrier gas, helium; flow rate, 1 mL/min; oven temperature programmed, 60°C (2 min), 60–180°C at 2°C/min, 180°C (7 min), 180–230°C at 4°C/min, 230°C (15 min), 230–260°C at 10°C/min, 260 °C (8 min); injector temperature, 250°C; detector temperature, 270°C; split ratio 1:100. A volume of 0.1 μL of the undiluted oils was injected.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mass spectra were obtained with a computerized system constituted by a GC Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector Hewlett-Packard 5973N and equipped with GC-MS ChemStation software (version G1701DA), using the same analytical conditions as above. Transfer line temperature was 280°C. Mass spectra were taken over m/z 35–400, using an ionizing voltage of 70 eV.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identification of essential oil constituents was achieved by means of their GC linear retention indices (RI) in the two stationary phases, determined in relation to a homologous series of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (8–23 carbons) and a homologous series of fatty acid methyl esters (methyl esters of fatty acids with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 carbon atoms, FAME indices), and comparison of fragmentation patterns in the mass spectra with those stored in our own library or in the GC-MS database and with literature data (Mc Lafferty, 
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">1993</a>; Adams, 
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2007</a>). Quantification of each compound was performed on the basis of their GC-FID peak areas on the two columns, using the normalization procedure without corrections for response factor.
