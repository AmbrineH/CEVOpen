 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This was achieved by library search on a Wiley 275 L GC/MS database, observed Kovats index and by comparing the retention indices and mass fragmentation patterns to those of the available references as well as of published data.[
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>] The quantitative estimation was carried out by peak area measurement. A series of authentic 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes was subjected to GC under the same experimental conditions, and the retention indices of the oil constituents were calculated. The individual components were determined by computerized peak area measurement. Compounds of the essential oil, their retention indices, and relative percentage composition are compiled [Tables

  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>].
