   <span class="italic">Psidium guineense</span>, known as Araçá, is a Brazilian botanical resource with commercial application perspectives, based on the functional elements of its fruits and due to the use of its leaves as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent. The essential oils of leaves of twelve specimens of Araçá were analyzed by GC and GC-MS to identify their volatile constituents and associate them with the biological activities reputed to the plant.

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a total of 157 identified compounds, limonene, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, 
   <span class="italic">epi</span>-β-bisabolol, caryophyllene oxide, β-bisabolene, α-copaene, myrcene, muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol, β-bisabolol, and 
   <span class="italic">ar</span>-curcumene were the primary components in descending order up to 5%. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) displayed three different groups with the following chemical types: limonene/α-pinene, β-bisabolene/
   <span class="italic">epi</span>-β-bisabolol, and β-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide. With the previous description of another chemical type rich in spathulenol, it is now understood that at least four different chemotypes for 
   <span class="italic">P. guineense</span> should occur.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the use of the Araçá fruits, which are rich in minerals and functional elements, it should be borne in mind that the knowledge of the chemical composition of the essential oils of leaves of their different chemical types may contribute to the selection of varieties with more significant biological activity.</p>
