 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In February 2012, a total of 400 stem cuttings of
  <span class="italic"> M. suaveolens</span> subsp.
  <span class="italic"> timija</span> (vegetative stage) were randomly sampled from the natural population located in the Marrakech region, Ourika valley (31°23′N–7°42′W; altitude: 900 m). The species identification was done by one of the authors (A. Abbad) and a voucher specimen (MST05) was deposited at the Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorization of Plant Resources, Faculty of Science Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco. The prepared cuttings (length 20 cm) were immediately transplanted to the main field in a randomized complete block design. Twenty-five cuttings were transplanted in each block (2 m × 2 m) with plant to plant and row to row spacing of 40 cm. One meter alley was maintained between treatments to eliminate any influence of lateral water movement. At the time of transplantation, the treatments were applied. Each treatment was replicated three times. Two treatments consisting of application of a complete mineral fertilizer using the N, P, and K fertilizer (60 kg/ha of N, P
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>5</sub>, and K2O with 13 : 40 : 13 formulation) [

  <span class="italic"> Glomus </span>sp. soil were conducted. Culture of
  <span class="italic"> Glomus </span>sp. was kindly provided by Sfairi (high commissariat for water and forests and desertification in Morocco). Blocks containing the crop without any treatment were taken as control. For the first month (establishment phase), the crop was watered on alternate days. Thereafter, the irrigation was carried out as needed, depending on the rainfall. The plants were harvested at the beginning of flowering stage, 10 weeks after application of treatments. The mycorrhizal colonization of the randomized mint timija plants was determined by staining of colonized roots with trypan blue according to the method of Phillips and Hayman [
