 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ferric reducing capacity of EOs was determined by using the potassium ferricyanide-ferric chloride method [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. The sample concentration providing 0.5 of absorbance (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by plotting absorbance at 700â€‰nm against the corresponding sample concentration.
