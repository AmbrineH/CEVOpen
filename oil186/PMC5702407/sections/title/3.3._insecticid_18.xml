 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxicity values (LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub>) for mint timija EOs against the important stored product insect pest,
  <span class="italic"> T. confusum,</span> using contact and fumigant methods are presented in Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">4</a>. Based on the calculated LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values, the tested EOs exhibited potent insecticidal activity against adult
  <span class="italic"> T. confusum</span>, confirming our previous findings [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values are ranged from 0.10 to 0.13 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span> and from 0.28 to 0.37 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, in contact assays as well as from 21.60 to 23.97 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air and from 38.35 to 54.38 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air, respectively, in fumigant assays. The levels of insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs registered in this work against
  <span class="italic"> T. confusum </span>appear to be linked to the major components menthone and pulegone. Indeed, the strong toxicity of these compounds against several storage pest insects has been reported in many previous studies [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">42</a>, 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">43</a>]. In addition, it is worth noting that the application of the treatments (N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation) has no significant effect on the insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs, since no overlap between the 95% confidence limits was observed (Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">4</a>). To our knowledge, there has been no previous report regarding the effect of mineral fertilizers and VAM inoculation on the insecticidal activity of plant EOs.
