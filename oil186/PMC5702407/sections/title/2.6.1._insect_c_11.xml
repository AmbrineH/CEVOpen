 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed the methods of Kasrati et al. [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Colonies of the red flour beetle,
  <span class="italic"> Tribolium confusum</span> (du Val) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), were maintained in the laboratory without exposure to any insecticide. They were reared in glass containers (16 cm diameter × 22 cm height) covered by a fine mesh cloth for ventilation. Each container contained a mixture of wheat flour, wheat germ, and yeast extract (13 : 6 : 1 w/w/w). The cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 26 ± 1°C, with a relative humidity (RH) of 70–85% and 16 : 8 h light : dark photoperiod. Only young adults (7–14 days old) were used for the tests. All experimental procedures were conducted under environmental conditions identical to those of the cultures. In all bioassays, insects where considered dead when no leg or antennal movements were observed. The bioassays were designed to assess median lethal concentrations (LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values) (doses that killed 50% and 90% of the exposed insects, resp.).
