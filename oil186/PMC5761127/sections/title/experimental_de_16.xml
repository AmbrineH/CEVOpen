 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rats of group 1 served as normal control and received saline orally daily for 7 days and were injected with 1 ml/kg BW of just olive oil (the solvent of CCl
  <sub>4</sub>) on the 7 day. The rats of group 2 served as CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-hepato and renotoxicity control and were received saline orally daily for 7 days and were injected with 1 ml/kg BW of CCl
  <sub>4</sub> and olive oil mixture on the 7 day (a single intraperitoneal injection). The CCl
  <sub>4</sub> dose was selected according to the reference dose for chronic oral exposure (RFD) as recommended for CCl
