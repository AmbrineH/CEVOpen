 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in vitro antioxidant activity of MpEO was lower than that of silymarin. Pretreatment of animals with MpEO at a dose of 5 mg/kg did not have a significant effect on ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, γGT, urea or creatinine levels in CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced stress. Whereas pretreatment with MpEO at doses of 15 and 40 mg/kg prior to CCl
  <sub>4</sub>, significantly reduced stress parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, γGT, urea and creatinine) compared to the CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-only group. Moreover, a significant reduction in hepatic and kidney lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and an increase in antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GPx was also observed after treatment with MpEO (40 mg/kg) compared to CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-treated rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with MpEO at 40 mg/kg can also markedly ameliorate the histopathological hepatic and kidney lesions induced by administration of CCl
  <sub>4</sub>.
