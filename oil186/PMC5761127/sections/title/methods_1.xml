 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study aimed to investigate the composition and in vitro antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span> leaf essential oil (MpEO). A single dose of CCl
  <sub>4</sub> was used to induce oxidative stress in rats, which was demonstrated by a significant rise of serum enzyme markers. MpEO was administrated for 7 consecutive days (5, 15, 40 mg/kg body weight) to 
  <span class="italic">Wistar</span> rats prior to CCl
  <sub>4</sub> treatment and the effects on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and γ -glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) levels, as well as the liver and kidney superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels were evaluated. In addition, histopathological examinations of livers and kidneys was performed.
