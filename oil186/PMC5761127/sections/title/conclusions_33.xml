 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contents of MpEO not only protect the integrity of plasma membrane but, at the same time, increased the regenerative and reparative capacity of the liver and kidney. These results suggest that the compound present in MpEO has hepatorenal protective effects against CCl
  <sub>4</sub> induced oxidative stress in rats. Further investigations are essential to elucidate the precise mechanism of active agents of MpEO protection against CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity and it has to be tested against other biological parameters.
