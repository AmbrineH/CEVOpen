  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> shows the main components of each oil. A total of 13 compounds were identified in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France, which represented 97.67% (area percent) of the oil extracted. The main compounds were 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal at 43.37%, β-caryophyllene (27.42%), and germacrene D (14.46%). From the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in Ireland, 11 components were identified, representing 96.09% of the total oil, among which β-caryophyllene (30.75%), 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (26.90%), β-cubebene (11.19%), 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal (8.65%), and δ-cadinene (7.97%) were the main compounds. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in Serbia yielded 11 compounds that represented 97.82% of the total oil, with β-caryophyllene (32.71%), 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (21.88%), β-cubebene (21.54%), and 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal (7.64%) being the main compounds. In all cases, the most abundant were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (46.99–62.94%), followed by monoterpene aldehyde (29.55–45.32%), monoterpene ester (2.45–5.06%), monoterpene hydrocarbon (1.38–2.81%) and monoterpene alcohol (0–1.53%).
