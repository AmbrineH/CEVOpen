 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">House dust mites (HDMs), such as 
  <span class="italic">Dermatophagoides farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>, are an important source of atopic dermatitis, perennial rhinitis, and asthma, with more than a million people at risk in the world
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. HDMs, mainly inhabit the house, apartment, and workplace

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Changes in housing lifestyle, such as individual households in flats, together with carpets and central installed heating, have increased the conditions for the multiplication of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. In addition, HDM allergy is also caused by mite faecal pellets, eggs, and dead mite bodies, making it difficult to control mites from the indoor environment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Control of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> has been conducted by chemical or physical methods
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Synthetic acaricides are most commonly used, and include chemical agents containing benzyl benzoate, dibutyl phthalate 
  <span class="italic">N</span>,
  <span class="italic">N</span>-diethyl-
  <span class="italic">m</span>-toluamide (DEET) and pyrethroids
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Although these acaricides are effective, misuse of synthetic acaricides has led to serious drawbacks, including acaricidal resistance, toxicity of human and animals, and environmental hazards
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. In recent years, the development of natural insecticides derived from plants and microbes is required to overcome these drawbacks. Plant-derived products (e.g. 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol and geraniol) that have wide bioactivity against hygienic insect pests and harmful insects have been researched as alternatives to existing insecticides

  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil was evaluated by antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant agents, and is applied to many areas of the cosmetic, food, medicine, and perfume industries

  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils cultivated in different countries has been investigated by many researchers

  </span> reported that 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil cultivated in Poland is characterized by a high content of β-caryophyllene oxide. Moreover, Basta

  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil cultivated in Greece was caryophyllene oxide, while other predominant constituents were (

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available on acaricidal toxicities and the color deformation effects of

  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia, and to evaluate their acaricidal and color deformation properties against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>. We further tested spray formulations containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1% 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil cultivated in France and its main compound, to investigate the most effective formulations for use as a future acaricide and mite indicator.
