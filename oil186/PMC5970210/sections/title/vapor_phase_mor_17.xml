  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> was attributable to contact or fumigant (vapor) action. A group of 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) were introduced into untreated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and each petri dish was covered with a fine cotton mesh. Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD
  <sub>90</sub> values of each test material were applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter papers, as stated in contact + fumigant mortality bioassay. Each treated filter paper was separately placed on top of the cotton mesh (6.5 cm diameter), to prevent direct contact of mites with the test sample. Each petri dish was sealed either with another tight-fitting lid (closed container method), or with another tight-fitting lid with a 3 cm central hole (open container method), to determine the potential vapor phase toxicity of the test samples. Negative controls received ethanol (100 µL) only.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The treated and control mites were maintained for 24 h at 24 °C and 74% relative humidity in darkness. The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (20×, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were replicated three times.</p>
