 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of NGS technology has expanded the knowledge about the correlation between the human gut microbiota and omega-3 PUFAs. However, the literature in this topic is still in the initial stages. The current literature is listed below and summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-02645-t001" href="#ijms-18-02645-t001">Table 1</a>. The first report in the literature about the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on human gut microbiota of adults came from a clinical study carried out in 60 overweight (BMI &gt; 25) healthy people, between 40 and 60 years old. In this study, a commercially available probiotic with high concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacteria</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacilli</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus thermophilus</span> (named VSL#3) was provided in combination with and without an omega-3 nutraceutical supplementation of 180 mg EPA and 120 mg of DHA for six weeks. This study failed to elucidate differences between the probiotic group and the probiotic plus omega-3 group. However, the limitation of this analysis was that the evaluation of microbiota changes was only completed using colony counting on anaerobic or aerobic selective media [
  <a rid="B12-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijms-18-02645">12</a>]. Subsequent studies focused more on food and diet impact instead of nutraceutical use of omega-3 PUFAs, likely because omega-3 fatty acids integrated in a food matrix can have a higher positive impact on gut microbiota. Supporting this hypothesis, a randomized crossover trial was completed on 20 middle-aged healthy individuals by administering a high daily dose (4 g) of a mixed DHA/EPA supplement for eight weeks [
  <a rid="B13-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijms-18-02645">13</a>]. The supplementation was performed using two different formulations: as a nutraceutical in the form of capsules, and as functional drink that was EPA- and DHA-rich. In this study, a taxonomy classification of the whole microbiota of the samples was completed with NGS technology. In this case, no statistically significant changes were observed in the 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>/
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> phyla ratio for both types of supplementations. On the contrary, analyzing the data at family and genus levels revealed consistent differences associated with both omega-3 PUFA supplementations. In particular, increases in the 
  <span class="italic">Clostridiaceae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Sutterellaceae</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Akkermansiaceae</span> families were recorded, and these changes were reverted by the washout period. A statistically increased abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacterium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Oscillospira</span> genera, associated with a reduction of 
  <span class="italic">Coprococcus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Faecalibacterium</span>, were found after both omega-3 PUFA supplementations in comparison with before the study and after washout. Instead, an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Lachnospira</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Roseburia</span> genera was prominent only after the functional omega-3 drink feeding. So, as previously anticipated, the functional drink had a greater impact on gut microbiota in comparison with nutraceutical supplementation. This study highlighted the increased abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial genera after omega-3 PUFA supplementation [
  <a rid="B13-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijms-18-02645">13</a>]. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the most abundant (&gt;95%) short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) present in gut lumen, as end products of the fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut microbiota. Among the dominant butyrate-producing bacterial taxa, the following genera belonging to the 
  <span class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</span> family of the phylum 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> were found: 
  <span class="italic">Eubacterium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Roseburia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anaerostipes</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Coprococcus</span> [
  <a rid="B14-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijms-18-02645">14</a>]. The importance of butyrate, and SCFAs in general, are linked to anti-inflammatory properties. Indeed, they have been shown to ameliorate IBD, although their exact mechanism of action is still not completely clear [
  <a rid="B15-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijms-18-02645">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another analysis named COMIT (Canola Oil Multicenter Intervention Trial), a double-blinded randomized crossover clinical study, the effect of five different unsaturated oil blends on gut microbiota were tested in 25 volunteers with a risk of metabolic syndrome [
  <a rid="B16-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijms-18-02645">16</a>]. These participants were recruited based on the presence of at least one of these risk factors: wide waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglyceride level, low HDL-cholesterol, and high blood glucose. The dietary treatment consisted of a daily intake of 60 g of one of the following dietary oils for 30 days: conventional canola oil (35.17 g oleic acid/60 g oil), DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil (37.95 g oleic acid and 3.48 g DHA/60 g oil), high oleic canola oil (42.88 g oleic acid/60 g oil), a blend of 25:75 corn/safflower oil (41.61 g linolenic acid/60 g oil), and a blend of 60:40 flax/safflower (22.48 g linolenic acid and 19.19 g ALA/60 g oil). After a pyrosequencing analysis, these dietary treatments revealed differences at the genus level rather than the phylum level. The high oleic canola oil feeding resulted in the highest level of 
  <span class="italic">Faecalibacterium</span> among all other oils. Conversely, DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil resulted in the lowest level. A comparison between canola and canola/DHA indicated that canola was associated with 
  <span class="italic">Coprobacillus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Blautia</span>, whereas canola/DHA was associated with the family 
  <span class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</span> of the phylum 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>. Instead, the comparison between all the canola oils and the PUFA-rich oils (i.e., corn/safflower and flax/safflower) revealed a correlation of the genera 
  <span class="italic">Parabacteroidetes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Prevotella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Turicibacter,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</span> family with the first group versus the genus 
  <span class="italic">Isobaculum</span>, associated with the second group. For the microbiota changes between canola and canola/DHA oils, the authors speculated that this could be the result of an interaction between the gut microbiota and DHA metabolites, potentially through the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts [
  <a rid="B16-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijms-18-02645">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijms-18-02645">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another dietary intervention was the Pilchardus Study, a multicentre randomized trial in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin level between 6.0% and 8.0%) and not subjected to insulin treatment or antidiabetic drugs [
  <a rid="B18-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijms-18-02645">18</a>]. In this study, the participants followed a six-month dietary intervention of either a standard diet for diabetes, control (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15), or a standard diet supplemented with 100 g of sardines five days a week (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 17), which provided approximately 3 g of EPA and DHA. The analysis of the abundance of the target bacteria by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed a significant decrease in 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> phylum in both experimental groups, with the 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>/
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> ratio decreasing in the omega-3 group. Moreover, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> concentrations increased in both groups and the proportions of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroides-Prevotella</span> increased in the sardine-fed group [
  <a rid="B18-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijms-18-02645">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another case report, Noriega and co-workers analyzed the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on human gut microbiota using NGS technology [
  <a rid="B19-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijms-18-02645">19</a>]. In this study, a daily supplementation of 600 mg of omega-3 PUFAs through a fish protein diet was implemented for two weeks in one 45-year-old man. This intervention led to an increase in the 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> phylum, and to a simultaneous decrease in 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Actinobacteria</span>. Moreover, a reduction in 
  <span class="italic">Faecalibacterium</span> genus versus an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Blautia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Roseburia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Coprococcus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ruminococcus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Subdoligranulum</span> genera was recorded. Some of these recorded genera are still associated with butyrate production. However, after two washout weeks, a reversal trend was observed, indicating that gut microbiota is strongly sensitive to diet changes [
  <a rid="B19-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijms-18-02645">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent study of Menni and co-workers [
  <a rid="B20-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijms-18-02645">20</a>] correlated DHA circulating levels with DHA dietary intake, determined by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The association with major taxa was determined in the largest population studied to date in this topic, with 876 participants, based on a cohort of middle-aged and elderly women (mean age = 64.98 years old). They found that a DHA intake of 350 mg/day resulted in a serum DHA concentration of 0.14 mmol/L, and was significantly associated with 36 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Of these, 21 OTUs (58%) belonged to 
  <span class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</span>, 7 to 
  <span class="italic">Ruminococcaceae</span> (19%), and 5 to 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> (14%). In this study, a correlation between serum DHA and faecal metabolites was evaluated, and a positive correlation with 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-carbamylglutamate was found. Even in this analysis, a positive correlation between omega-3 PUFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria (
  <span class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</span> family) was highlighted. The authors hypothesized that the levels of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-carbamylglutamate present in the gut lumen may mediate the association between the found taxa and serum DHA [
  <a rid="B20-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijms-18-02645">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These studies have highlighted some common changes in gut microbiota after omega-3 supplementation. In particular, a decrease in 
  <span class="italic">Faecalibacterium</span>, often associated with an increase in the 
  <span class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</span> family, genus 
  <span class="italic">Roseburia</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span>, has been observed. In a cross-sectional study, the gut microbiota composition of IBD-affected individuals was identified [
  <a rid="B21-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijms-18-02645">21</a>]. Notably, in the IBD group, the authors found an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Faecalibacterium</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Sutterella</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Veillonella</span> genera, whereas 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroides</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Flavobacterium</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Oscillospira</span> genera decreased [
  <a rid="B21-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijms-18-02645">21</a>]. Therefore, omega-3 PUFAs could improve IBD patients’ condition by reverting the microbiota to a healthier composition. Moreover, omega-3 PUFAs can trigger a healthy chain reaction, increasing SCFA amounts; their anti-inflammatory action can help improve this pathology. However, further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies focused on the correlation between gut microbiota changes and omega-3 diet in infants. Emerging evidence has shown that the acquisition of the microbiota community in infancy does not start from delivery, as long-believed, through natural parturition and subsequent breastfeeding, but rather begins in utero, demonstrated by the presence of a microbiota community in the placenta and amniotic fluid [
  <a rid="B22-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijms-18-02645">22</a>]. Therefore, the mother’s diet can influence the correct development of the infant’s microbiota during gestation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first evidence of the correlation between infant microbiota and omega-3 PUFAs came from the randomized, non-blinded, 2 × 2 intervention study by Nielsen and colleagues [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-02645">23</a>]. In this study, 114 nine-month-old infants were included and randomized to receive cow’s milk or infant formula with or without 5 mL/day of fish oil until the 12th month. In 65 of the 114 infants, the gut microbiota were analyzed in faeces by fingerprint profiles generated by the V3 and V6-8 PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). The study revealed that consumption of fish oil in cow’s milk groups created a differential fingerprint profile, and this difference was not found in the infant formula groups. The authors explained that difference with the fact that cow’s milk contains considerably less omega-3 PUFAs in comparison with infant formula, so omega-3 PUFAs can have a dose-response effect in changing the gut microbiota profile [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-02645">23</a>]. Subsequently, the same research group performed a double-blinded randomized parallel intervention in 132 nine-month-old infants, to analyze microbiota differences after nine months of daily supplementation with 5 mL fish oil (1.6 g EPA and DHA) or sunflower oil (3.1 g linolenic acid, C18:2 omega-6) [
  <a rid="B24-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-02645">24</a>]. Differences between groups were analyzed in faeces using fingerprint profiles generated analyzing Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP). Interestingly, the authors found that fish oil caused significant changes in the microbiota in comparison with sunflower oil, but only among children who had stopped breastfeeding before the study. The authors determined that the cessation of breastfeeding opened the infant microbiota to new bacteria. Therefore, breastfeeding likely causes a delay in gut microbial maturation. Indeed, they found that the T-RFLP pattern of non-breastfed infants at the 9th month was more similar to those at the 18th month than that of the partial breastfed nine-month-old infants [
  <a rid="B24-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-02645">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the first deeper analysis in infants using NGS technology was a randomized controlled trial, where 32 infants born premature with enterostomy were randomized to receive either the usual nutritional therapy or an enteral supplementation of a fish and safflower blend oil until bowel reanastomosis, for a maximum of 10 weeks [
  <a rid="B25-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijms-18-02645">25</a>]. The experimental PUFA group showed greater bacterial diversity combined with lower abundance of some pathogenic bacteria, such as 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Clostridium</span>, and some genera of the 
  <span class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</span> family, such as 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pantoea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Serratia</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Citrobacter</span> [
  <a rid="B25-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijms-18-02645">25</a>]. In a population-based prospective human cohort study [
  <a rid="B26-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijms-18-02645">26</a>], 81 maternal-neonate dyads were studied to understand whether a maternal high-fat diet can influence the neonatal and infant gut microbiota. Stool and meconium were collected from neonates until six weeks of age, and a dietary questionnaire was completed by the mothers to estimate fat, sugar, and fiber intakes. From the questionnaire, two different groups were identified: a high-fat maternal diet group, with a 43.1% fat intake, above the recommended limit of 20–35%, and a low-fat maternal diet group, with a 24.4% fat intake. This cohort analysis revealed that a maternal high-fat diet during gestation influenced the neonatal microbiota, resulting in a significant depletion of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroides</span> in the high-fat maternal diet group that persists beyond delivery, in infants four to six weeks old [
  <a rid="B26-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijms-18-02645">26</a>]. In that study, fatty acid types were not differentiated. However, considering that the levels for sugar and fiber intakes were not in line with the recommended range (i.e., sugar mean 59.6%, recommended &lt;25%; fiber mean 24.9%, recommended &gt;25%), the main fat intake was assumed to be from saturated fatty acids, common in the Western American diet. Therefore, as discussed above, the omega-3 PUFAs favor the butyrate-producing bacterial genera, whereas a diet rich in saturated fats can depauperate the gut microbiota of these commensal bacteria.
