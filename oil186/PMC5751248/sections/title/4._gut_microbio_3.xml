 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inflammation and dysbiosis are conditions associated with different behavioral, mood, and psychological disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Increasing evidence shows that gut microbiota influences mammalian behavior. For instance, the complete absence of microbiota in germ-free mice induced depressive-like behavior and impairments in sociability [
  <a rid="B81-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijms-18-02645">81</a>], whereas bacterial colonization of these mice improved social behavior [
  <a rid="B82-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijms-18-02645">82</a>]. Furthermore, psychological disorders, such as MDD and ASD, are characterized by higher intestinal permeability, chronic low-grade inflammation [
  <a rid="B83-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-ijms-18-02645">83</a>], neurotransmitter signaling alteration, and Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction [
  <a rid="B84-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-ijms-18-02645">84</a>], leading to excessive stress-induced corticosterone release. These are all processes that are influenced by gut microbiota. Indeed, the gut microbiota is an integral part of the microbiota–gut–brain axis, a bidirectional crosstalk between the gut microbiota and brain, essential in the regulation of many physiological functions, such as digestive and gastrointestinal functions, as well as inflammation, neurogenesis, neurodevelopment [
  <a rid="B85-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijms-18-02645">85</a>], behavior, and stress responses. Through this axis, the gut microbiota and central nervous system (CNS) communicate by different pathways, including endocrine, immune, and neural pathways, using the gastrointestinal tract as a scaffold [
  <a rid="B86-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijms-18-02645">86</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both MDD and ASD are characterized by similar alterations in gut microbiota composition associated with a pro-inflammatory microbial profile [
  <a rid="B81-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijms-18-02645">81</a>,
  <a rid="B87-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijms-18-02645">87</a>,
  <a rid="B88-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijms-18-02645">88</a>]. Since gut microbiota can modulate neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and mammalian behavior, and since dysbiosis is linked to inflammation, neurodevelopmental, and behavioral disorders, correct microbiota development appears to be fundamental to guaranteeing proper brain function and avoiding behavioral and social impairments later in life. Various environmental factors that impair gut microbiota composition may impact neurodevelopment and increase the risk of behavioral disorders. With respect to this, omega-3 PUFAs, and in particular EPA and DHA, are essential nutrients for brain development and health as they play a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis [
  <a rid="B89-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-ijms-18-02645">89</a>], dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission [
  <a rid="B90-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijms-18-02645">90</a>], and HPA axis activity [
  <a rid="B91-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijms-18-02645">91</a>]. An omega-3 PUFA deficiency, especially during intrauterine and early life, is associated with impaired psychomotor development, and issues with attention, cognition, and visual acuity [
  <a rid="B92-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijms-18-02645">92</a>]. Moreover, a substantial decrease in plasma and brain omega-3 PUFAs levels, for DHA in particular, was found in patients with ASD [
  <a rid="B93-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-ijms-18-02645">93</a>,
  <a rid="B94-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijms-18-02645">94</a>]; it is also correlated with mood and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression later in life [
  <a rid="B64-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijms-18-02645">64</a>,
  <a rid="B95-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95-ijms-18-02645">95</a>]. Conversely, DHA supplementation has been shown to improve the symptoms of these conditions [
  <a rid="B96-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-ijms-18-02645">96</a>,
  <a rid="B97-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-ijms-18-02645">97</a>,
  <a rid="B98-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98-ijms-18-02645">98</a>]. These omega-3 PUFA benefits on the brain may be due to their ability to modulate gut microbiota composition. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, data are limited showing that omega-3 PUFA administration leads to benefits for behavioral disorders by modulating gut microbiota composition; the few studies on this subject, mostly completed in animal models, are summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-02645-t003" href="#ijms-18-02645-t003">Table 3</a>. For instance, Pusceddu and colleagues [
  <a rid="B99-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99-ijms-18-02645">99</a>] showed that long-term EPA/DHA administration can lead to a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect associated with a composition restoration of altered gut microbiota on maternal-separated rats. Particularly, maternal-separated rats showed an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes,</span> and non-separated rats showed a decrease in 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>, in agreement with the results obtained by Jiang et al. [
  <a rid="B88-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijms-18-02645">88</a>] on depressed human patients. In these early-life-stressed rats, a long-term administration of EPA/DHA led to the restoration of the normal 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</span> ratio. Furthermore, long-term EPA/DHA administration in separated mice improved the inflammatory condition typically associated with stress by increasing the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory bacterial genera, such as 
  <span class="italic">Akkermansia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Flexibacter,</span> which have been reported to be related to an inflammatory state [
  <a rid="B100-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100-ijms-18-02645">100</a>,
  <a rid="B101-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101-ijms-18-02645">101</a>]. These taxa changes align with those noted in a previously-mentioned case report [
  <a rid="B19-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijms-18-02645">19</a>]. Since inflammation plays an important role in depression, the gut microbiota shift observed in maternal-separated rats is likely protective of the behavioral disorders.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a more molecular level, Kaliannan and co-workers [
  <a rid="B52-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijms-18-02645">52</a>] provided information about how omega-3 PUFAs modulate gut microbiota composition by enriching it with beneficial species through the modulation of IAP expression. Nevertheless, how omega-3 is able to modulate IAP expression must be clarified. One hypothesis is that lipid mediators obtained by omega-3 PUFA metabolizing, such as resolvin E1, are directly responsible for IAP expression [
  <a rid="B102-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102-ijms-18-02645">102</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outcomes from another study by Davis et al. [
  <a rid="B103-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103-ijms-18-02645">103</a>] on the stress-induced adult mouse model through social isolation demonstrated that environmental stress can cause significant changes in the adult gut microbiota, and these changes may be countered with the introduction of DHA into the diet, providing evidence of the ability of omega-3 PUFAs to positively modulate gut microbiota composition. In this survey, a sexual dimorphism was found in response to stress and to DHA treatment, with adult males being more sensitive than females. Gut microbiota changes appearing in males after isolation are linked with depressive-like behavior and showed a decrease in bacteria implicated in SCFA production, such as 
  <span class="italic">Allobaculum</span>, and an increase in those involved in tryptophan metabolism, such as 
  <span class="italic">Ruminococcus</span> species. Of note, this bacterial genus was also found in high levels in ASD children [
  <a rid="B104-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104-ijms-18-02645">104</a>] and may lead to an increase in tryptophan biosynthesis that has been found to be higher in males. Enrichment of tryptophan biosynthesis supposedly leads to an increase in the concentration of quinolinic acid, a neuroactive compound able to cross the blood–brain barrier that has been correlated with anxiety behavior.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another recent study on mice by Robertson and co-workers [
  <a rid="B92-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijms-18-02645">92</a>] highlighted that 
  <span class="italic">in utero</span> and early life omega-3 PUFA intake, particularly EPA and DHA, regulates the gut microbiota development influencing bacterial abundance and types in adolescence and adulthood, and affects social and communicative behavior throughout one’s lifespan. In particular, mice born from mothers fed a diet lacking in omega-3 PUFAs and themselves fed the same diet displayed anxiety and depressive-like behavior, as well as a cognitive and sociability impairment, compared with those fed an omega-3 PUFA-enriched diet. These behavioral features were significantly more obvious in adulthood than in adolescence. Furthermore, mice groups lacking omega-3 PUFAs displayed a systemic inflammation activated by high LPS plasma levels and altered HPA axis activity, as well as an imbalance in the normal 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</span> ratio. However, mice fed an omega-3-enriched diet showed significantly enhanced cognition, and dampened HPA-axis activity and inflammation, as well as an improved intestinal epithelial integrity due to a higher abundance of the 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacteria</span> genus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This evidence supports the idea of a novel mechanistic hypothesis by which omega-3 PUFAs exert their beneficial effects on health, brain functions, and behavior by influencing gut microbiota composition and, thus, gut–brain axis functionality.</p>
