  <span class="bold">Raw material</span>. Thyme was harvested during the flowering season (July 2012) from the area around the Broşteni commune – Mehedinţi County, Romania. The plant material was dried in well-ventilated areas, sheltered from direct sunlight and then stored in double-layered paper bags at temperatures of 3-5°C until processing. A voucher specimen (V.FPT-451) was deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania.

  <span class="bold">Isolation of essential oils</span>. The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation, according to Ph. Eur. 5.0 [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>
  </span>], by using a modified Clevenger apparatus (with the EO collection area cooled to prevent the emergence of artifacts). The EO was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) and stored in a tightly sealed brown glass bottle at 0-4°C for testing.

  <span class="bold">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry</span>. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a HP6890 instrument coupled with a HP 5973 mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph is equipped with a split-splitless injector and a Factor FourTM VF-35ms 5% fenil-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness capillary column. Gas chromatography conditions include a temperature range of 50 to 250°C at 40°C/min, with a solvent delay of 5 min. The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250°C. The inert gas was helium at a flow of 1.0 mL/min, and the injected volume in the splitless mode was 1 μL. The MS conditions were the following: ionization energy, 70 eV; quadrupole temperature, 100°C; scanning velocity, 1.6 scan/s; weight range, 40-500 amu.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The percent composition of the volatile compounds was calculated. The qualitative analysis was based on the percent area of each peak of the sample compounds. The mass spectrum of each compound was compared with the mass spectrum from the NIST 98 spectrum library (USA National Institute of Science and Technology software).</p>

  <span class="bold">Determination of antimicrobial activity</span>. Thyme EO was tested on 7 common food-related bacteria and fungus: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13882), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), using the disk diffusion method as previously described [

   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>
  </span>]. Briefly, a suspension of the tested microorganism (10^6 cells/mL-1) was spread on the solid media plates (Mueller-Hinton agar for bacteria and Sabouraud cloramphenicol agar for fungi). The paper discs (Whatman No 1 filter paper - 6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 5, 10, 15 and 20µL EO and placed on the inoculated agar. The plates inoculated with bacterial strains were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 48 h at 30°C for fungi, respectively. As positive controls, ciprofloxacin (30 µg/disk) and cephalexin (10 µg/disk) were used for bacterial strains and fluconazole (10 µg/disk) for fungi. After incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters. Each test was performed in triplicate on at least three separate experiments.

  <span class="bold">Statistical analysis</span>. The statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS Version 21 (IBM Corp., NY). The mean inhibition zone for each group of nine observations was compared with the value of the disc diameter (6 mm) using the t-test. The GLM procedure was used to conduct a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the inhibition zones. The type of microorganism and amount of essential oil were used as factors in the full factorial model. Post-hoc tests for each amount of essential oil were conducted by using Tukey’s HSD method, in order to compare the effect on different types of microorganisms.
