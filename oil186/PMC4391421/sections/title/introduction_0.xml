 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus Thymus, member of the Lamiaceae family, contains about 400 species of perennial aromatic, evergreen or semi-evergreen herbaceous plants with many subspecies, varieties, subvarieties and forms [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>
  </span>]. In Romania, the Thymus genus contains one species cultivated as aromatic plant (Thymus vulgaris) and other 18 wild species [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>
  </span>]. T. vulgaris (thyme), locally known as “cimbru”, is widely used in the Romanian folk medicine for its expectorant, antitussive, antibroncholitic, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, carminative and diuretic properties.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various studies have aimed to investigate the chemical composition and biological properties of the T. vulgaris essential oil (EO). According to European Pharmacopoeia 5.0 (Ph. Eur. 5.0) [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>
  </span>], the minimum content of EO in T. vulgaris is 12 mL/kg, but the chemical composition shows variations, six chemotypes being mainly reported, namely geraniol, linalool, gamma-terpineol, carvacrol, thymol and trans-thujan-4-ol/terpinen-4-ol [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span>,
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span>]. Both the isolation yield and the chemical composition of the EOs are dependent on a number of factors, such as the environment, growth region and cultivation practices [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>
  </span>]. In addition to the flavoring properties determined by the constitutive active ingredients, the thyme EO exhibits significant antimicrobial activity [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span>,
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>
  </span>-
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>
  </span>] as well as strong antioxidant properties [
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>
  </span>,
  <span class="bold">
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>
  </span>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study is to determine the chemical composition together with the antimicrobial properties of the EO of T. vulgaris cultivated in Romania, in order to identify new sources of natural antiseptics with applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry.</p>
