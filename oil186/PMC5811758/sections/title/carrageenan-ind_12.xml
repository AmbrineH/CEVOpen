 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acute anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on the basis of paw edema inhibition induced by the injection of carrageenan (0.1 ml 2%) into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw of the rats (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>, 
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>). Male rats were divided into four different groups of six animals each that separately received PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg), mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg), and the sweet almond oil as a vehicle (10 ml/kg, IP) 1 hr before the injection of carrageenan. The paw volume was measured 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after the carrageenan administration using a plethysmometer (model PM 4500, Borj Sanat Co, Iran). Anti-inflammatory activity was revealed as the inhibition percent of the edema when compared with the control group. The percentage inhibition of edema was measured by the following equation: % inhibition of edema= 100 [(Vcontrol â€“Vtest)/Vcontrol].
