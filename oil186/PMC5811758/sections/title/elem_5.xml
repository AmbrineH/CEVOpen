Specimens were identified by N Kazemivash and the voucher was deposited in the Herbarium of Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAUPS), Tehran, Iran, under code numbers 5067- AUPF. Fruits were subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hr. At the end of distillation, the oil was collected, dried with anhydrous Na

    <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>). Animals were individually placed on a controlled hot-plate maintained at 55±0.2 °C. Briefly, the animals were placed on the hot-plate apparatus and latency to licking or shaking of the paws or jumping was recorded. PBFEO (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) was given to the separate group by intraperitoneal injection. Morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg) were also administered by the same route. The latency was recorded before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following intraperitoneal administration of the agents and is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect (MPE). MPE% = 100%

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analgesic effects of PBFEO were investigated by formalin test. 30 min after separate injection of different doses of the essential oil (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg, positive control) and the vehicle, formalin (50 µl of 2.5%) was injected into the hind paw of the mice. Scoring of nociceptive behaviors began after formalin injection and was continued for 60 min. A nociceptive score was recorded for each five-minute time block by measuring the amount of time spent in each of the following behavioral types: 3, the injected paw was licked, bitten, or shaken; 2, the injected paw was elevated; 1, the injected paw had little or no weight placed on it; and 0, the injected paw was not favored. Pain rating ranging from zero to three, was calculated (

Male rats were divided into four different groups of six animals each that separately received PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg), mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg), and the sweet almond oil as a vehicle (10 ml/kg, IP) 1 hr before the injection of carrageenan. The paw volume was measured 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after the carrageenan administration using a plethysmometer (model PM 4500, Borj Sanat Co, Iran). Anti-inflammatory activity was revealed as the inhibition percent of the edema when compared with the control group. The percentage inhibition of edema was measured by the following equation: % inhibition of edema= 100 [(Vcontrol –Vtest)/Vcontrol].

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chronic anti-inflammatory activity of PBFEO was measured on the basis of cotton pellet-induced granuloma according to the method of Winter and Porter (
    <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>). Four groups of six rats were used. Pellets weighing just about 60 mg each were made with 5 mm of dental cotton tampons. The pellets were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 120 °C under 15 lb pressure. Rats were anesthetized and pellets were subcutaneously implanted in the axilla region of each rat through a single needle incision. Each group was treated daily, for 7 consecutive days with PBFEO (50 and 100 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg), and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg), IP. On the eighth day, rats were anesthetized over again; the cotton pellets together with the granuloma tissues were separated surgically and made free from extraneous tissues. The wet pellets were weighed for the purpose of the wet weight, and then dried in an incubator at 60 °C for 18 hr until a constant weight was obtained; after that, the dried pellets were weighed for a second time. The exudates’ quantity (mg) was calculated by subtracting the constant dry weight of the pellet from the immediate wet weight of the pellet. Dry weight of granuloma was calculated after deducting the weight of the cotton pellet from the constant dry weight of the pellet and taken as an amount of granuloma tissue formation. The percent inhibitions of exudates and granuloma tissue formation were considered.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC/MS analysis was done on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 /5972 system with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness). The operating conditions were the same conditions as described above but the carrier gas was He. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV. Scan mass range was from 40–400 m/z at a sampling rate of 1.0 scan/s. Quantitative data were obtained from the electronic integration of the FID peak areas. The components of the oil were known by their retention time, retention indices, relative to C

   <sub>28</sub> n-alkanes, computer matching with the WILEY275.L library, as well as by comparison of their mass spectra with data already available in the literature (
