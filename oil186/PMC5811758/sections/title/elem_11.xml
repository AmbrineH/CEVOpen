  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acute anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on the basis of paw edema inhibition induced by the injection of carrageenan (0.1 ml 2%) into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw of the rats (
   <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>, 
   <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>). Male rats were divided into four different groups of six animals each that separately received PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg), mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg), and the sweet almond oil as a vehicle (10 ml/kg, IP) 1 hr before the injection of carrageenan. The paw volume was measured 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after the carrageenan administration using a plethysmometer (model PM 4500, Borj Sanat Co, Iran). Anti-inflammatory activity was revealed as the inhibition percent of the edema when compared with the control group. The percentage inhibition of edema was measured by the following equation: % inhibition of edema= 100 [(Vcontrol –Vtest)/Vcontrol].

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chronic anti-inflammatory activity of PBFEO was measured on the basis of cotton pellet-induced granuloma according to the method of Winter and Porter (
   <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>). Four groups of six rats were used. Pellets weighing just about 60 mg each were made with 5 mm of dental cotton tampons. The pellets were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 120 °C under 15 lb pressure. Rats were anesthetized and pellets were subcutaneously implanted in the axilla region of each rat through a single needle incision. Each group was treated daily, for 7 consecutive days with PBFEO (50 and 100 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg), and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg), IP. On the eighth day, rats were anesthetized over again; the cotton pellets together with the granuloma tissues were separated surgically and made free from extraneous tissues. The wet pellets were weighed for the purpose of the wet weight, and then dried in an incubator at 60 °C for 18 hr until a constant weight was obtained; after that, the dried pellets were weighed for a second time. The exudates’ quantity (mg) was calculated by subtracting the constant dry weight of the pellet from the immediate wet weight of the pellet. Dry weight of granuloma was calculated after deducting the weight of the cotton pellet from the constant dry weight of the pellet and taken as an amount of granuloma tissue formation. The percent inhibitions of exudates and granuloma tissue formation were considered.
