 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining the volatile profiles and ISSR molecular markers using bioinformatic tools, we were successful in clustering the 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species in order to identify markers for chemosystematic classification. In this work, 
  <span class="italic">V. gardneriana</span> was isolated from the other species, expanding our understanding of the chemodiversity of this genus. In addition, the volatile components extracted from 
  <span class="italic">V. gardneriana</span> showed potential for controlling 
  <span class="italic">A. guerreronis</span>, as it was highly toxic to this coconut pest.
