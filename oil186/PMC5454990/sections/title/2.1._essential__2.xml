 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil (EO) of 
  <span class="italic">Ocotea</span> species provided different yields and the higher yields were found in the leaf EO for all samples (0.7–0.8%) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t001" href="#ijms-18-01081-t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most representative compounds class was sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (56.3–82.0%) in all samples from Caxianuã Forest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f001" href="#ijms-18-01081-f001">Figure 1</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> oils showed different chemical profiles in the tissues; in the EO from leaves (
  <span class="bold">Cau-L</span>) the monoterpene hydrocarbons (21.5%) were present, while in the branches (
  <span class="bold">Cau-B</span>) there was a high accumulation of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (35.9%). The EO of 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> leaves (
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>) showed higher concentrations of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (25.8%) than branches (
  <span class="bold">Cuj-B</span>, 4.0%), which showed significant amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (22.7%) and fatty acid derivatives (34.6%). The 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> oils showed amounts of phenylpropanoids, especially in the branches (
  <span class="bold">Can-B</span>, 15.5%). Seventy volatile components were identified, comprising approximately 95.1% of the total composition of the oils (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t002" href="#ijms-18-01081-t002">Table 2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main compounds identified in 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> oils were bicyclogermacrene (29.6%), germacrene D (19.9%), β-caryophyllene (9.6%), α-pinene (9.8%), and β-pinene (9.7%) in the leaves (
  <span class="bold">Cau-L</span>) and δ-cadinene (13.8%), germacrene D (8.9%), and α-muurulol (7.8%) in the branches (
  <span class="bold">Cau-B</span>). β-Caryophyllene, germacrene-D, α-pinene, and β-pinene were the principal common constituents of the EOs of leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Ocotea floribunda</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. holdridgeana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. meziana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. sinuata</span>,

  <span class="italic">O. valeriana</span>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, these chemical compounds were identified in the leaves in other Lauraceae species. The EO of leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Endlicheria arenosa</span> was dominated by bicyclogermacrene (42.2%), germacrene D (12.5%), and β-caryophyllene (10.1%) [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-01081">23</a>]. Similarly, the EO of 
  <span class="italic">Nectandra leucantha</span> showed as the main compounds bicyclogermacrene (28.4%), germacrene A (7.3%), α-pinene (6.6%), and β-pinene (4.6%) [
  <a rid="B24-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-01081">24</a>]. The sesquiterpene δ-cadinene identified in the EO of branches was detected as the main compound in EOs of leaf and bark of 
  <span class="italic">Beilschmiedia madang</span> (17.0% and 20.5%, respectively) and was associated with germacrene D in the oil of barks of 
  <span class="italic">Beilschmiedia glabra</span> [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EO of 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> leaves (
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>) was rich in β-caryophyllene (22.2%) and caryophyllene oxide (12.4%), followed by 2-tridecanone (7.3%) and δ-cadinene (6.6%). However, the EO of the branches (
  <span class="bold">Cuj-B</span>) was dominated by 2-tridecanone (30.0%), limonene (20.5%), and β-caryophyllene (8.1%). The occurrence of fatty acid derivatives such as 2-tridecanone in Lauraceae species is not very common. However, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and δ-cadinene were the main compounds of the EO oil from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Cryptocarya mandioccana</span> [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils of 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> showed predominance of sesquiterpenes of selinane and caryophyllane skeletons. In the leaves (
  <span class="bold">Can-L</span>), the main compounds were β-selinene (20.3%), β-caryophyllene (18.9%), 7-
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-α-selinene (14.3%), and bicyclogermacrene (10.4%); in the branches (

  <span class="italic">epi</span>-α-selinene (9.0%), β-caryophyllene (7.1%), and the phenylpropanoid (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-asarone (8.8%) were identified. Interestingly, the leaf essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">O. foetens</span>, an endemic species of the Macronesian region (Canary Islands, Spain, and Madeira Islands, Portugal), had very little concentration of monoterpenoids or sesquiterpenoids, but was rich in ethyl

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to differentiate between the analyzed 
  <span class="italic">Ocotea</span> samples, a hierarchical cluster analysis using the chemical constituents was carried out and the resulting dendrogram is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f002" href="#ijms-18-01081-f002">Figure 2</a>. According to these results, the samples were grouped in two main groups with similarity of 46.6%. Group I is characterized by oils from 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. whitei</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span>, which present high amounts of α-pinene (9.8–22.5%) and β-pinene (7.3–21.3%). A higher similarity (74.1%) was found with 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O. whitei</span> due the proportions of α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t002" href="#ijms-18-01081-t002">Table 2</a>). The main compound of 
  <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span> oil was the diterpene kaurene (34.0%) and it decreased its similarity level. Group II includes 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O. veraguensis</span> oils, the samples 
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span> and 
  <span class="bold">Can-L</span> present similar amounts of β-caryophyllene (22.2% and 18.9%, respectively). A lower similarity was found in sample 
  <span class="bold">Ver-L</span>, which was rich in bulnesol (29.0%) and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (19.8%).
