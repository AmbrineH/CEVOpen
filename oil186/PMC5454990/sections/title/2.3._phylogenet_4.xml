  <span class="italic">MatK</span> from chloroplast genes has been used as a marker for the construction of plant phylogenies, due to its rapid evolution and their ubiquitous presence in plants [
  <a rid="B40-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijms-18-01081">40</a>]. The sequences have a size of about 1550 bp and encode the maturase K enzyme [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lauraceae species used in this study formed a defined group in the phylogenetic analysis, and the results of the phylogenetic tree were robust and supported by bootstrap value (=100). Species of Calycanthaceae were used as outgroup; this corroborates with the taxonomic classification and supports the topology of the tree (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic distances estimated for Lauraceae species were lower. The values ranged from 0 to 0.003 to 
  <span class="bold">Cau-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Can-L</span> and from 0 to 0.009 to 
  <span class="bold">Ver-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Flo-L</span> and 
  <span class="bold">Whi-L</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tree shows that the geographically closest species are grouped: 
  <span class="bold">Cau-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>, and 
  <span class="bold">Can-L</span> were collected in Caxiuan√£ National Forest and 
  <span class="bold">Ver-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Flo-L</span>, and 
  <span class="bold">Whi-L</span> were collected in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Although there may be differences in the composition of essential oils in plants of the same species with the same geographical location, the results of phylogenetic tree showed a good correlation with classes of chemical compounds. The species 
  <span class="bold">Cau-L</span> and 
  <span class="bold">Can-L</span> are rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and the samples 
  <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>, 
  <span class="bold">Ver-L</span>, and 
  <span class="bold">Whi-L</span> showed similar amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons. A higher difference could be observed for sample 
  <span class="bold">Flo-L</span>, which had diterpenes as its main compound class. Our results support the hypothesis that 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> gene is reasonably useful in phylogenetic reconstructions at high taxonomic levels (to order or family), but shows poorer reliability with lower taxonomic levels of classification (to genus or species) [
