 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phospholipid content of the pulp and seed oils was determined by gas chromatography (GC). 0.01 g of the extracted fats was added to the test tube. To ensure complete dryness of the oil for phospholipids analysis, the solvent was completely removed by passing the stream of the nitrogen gas on the oil. 0.04 mL of chloroform was added to the content of the tube and it was followed by the addition of 0.10 mL of chromogenic solution. The content of the tube was heated at a temperature of 100°C in a water bath for about 1 min. The content was allowed to cool, 5 mL of the hexane was added and the tube with its content shook gently several times. The solvent and the aqueous layers were recovered and allowed to be separated. The hexane layer was recovered and allowed to be concentrated to 1.0 mL for gas chromatography using flame photometric detector. The conditions for phospholipid analysis include: H.P 5890 powered with HP ChemStation REV. A 09.01 (1206) and split injection ratio of 20:1, nitrogen as carrier gas, inlet temperature 250°C, column type HP5, column dimension: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, oven program: initial temperature at 50°C, first ramping at 10°C/min for 20 min, maintained for 4 min while second ramping at 15°C/min for 4 min, maintained for 5 min. Detector: PFPD Detector temperature was 300°C, hydrogen pressure being 20 psi, compressor air being 35 psi [
