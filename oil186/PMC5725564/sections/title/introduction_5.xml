 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a well known fact that nutrition is an issue of both quantity and quality of food that contains essential nutrients for normal body functions. Vegetables and fruits in all their forms ensure an adequate intake of most essential nutrients and vitamins, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals which can supply the much-needed measure of balance diets thereby contributing to solve many of the nutritional problems. They also play an important role in human nutrition and health particularly as sources of vitamin C, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, thiamine, minerals and dietary fibre [
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>]. Scientific evidence shows that frequent consumption of vegetables and fruits can prevent oesophageal, stomach, pancreatic, bladder and cervical cancers and that a diet high in fruits and vegetables could prevent 20% of most types of cancer [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since good nutrition is a basic human right, there is a need for the exploitation of available local resources in order to satisfy the needs of the increasing population in developing countries which is characterized by abject poverty. Studies on wild edible fruits and vegetables indicate that they are good sources of human nutrition, since they contain the essential minerals and vitamins in addition to proteins, fibres, fats and carbohydrate which are very significant for healthy growth and development of human body.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood plum (
  <span class="italic">Haematostaphis barteri</span>) is a wild edible vegetable belonging to the 
  <span class="italic">Anacardiaceae</span> family. It is a perennial tree crop which normally grows wildly in the forest and usually among savannah [
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>]. The tree is found wild in Borno and Adamawa [
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>], and Taraba States of Nigeria, and it is known as Jinin Kafiri in Hausa language. The leaves of blood plum are used for seasoning soup in some local government areas of Adamawa and Taraba states as well as animal feed. It is also used in nursing the snake bite victims, therefore, the plant bark is also used in treating liver, gall bladder, spleen disorders and jaundice, whereas the wood is used as firewood [
  <a rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" href="#r5">5</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> fruit has oily seed which is edible [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the increasing incidence of diet related diseases such as obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in particular, the study is aimed at analyzing the fatty acid composition, phospholipid and phytosterol contents as well as some physicochemical parameters of pulp and seed of 
  <span class="italic">Haematostaphis barteri,</span> with a view to providing information regarding effective utilization of the plantâ€™s pulp and seed in various foods and with the possibility of industrial applications.
