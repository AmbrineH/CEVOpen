 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of fatty acid composition of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> indicate that both the pulp and seed oils have a high content of linoleic acid (C18:2) of 50.56% and 38.87%, respectively (Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span>). It was also observed that the oils contained significant amount of unsaturated fatty acids of 78.43% and 66.65% for the pulp and seed oils of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri.</span> Palmitic acid (C16:0) was found to be predominant saturated fatty acid (SFA) in the oil samples with values of 15.34% (pulp) and 25.37% (seed). The observed values of palmitic acid are in agreement with the reported data of some leguminious plant seeds such as 
  <span class="italic">C. lanatus</span> (17.71%) and 19.15% for 
  <span class="italic">T. cucumerina</span> seed oils, and 20.87% for 
  <span class="italic">G. jasminoide</span> by [
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>]. respectively. It is one of the most common saturated fatty acid found in cheese, milk, butter, animals and plants and it is an antioxidant, a nematicide used in making soups.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some studies have indicated the various impacts of SFAs on the human health. It has been concluded that lauric acid (C12:0) as well as myristic acid (C14:0) raise plasma total cholesterol concentrations, due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the rise of both LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations respectively [
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>]. However, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol is the basic cause of coronary artery diseases than the value of LDL cholesterol [
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>]. Oils rich in lauric acid (C12:0) decreased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. On the other hand, myristic (C14:0) and palmitic acids (C16:0) affected this ratio only little and stearic acid (C18:0) slightly reduced this ratio. Lauric acid was not found as a component of the 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> pulp oil in the study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is observed that the unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and oleic) account for most of the 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> pulp and seed oils. It is also noted that linoleic and oleic acids are the major fatty acids in peanut, soy beans and lentil [
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>]. The pulp oil has the highest content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs); that is, oleic acid (C18:1) (22.31%). Various studies indicate that a diet rich in oleic acid decreases the development of atherosclerosis and lowers serum cholesterol by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators while promoting antioxidant defenses [
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>]. Davidson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>] and Wang 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>] all reported that the deleterious effects of oleic acid have been attributed to increase in the permeability of both vascular and alveolar epithelium to solute caused by changes in membrane fluidity and increase in intracellular calcium concentration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linoleic acid (C18:2) occurs most abundantly in soybean oil, corn oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, grape seed oil and sunflower oil which are leguminous seeds. The amount of linoleic acid (50.55%) and (38.87%) in pulp and seed oils of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> (Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span>) is comparable with that reported for harms seed (47.95%) [
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>], soy beans (52.0%) [
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>], boiled tiger nut (46.71%) [
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>], but lower than that of 
  <span class="italic">Adenopus breviflorus</span> oil (60.73%) [
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>], 
  <span class="italic">L. breviflora</span> oil (61.10%) [
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>]. Linoleic acid plays a significant role in the skin. In dry skin, it strengthens the lipid barrier of epidermis, protects against transepidermal loss of water and normalises the skin metabolism. Linoleic acid is a natural component of sebum. In persons with acne skin, a decrease in LA content in sebum is observed, which leads to blocked pores and formation of comedos and eczemas. The use of linoleic acid for oily skin and problematic skin care leads to improvement of the work of sebaceous glands, unblocking of pores and decrease in the number of comedos. Moreover, this acid is built in the structure of cell membrane and is also used for production of intercellular cement of the skin. These two processes are possible thanks to the presence of the enzymatic complex in the stratum corneum of epidermis [
  <a rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" href="#r20">20</a>]. The seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> contained the highest concentrations of all the fatty acids except for stearic (C18:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), linoleic acid (C18:2) and α - linolenic acids which differ from the pulp oil by 14.23%, 87.20%, 23.11% and 33.04% respectively. The level of RSD ranged from 7.71% in Stearic acid to 88.50% in lignoceric acid (Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SD = Standard Deviation; RSD = Relative Standard Deviation; TSFA = Total Saturated Fatty Acid; TMUFA = Total Monounsaturated Fatty Acid; TUFA = Total Unsaturated Fatty Acid; TEFA = Total Essential Fatty Acid; TNEFA = Total Non-Essential Fatty Acid; O/L = Oleic/Linoleic Ratio; TPUFA = Total Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid; n-6/n-3 = linoleic (n-6)/α–linolenic (n-3) Ratio, P/S = Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid/Saturated Fatty Acid.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span> also presents distributions of results into TSFA, TMUFA, TPUFA TUFA, TEFA, TNEFA, oleic to linoleic (O/L) and linoleic to α - linolenic (n6/n3) ratios. It was generally observed that the percentage of both unsaturated and essential fatty acids in pulp oil was higher than that of seed oil, whereas the percentages of saturated and non essential fatty acids were higher in the seed oil sample. TSFA ranged from 21.57% to 33.35% in pulp and seed 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oils. These values are higher than the reported values of 9.0% - 12.9% for pinto bean [
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>] and 17.06% for 
  <span class="italic">B. eurycoma</span> [
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>]. High dietary intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are a risk factor for development of obesity, cardiovascular disease.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most abundant PUFA was linoleic acid (LA, C18:2, n-6) in all analyzed samples, in the range from 38.87% in seed oil to 50.56% in pulp oil. Similar results of LA predominating have been reported for grape, almond, wheat germ, sesame, pumpkin seed and safflower oil [
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>]; for peanut, rapeseed and coconut oil [
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>]; and for hemp oil [
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>]. The high content of linoleic acid in both oils is an indication that the oil is of high nutritional value for linoleic acid being an essential acid with cholesterol-lowering activity [
  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent reports have shown the important impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on human health in the prevention of, particularly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease and cancer; further, inflammatory, thrombotic and autoimmune disease; hypertension; diabetes type two, renal diseases; and rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. Their non-substitutable roles in many biological pathways are crucial [
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>]. Linolenic acid is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions, prevention and treatment of a great number of human diseases such as heart and inflammatory diseases [
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, linoleic acid as reported by Gunstone and Norris [
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>] usually cures essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency as it can be neutralized to the required C20 and C22 polyene acids. Essential fatty acid deficiency in human results in abnormal skin conditions such as scaliness and dermatitis, increased water loss, reduced regeneration of tissue and increase susceptibility to infection [
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>]. Therefore, as the pulp oil contained higher PUFA than the seed oil, it is clear that the cholesterol of the pulp oil could be very low and this will make it very useful for foods preparation to reduce the incidence of heart attack (arteroscleroses) caused by high intake of cholesterol. The TEFA in pulp oil (52.55%) is much higher than TEFA in rice, sorghum, millet, maize and Bambara groundnut [
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>, 
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oleic/linoleic (O/L) acid ratio has been associated with high stability and potentiality of the oil for deep frying fat. The O/L levels were 0.32% in seed and 0.44% in pulp oils of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span>. These values are lower than that of 
  <span class="italic">Anarcadium occidentale</span> (12.28%) [
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>], peanut oil (1.48%) [
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>], raw tiger nut (2.11%) [
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>], hence 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oils may not be stable compared with soya bean, peanut and groundnut oils. The relationship between the saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid content is expressed as P/S index. In a diet, it is important the index value be higher than 1, due to the essential character of the linoleic fatty acid (n-6) [
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>]. Several studies indicate that the P/S relation influences in the level of nutrient metabolization in the body, and as the proportion increases a smaller deposition of lipids [
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>]. The values of the P/S indexes of the oils studied are shown in Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span> with values greater than 1.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total unsaturated fatty acids (TUFA) were 66.65% in seed and 78.43% in pulp oils. The linoleic (n-6) and α–linolenic (n-3) fatty acids have critical roles in the membrane structure and as precursors of eicosanoids, which are potent and highly reactive compounds. Since they compete for the same enzymes and have different biological roles, the balance between the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in the diet can be of considerable importance [
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>]. The recommended ratio of linoleic to α–linolenic acids in the diet should be between 5:1 and 10:1 [
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>]. The ratios of linoleic to α–linolenic of the samples in the present study ranged from 25.40:1 to 29.23. This shows that on a diet based mainly on 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span>; FAO/WHO nutritional requirement will be met. The extracted oil from the pulp sample contained high concentration of MUFA, PUFA, TUFA, TEFA and O/L (%) which differ positively by 0.96%, 21.63%, 15.02%, 23.48% and 27.27%, respectively; from that of the seed oil, while the TSFA and TNEFA (%) of the seed oil sample varies respectively by 54.61% and 26.01% from the pulp sample (Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phospholipids content of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> pulp and seed oils are shown in Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>
  </span>. From the result, the seed oil contained the highest concentration of total phospholipids, 771.80 mg/100g as compared to 292.46 mg/100g for pulp oil. Phosphatidycholine (PC) had the highest value of 351.82 mg/100g in seed sample while phosphatidylinositol (PI) showed a greater concentration with the value of 176.69 mg/100g in pulp sample. PC is usually the most abundant phospholipid in animals and plants, often amounting to almost 50% of the total, and as such it is obviously a key building block of membrane bilayers. In particular, it makes up a very high proportion of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. It is also said to be the principal phospholipid circulating in plasma, where it is an integral component of the lipoproteins, especially the HDL, as it is regarded as the only phospholipid necessary for lipoprotein assembly and secretion [
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>-
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>]. PI is an important lipid, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes in all plants and animals, both directly and via a number of metabolites. The inositol phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol) are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules in animal and plant cells, trough the action of a family of highly specific enzymes collectively known as phospholipase C. They regulate the activity of a group of at least a dozen related enzymes known as protein kinase C, which in turn control many key cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis. In addition to that, inositol phospholipids appear to have crucial roles in interfacial binding of proteins and in the regulation of proteins at the cell interface [
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is usually the second most abundant phospholipid in animal and plant lipids [
  <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>]. The PE values were 164.33 mg/100g in seed and 56.74 mg/100g in pulp samples. In animal tissues, phosphatidylethanolamine is especially important in the sarcolemmal membranes of the heart during ischemia, it is involved in secretion of the nascent very-low-density lipoproteins from liver and it has functions in membrane fusion and fission. It also has a functional role in the Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>- ATPase in that one molecule of PE is bound in a cavity between two trans–membrane helices, acting as a wedge to keep them apart. This is displaced when Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> is bound to the enzyme [
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phosphatidyserine (PS) and lysophosphatidycholine (LPC) were the minor phospholipids with concentrations ranging between 33.66 to 38.37 mg/100g and 2.52e
  <span class="sup">-2</span> to 9.85 mg/100g, respectively. In addition to its function as a component of cellular membranes and as a precursor for other phospholipids, PS is an essential cofactor that binds to and activates a large number of proteins, especially those with signalling activities [
  <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>]. LPC (which is mostly found in trace amounts in most tissues) has pro-inflammatory properties and it is known to be a pathological component of oxidized lipoproteins (LDL) in plasma and of atherosclerotic lesions; it has been shown to promote demyelination in the nervous system. Recently, LPC has been found to have some functions in cell signalling, and specific receptors (coupled to G proteins) have been identified. It activates the specific phospholipase C that releases diacylglycerols and inositol triphosphate with resultant increases in intracellular Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> and activation of protein kinase C. LPC also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase in certain cell types [
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>]. The RSD ranged from 6.55% in phosphatidylserine to 99.04% in lysophosphatidylcholine.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most abundant plant phytosterols are sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol [
  <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>]. The total phytosterol concentrations of the studied samples were 17.09 and 436.37 mg/100g for pulp and seed oils, respectively (Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>
  </span>). Seed sample was more concentrated in all the plant sterols than the pulp oil. The RSD varied from 24.90 to 98.46.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The daily dietary intake of plant sterols differs among populations, but is typically between 160-400 mg. Those eating a vegetarian diet may eat up to 750 mg/day, which would provide some degree of cholesterol lowering [
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>]. Therefore, oil extracted from the seed of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> sample will be a very good source of dietary phytosterols. In addition to their cholesterol lowering properties, phytosterols possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenicity, and anti-oxidation activities, and should thus be of clinical importance, even for those individuals without elevated LDL cholesterol [
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the physicochemical analysis of the 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> pulp and seed oils are presented in Table 
  <span class="bold">
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>
  </span>. The iodine, acidity, peroxide and saponification values are the major characterization parameters for oil quality. Peroxide value (PV) is a measure of oxidation during storage and the freshness of lipid matrix. It is a useful indicator of the early stages of rancidity occurring under mild condition and also, a measure of the primary lipid oxidation products. One of the most important parameters that influence lipid oxidation is the degree of unsaturation of its fatty acids. When double bonds of unsaturated fats are oxidized, peroxides are among the oxidation products formed. Peroxide values of all the oil samples were in agreement with the maximum Codex standard peroxide value (10 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/kg) for vegetable oil deterioration. The 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oils have significantly high peroxide values (8.15 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/kg for pulp and 9.20 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/kg for seed) and hence high degree of unsaturation. This observation suggests that 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oils have high content of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1), which are responsible for oxidative rancidity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acid value is a measure of the free fatty acids in oil. The higher the acid value found, the higher the level of free fatty acids which translates into decreased oil quality. Acceptable levels for all oil samples should be below 0.6 mg KOH/g (measured in potassium hydroxide per gram) [
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>]. Among the oil samples studied, the seed oil has highest (24.00 mg KOH/g) acid value which indicates high free fatty acids and leads to a tendency to become rancid (off-flavor). Acid value is also used as an indicator for edibility of an oil and suitability for use in the paint and soap industries [
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>]. High acid values in the oils (16.50mg KOH/g and 24.00mg KOH/g) for pulp and seed samples, respectively showed that the oils may not be suitable for use in cooking (edibility), but however, be useful for production of paints, liquid soap and shampoos [
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>]. Acid value of the oil suitable for edible purpose should not exceed 4 mg KOH/g [
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Iodine index is a property of the unsaturation of fatty acids or its esters. Lipids with unsaturated fatty acids (containing one or more double bonds) are easily assimilated and broken down to produce calorific energy than saturated fatty acids. However, when the iodine value becomes too high, the stability of the oil reduces because it is more likely to undergo oxidation. Oils with iodine value above 125mg of I/100g are classified as drying oils; those with iodine value 110 - 125mg of I/100g are classified as semidrying oils. Those with iodine value less than 110 are considered as nondrying oil [
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>]. The iodine values of the extracted oils were 94.24 and 122.42 g I
  <sub>2</sub>/100g for pulp and seed, respectively. The value is high for seed sample, indicating that it is semidrying oil. Thus, the oil will not attract high interest in the paint and coatings industry unless it undergoes dehydration before use. The differences in iodine values between pulp and seed oil samples may be due to the different fatty acid compositions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saponification value (SV) is an indicator of the average molecular weight and, hence, chain length. It is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the lipid. The SV values of the studied oils were 189.40 mg KOH/g and 190.22 mg KOH/g for pulp and seed samples, respectively. The results are in good agreement with Codex standard for cotton oil (189 - 198 mg KOH/g), soybean oil (189 - 195 mg KOH/g), corn oil (187 - 195 mg KOH/g) and peanut oil (187 - 196 mg KOH/g) [
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>], but lower than the 246.60 for African pear seed oil [
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>], 227.49 for groundnut seed oil [
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>] and 224.40 for shea butter tree seed oil [
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>]. Oil fractions with saponification values of 200 mg KOH/g and above, had been reported to possess low molecular weight fatty acids [
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unsaponifiable matter of the oil samples were 1.63% (pulp) and 2.54% (seed). These values are low especially in the pulp oil, which indicate that the oil sample is pure because most fats and oils of normal purity contained less than 2% of unsaponifiable matter [
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>]. Specific gravity of the extracted oils was 0.92 gcm
  <span class="sup">–3</span> in both pulp and seed samples. The result indicates that the studied oils are less dense than water and therefore would be useful in cream production as it will make the oils flow and spread easily on the skin. The low specific gravity of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oil implies good shelf-life characteristics. The viscosities of the investigated oils were 9.15 and 10.62 in pulp and seed oils, respectively. Oils with low viscosity value indicate that they are light and so probably highly unsaturated. The high value might be as a result of suspended particles still present in the crude oil sample. Kinematic viscosity increases with FA chain length and with increasing degree of saturation of either the fatty acid or alcohol moiety in a fatty ester [
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flash point is the lowest temperature at which a liquid can form an ignitable mixture in air near the surface of the liquid. It has value of 290.00 (pulp) and 295.00 (seed) 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> oils. The lower the flash point, the easier it is to ignite the material. The extracted oils were light amber yellow and pale yellow colour for pulp and seed oils of 
  <span class="italic">H. barteri</span> samples, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 0.00% in specific gravity to 18.52 in acid value.
