 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study presented data on the concentrations of fatty acid, phospholipid and phytosterol compositions of 
  <span class="italic">Haematostaphis barteri</span> pulp and seed oils. Some physicoâ€“chemical parameters were also presented. There was a clear indication that the pulp and seed oils contained a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids, making them a healthy low fat food. It was also revealed that both sample oils may be developed into a commercial product for use in food products.
