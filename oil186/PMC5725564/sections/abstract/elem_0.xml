  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploring under–utilized plant fruits could be of high significance for food security and nutritional requirements, therefore, it can effectively add to the overall improvement of a nation’s economy. Blood plum (
   <span class="italic">Haematostaphis barteri</span>) is a wild edible vegetable and its fruit contains pulp and oily seed which are edible.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study was carried out to determine fatty acid profile, phospholipid and phytosterol contents as well as some physicochemical parameters of pulp and seed oils of 
   <span class="italic">Haematostaphis barteri</span> (popularly known as blood plum) using standard analytical techniques.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results:</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most concentrated fatty acids were palmitic acid (15.34%) &lt; oleic acid (22.31%) &lt; linoleic acid (50.56%) for the pulp oil while that of seed oil were oleic acid (12.34%) &lt; palmitic acid (25.37%) &lt; linoleic acid (38.87%). Arachidic, behenic, lignoceric and palmitoleic acids were all present in small quantities with none of them recording up to 1.0% in either of the samples. Lauric was determined but not detected in the pulp oil. The fatty acid composition of pulp and seed oils contained a healthy mixture of all the types of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The value of polyunsaturated/saturated index (P/S) which is associated to the impact on human health was higher in the pulp oil (2.47). Phospatidylinositol had the highest content (17.69 mg/100g) in the pulp oil while the highest content in seed oil was phosphatidylcholine (351.82 mg/100g). The total phytosterols for pulp and seed oils were 17.09 and 436.37 mg/100g, respectively. The results of some physicochemical parameters of pulp and seed oils were colour (light amber yellow and pale yellow), kinematic viscosity (9.15 and 10.62 mm
   <span class="sup">2</span>/s), specific gravity (0.92 and 0.92), unsaponifiable matter (1.63 and 2.54%), flash point 29.00 and 295.00
   <span class="sup">o</span>C), saponification value (189.40 and 190.22 mg KOH/g), peroxide value (8.15 and 9.20 meq O
   <sub>2</sub>/kg), iodine value (94.24 and 122.42 mg of I/100 g) and acid value (16.50 and 24.00 mg KOH/g), respectively.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, high percentage PUFA and low value of cholesterol may make either of the sample oils, a good food source on health wise basis. It was also revealed that both sample oils may be developed into a commercial product for use in food products.</p>
