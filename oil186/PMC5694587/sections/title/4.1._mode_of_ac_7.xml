 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most antimicrobial activities of several plant EOs depend mainly on their bioactive single components which are able to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and/or completely suppress the pathogens [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. In fact, several studies have explained that the synergetic effect between two or more chemical constituents could have a distinctive role in the biological activity of EOs [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The synergism between the aromatic plant components often plays an essential role in the effectiveness and reduction of the developing resistance of any pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, some constituents such as carvacrol, 
  <span class="italic">Î³</span>-terpinene, and p-cymene are more effective when they are combining together [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. This synergistic action is due to p-cymene which acts as a mediator for carvacrol transportation across cell wall components and the cytoplasmic membrane of pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, the enzymatic reactions within the EOs and the lipophilic properties of the individual bioactive constituents might play a role in degrading the microbe plasma membrane and hence lead to the lyses of the hypha wall as discussed by Soylu et al. (2010) [
