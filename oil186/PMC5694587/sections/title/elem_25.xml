 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, great interest was given to the curative effect of many plant EOs especially for wound treatment since the EOs have demonstrated interesting medication against some wound types, which cannot occur with pharmaceuticals [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For centuries, plant EOs have been used for curing many diseases such as melaleuca EO which is considered an effective factor for speeding up the healing process of wounds. Lavender EO was commonly used to heal wounds, cuts, burns, and sunburns by improving the formation of scar tissues [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]. Tea tree oil has been shown to be effective
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> on several strains of methicillin-resistant
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> (MRSA) isolated from wounds [
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>]. The EOs extracted from frankincense and geranium can be used as antiseptic agents by burning them. They can also be applied internally to protect the wounds from developing infections [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.1.1. Anti-Inflammatory</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inflammatory disorders are associated with pain, redness, and swelling, leading to loss of vital functions. EOs have been used for several decades to relieve pain and inflammation. Usually, EOs have more effective and pain-relieving properties than many pharmaceutical analgesics. The use of EOs has many benefits in the treatment of inflammation because it has fewer side effects than many synthetic and traditional drugs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A review of the medicinal properties of chamomile documented that plants contain more flavonoids with anti-inflammatory properties than others do. These inflammation-reducing compounds can penetrate the skin easily and reduce inflammation. Tea tree oil has been shown to increase monocytic differentiation
   <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> and reduce inflammation, therefore assisting the healing of chronic wounds. Other promising applications have been proposed for
   <span class="italic"> Helichrysum italicum</span> (Roth) G. Don as antispastic [
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>],
   <span class="italic"> Pelargonium roseum</span> L'hér. as anti-inflammatory [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possible mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of EOs was suggested to compete with arachidonic acid for its incorporation into the membrane. Hence, arachidonic acid generates slightly modified prostaglandins and eicosanoids, which induces a lesser extent of inflammation via reduced induction of COX-2 [
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>]. Further studies reported that the main component of tea tree oil, terpinen-4-ol, has been shown to suppress inflammatory mediator production by activating monocytes

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.1.2. Antioxidant</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity can be defined as the molecules able to react with radicals or having a reducing power to counteract the oxidative stress caused by radicals. Antioxidant properties play an essential role in some of EOs' biological activities, which is justified by the involvement of oxidative stress in pathology. In addition, the botanical source of aromatic plants and the environmental factors such as climate may affect the actual composition of extracted EOs and thus reflect different antioxidant activities. Oregano EO is able to protect extra virgin olive oil from oxidation during storage and is able to extend the shelf life of sea bream and to reduce the formation of volatile amines and of TBAR compounds [
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>]. Oregano and sage EOs are able to protect the minced meat samples from autoxidation [
   <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant effect of many EOs is due to the inherent ability of some of their components, particularly phenols, to stop or delay the aerobic oxidation of organic matter [
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. On the other hand, there are phenol-free EOs that express antioxidant behaviour and this is due to the radical chemistry of some terpenoids and other volatile constituents (e.g., sulfur-containing components) [
   <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>]. In general, phenolic compounds, both natural (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-tocopherol) or synthetic (e.g., BHA), act as antioxidants due to their high reactivity with peroxyl radicals, which are disposed of by formal hydrogen atom transfer [
   <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>]. The antioxidant chemistry of sulfur-containing EOs from
   <span class="italic"> Allium</span> and related genera is due to a direct chain-breaking activity that is expressed only upon conversion of the inactive components into thiosulfinates that ultimately yields the “active” sulfonic acid [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.1.3. Anticarcinogenic</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anticarcinogenic activity is the ability of a specific substance to counteract or completely inhibit the development of carcinogen. The traditional anticancer therapy, such as multichemotherapeutic drugs, is often compromised of the development of drug resistance and the serious irreversible side effects [
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>]. As pointed out recently, natural products from medicinal plants represent a fertile ground for the development of novel anticancer agents. However, the utilization of plant EOs as anticancer agents is under daily diagnosis for designing the best natural alternative, which could have selectivity towards the target cells of various tumours.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current review, some revealing examples of plant EOs and their constituents that have been used effectively as antitumour agents have been discussed. The detailed discussion will also be reported regarding the possible mechanisms and the multiple pathways involving apoptosis, DNA repair modulation, cell cycle arrest, and antiproliferative activity through the increase of reactive oxygen and nitrogen levels (ROS/RNS) in cancer cells [
   <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some EOs showed a potential anticancer activity against liver, lung, colon, and prostate cancer such as
   <span class="italic"> Artemisia lavandulaefolia</span> DC and its main single constituent 1,8-cineole against a subline of the ubiquitous KERATIN-forming tumour cell line HeLa which derived from an epidermal carcinoma of the mouth [
   <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>]. Jayaprakasha et al. (2013) [
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>] found that
   <span class="italic"> C. limettioides</span> Tan EO inhibited colon cancer (SW480) by inducing the cells-apoptosis. Zu et al. (2010) [
   <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>] noted that the
   <span class="italic"> T. vulgaris</span> EO exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards three human cancers: PC-3 from human prostate, A549 from human lung, and MCF-7 from breast adenocarcinoma.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further studies demonstrated that some single constituents like carvacrol [
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>], thymol [
   <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>], limonene, and citral [
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>] have shown a promising cytotoxic effect against different human cancer cell lines mainly due to the induction the mitochondrial dysfunction [
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>–
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Elshafie et al. [
   <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>] have pointed out the effectiveness of
   <span class="italic"> O. vulgare</span> EO and its main single constituents (carvacrol, thymol, citral, and limonene) on tumour liver cell line (HepG2) following the MTT viability assay. The results showed that the above treatments illustrated a great effect as anticancer therapeutic agents especially thymol and carvacrol (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general mechanism of cytotoxic effect of plant EOs is mostly due to the presence of phenols, aldehydes, and alcohols. In particular, the toxicity towards mammalians decreases significantly with the increase of average lipophilicity of EO components [
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>], while the toxicity against bacteria and fungi simultaneously increases significantly with increasing lipophilicity [
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>]. This mode of action refers to the extraordinary role of EOs among natural compounds, especially of their highly lipophilic constituents. The cellular mechanisms of carcinogenic prevention by EO treatments were also considered to be due to the induction of cell-apoptosis [
   <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>]. There is also a suggestion that the pathway of cancer cells is sensitive to the inhibitory actions of plant isoprenoids by reducing tumour cell-size in patients [
