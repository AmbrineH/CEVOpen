  <span class="italic"> in vitro </span>antibacterial activity of three EOs extracted from
  <span class="italic"> Schinus terebinthifolius</span> Raddi (leaves and fruits) against two strains of G+ve bacteria (
  <span class="italic">Bacillus megaterium </span>de Bary and
  <span class="italic"> Clavibacter michiganensis</span> Smith) and 4 strains of Gâˆ’ve bacteria (
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Xanthomonas campestris </span>Pammel,
  <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas savastanoi</span> Janse, and
  <span class="italic"> P. syringae </span>pv.
  <span class="italic"> phaseolicola </span>Van Hall) compared with the synthetic antibiotic tetracycline. They resulted in the fact that the above-mentioned EOs were able to significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacterial strains especially against G+ve bacteria.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">El-Massrry et al. (2009) [
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">71</a>] studied the antibacterial activity of different crude extracts from fresh leaves of
  <span class="italic"> S. terebinthifolius</span> cultivated in Egypt and reported that these extracts exhibited higher antibacterial activity against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>. In a recent study, the EOs extracted from
  <span class="italic"> V. officinalis </span>L.,
  <span class="italic"> Majorana hortensis</span> L., and
  <span class="italic"> Salvia officinalis </span>L. were able to inhibit the growth of some phytopathogenic bacteria in a dose dependent manner such as
  <span class="italic"> B. megaterium</span>,
  <span class="italic"> C. michiganensis</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> B. mojavensis</span> in the case of
  <span class="italic"> V. officinalis</span> [
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>], whereas the highest reduction of
  <span class="italic"> C. michiganensis</span>,
  <span class="italic"> X. campestris, </span>and
  <span class="italic"> P. savastanoi</span> was observed in the case of
  <span class="italic"> S. officinalis </span>and
  <span class="italic"> M. hortensis</span>. The mode of action of different EOs towards the bacterial cells
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> is explained by permeabilization of cell membranes, loss of ions, leakage of macromolecules, and lysis [
