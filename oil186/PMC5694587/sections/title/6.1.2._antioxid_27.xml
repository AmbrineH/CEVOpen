 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity can be defined as the molecules able to react with radicals or having a reducing power to counteract the oxidative stress caused by radicals. Antioxidant properties play an essential role in some of EOs' biological activities, which is justified by the involvement of oxidative stress in pathology. In addition, the botanical source of aromatic plants and the environmental factors such as climate may affect the actual composition of extracted EOs and thus reflect different antioxidant activities. Oregano EO is able to protect extra virgin olive oil from oxidation during storage and is able to extend the shelf life of sea bream and to reduce the formation of volatile amines and of TBAR compounds [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant effect of many EOs is due to the inherent ability of some of their components, particularly phenols, to stop or delay the aerobic oxidation of organic matter [
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. On the other hand, there are phenol-free EOs that express antioxidant behaviour and this is due to the radical chemistry of some terpenoids and other volatile constituents (e.g., sulfur-containing components) [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>]. In general, phenolic compounds, both natural (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-tocopherol) or synthetic (e.g., BHA), act as antioxidants due to their high reactivity with peroxyl radicals, which are disposed of by formal hydrogen atom transfer [
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>]. The antioxidant chemistry of sulfur-containing EOs from
  <span class="italic"> Allium</span> and related genera is due to a direct chain-breaking activity that is expressed only upon conversion of the inactive components into thiosulfinates that ultimately yields the “active” sulfonic acid [
