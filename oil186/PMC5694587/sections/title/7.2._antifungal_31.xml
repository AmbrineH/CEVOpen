 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous plant EOs and their single constituents have been reported to inhibit postharvest fungi
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> and
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span>. Several researchers reported that some plant EOs can be potentially utilized in controlling some serious phytopathogenic fungi such as
  <span class="italic"> B. cinerea</span> [
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">73</a>, 
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>],
  <span class="italic"> Aspergillus </span>spp. [
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">75</a>],
  <span class="italic"> Fusarium </span>spp. [
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">76</a>],
  <span class="italic"> Penicillium </span>spp. [
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">77</a>], and
  <span class="italic"> C. gloeosporioides </span>Penz. [
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elshafie et al. (2015) [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>] investigated the fact that the EOs obtained from
  <span class="italic"> T. vulgaris </span>and
  <span class="italic"> V. officinalis</span> can be effectively utilized for controlling brown rot infection on peach fruit caused by
  <span class="italic"> Monilinia laxa</span>,
  <span class="italic"> M. fructicola</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> M. fructigena</span>. Clove EO extracted from
  <span class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum </span>(L.) Merr. &amp; Perry has been reported as a bioactive substance especially its active component monoterpene eugenol against
  <span class="italic"> B. cinerea</span>,
  <span class="italic"> M. fructigena</span>,
  <span class="italic"> P. expansum </span>Link, and
  <span class="italic"> Phlyctema vagabunda </span>Desm. in apples [
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">79</a>]. Oregano EO and its main single constituent carvacrol were reported to inhibit effectively the mycelium growth of
  <span class="italic"> Neofabraea alba </span>(E. J. Guthrie) Verkley in apples [
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">80</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies also concluded the presence of significant potential fungicidal effects of some plant EOs such as thyme and vervain higher than chemical preparations in postharvest treatments against
  <span class="italic"> M. laxa</span>,
  <span class="italic"> M. fructigena, </span>and
  <span class="italic"> M. fructicola </span>on peach fruit [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. In the same mode, EOs of fennel (
  <span class="italic">Foeniculum sativum</span> Mill.), marjoram, oregano, and sage exhibited a fungicidal effect against
  <span class="italic"> B. cinerea</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. expansum</span> in apples [
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elshafie et al. (2015) [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] evaluated the antifungal effect of the single components of
  <span class="italic"> O. vulgare </span>EO (carvacrol, thymol, linalool, and
  <span class="italic"> trans</span>-caryophyllene) against the postharvest pathogens
  <span class="italic"> M. laxa, M. fructigena, </span>and
  <span class="italic"> M. fructicola</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The fungicidal activity assay of the above four single components has been carried out
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> according to the method of Soylu et al. (2010) [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>] and the antifungal activity was expressed by measuring the diameter of mycelium growth [
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>]. They concluded that carvacrol and thymol have exhibited the highest activity in
  <span class="italic"> in vitro </span>tests against all studied postharvest
  <span class="italic"> Monilinia </span>pathogens. Linalool and
  <span class="italic"> trans-</span>caryophyllene showed low antifungal activity against all studied pathogens. However, thymol showed a fungitoxic effect while carvacrol and citral showed a fungistatic effect against the previous tested fungi.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the same study, Elshafie et al. (2015) [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] reported that the bioactive treatments which exhibited the highest
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> activity were selected for further
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> experiments against the same postharvest pathogenic fungi and concluded that carvacrol and thymol showed a promising inhibition of the brown rot disease of peach fruit caused by
  <span class="italic"> M. laxa</span>,
  <span class="italic"> M. fructicola,</span> and
  <span class="italic"> M. fructigena</span>. The antifungal effect is mainly attributed to the inhibition of both mycelium growth and spore germination. This hypothesis suggests that impeding the initial infection and the subsequent mycelial spread beyond the infection site will restrict the expression of disease.
