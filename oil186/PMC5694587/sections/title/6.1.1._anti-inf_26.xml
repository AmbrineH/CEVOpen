 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inflammatory disorders are associated with pain, redness, and swelling, leading to loss of vital functions. EOs have been used for several decades to relieve pain and inflammation. Usually, EOs have more effective and pain-relieving properties than many pharmaceutical analgesics. The use of EOs has many benefits in the treatment of inflammation because it has fewer side effects than many synthetic and traditional drugs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A review of the medicinal properties of chamomile documented that plants contain more flavonoids with anti-inflammatory properties than others do. These inflammation-reducing compounds can penetrate the skin easily and reduce inflammation. Tea tree oil has been shown to increase monocytic differentiation
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> and reduce inflammation, therefore assisting the healing of chronic wounds. Other promising applications have been proposed for
  <span class="italic"> Helichrysum italicum</span> (Roth) G. Don as antispastic [

  <span class="italic"> Pelargonium roseum</span> L'h√©r. as anti-inflammatory [
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>], and
  <span class="italic"> O. majorana</span> L. as antimutagenic agent [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possible mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of EOs was suggested to compete with arachidonic acid for its incorporation into the membrane. Hence, arachidonic acid generates slightly modified prostaglandins and eicosanoids, which induces a lesser extent of inflammation via reduced induction of COX-2 [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>]. Further studies reported that the main component of tea tree oil, terpinen-4-ol, has been shown to suppress inflammatory mediator production by activating monocytes
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> [
