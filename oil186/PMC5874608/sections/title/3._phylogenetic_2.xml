  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> is a member of Lamiaceae and belongs to a clade of New World Mentheae. The closely related genera that share similar morphology and habitat preference with 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> include 
  <span class="italic">Dicerandra</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Piloblephis</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Stachydeoma</span> spp., and the woody, southeastern U.S. species of 
  <span class="italic">Clinopodium</span> such as 
  <span class="italic">C. ashei, C. georgianum, C. coccineum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. dentatum</span> [
  <a rid="B28-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-07-00019">28</a>]. Despite the fact that 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> species are morphologically distinguishable, there are two problems about species status based on morphology. First, 
  <span class="italic">C. brevifolia</span> (endangered species) shares a lot of morphological characteristics with 
  <span class="italic">C. canescens</span> (relatively widespread in its range). Second, populations of 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> in Santa Rosa County, Florida, have morphological characteristics in common with both 
  <span class="italic">C. glabra</span> (endangered species) and 
  <span class="italic">C. canescens.</span> Due to the endangered status of four 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> species, it is important to resolve the species relationships, define species limits and elucidate the evolutionary processes in order to help with conservation plans. 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> was subjected to several phylogenetic analyses using four data partitions: plastid DNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and two members of the GapC gene family [
  <a rid="B29-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-07-00019">29</a>,
  <a rid="B30-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-plants-07-00019">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-plants-07-00019">31</a>]. These analyses did not resolve species relationships in 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span>. In agreement morphological evidence, ITS results supported a monophyletic 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> while plastid DNA results did not. Some 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> populations showed moderate levels of inbreeding, but inbreeding does not seem as a major factor. Because previous analyses failed to resolve species relationships separately, combined analyses were carried out but the results still did not resolve the relationships within 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span>. Studies using genotype data from quickly evolving microsatellite loci suggested that both ancient interspecific hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism have likely occurred in 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> and that based on the patterns of genetic structure (which corresponds to species bounderies), 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> species have diverged genetically from one another (nonmonophyly) despite having unique distribution patterns and distinguishing morphological characteristics [
