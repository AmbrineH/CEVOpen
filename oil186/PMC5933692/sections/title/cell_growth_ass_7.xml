 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231) were used. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HA22T/VGH was kindly provided by Professor Massimo Levrero (Laboratory of Gene Expression, Fondazione Andrea Cesalpino, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Rome, Italy). HepG2 (ATCC
  <span class="sup">®</span>: HB-8065
  <span class="sup">™</span>) and Hep3B (ATCC
  <span class="sup">®</span>: HB-8064
  <span class="sup">™</span>) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). All the above cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy). The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (ATCC
  <span class="sup">®</span>: HTB-26
  <span class="sup">™</span>—Rockville, MD, USA) and SUM149 (SUM149PT—Asterand Bioscience Detroit, MI) were kindly provided by Dr. Elda Tagliabue (Molecular Targeting Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione Institute of Hospitalization and Scientific Care, National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy) and were authenticated using the short tandem repeat profiling method in their Institute facility.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cells were seeded at 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cells/well onto 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After obtaining the cells, the first passage carried out was assigned passage number 1. Cells with a narrow range of passage number (4–6) were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination were used for all experiments.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At time 0, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium supplemented of essential at the indicated concentrations. Following 72 h of treatment, 16 μL of a commercial solution obtained from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI, USA) containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and phenazine ethosulfate were added. The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> for 2 h, and the bioreduction of MTS dye was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of each well at 490 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Cell growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage (mean ± SD) of the absorbance of the control cells.
