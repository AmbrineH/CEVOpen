 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils have been used for centuries in folk medicine and in the last few years the biological properties of different essential oils have been demonstrated. Their use in the treatment of pain, inflammation, viral diseases and cancer, enhancement of the bioavailability of other drugs, as well as repellent/insecticidal properties against stored product and crop insects were confirmed [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref016">16</a>]. According to Bakkali 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref017">17</a>] in natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our chemical composition indicates that the compounds found in 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> essential oil potentially have several biological roles. Among others, diterpenes contributing to 30% of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> composition could have beneficial effects as bactericides, as protection against free radical cell damages, as anti-inflammatory and in the treatment of cancer, among others [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref018">18</a>]. As reported by Islam [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref019">19</a>] diterpenes may act as anticancer alone or in combination with other diterpenes or anticancer drugs with synergic effects. In particular, phytol, occurring in 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> essential oil to 4.1%, can induce apoptosis in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells and its cytotoxic activity has been demonstrated 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> for several tumor cell lines [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref020">20</a>]. Moreover, the diterpenes have also evident actions against toxic substances that cause cytogenotoxic damages in biological systems [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref019">19</a>]. In an ecological context, they may confer to plants resistance against pests or pathogens [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref021">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone is also among of the main compounds (5.3%) found in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span>. It was recognized as a naphotoquinones belonging to hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone since its mass spectrum and its linear retention indices are very similar to those of other known isomers of hydroxyl-methyl-naphthoquinones (e.g. plumbagin, 7-methyl-juglone). It is interesting to note that naphthoquinones are biosynthesized in several plant families (e.g. Plumbaginaceae, Juglandaceae, Boraginaceae, Iridaceae, Verbenaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Gentianaceae, Droseraceae, and Euphorbiaceae, among others) as well as in algae, fungi, some animals and also as products of the metabolism in some bacteria [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref022">22</a>]. From an ecological point of view, naphthoquinones act as chemical defense for many plants and several naphthoquinones are essentials in the biosynthesis of many molluscicidal and insecticidal compounds (e.g. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives) [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref022">22</a>]. Furthermore, naphthoquinones and their derivatives are compounds with important pharmacological activities such as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anti-parasitic (e.g. antimalarial and antileishmania) [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref024">24</a>]. Pharmacological activities showed by naphthoquinones and derivatives can be explicated through two mechanisms: (1) as pro-oxidants, reducing oxygen to reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (2) as electrophiles, forming covalent bonds with tissue nucleophiles [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref026">26</a>]. According to López 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref022">22</a>], hydroxy-naphthoquinones and their derivatives are promising compounds for treating disease and for pest control. Several natural compounds exert its antitumor activity through anti or pro-oxidant mechanisms. In the present study, 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> essential oil induces a strong suppressive growth effects in all tested cancer cell lines, probably through an increase in free radical generation due to diterpenes and hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196947.t001" href="#pone.0196947.t001">Table 1</a>) which are the main compounds found in this oil [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref026">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our previous data on the same tumor cellular models, demonstrated that the redox perturbation due to natural compounds led to inhibition of NF-κB, a transcriptional factor often constitutively activated in many type of cancers and an important target for antitumor therapy [
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196947.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196947.ref027">27</a>]. It would be interesting to assess the chemical structure of the tentatively identified hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone. Further studies should be also necessary to confirm if the diterpenes and this hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone are NF-κB inhibitors in these cancer models and to evaluate their possible use as anticancer drugs.
