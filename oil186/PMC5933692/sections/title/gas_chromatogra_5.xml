 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC analysis was performed in an Agilent 7000C GC system, fitted with a fused silica Agilent HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness), coupled to an Agilent triple quadrupole Mass Selective Detector MSD 5973; ionization voltage 70 eV; electron multiplier energy 2000 V; transfer line temperature, 295 °C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). The other GC analysis was performed in a Shimadzu QP 2010 plus, single quadrupole GC/MS system, fitted with a Supelcowax 10 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness); ionization voltage 70 eV; transfer line temperature, 280 °C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). For both columns, the temperature was initially kept at 40 °C for 5 min, then gradually increased to 250°C at 2°C min
  <span class="sup">-1</span> rate, held for 15 min and finally raised to 270 °C at 10 °C min
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. One μL of diluted samples (1/100 v/v, in 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane) was injected at 250 °C automatically and in the splitless mode; transfer line temperature, 295 °C.
