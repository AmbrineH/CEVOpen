 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate antioxidant activity, we have used DPPH Assay. The antiradical efficiency of the sample was evaluated by the DPPH stable radical method [

  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> at different concentrations, was added to aliquots (3.9 mL) of a solution made up with DPPH (4.8 mg) in MeOH (200 mL), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The initial concentration of DPPH was approximately 60 μM. Lower absorbance values of reaction mixture indicate higher free radical scavenging activity. The results were plotted as the percentage of absorbance disappearance at 517 nm [(1—A/A0) × 100] against the amount of sample divided by the initial concentration of DPPH. Each point was acquired in triplicate. ED
  <sub>50</sub> corresponds to micrograms of fraction able to consume half the amount of free radical divided by micromoles of initial DPPH. The results were expressed as antiradical capacity (ARC), which is the inverse of ED
  <sub>50</sub>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pro-oxidant activity was examined by cell counting, adding N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant molecule, 1 h before essential oil. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three different experiments performed in duplicate. All the chemicals were supplied by Sigma Aldrich srl, Milan, Italy.</p>
