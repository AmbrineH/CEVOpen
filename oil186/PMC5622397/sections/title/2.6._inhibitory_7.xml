 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the evaluation of the inhibition effect of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil upon the germination of conidia there was used an entirely casualized design, with seven treatments and three repetitions. The treatments were constituted by the following oil concentrations: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0, and 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, negative control, with methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and positive control with distilled/sterilized water. From each oil treatment, there was mixed 100 µL of the oil concentrations and 100 µL of the 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> conidia concentration (10
  <span class="sup">4</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The evaluation was made 12 h after the inoculation in optical microscope.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plates containing the oil solutions were incubated on a humid chamber (trays) at 27 °C for 12 h. After this period the evaluation was made with approximately 200 conidia where they were counted, and the percentage of germination of conidia of inhibition were calculated, adapted from [
