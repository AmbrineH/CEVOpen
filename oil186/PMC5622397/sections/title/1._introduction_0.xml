 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even Brazil, occupying a highlighting position between the biggest worldâ€™s producers, has a productivity that is considered low when compared to other producer countries. In the state of Tocantins, it is observed expressive increases of planted areas and of productivity on maize culture, which have been higher than the national mean in the last years. These indicators make the state of Tocantins one of the greatest producers of the North region [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00062">1</a>], and one of the potential producers of grains of Brazil in a near future [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the factors that affect the productivity and the quality of the grain, there are the diseases. Recent studies show an increase on the frequency of the fungus 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia lunata</span> (Wakker) provoking diseases in maize cultivars in China [
  <a rid="B3-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-medicines-04-00062">3</a>]. In maize plantations in Brazil, there are few records of the 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot in scientific literature. In the state of Tocantins there is an observed marked increase on the incidence of this disease for many years [
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00062">4</a>]. In a disease survey on Tocantins realized by [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00062">5</a>], the 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot was noted together with helmintosporiosis (
  <span class="italic">H. turcicum</span>) as more incident.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nowadays, alternatives for reduction of the use of pesticides are searched, and some works have already been realized aiming at identifying new bioproducts based on medicinal plants with antimicrobial action [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00062">6</a>]. Some works have already showed that the addition of essential oils in specific concentrations on the culture environments with phytopathogenic fungi is efficient in the inhibition of development of these organisms [
  <a rid="B7-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-medicines-04-00062">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00062">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00062">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00062">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the lack of works developed for the control of 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot in the state of Tocantins and in Brazil, studies are necessary in pursuing the disease management. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the fungitoxicity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span>, commonly known as lemongrass, upon the phytopathogen 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata,</span> and also to verify its efficiency on the preventive and curative control of 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot on maize.
