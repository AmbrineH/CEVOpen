 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were used plates containing inoculum of seven days of incubation where were added 10 mL of sterilized distilled water for the preparation of the conidia solutions. Utilizing a soft brush, there was realized the detachment of the conidia. This solution was filtered in gauze, and the conidia were counted in the Neubauer chamber. The concentration of 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was utilized for the biological activities. Following, the vases were kept for 48 h with humid cotton and closed with a plastic bag in order to provide a humid chamber. 48 h after the inoculation, the vases were left in shaded place until the appearance of the first leaf symptoms of 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot. For the evaluation of the severity of the diseases, there was used a notes scale according to [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00062">16</a>], where 0 = healthy plant; 1 = less than 1% of leaf area sick; 3 = 1 to 5% of the leaf area sick; 5 = 6 to 25% of the leaf area sick; 7 = 26 to 50% of the leaf area sick; and, 9 = more than 50% of the leaf area sick.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to evaluate the preventive effect of the essential oil, an entirely casualized design was used, where different concentrations of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> oil were tested, being: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0; and 7.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and three repetitions. As control, there were utilized water-pulverized plants (positive control) and methyl-thiophanate-pulverized plants at 2 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (negative control). From each treatment, 5 mL was sprayed on the plants and one hour after, the plants were inoculated with 5 mL of the conidia solution (10
  <span class="sup">4</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) of 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span>. The evaluation of the severity of the disease was made every two days after inoculation (5 evaluations on total).

From each treatment, 5 mL of the already cited oil concentrations was sprayed on the plants after verification of the appearance of the disease, and the evaluation of severity of the disease was made every two days, being realized a total of five evaluations after the application of the oil solutions. With the obtained results in the evaluations, the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was calculated, according to [
