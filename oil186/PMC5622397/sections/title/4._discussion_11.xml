 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phytoxicity on maize plants has as a principal symptom the appearance of necrosis on the leaves, specifically on the regions in which the solution accumulates, like borders and leaf veins, causing a loss of the green leaf area [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00062">18</a>]. Studies realized by [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00062">19</a>], show that the concentration of 1% of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> oil showed presented low toxicity (≤25%), since the plants presented only a light necrosis on the leaves.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil has as majoritarian component the Citral, with 69.31% (Geranial + Neral) and the Myrcene, with 23.77%, both being monoterpenes, according to [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00062">20</a>] studies, showing that both the oil and its majoritarian component, the Citral, acted on the mycelial inhibiton of the phytopathogens 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum cubense</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bipolaris sp.</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When observing the fungistatic action in vitro, [
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00062">10</a>] noted that the lemongrass (
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span>) essential oil inhibited the development of the fungi 
  <span class="italic">Didymella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">bryoniae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">pyricularia grisea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rizoctonia solani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sclerotium rolfsii</span>, demonstrating the high potential for the alternative control of these pathogens. Studies realized by [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00062">21</a>] obtained the total inhibition of the mycelial growth and of the germination of spores from 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</span> utilizing the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil from the concentration of 1 μL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil is described in many studies. Elevated levels of Geranial and Neral in the chemical composition of lemongrass were observed by [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00062">22</a>], with a mean of approximately 51% and 36%, respectively. The authors [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00062">23</a>] also observed similar percentages for Geranial (46.3%) and Neral (31.28%). Yet [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00062">24</a>] found levels of 43.6% for Neral and 34% for Geranial, values that are different to the ones found on this work, where the highest percentage was of Neral. It is known that many factors, such as extraction method, access and conditions of cultivation may have an influence on the levels of the essential oil components. That can explain the differences found in the present study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no record in the scientific literature about the preventive and curative effect in vivo of any essential oil upon the 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot disease. Nevertheless, [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00062">25</a>] when studying another pathosystem, it demonstrated good results for the alternative control. Five treatments were tested with lemongrass and other essential oils against the helmintosporiosis of Tanzania grass (
  <span class="italic">Panicum maximum</span> Jacq.) in preventive and curative effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was verified by [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00062">19</a>], on the control of the phytopathogen 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum graminicola</span>, that the lemongrass essential oil stood out as the most fungitoxic, since that occurred inhibition of 100% of fungus mycelial growth from the concentration (0.50 μL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The fact that the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil was not efficient on the in vitro inhibition test, but effective on the conidia germination and preventive control, demonstrates that it is very important to realize essays in vivo, but is also necessary in future works, in order to enlighten the mechanism of action of essential oils upon the plant diseases.
