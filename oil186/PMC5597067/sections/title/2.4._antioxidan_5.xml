 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The samples were also subjected to screening in order to identify their possible antioxidant activity, by using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH·) scavenging assay [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00001">21</a>]. Free radical scavenging activity of the corresponding samples was dependent on the extent of bleaching of the purple-colored DPPH methanol solution. Aliquots (50 μL) of various concentrations (0.5–3.0 mg/mL) of the samples in methanol were added to 5 mL of 0.004% DPPH solution in methanol (5 mL). Following a 30-min incubation period at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm. Inhibition of DPPH· in percentage (I%) was calculated using the following formula:
