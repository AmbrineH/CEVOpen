 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MICs of three fingered citron oils against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, are reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t002" href="#medicines-04-00001-t002">Table 2</a>. In particular, the ultrafiltration oil showed notable in vitro antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MIC = 156 μg/mL), 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> (MIC = 156 μg/mL), 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (MIC = 39 μg/mL), and 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> (MIC = 20 μg/mL).The vacuum distillation oil was only marginally active against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MIC = 625 μg/mL), 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> (MIC = 313 μg/mL), and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (MIC = 625 μg/mL), but was also strongly active against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> (MIC = 156 μg/mL).
