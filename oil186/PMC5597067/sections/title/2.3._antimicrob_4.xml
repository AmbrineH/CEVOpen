 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils were screened for antibacterial activity against: Gram-positive bacteria, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC No. 29213), 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> (ATCC No. 14579); Gram-negative bacteria 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (ATCC No. 27853), 
  <span class="italic">Serratia marcescens</span> (ATCC No. 14756). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using the microbroth dilution technique [

  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span> solutions of essential oil in DMSO, plus 50 μL CAMHB. The extract solutions were serially diluted (1:1) in CAMHB, in 96-well plates. Organisms at a concentration of approximately 1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> colony forming units (CFU)/mL were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h; the final minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration without turbidity. Gentamycin was used as a positive antibiotic control; DMSO was used as a negative control. Antifungal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> (ATCC No. 10231) and 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> (ATCC No. 16888) was determined as above, using Yeast and Mold Broth (YMB) inoculated with the corresponding fungal culture, diluted to a McFarland turbidity of 1.0. Amphotericin B was the positive control [
