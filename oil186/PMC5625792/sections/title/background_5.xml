 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various herb species have been used worldwide in prevention and treatment of diseases for many centuries. Today, several drugs have been developed from plants that are active against many common diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Among the aromatic plants belonging to the 
  <span class="italic">Lamiaceae</span> family, 
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span>, commonly known as Rosemary, is a flavoured herb which is native to the Mediterranean region and grows in various countries in the world [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The ROEO is a mixture of several major and minor compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Debersac et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>] showed that 1,8-cineole is the major component of Rosemary essential oil, whereas, in other studies α-pinene was the main component, followed by 1,8-cineole, camphene, β-myrcene, borneol and camphor [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Essential oils represent an alternative “green “to be used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, agricultural and food fields while substituting chemical treatments. Biological activities of essential oils from various plants, including Rosemary, have been attributed to the presence of specific chemical compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], antiproliferative [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>], anti-inflammatory [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] and antioxidant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] activities of the ROEO. The oil of Rosemary is used as a biological preservative of food products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] due to its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>].

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria, during development, can be present in planktonic or sessile forms known as biofilm [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Biofilm is a microbial structure that causes many problems in medical field, in food industry and even to the environment. Thus, biofilm could cause many public health problems. Indeed, nearly 80% of chronic bacterial infections are associated with the presence of biofilm [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. In addition, biofilms contaminate the majority of medical or prosthetic devices such as vascular prosthesis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], urinary catheters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], joint prostheses, pacemakers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], contact lens [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] and dental plates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. As the antibiotic treatment is most effective against microbial infections, bacterial biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics posing a public health problem. Indeed, concentrations of antibiotics needed to inhibit bacteria in biofilms may be greater than a thousand times that required to inhibit the same planktonic bacteria [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. So, it is necessary to find alternatives to fight against biofilm problems. In addition, biofilms cause a problem in many food industries. They contaminate the surfaces in contact with food while causing an alteration of the organoleptic quality of food products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. It has been previously demonstrated that essential oils are able to penetrate and cause the destruction of microbial biofilms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Few studies have shown the anti-biofilm activity of ROEO [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. However, all of these studies did not use 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span>, which is the major cause of catheter infections, as a model for anti-biofilm studies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many studies, antitumor activity has been reported for essential oils against several tumor cell lines. In fact, in-vitro anticancer activity of the essential oil isolated from the leaf of 
  <span class="italic">Machilus mushaensis</span> from Taiwan was analyzed and the oil exhibited cytotoxic activity against human oral, liver, lung, colon, melanoma, and leukemic cancer cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Indeed, other researchers evaluated the anticancer activity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> (Lour) and this investigation exhibited the potent chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive effect of 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> (Lour) essential oil over lung metastasis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In other studies, the oils of 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus torquata</span> stems exhibited cytotoxic activities on MCF-7 cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Huang%20W%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=27396185" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Huang</span> et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] have investigated the effect of two volatile oils prepared by steam distillation (SD) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of 
  <span class="italic">Centipeda minima</span>, a Chinese herb used in the treatment of various diseases including cancer. They found that SFE oil displayed potent anti-angiogenic activity in a zebrafish model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking all together, valorization of essential oils by the study of their original biological activities is of great interest. In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of Tunisian ROEO, to evaluate its antibacterial, anti-biofilm activities and anticancer properties.</p>
