 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to study cell migration and proliferation of untreated and treated cells with ROEO, the cell migration assay was performed. Results showed that the wound disappeared rapidly after 48 h for the untreated cells in comparison with the wound in the treated cells whose is slowly covered by the cells during the same incubation time for both Hela and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) (data not shown for MCF-7 cells).
