 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the low prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">L monocytogenes</span> in this study, consumption of raw and undercooked seafoods, may pose a health risk particularly for susceptible populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present work confirmed the antioxidant activity of the 
  <span class="italic">B persicum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E globulus</span>, and rose water. Also, 
  <span class="italic">B persicum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E globulus</span> essential oils and extracts had relatively high antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> spp. In addition, the essential oils can penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane, which causes a loss of the membrane permeability of the cellular membrane and leakage of the cytosolic materials. Therefore, it is suggested that the above extracts and essential oils used as a potential source of natural antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span>.
