A volume of 200 μL of the plant extracts (1 mg/mL) and essential oils was mixed with 2800 μL of the ferric reducing antioxidant power reagent. The absorbance was measured after 30-minute incubation at 37°C in dark condition at 593 nm. The values were calculated from a calibration curve obtained with FeSO
