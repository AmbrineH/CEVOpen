  </span> with some modifications. Bacteria from the working culture of 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> strains were collected by centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5000 rpm, washed 3 times, and resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution. Then, cell suspension obtained were incubated at 37Â°C under agitation for 4 hours in the presence of essential oils and extracts at MIC concentration. After that, 10 mL of samples were collected and centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 3 minutes. The concentration of the released components including especially of nucleic acids, 1 mL supernatant was used to measure ultraviolet absorption at 260 nm.
