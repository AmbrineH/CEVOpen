 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation of the phospholipids content under the effect of roasting is represented by 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. The control oil showed a content of 0.198%. The values obtained at the roasting temperatures of 75, 100, and 125°C did not differ significantly from that of the control oil. They increased significantly after roasting at temperatures of 150 (20 and 30 min) and 175°C (10, 20, and 30 min). The values also increased with the roasting time (0.447 and 0.756%, respectively, after 20 and 30 min at 150°C, and at 0.503, 0.855, and 1.370%, respectively, after 10, 20, and 30 min at 175°C). These results are in agreement with previous works carried out on safflower, rice germ, argan, pumpkin, and mustard seeds reporting an increase in phospholipids content as a function of temperature and/or duration of roasting [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>–
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. As for tocopherols, the increase in the phospholipids level could be explained by a better extractability following the destruction of almonds tissues by roasting.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have focused on the effects of roasting conditions on the physicochemical characteristics of edible oils. Significant changes in some characteristics such as color, aroma, fatty acid profile, and bioactive compounds have been reported [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. The heating of oil seeds also leads to the initiation of the oxidation of UFA and the loss of natural antioxidants. The natural antioxidants content strongly influences the oxidation stability of the oil during storage. In this regard, the tocopherols present the most effective antioxidants for reducing lipid oxidation in oils [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-tocopherol also has vitamin activity. Therefore, the roasting process at uncontrolled temperatures could induce a reduction in oxidative stability and a loss of nutritional value of the oil.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studies on the effects of roasting on the chemical composition and the oxidative stability of argan oil are not numerous. In addition, the temperature used by the authors remains relatively low (110°C) [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>, 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>] compared to works done on other oilseeds [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>, 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>], but also with regard to the temperatures applied for the traditional extraction of argan oil intended for commerce or for a familiar use. Indeed, the extraction of argan oil is mainly done using the artisanal process, especially in rural areas of southern Morocco. Almonds from the argan tree are roasted over a wood fire using a stove. They are then ground using a rotary arm grinding stone and the resulting paste is crushed by hand. The addition of small amounts of warm water facilitates the extraction of the oil [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. The argan oil obtained by this process is reputed to be poorly preserved [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>]. Indeed, high roasting temperatures, contact with the metal, and the addition of water are all factors for initiating the oxidation of the oil. In this regard, Mathaüs et al. reported that the traditional oil was characterized by negative sensory attributes after 12 weeks of storage [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. This result has been attributed in particular to the conditions of manual extraction practiced in the artisanal process. More recently, cooperatives producing argan oil use electric ovens for roasting and the extraction is carried out by press. This allowed an improvement in the quality of the oil compared to the artisanal process [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. Mathaüs et al. also noted an improvement in the oxidative stability and sensory quality of oil extracted from roasted almonds at 110°C for 30 min [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. These results were explained by a better extraction of antioxidants and the formation of Maillard reaction products during roasting. In fact, for the same temperature (110°C), other authors reported a significant increase in phospholipids content [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>] and a significant decrease in moisture [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. As for the content of FA and tocopherols, Harhar et al. did not report significant changes [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. However, the roasting time of 45 min (at 110°C) induced a reduction in the oxidative stability of the oil [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. This allowed these authors to conclude that 110°C/30 min (temperature/time) represents an optimal roasting condition for preserving the nutritional and the organoleptic properties of argan oil.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to better reproduce the roasting conditions used in the two argan oil extraction processes (artisanal and mechanical), we used temperatures between 75 and 175°C for periods of 10 to 30 min. Our results showed that PV and acidity increased with temperature and roasting time with maximum values reaching 175°C/30 min. With regard to tocopherols, the lowest levels were obtained after roasting at 175°C/10 min. The temperatures of 125° and 150°C induced a lower increase in PV and a lower reduction in the tocopherols content especially when the duration of roasting was limited to 10 min. These same conditions caused a significant increase in the browning index. From these results, it can be concluded that heating argan almonds at high temperatures is not recommended, even for short periods. Since the roasting of argan almonds is an important step for the development of the organoleptic characteristics of edible argan oil, particularly its aroma and color, it would be desirable to use temperatures between 125 and 150°C for duration of 10 min. Nevertheless, our study requires additional investigations to evaluate the oxidative stability of oils extracted from roasted almonds at different temperatures and times.</p>
