 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that the temperature and the duration of roasting (75 to 175°C, and 10 to 30 min, respectively) had little effect on the physicochemical characteristics of the argan oil. Similarly, the composition of FA was not modified by roasting whatever the temperature and the time used. However, the browning index increased significantly from 100°C, important decrease in the tocopherols content was recorded at 175°C, and significant increase in the phospholipids level was obtained from 150°C/20 min condition. These results make it possible to conclude that roasting at temperatures of 125-150°C for 10 min would allow the development of organoleptic characteristics without compromising the nutritional value and the oxidative stability of the oil.</p>
