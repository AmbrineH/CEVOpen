 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan oil extracted from the fruits of
  <span class="italic"> Argania spinosa</span> L. (Sapotaceae) has many nutritional, cosmetic, and therapeutic properties thanks to its richness in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and bioactive substances such as tocopherols and phytosterols [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. The cosmetic oil is extracted by mechanical press from unroasted almonds. As for the edible oil, it is extracted by press or in the traditional way by hand kneading roasted almonds. Roasting is usually carried out on the wood fire by constantly stirring the almonds until browning. It constitutes an important step in the development of the organoleptic characteristics of the oil, in particular the typical hazelnut aroma appreciated by the consumer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In industry, heating of oilseeds is carried out with the aim of increasing oil extraction yield, reducing seed moisture, and deactivating lipases and lipoxygenases which could induce fatty acids (FA) oxidation [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. The oxidation could lead to loss of nutritional value and decreased shelf life [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. The roasting of oilseeds could also improve the stability of vegetable oils by increasing the extraction yield of antioxidant substances [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. As regards the effect of roasting on the content of tocopherols which represent the major antioxidants of vegetable oils, the data from the literature are inconsistent. Depending on the nature and variety of oilseeds, roasting may lead to a decrease [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>–
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>] or an increase in tocopherols level in oil [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>–
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. Since tocopherols are thermosensitive, their final concentration in the oil will depend essentially on the temperature and the duration of the roasting.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of argan oil, the literature does not report studies of the impact of roasting on the chemical composition of the oil, with the exception of the study by Harhar et al. [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>] in which only the duration of the roasting was taken into consideration for a constant temperature of 110°C. The objective of this work was to evaluate the concomitant effects of the temperature and the duration of the roasting of the
  <span class="italic"> A. spinosa </span>almonds on the chemical composition of the oil. To do this, the roasting was carried out by combining temperatures of 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175°C with times of 10, 20, and 30 min. The chemical composition of the oil related to the content of fatty acids, tocopherols, and phospholipids. The physicochemical parameters considered were acidity, peroxide value (PV), absorbance at 232 nm (K232) and 270 nm (K270), and browning index (assessed by absorbance at 420 nm).
