 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of roasting on the initial physicochemical characteristics of the argan oil is presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. The acidity of 0.18 for the control oil increased significantly under the effect of the roasting whatever the temperature and the duration. The maximum values (0.28-0.3) were recorded for the temperature of 175°C. This result is consistent with previous works on pine nuts, colza, and sesame oils [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>–
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. The increase in acidity could be explained by the release of FA following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides which constitute the major components of vegetable oils. It could trigger reactions of oxidative degradation of the oil due to the prooxidative action of free FA [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PV was 0.1 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/Kg for the control oil. It significantly increased in oils extracted from almonds roasted at 125°C for 30 min, 150°C for 10 min, and at 175°C for 10, 20, and 30 min durations. PV is a parameter commonly used to evaluate the primary oxidation state of vegetable oils during technological treatments and storage. It reflects the content of hydroperoxides formed by oxidation of the UFA. In this regard, previous studies of rapeseed, sesame, and walnut seeds oils reported an increase in the PV of the oil with an increase in the roasting temperature of the seeds [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Our results showed that roasting at elevated temperatures resulted in oil oxidation which could affect its stability during storage.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">K232 reflects the content of conjugated dienes (CD) produced from the hydroperoxides of the UFA. K270 permits to evaluate the secondary oxidation products resulting from the decomposition of hydroperoxides [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. In our study, the K232 value of 0.844 for the control oil increased to 0.878, 0.896, and 0.906, respectively, under the 175°C/10 min, 75°C/30 min, and 100°C/10 min conditions and decreased to 0.814, 0.806, and 0.793, respectively, for the couples temperature (°C)/time (min) of 175/30, 100/20, and 75/10. The absorption at 270 nm also showed variations according to the roasting conditions. Overall, it increased from 0.041 to 0.062, respectively, at 150°C/30 min and 75°C/30 min conditions, compared to the control (0.054). Previous studies reported that increasing temperature and time of seed roasting led to an increase in K232 and K270 [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. The fluctuations of the CD contents recorded in this work would be due to the instability of these compounds which transform into secondary oxidation products. The increase in the K270 value indicates the formation of undesirable oxidation products such as carbonyl compounds. However, the values of acidity, PV, and K270 encountered under the various conditions of our work remained below the limits set by the Moroccan Standard NM 08.5.090 [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The absorbance at 420 nm increased significantly from 100°C with both time and temperature. These results are in agreement with data previously reported for other edible oils [

  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. The products of the Maillard reaction are also responsible for the development of the flavour of the edible argan oil. For this reason, roasting constitutes an important step in the edible oil production. Some derivatives of the Maillard reaction also afford numerous food safety benefits [
