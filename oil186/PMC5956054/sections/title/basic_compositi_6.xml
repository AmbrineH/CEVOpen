 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest protein content was found in faba bean, blue lupin and rapeseed press cake, while quinoa samples and whole dehulled buckwheat appeared to contain lower levels (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Our mean protein results for commercial whole faba bean and blue lupin samples are in accordance with earlier studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. However, Multari et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] obtained somewhat lower results for commercial faba bean flour and higher results for lupin flour than were found in the present study. Similar protein content of hemp and flaxseed is documented in the literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Furthermore, in line with our study lower protein levels have previously been found in buckwheat and quinoa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. It seemed that protein was mostly located in the outer layer of the buckwheat and quinoa seeds, while the opposite was found in the case of oil hemp. Protein content of plant foods is influenced by cultivar, environment and grade of processing which explains variabilities between various studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A great part of the total carbohydrates of whole lupin, hemp seed, and flaxseed as well as rapeseed press cake were constituted in fiber. Especially whole lupin contained a lot of insoluble fiber (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Whole faba bean contained 63.3 ± 0.5 g/100 g DW carbohydrates, of which 39% was fiber, also mostly insoluble. Buckwheat and quinoa contained lower levels of fiber and higher levels of other carbohydrates. Generally, our fiber results for lupin, hemp, flaxseed, buckwheat, quinoa, and faba bean are in accordance with earlier reports [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], while taking into account that partly different varieties and differently processed products were previously studied. However, the total fiber content of rapeseed press cake found in our study was much higher than the mean crude fiber content (11.6%) calculated by Lomascolo et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] from various studies. One reason for this discrepancy is that crude fiber method measures basically only cellulose and insoluble lignin. The remaining carbohydrates–after excluding the amount of dietary fiber–are mainly starch [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fat content of oil crops (hemp and flaxseed) was high (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These results are in accordance with the earlier data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The residual fat content of rapeseed press cake was quite high (10.4 ± 0.3 g/100 g DW) compared with earlier studies on rapeseed meal (2.5%, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]). This difference is probably caused by the fact that the material used in the present study was a crude press cake. In line with earlier reports [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] the other crops contained fewer than 10 g/100 g DW of fat.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ash content varied from &lt;0.2 to 7.6 ± 0.1 g/100 g DW among the samples (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Processing affects the nutrient content of commercial products. For example, pearled quinoa contained less protein, ash, fat and dietary fiber than whole quinoa, buckwheat bran contained more protein, fat, and ash than whole dehulled buckwheat, and grinded faba bean contained less dietary fiber than the whole faba bean. Hemp hulls contained more carbohydrates but less protein, fat and ash than the whole seed (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
