 <p>The present research aimed to study the chemical composition and acaricidal activity of
  <span class="italic"> Citrus limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Piper nigrum</span> essential oils against the cattle tick
  <span class="italic"> Rhipicephalus microplus</span>. GC-MS analysis of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil showed limonene (50.3%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (14.4%), and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-terpinene (11.7%) as the major components;
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> oil was mainly composed of 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene (26.2%), 
  <span class="italic">σ</span>-ocymene (5.8%), and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (5.5%). Acaricide activity was evaluated at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0% (v/v) of each plant oil, as well as 1 : 1 combination of both oils (5% : 5%, 2.5% : 2.5%, and 1.25% : 1.25% each), by immersing engorged
  <span class="italic"> R. microplus</span> females for one minute. The LC90 of oils from
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum, P. nigrum,</span> and the combination were 4.9%, 14.8%, and 5.1%, respectively.
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil caused 100% mortality of engorged females at the highest concentration (10%).
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> essential oil inhibited egg-laying by up to 96% in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting it reduces tick fecundity. When combined, the oils presented toxicity as to
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil alone, but with stronger inhibition of oviposition (5% : 5%), indicating a possible additive effect against
  <span class="italic"> R. microplus</span>. The present data provide support for further investigation of novel natural products to control bovine tick infestations.
