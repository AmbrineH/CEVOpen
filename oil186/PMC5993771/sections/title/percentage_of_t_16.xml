  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure-1</a> shows the effects of different treatments on total motility during the study period. Total motility represents the percentage of total moving spermatozoa regardless of the quality of the motility. When compared to the control group (Tris), statistically significant impact was observed in the different treatments (p&lt;0.001). At T0, no significant difference was observed between 87 μg/ml (R5, 89.84±3.64) and 8.7 μg/ml (R10, 98.12±0.16) treatments and the control group (Tris, 92.03±1.32). The highest concentration of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> essential oil (R, 870 µg/ml) showed the lowest motility percentage at 0 and 6 h and a total spermicidal effect at 24 h. After 48 h of chilling storage, 87 and 8.7 µg/ml concentrations expressed the highest motility with 71.4±2.05% and 74±6.49%, respectively.
