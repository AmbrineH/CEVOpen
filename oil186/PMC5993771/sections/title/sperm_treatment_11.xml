 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pooled sperm was diluted at 1/2 ratio at room temperature (18-22°C) in Tris extender (3.028 g of hydroxymethylaminomethane, 1.25 g of fructose, 1.7 g of citric acid, 800 Ul/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 1 mg/ml of streptomycin sulfate in 100 ml of distilled water) and then split into four equal aliquots. Each aliquot was diluted with Tris extender supplemented with 870, 87, or 8.7 µg/ml of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> essential oil, identified as treatments R, R5, and R10, respectively (26). Tris-based extender without any supplementation was considered as a control group. All samples were then stored at 4°C and analyzed at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h. The experimentation was repeated 6 times (n=6).
