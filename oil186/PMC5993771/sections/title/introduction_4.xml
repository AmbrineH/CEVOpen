 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent years witnessed, in poultry, a growing interest in wide ranges of natural products and plant extracts, especially about their positive effects on reproduction and fertility outputs [
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>-
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>]. Essential oils, when used particularly 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> as dietary supplementation, showed a remarkable potency in protecting and improving sperm parameters of several animal species [
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>-
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>]. However, when used 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, in humans as well in other animal species, essential evidenced spermicidal effects with impacts on gametes motility and plasma membrane integrity [
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>-
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> is known as a rich source of polyphenols and volatile oils including molecules such as carnosic, rosmarinic acids, and camphor [
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>-
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>]. These compounds display diverse biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties. In aged roosters, Borghei-Rad 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] reported that dietary supplementation with rosemary leaves powder improved significantly semen quality, fertility, and hatchability through fighting oxidative stress damages. Similarly, dietary supplementation using other antioxidants, including Vitamin E, selenium, Vitamin C, and enzymatic antioxidant systems, improved significantly animal health and sperm quality [
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>-
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sperm cells are known to be more vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during oxidative stress, than somatic cells due to gametes cell structure and their limited contents of antioxidants. In this respect, the phospholipidic fraction of spermatozoa cell membranes [
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>] is the first target of ROS with negative effects on membrane fluidity and the subsequent impairment of motility, acrosome reaction, and sperm-egg interaction [
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>,
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>]. Accordingly, high membrane concentration in PUFA makes sperm cells more susceptible to lipid peroxidation, especially, during the different stages of 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> storage at low temperatures compromising, thus fertility outputs [
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>,
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, in rooster, artificial insemination (AI) is routinely carried out after short-term storage at 4°C; however, reports evidenced that fertilizing capacity of freshly collected semen is dramatically lost after half an hour of collection [
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>]. Therefore, development of optimal semen extenders, including different active compounds, was considered worldwide by different research groups to protect sperm cells against motility damages. The adopted strategies consisted essentially of protecting cell membrane against cold shock and oxidative stress [
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>,
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this respect, numerous studies, using rosemary leaves extract, containing rich fractions of polyphenols, have reported positive effects on frozen semen in several species including boar [
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>], dog [
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>], and ram [
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>]. However, no protective effect was reported when using 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> essential oil, and recently, Elmi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a>] observed similar motilities when comparing the control to sperm treated 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> with 0.2 mg/ml of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> essential oil. Overall, all the reported data independently on the considered plant showed an obvious spermicidal activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, to the best of our knowledge, no previous records reported the usefulness of essential oils as protective factors during semen preservation at low temperatures. This study aimed to investigate the interest of 
  <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> essential oil in the preservation of rooster sperm motility during 4°C short-term storage.
