    <td align="left">Inexpensive and simplicity; allows for solvent reuse</td>
    <td align="left">Does not always uses benign solvents; frequently requires an evaporation/concentration step for recovery; usually demands large amounts of solvent and long extraction time; possibility of thermal degradation</td>

    <td align="left">Microwave processing</td>
    <td align="left">Reduced extraction time; reduced solvent usage; improved extraction yield; simple and inexpensive</td>

    <td align="left">Ultrasonication</td>
    <td align="left">Inexpensive, simple and efficient; can reduce the operating temperature (good for thermolabile compounds); can be used with any solvent</td>
    <td align="left">Its efficiency may be linked to the nature of plant matrix; the active part of ultrasound inside the extractor is restricted to a zone located in the vicinity of the ultrasonic emitter</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Supercritical fluid</td>
    <td align="left">Moderate extraction temperature (good for thermolabile compounds); rapid mass transfer (larger extraction rate); solubility of a chemical in a supercritical fluid can be manipulated; can eliminate concentration process; the solutes can be separated from supercritical fluids without losing volatiles due to its extreme volatility; additional filtration or centrifugation to remove solid residue is not necessary</td>
    <td align="left">Onerous operating conditions</td>
