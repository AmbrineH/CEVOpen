 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The open reading frame (ORF) cDNA sequence (1362 bp) of a ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (designated as 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>) was cloned from oil palm (
  <span class="italic">Elaeis guineensis</span> Jacq.) mesocarp based on that gene sequence from 
  <span class="italic">Elaeis oleifera</span> (GenBank accession: EU057620.1) using RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence is 100% identity with that from 
  <span class="italic">Elaeis oleifera</span>. It encodes a 453-amino acid polypeptide with the conserved domain of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (amino acids 1–443), which is predicted to be chloroplastic. The protein BLAST analysis of EgFAD8 showed that it shared high homology (more than 70%) with other members of the ω-3 desaturase enzyme family. Phylogenetic analysis of EgFAD8 with various fatty acid desaturases from model plant 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> revealed that EgFAD8 clusters with two chloroplastic ω-3 fatty acid desaturases AtFAD7 and AtFAD8, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum-type ω-3 fatty acid desaturase AtFAD3 (
