 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activity of EgFAD8 was determined by heterologous expression in 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">cerevisiae</span> supplemented with linoleic acid as substrate, which is absent in yeast. Yeast transformed with empty vector (pYES2) was used as negative control. The total fatty acid composition of yeast transformed with 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> or pYES2 was detected and analyzed. The result showed that yeast transformed with 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> produced a new fatty acid species 18:3 ω-3 (about 0.27 mol%) in yeast, but not presented in the negative control (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g003" href="#pone.0196693.g003">Fig 3</a>). Meanwhile, there was no obvious difference in the levels of other fatty acids between yeast transformed with 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> and the negative control pYES2 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g003" href="#pone.0196693.g003">Fig 3</a>). Therefore, the expression of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> in yeast could produce 18:3 using the supplemented 18:2.
