 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to generate a yeast expression construct, 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> fragments were digested with 
  <span class="italic">Kpn</span>I and 
  <span class="italic">Xba</span>I from pEASY vector, and subcloned into pYES2 vector. The construct EgFAD8-pYES2 and the control pYES2 were separately transformed into INVSc1 cells using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method [

  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref046">46</a>]. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-U) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. Three independent positive clones of each transformation were used for further expression studies.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precultures were made in 2 mL SC-U medium with 2% (w/v) raffinose and 1% (w/v) tergitol NP-40 (Sigma, USA), and were grown overnight at 30°C. For induction gene expression, appropriate amount of precultures were inoculated into 20 mL SC-U medium containing 2% (w/v) galactose and 50 μM linoleic acid at an OD
  <sub>600</sub> of 0.1. Yeast cultures were incubated for three days at 30°C under continuous agitation (250 rpm). Then the cells were harvested and washed twice with sterile deionized water before used for fatty acid analysis.
