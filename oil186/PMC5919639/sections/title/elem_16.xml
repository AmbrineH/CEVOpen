 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The transcript levels of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> in leaf and mesocarp at five different developmental stages were determined by RT-qPCR using 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-actin as an internal control. The results showed that the transcript level of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> in mesocarp was quite flat during ripening with a slight increase at the beginning (from P1 to P2,

  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> in mature leaves was at least twice that in mescoarp (
