 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In higher plants, fatty acids are synthesized 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> in the stroma of plastids through a complex series of condensation reactions to produce either C16 or C18 fatty acids. These fatty acids are then incorporated into the two glycerolipid synthetic pathways: the prokaryotic pathway and eukaryotic pathway [

  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref011">11</a>]. Chloroplast galactolipids contain substantial amounts of trienoic fatty acid, either the hexatrienoic acid (16:3) or 18:3, which may vary in different plant species [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref012">12</a>]. In both glycerol pathways, desaturation of fatty acids is performed by a series of membrane-bound desaturases of the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid desaturases are encoded by nuclear genes and differ in the substrate specificity and subcellular localization, and play critical roles in maintaining proper structure and cellular function of biological membranes [

Furhter desaturations are carried out by membrane-bound desaturases in the ER (FAD2 and FAD3) and the chloroplast (FAD4, FAD5, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8) as we mentioned before. FAD2 and FAD6 are ω-6 desaturases that synthesize linolenic acid (18:2) from oleic acid (18:1) by introduction of a double bond at the 12
  <span class="sup">th</span> position from carboxylic end or 6
  <span class="sup">th</span> position from the ω end in the ER and plastid, respectively. While, FAD3, FAD7, and FAD8 are ω-3 desaturases that desaturase 18:2 to 18:3 by inserting a double bond at the 15
  <span class="sup">th</span> position from the carboxylic end or 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> position from the ω end. Moreover, the
