  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantitative analysis of the essential oil was carried out using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 6,890 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m × 0.18 mm; 0.18 μm). The oven temperature was programmed to 50°C for 3.2 min, then heated to 300°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The temperatures of the injector and the flame ionization detector (FID) were maintained at 280°C. The essential oils were diluted in acetone to 3.5% (v/v) and injected in split mode (1/60); hydrogen was used as the carrier gas (1 ml/min), and the injection volume was 1 μl. At the same time, a solution of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>‐alkanes (C8‐C30) was analyzed under the same conditions to calculate retention indices (RI) using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation (Van Del Dool &amp; Kratz, 
   <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0021">1963</a>). The relative concentrations of the compounds were calculated from the peak area obtained by gas chromatography without using correction factors.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative analysis was performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 7,890 coupled to a Agilent mass spectrometer model 5975 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m × 0.18 mm; 0.18 μm). The oven temperature was 50°C and remained constant for 3.2 min; then, it was increased to 300°C at a rate of 8°C/min. The injector temperature was 280°C. Ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70 eV, and the electron multiplier was maintained at 2200 eV. The temperature of the ion source was 230°C. Mass spectral data were acquired in the scan mode in the range m/z 33–450. The flow of carrier gas (helium) was set at 0.9 ml/min; compound identification was made by comparison of their spectra and RI with those of libraries such as Adams (
