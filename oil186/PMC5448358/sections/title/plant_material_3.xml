 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plant material consisting of the aerial parts (stems, leaves, and flowering tops) and the roots was harvested. The samples were collected on the “plateau des cataractes” (District of Louingui, Pool Department, Republic of Congo) at three sites, Loufoulacari (L), Campus rural (C), and Sese (S), and during different period of the year 2015, february (f), may (m), july (j), november (n), and december (d). These harvest periods include periods of drastic reductions in rainfall, the dry season (may and june), and periods of heavy rainfall, the rainy season (november and december). The precipitation levels on the “plateau des Cataractes” are an average of 2 mm in the dry season and 250 mm in the rainy season. Moreover, the sites of Loufoulakari and rural Campus are on a clay ground, whereas the Sese site is located on a sandy soil.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the determination of the chemical composition, the plant material was dried in the shade for 8 days and then subjected to steam distillation. Indeed, from the sixth day, the loss of water reached a plateau, as is the case for many species of the Poaceae family (Silou et al.,
