 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of the aerial part is rich mainly in 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol, 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1 (7), 8‐dien‐2‐ol. The essential oil obtained from the roots is rich in aristolone and limonene. The content of these components varies depending on the harvest period. The residual water content is the most important factor that significantly influences the average yield of the essential oil and the content of the major constituents. Regarding the aerial part, a low residual water content of the plant material increases (1) the essential oil yield and (2) the content of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>‐p‐mentha‐2, 8‐dien‐1‐ol. For the roots, the samples that have a very low residual water content should provide extracts richer in aristolone. The combined effects of the extraction duration and the state of division, on the one hand, and the extraction duration, the state of division and the residual water content, on the other hand, greatly influence the extraction of aristolone. However, these interactions are complex and difficult to assess.
