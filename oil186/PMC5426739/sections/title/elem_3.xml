  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Three oils were prepared using olive: sesame: flaxseed in ratios of 65:30:5, 60:30:10 and 55:30:15 in triplicate. The oil mixtures were stored at 4 and 24°C for 90 days. Experiments were carried out on the production day and every 30 days. The fatty acid profile was determined on the first and 90
   <span class="sup">th</span> days.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The oil samples were placed in a series of 20 ml clear glass bottles incubated in a forced-draft air oven set at 65℃ for 10 days. The oxidation reaction was accelerated in the oil samples, and peroxide value was determined in triplicate after each 24 hours for 10 days.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> All parameters were measured in triplicate. Data obtained were analyzed by ANOVA using the SPSS statistical software (Chicago, IL, USA) in factorial experiments in completely randomized design, and the results were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three amounts. Duncan’s multiple range post hoc test was used to analyze significant differences at the 0.05 level.</p>
