 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five hundred grams (500 g) of fresh areal plant parts at flowering stage were blended with 4 L of distilled water and submitted to water-distillation in a modified Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h. After distillation, the collected oil was isolated from the water and dried over sodium sulfate (water free). Six replicate distillations were performed and the EO was stowed at 4 Â°C before analysis.</p>
