 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fungi samples were obtained from the Leibniz Institute (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). The fungal species tested in this study were 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span> DSM-5144, 
  <span class="italic">Rhizopus stolonifer</span> DSM-2194, 
  <span class="italic">Verticillium dahliae</span> DSM-11938, 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> DSM-1957, and 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</span> DSM-62146. The culture of fungal species was made on Potato-Dextrose-Agar (PDA) slants purchased from VWR (Strasbourg, France). The storage temperature was 4 °C. After 10 days of culture, the fungi spore were obtained, then blended with sterile distilled water to get a spore suspension of 1 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> spore/mL. The concentrations of EO solutions were reached from 0.1 to 3 mg/mL. The disc diffusion method [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00030">16</a>] was adopted to evaluate the antifungal activity. Five microliters (5 µL) of EO was used. Inhibition percent was obtained by Equation (3):

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MIC value was obtained from the equation of the line (% inhibition against concentration). The lower MIC value shows better antifungal activity. All antifungal results are the mean (±SEM) from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates.</p>
