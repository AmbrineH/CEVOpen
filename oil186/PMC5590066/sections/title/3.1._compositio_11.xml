 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yellow greenish EO isolated from French 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> aerial parts possessed a strong characteristic odor. The EO yield was 0.07% (Fresh weight), which is 5 t higher than reported for Indian origin (0.014%) [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00030">5</a>], 3 t lower than in Canadian samples (0.21%) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty-three compounds were identified in 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO amounting 96.3% of the total EO (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t001" href="#medicines-04-00030-t001">Table 1</a>). Oxygenated monoterpenes constituted the major part of the EO (40.7%), with camphor (12.8%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-chrysantenyl acetate (6.6%), terpinen-4-ol (4.70%), (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-
  <span class="italic">p</span>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol (4.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.0%) being its main components. Other quantitatively important fractions were hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (17%) and oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes (19.5%), germacrene-D (12.0%) and (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-nerolidol (7.3%) being the main components. The monoterpene part corresponded only to 15%, sabinene (6.7%) and β-pinene (3.4%) being its main constituents.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may be observed that the main components of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> analyzed in our study to some extent were comparable to those previously reported [

  <span class="italic">E</span>)-
  <span class="italic">p</span>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, (

  <span class="italic">p</span>-menthan-2-one, thymol acetate, (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-methyl isoeugenol, β-cedrene epoxide, and patchouli alcohol in the oil of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> analyzed in our study was considerably higher than in the previously studied yarrow oils. Camphor (up to 20%), α and β-thujones (up to 26.8%), 1,8-cineole (up to 20.3%), artemisia ketone (up to 10.1%), and chamazulene (up to 0.8%) were reported in 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil from France [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00030">12</a>], but the content of these compounds in our study was rather different; it contained 12.8% camphor, 4.5% (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-
  <span class="italic">p</span>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, 4.7% terpinen-4-ol, 4.0% 1,8-cineole, and 1.8% borneol, whereas artemisia ketone, thujones, and chamazulene were not detected.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A completely different 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> chemotype was reported in the Saguenay region around Quebec in Canada where the β-thujone was the main compound (13.8%) [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00030">6</a>]. The sesquiterpene alcohols spathulenol, (
  <span class="italic">Z</span>)-nerolidol, α-bisabolol, and (
  <span class="italic">E,E</span>)-farnesol were dominant constituents in the 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil from Iran [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00030">8</a>]. These results confirm that the chemical polymorphism is a characteristic feature of yarrow. The variations in the chemical profile of the 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil as a consequence of ontogenesis and organic differentiation were recently noted [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00030">19</a>]. The influence of ecological factors (climate, altitude, association, nutrients, etc.) seems to be an important factor; in addition to the like chemotype, variations in EO chemical composition could exist.
