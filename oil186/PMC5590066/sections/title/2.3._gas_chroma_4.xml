  <span class="italic">v</span>) and construed on a Clarus 500 (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Shelton, USA) gas chromatograph outfit with a fused-silica capillary column HP-5MS (5% diphenyl 95% dimethyl polydimethylsiloxane, 30 m length, 0.25 mm id, 0.25 µm film thickness (J&amp;W scientific, Folsom, CA). Flame ionization detector (FID) (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Shelton, CT, USA) was used. The importer gas was helium (1.3 mL/min flow). The injection volume was 0.5 µL. Injector temperature was 250 °C and under split mode at a ratio of 1:5. The temperature of FID was 250 °C. The furnace temperature was programmed at 60 °C for 5 min, grated to 250 °C at 5 °C/min and maintained at 250 °C for 5 min. The identification of compounds was built on retention indices (RI) qualified to C5-C18 n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France) and available literature data [

Results are the mean from at least three independent experiments performed in six replicates.
