  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yellow greenish EO isolated from French 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> aerial parts possessed a strong characteristic odor. The EO yield was 0.07% (Fresh weight), which is 5 t higher than reported for Indian origin (0.014%) [
   <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00030">5</a>], 3 t lower than in Canadian samples (0.21%) [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty-three compounds were identified in 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO amounting 96.3% of the total EO (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t001" href="#medicines-04-00030-t001">Table 1</a>). Oxygenated monoterpenes constituted the major part of the EO (40.7%), with camphor (12.8%),

   <span class="italic">p</span>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol (4.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.0%) being its main components. Other quantitatively important fractions were hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (17%) and oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes (19.5%), germacrene-D (12.0%) and (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-nerolidol (7.3%) being the main components. The monoterpene part corresponded only to 15%, sabinene (6.7%) and β-pinene (3.4%) being its main constituents.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may be observed that the main components of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> analyzed in our study to some extent were comparable to those previously reported [

   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> analyzed in our study was considerably higher than in the previously studied yarrow oils. Camphor (up to 20%), α and β-thujones (up to 26.8%), 1,8-cineole (up to 20.3%), artemisia ketone (up to 10.1%), and chamazulene (up to 0.8%) were reported in 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil from France [
   <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00030">12</a>], but the content of these compounds in our study was rather different; it contained 12.8% camphor, 4.5% (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-
   <span class="italic">p</span>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, 4.7% terpinen-4-ol, 4.0% 1,8-cineole, and 1.8% borneol, whereas artemisia ketone, thujones, and chamazulene were not detected. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A completely different 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> chemotype was reported in the Saguenay region around Quebec in Canada where the β-thujone was the main compound (13.8%) [
   <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00030">6</a>]. The sesquiterpene alcohols spathulenol, (
   <span class="italic">Z</span>)-nerolidol, α-bisabolol, and (
   <span class="italic">E,E</span>)-farnesol were dominant constituents in the 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil from Iran [
   <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00030">8</a>]. These results confirm that the chemical polymorphism is a characteristic feature of yarrow. The variations in the chemical profile of the 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil as a consequence of ontogenesis and organic differentiation were recently noted [
   <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00030">19</a>]. The influence of ecological factors (climate, altitude, association, nutrients, etc.) seems to be an important factor; in addition to the like chemotype, variations in EO chemical composition could exist.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. AA of EO Against Sunflower Oil Oxidation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plant oils containing sensitive to oxidative degradation unsaturated fatty acids have been widely used as substrates for testing AA. The ability of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO to protect the sunflower oil was evaluated by comparing with synthetic antioxidant BHT in Oxipres apparatus. The effect of additives was expressed as a protection factor (PF) indicating the increase in sunflower oil stability (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t002" href="#medicines-04-00030-t002">Table 2</a>). The addition of 0.2% of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO increased the stability of sunflower oil about 1.5 t (the IP of sunflower oil without additives was 2.9 h). 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil prolonged the IP of sunflower oil oxidation depending on the concentration; the highest concentration of additive (0.2%) was more effective than BHT applied at 0.02% (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t002" href="#medicines-04-00030-t002">Table 2</a>). AA of other EO plant species in sunflower oil was previously evaluated by the Oxipres method; for instance, 
   <span class="italic">Calamintha grandiflora</span> applied at 0.2% demonstrated PF of 1.63 [
   <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00030">20</a>]. In conclusion, 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO stabilized the oxidation of sunflower oil. This stability of oil rose with the added amounts of EO.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Antibacterial Activity of EO</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antibacterial effect of EO was evaluated in vitro against nine pathogenic bacteria species (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t003" href="#medicines-04-00030-t003">Table 3</a>). Gram-positive bacteria were more delicate to the EO than Gram-negative bacteria. 
   <span class="italic">B. cereus</span> was the most susceptible bacteria to 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil at the applied concentrations (5 and 10 µg/mL). The smallest inhibition zones were obtained in 
   <span class="italic">S. typhimurium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">S. agona</span> cultures while 
   <span class="italic">St. epidermidis, S. enteritidis</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> were resistant against all concentrations of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil. MIC for 
   <span class="italic">B. cereus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">St. aureus</span> were 100 and 120 µg/mL, respectively; while the MIC for 
   <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> was 310 µg/mL. Among the Gram-negative tested bacteria, a remarkable antibacterial effect was observed only for 
   <span class="italic">S. typhimurium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">S. agona</span> with their respective MIC values 2000 and 1000 µg/mL. The effect of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil from Turkey [
   <a rid="B3-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-medicines-04-00030">3</a>] was also tested against 
   <span class="italic">St. aureus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B. cereus</span>; it was found that the MIC was 72 mg/mL, which is remarkably higher than the MIC of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil measured in our study. As was shown, the composition of 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oils from various locations may be rather different. The properties and the content of individual constituents may have an important power on the antibacterial effect of oil against different bacteria species. For instance, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, which were abundant in 
   <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> oil studied in this work, are well-known natural chemicals with antibacterial potentials [
   <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00030">21</a>]. The EO also studied in our work also contained 12% of germacrene-D and 7.3% of (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-nerolidol, which were absent in the Turkish oil. The antibacterial activities of germacrene-D and (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-nerolidol were previously reported as well [
