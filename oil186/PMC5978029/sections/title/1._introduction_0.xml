 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a calcium phosphate compound and the best known biomaterial in terms of its morphological and compositional similarity with human hard tissue. From a thermodynamic point of view, hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate with regard to the physiological conditions of the human body, including temperature, body fluids composition and human pH. The outstanding properties of HAp nanopowders, such as their biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity and nontoxicity, have been demonstrated [

  <sub>6</sub>(OH)
  <sub>2</sub>) resemble, in the most favorable way, the natural biological apatite found in bone. Therefore, it is of interest in medicine and biomedical engineering for bone regeneration and dental applications. As a result of its biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite can be used for coating metal prostheses or dental implants, which is favorable for a successful osteointegration process. On the other hand, it is well known that the risk of postoperative infections [

  <a rid="B4-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-materials-11-00652">4</a>] can be drastically reduced by incorporating antibacterial agents in the chemical structure of hydroxyapatite.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are complex biostructures, and contain a lot of chemical compounds from different chemical classes: terpenoids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters, either saturated or with different levels of unsaturation, their chemical composition depending on the plantâ€™s origin and quality, harvest time, climate, soil and especially extraction process [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils have been used since ancient times. Over the years, EOs have been approved for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, perfumery and food and medicine industries, and are some of the most commonly used natural products. On the other hand, aromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine, argues that essential oils can be particularly active healing remedies with specific actions for various maladies. Moreover, they can be a natural alternative to synthetic drugs, which produce countless side effects. Today, by combining science with ancient wisdom, we can gain a deeper understanding of and, at the same time, access to the therapeutic benefits that essential oils possess [
  <a rid="B8-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-materials-11-00652">8</a>]. The essential oils of basil and lavender are among the best known because of their applicability in various fields of activity. Lavender EOs contains volatile molecules of particular interest to the cosmetics industry, perfumes and aromatherapy, while basil EOs are commonly used in the food industry.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, because of the excessive use of antibiotics, bacteria and viruses are becoming more resistant to drugs. On the other hand, viruses and bacteria have changed a lot over time, and antibiotics cannot treat most of the diseases they cause. Even if bacteria adapt and become resistant to antibiotics, medical and pharmaceutical specialists are trying to find new products that can be used to develop medicines to fight back against pathogens. More than that, chemically synthetized drugs present a certain toxicity and involve a potential risk to humans. In this context, researchers are continuously trying to find new molecules to fight against bacterial strains.</p>

  <a rid="B8-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-materials-11-00652">8</a>] have shown that essential oils are encouraging for use in medicine and biomedical applications due to their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties and their ability to prevent the growth of different pathogens.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this context, the results presented in this paper evidence the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities of hydroxyapatite-lavender essential oil (HAp-L) and hydroxyapatite-basil essential oil (HAp-B) nanocomposites. The morphology of the surfaces of the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with essential oils was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The influence of the basil and lavender essential oils on the molecular structure of the HAp was investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements. The antibacterial effect of hydroxyapatite coated with basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) essential oil nanopowders (pressed into pellets) against Gram-positive (MRSA,
