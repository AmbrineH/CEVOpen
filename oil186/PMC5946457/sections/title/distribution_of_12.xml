 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Being submicron sized systems, ME/NEs exhibit prolonged circulation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. A major portion of orally administered ME/NEs undergo intestinal lymphatic absorption followed by biodistribution and finally ended up with lymphatic drainage to capillaries. An extent of the biodistributed drug is affected by the macrophages of liver, spleen, and lungs with the result of RES uptake [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. HCO-60, a pharmaceutically modified castor oil in conjugated linoleic acid microemulsion was effective as co-surfactant against RES uptake [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. Combination of carriers such as capmul and myvacet oil used thereof in particulate systems accounts largely for biodistribution of emulsified systems [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>]. A potential intestinal P-gp inhibitor tween 80 was also reported to produce higher indinavir distribution levels in plasma. However, highly hydrophilic drug undergo rapid uptake by organs of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) lead to lowering of drug levels [
