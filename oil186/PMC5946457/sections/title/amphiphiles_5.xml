 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to typical structural significance, amphiphiles reduce the interfacial tension and impart thermodynamic stability in dispersions. Droplet size of hetero-dispersions is affected by HLB value, type, and concentration of surfactant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Surfactants with high HLB (12–18) are suitable candidates for ME/NE’s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], since their ability to form smaller droplets within the GI lumen that enables the absorption maxima. In contrast, at higher concentrations, surfactants hamper the absorption process due to increased apparent weight on whole [

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Being nonionic, polysorbate is less toxic and unaffected by changes in pH, ionic strength and promotes the formation of ultrafine droplets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] whereas, poloxamers display aggregation with Ostwald ripening. But in combination with ionic surfactants, due aggregation of poloxamers is minimized by imparting a positive charge on the surface. A similar principle was noticed in a binary mixture of DDAB and C12E5 DDAB (cationic –nonionic) surfactants which had no obvious effect on droplet structure and size, although it improved the stability of nanoemulsion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Hence, the nonionic surfactants are considered to be stable in the design of ME/NEs and their subtypes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Tween 80, cremophor EL and cremophor RH40 had proven their superiority on digestion and increased absorption by inhibiting the efflux transporters such as p-gp, breast cancer resistance protein and MDR-protein [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. A recent success of amphiphiles was portrayed with a combination of Gelucire®, sucrose ester, a non-digestable surfactant. The substitution of the non-digestible surfactants with digestible surfactants, sucrose esters S-1670 and Span® 60, eliminated the digestion lag time with no change in the formation of colloidal structures [
