 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the advent of several emerging novel chemical entities, delivery of high molecular weight and poorly soluble bioactive molecules remains a challenging task. Therapeutic efficacy of low soluble molecules (BCS Class II and IV) is generally high and hence the design of oral delivery systems with improved dissolution and permeability characteristics cannot be ignored [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] However, poor solubility characters pose greater inter/intra subject variabilities and dose disproportionalities. Yet, most of the novel strategies still remain open for developing versatile oral drug delivery systems since the route of administration is salient [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. However, development of stable and acceptable dosage forms for lipophilic drugs is an ever challenging task for the researchers.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In times of yore, many attempts were made to deliver lipophilic/hydrophobic moieties for better therapeutic outcomes. Of late, Oral Emulsified Lipid Delivery Systems (OELDS) was instigated with sulphonamide lipid emulsions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. In such systems, incorporation of poorly water-soluble drugs into the inert core of carriers composed of oils, surfactants, and cosolvents, enables them to solubilize in GI fluids by forming a colloidal dispersion. Microemulsions, nanoemulsions, Self Microemulsifying/Nano emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SMEDDS/SNEDDS), Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN’s), Nanoparticulate lipid structures (NLS) are recognized as frontline approaches in OELDS [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Amongst these, particulate micro/nanoemulsified systems are particularly germane to communication are fundamental approaches for revolutionary strategies have gained good research due to their potentials in increasing both lymphatic and portal circulation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Nevertheless, therapeutic outcomes of OELDS are affected by particle/droplet size, the rate of dispersion, emulsification time and precipitation of drug in GIT. Moreover, dietary edible oils which exhibit typical food effect on absorption of drugs owing to structural and functional similarities with that of the physiological lipids, offer better tolerance.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the potential considerations of ME/NEs as an appealing substitute, the review was undertaken to emphasize typical biopharmaceutical aspects of oral absorption, including enzymes, transporters, and carriers involved therein. Distribution and elimination attributes of ME/NEs are also discussed here. Although both the emulsified particulate systems differ in droplet size, composition, and physicochemical properties, there is a firm connection in their in-vivo performance. Therefore, both the emulsion systems and their subtypes, self-micro/nano emulsifying drug delivery systems are explicated together.</p>

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings of Hoar and Schulman in 1940’s have led to the concept of the microemulsion, which formed a clear homogenous fluid of milky emulsion with hexanol. Later, the term microemulsion was coined by Schulman in 1959 based on the droplet size (100–600 nm). Since then the term has modified and defined, according to, on many occasions [

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Micro/nanoemulsions (ME/NEs) share the similarities in definition, as they are isotropic, homogenous liquid systems composed of oil, amphiphile and water contents, very often included with a modifier like cosurfactant or cosolvent [

Unfortunately, these emulsified lipid systems are used as misnomers on several occasions but they differ majorly in terms of droplet size. Nanoemulsions as dispersed oil droplets with 10–100 nm radii are thermodynamically non-equilibrium and kinetically stable systems [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Microemulsion composed of high amphiphile concentration (&gt; 20%) offers thermodynamic stability. The relative size of ME/NEs droplets accounts for their optical transparency, translucence, and stability [

The release of encapsulated functional components from ME/NEs is potentiated by trigger mechanisms such as pH, ionic strength, temperature and presence of enzymes.

   <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particulate emulsified delivery systems are being gradually more used to protect bioactives against the intense environment, to improve molecular targets, stability and to increase bioavailability. Molecular action of selected lipophilic drugs when associated with oil core or amphiphiles of the ME/NE systems is ascribed to transfer the drug molecules into the targeted cells by fusion of oil droplet with the cell membranes through lipid exchange or by endocytosis of the oil droplets [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. If the targeting moieties (folate, thiamine, etc.) with corresponding cell surface receptors are anchored to ME/NEs to adapt multifunctional property, they can directly target a tissue of interest and remain longer at the disease site to allow the total transfer of the drug molecules. Different molecules owned by anti-inflammatory agents, insulin, cancer etc., were rationalized herein.

   <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential PUFA transporters of an abluminal membrane of the endothelial cells of BBB allowed the CNS acting essential PUFA (omega-3 and omega-6), a lipophilic moiety into the brain [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>]. Nonionic surfactants (tween 80 and poloxamer) augmented brain targeting essential PUFA through lipoprotein receptor-mediated uptake owing to the affinity of apolipoprotein E for LDL receptor in the BBB enabled uptake by RME (receptor-mediated endocytosis). In another instance, enhanced brain uptake of doxorubicin resulted with drug- loaded MEs with principal interaction of ME entities with plasma apolipoprotein A–I facilitated scavenger receptor in BBB endothelium [

   <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Curcumin encapsulated by a combination of cationic surfactants such as cetyl and dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide was found to be intact even against alkaline hydrolysis [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>] and bioaccessible with use of triacylglycerols (medium chain) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>]. Polymeric micelles of curcumin were bestowed with over 55-fold increase in bioavailability [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>]. In similar lines, tamoxifen loaded NEs (size &lt; 47 nm) inhibited cell proliferation 20-fold greater and increased cell apoptosis 4-fold greater in the HTB-20 breast cancer cell line [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>].

   <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oral administration of ME of cyclosporine A resulted in increased bioavailability with not many side effects in hepatic impaired patients [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>] and stable plasma drug concentrations were maintained in renal impaired patients [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. Oral application of carvedilol loaded NEs has displayed two-fold faster release profile and several folds increase in C
    <sub>max</sub> and AUC [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>]. Thus the particulate emulsified systems are proven to be superior in the treatment of certain ailments though they were orally administered.
