 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings of Hoar and Schulman in 1940’s have led to the concept of the microemulsion, which formed a clear homogenous fluid of milky emulsion with hexanol. Later, the term microemulsion was coined by Schulman in 1959 based on the droplet size (100–600 nm). Since then the term has modified and defined, according to, on many occasions [

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Micro/nanoemulsions (ME/NEs) share the similarities in definition, as they are isotropic, homogenous liquid systems composed of oil, amphiphile and water contents, very often included with a modifier like cosurfactant or cosolvent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] to constitute stability. Unfortunately, these emulsified lipid systems are used as misnomers on several occasions but they differ majorly in terms of droplet size. Nanoemulsions as dispersed oil droplets with 10–100 nm radii are thermodynamically non-equilibrium and kinetically stable systems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Microemulsion composed of high amphiphile concentration (&gt; 20%) offers thermodynamic stability. The relative size of ME/NEs droplets accounts for their optical transparency, translucence, and stability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Owing to sub-micron droplet size, the solubility of lipophilic drugs is enhanced and fortified with intra-luminal processing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The release of encapsulated functional components from ME/NEs is potentiated by trigger mechanisms such as pH, ionic strength, temperature and presence of enzymes. It is characterized in terms of increase in concentration in the continuous phase or target location such as the mouth, nose, stomach, or gastrointestinal tract with the function of time [

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ME/NEs including SMEDDS and SNEDDS are strategically significant due to the protection of lipophilic drugs against degradation in GIT, translocation across epithelial barriers by extending transit time and specified absorptive pathways. Performance of ME/NEs is typically depended on the class/type of system and composition [
