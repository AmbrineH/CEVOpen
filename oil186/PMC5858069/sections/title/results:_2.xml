 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the four essential oils had antibacterial effects on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span>, and ZT had the greatest antibacterial activity. Assessment of the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone showed higher antibacterial activity of PF and ZT than that of chlorhexidine. The MIC and MBC of ZT showed that the antimicrobial activity of ZT against 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> was greater than that of other plants evaluated in this study.
