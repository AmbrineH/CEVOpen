 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of experiments was conducted to assess the level of toxicity of the SoEO on the seed germination, hypocotyl and root lengths and fresh weights of 
  <span class="italic">T. aestivum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">R. sativus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. lycopersicum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. foenum-graecum</span> (Figure 2
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a> and 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">(Fig. 3)</a>). The SoEO affected the germination and the seedling growth of tested seeds in a different way. Although the level of the major compounds in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis </span>was closed to those of other
  <span class="italic"> Salvia </span>species, the interaction between seed species and treatments (with or without SoEO) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). The SoEO did not statistically inhibit the germination of all tested seeds (Figure 2
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data disagree with the literature on inhibitory activity exerted by essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia </span>species on seed germination (Mancini et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]; Muller and Muller, 1964[
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">37</a>]; Singh et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>]). Significant interactions (p &lt; 0.05) between seed species and treatments (with or without SoEo) were also noted in radicle and hypocotyl lengths and weights (Figure 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">(Fig. 3)</a>). Indeed, radicle length and hypocotyl length of 
  <span class="italic">T. aestivum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. foenum-graecum</span> seeds were significantly inhibited by the SoEO, while stimulation was observed on 
  <span class="italic">S. lycopersicum </span>and 
  <span class="italic">R. sativus </span>seeds, in comparison to untreated seeds. Fresh weight of roots and hypocotyls of 
  <span class="italic">T. aestivum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. foenum-graecum</span> also decreased by the SoEO, compared to the untreated seeds (Figure 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">(Fig. 3)</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibition of seedling growth could be attributed to camphor and 1,8-cineole, the main compounds of the SoEO
  <span class="italic">, </span>which are potent inhibitors of oxygen uptake by mitochondrial suspensions (Romagni et al., 2000[
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">44</a>]). Moreover, several monoterpenoids of the SoEO, including linalool (Singh et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>]), α-pinene (Singh et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>]) and limonene (Singh et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>]) are potent inhibitors of seedling growth. Previous studies have documented that essential oil and their constituents induce oxidative stress and inhibit root growth (Singh et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>], 2009[
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">49</a>]; Mutlu et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">38</a>]). They reported an enhancement of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide accumulation and an increase of electrolyte leakage in root tissue (Singh et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">49</a>]; Mutlu et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">38</a>]). However, the SoEO does not cause any inhibitory effect on root and hypocotyl elongation and fresh weight on
  <span class="italic"> S. lycopersicum</span> seeds. López-Iglesias et al. (2014[
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">30</a>]) suggested that enhanced plant growth/plant growth inhibition, could be the result of a positive or negative balance between nutrient and polyphenol concentration. Santana-Méridas et al. (2014[
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">46</a>]) reported a stimulating effect of rosemary residues on 
  <span class="italic">L. sativa </span>and a moderate phytotoxic effect of 
  <span class="italic">L. perenne</span>. The phytotoxic effects of the SoEO appeared to be species seeds-dependent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that 
  <span class="italic">S.officinalis </span>essential oil from Eastern Center of Tunisia showed a high variation in its chemical composition compared to those isolated from other country regions. Moderate antioxidant activity of SoEO was demonstrated. This oil exhibited promising antimicrobial and antifungal activities and seems to have a potent fumigant activity against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera pests. Both phytotoxic and stimulating effects on 
  <span class="italic">T. aestivum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">R. sativus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. lycopersicum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. foenum-graecum</span> radicle and hypocotyl growth were observed. The high biological activities of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis </span>could be attributed to the components identified by GC-MS analysis. All those results valorize Tunisian 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> as a medicinal plant which can be a source of biological active compounds. Therefore, Tunisian 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis </span>essential oil could be used as a natural agent in pest management, in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
