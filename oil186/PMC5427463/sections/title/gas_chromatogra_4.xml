 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative amounts of the SoEO individual constituents were estimated using a Hewlett Packard 5890 II GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and HP-5 MS capillary column (5 % phenyl/95 % dimethylpolysiloxane: 30 m × 0.25 mm, 
  <span class="italic">i.d.,</span> 0.25 μm film thickness). Injector and detector temperature were set at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was kept at 50 °C for 1 min, then gradually raised to 230 °C at 10 °C/min and subsequently, held isothermal for 5 min. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 38.5 cm/ sec and a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The sample was diluted in hexane and 1 µL was injected manually into the system. Quantitative data acquisition of the individual components was electronically obtained from FID area percent data.
