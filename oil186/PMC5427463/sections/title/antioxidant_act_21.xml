 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values (the concentration reducing 50 % of DPPH) obtained for scavenging activity on DPPH radical are shown in Table 2
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T2" href="#T2">(Tab. 2)</a>. According to the recorded results, SoEO exhibited a good antioxidant power with an IC
  <sub>50 </sub>of 6.7 mg/mL but relatively lower than the synthetic antioxidant BHT used as positive control (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 3.2 µg/mL). The reducing power and the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation of SoEO showed a mild to moderate activity compared to the positive controls (Table 2
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T2" href="#T2">(Tab. 2)</a>). It seems that the antioxidant activity of sage oil is due to the presence of monoterpenes such as α-pinene, a known potent antioxidant (Wang et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">56</a>]) and several sesquiterpenes (Tamil Selvi et al., 2015[
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">52</a>]) and it is assumed that the contribution of minor and major compounds exhibited this activity and not only one or few active molecules (Wang et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">56</a>]).
