   <span class="italic">Candida dubliniensis</span> (CBS 8501, ATCC 8500), and 
   <span class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</span> (ATCC 4344), were determined. In addition, the antifungal activities of the essential oil against 24 clinical isolates of yeasts identified by polymerase chain reactionâ€“restriction fragment length polymorphism were also examined. The antifungal susceptibility of clinical isolates of the tested fungi were examined by microdilution and disk diffusion methods, and fluconazole was used as positive control in the same experimental conditions. The antibacterial activities of the essential oil against standard species of 
   <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC 25923), 
   <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</span> (ATCC11700),

   <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> collected from the Dr Faghihi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) were also determined in this study.
