 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> possesses proper broad spectrum of antibacterial effects and antifungal activities. So this essential oil may be applied in design of novel antimicrobial agents according to these effects. Furthermore, nowadays rise of microbe resistance are considerable and natural products could be appropriate candidates to overcome this problem.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More researches are needed to determine the active therapeutic compounds and their mechanisms of action. Also, in vivo potential of these essential oils alone or in combination with current antimicrobial agents in animal models could be investigated in future studies.</p>
