 <p>Resistance of many pathogens to available drugs is a global challenge and is leading to growing interest in natural alternative products. In this study, chemical composition and in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> were investigated. The chemical constituents of essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">S mirzayanii</span> were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution. The main identified compounds were 1,8-cineole (41.2 ± 1.3%), linalool acetate (11.0 ± 0.5%), and α-terpinyl acetate (6.0 ± 0.4%) (mL of essential oil/g of plant material). The MIC
  <sub>95</sub> were 0.03 to 0.5 µL/mL and 16 to 128 µL/mL for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. These results indicated that 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> essential oil significantly inhibited the growth of standard and clinically isolated tested yeasts by MIC
  <sub>50</sub> 0.03 to 1 µL/mL. Potent antibacterial and antifungal activities of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> essential oil may be considered in future study, particularly against antibiotic-resistant cases.
