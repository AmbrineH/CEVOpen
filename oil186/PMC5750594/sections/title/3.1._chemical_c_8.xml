 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clear pale yellow oleoresin essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> was obtained in 0.3% yield and analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. From a total of 56 peaks, 99.6% of the compounds were identified in the oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t002" href="#medicines-04-00070-t002">Table 2</a>). The major components of the resin oil were identified as δ-3-carene (47.9%), α-pinene (4.0%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), α-terpineol (5.5%) and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymen-8-ol (4.8%) (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f001" href="#medicines-04-00070-f001">Figure 1</a>). δ-3-Carene has been reported as a major component in several 
  <span class="italic">Protium</span> spp. oleoresin essential oils, including 
  <span class="italic">P. decandrum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</span> [
  <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00070">15</a>]; however, in most oleoresin essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">Protium</span>, δ-3-carene is a minor component or unobserved (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" href="#medicines-04-00070-t001">Table 1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Protium</span> oleoresin oils show wide variation in chemical composition, depending on species as well as age and color of the resin (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" href="#medicines-04-00070-t001">Table 1</a>). The age of an oleoresin has a distinct effect on the chemical composition. Some monoterpenes have been found to undergo oxidation upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen [
  <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00070">33</a>,
  <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00070">34</a>,
  <a rid="B35-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-medicines-04-00070">35</a>], including oleoresin monoterpenoids [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00070">20</a>]. In addition, fresh oleoresin from the same species shows wide variation in chemical composition. Thus, for example, the essential oil from fresh oleoresin of 
  <span class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</span> collected from the Restinga of Carapebus, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, had myrcene (35.0%) and α-pinene (27.0%) as the major components [
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00070">10</a>]; the fresh resin oil from Reserva da Campina, Amazonas, Brazil, was rich in 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (36.0%), α-terpinene (18.0%), and γ-terpinene (12.0%) [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00070">23</a>]; and the fresh resin oil from Crato, Ceara, Brazil was dominated by terpinolene (28.5%), α-phellandrene (16.7%), and limonene (16.9%) [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00070">24</a>]. The oleoresin in this present work is a relatively fresh resin, reflected in the high concentration of δ-3-carene.
