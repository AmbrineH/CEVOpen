  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> oil was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 amu, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s. GC equipped with a Restek B-Dex 325 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film) (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA). Oven temperature was started at 50 °C, and then gradually raised to 120 °C at 1.5 °C/min. The oven was then raised to 200 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 5 min. Helium was the carrier gas and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min. The sample was diluted 3%
