  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Chemical Composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clear pale yellow oleoresin essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> was obtained in 0.3% yield and analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. From a total of 56 peaks, 99.6% of the compounds were identified in the oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t002" href="#medicines-04-00070-t002">Table 2</a>). The major components of the resin oil were identified as δ-3-carene (47.9%), α-pinene (4.0%), 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), α-terpineol (5.5%) and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-cymen-8-ol (4.8%) (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f001" href="#medicines-04-00070-f001">Figure 1</a>). δ-3-Carene has been reported as a major component in several 
   <span class="italic">Protium</span> spp. oleoresin essential oils, including 
   <span class="italic">P. decandrum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</span> [
   <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00070">15</a>]; however, in most oleoresin essential oils from 
   <span class="italic">Protium</span>, δ-3-carene is a minor component or unobserved (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" href="#medicines-04-00070-t001">Table 1</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Protium</span> oleoresin oils show wide variation in chemical composition, depending on species as well as age and color of the resin (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" href="#medicines-04-00070-t001">Table 1</a>). The age of an oleoresin has a distinct effect on the chemical composition. Some monoterpenes have been found to undergo oxidation upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen [
   <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00070">33</a>,
   <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00070">34</a>,
   <a rid="B35-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-medicines-04-00070">35</a>], including oleoresin monoterpenoids [
   <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00070">20</a>]. In addition, fresh oleoresin from the same species shows wide variation in chemical composition. Thus, for example, the essential oil from fresh oleoresin of 
   <span class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</span> collected from the Restinga of Carapebus, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, had myrcene (35.0%) and α-pinene (27.0%) as the major components [
   <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00070">10</a>]; the fresh resin oil from Reserva da Campina, Amazonas, Brazil, was rich in 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (36.0%), α-terpinene (18.0%), and γ-terpinene (12.0%) [
   <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00070">23</a>]; and the fresh resin oil from Crato, Ceara, Brazil was dominated by terpinolene (28.5%), α-phellandrene (16.7%), and limonene (16.9%) [
   <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00070">24</a>]. The oleoresin in this present work is a relatively fresh resin, reflected in the high concentration of δ-3-carene.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Enantiomeric Distribution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chiral GC-MS analysis was performed to evaluate the enantiomeric distribution of the monoterpenes present in 
   <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> essential oil (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t003" href="#medicines-04-00070-t003">Table 3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f002" href="#medicines-04-00070-f002">Figure 2</a>). The levorotatory (−)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was found to be the exclusive stereoisomer while the (−)-enantiomers of α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene predominated over the (+)-isomers. The (+)-enantiomers of limonene and α-terpineol, on the other hand, were dominant. The hexane root extract of 
   <span class="italic">Angelica archangelica</span> showed predominantly (+)-δ-3-carene, but the (−)-enantiomer was detected [
   <a rid="B36-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-medicines-04-00070">36</a>]. Only the (+)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was detected in 
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> (Pinaceae) essential oils, while (−)-limonene predominated [
   <a rid="B37-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-medicines-04-00070">37</a>]. The (+)-enantiomer of limonene is the more common, especially in 
   <span class="italic">Citrus</span> (Rutaceae) essential oils [
   <a rid="B38-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-medicines-04-00070">38</a>,
   <a rid="B39-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-medicines-04-00070">39</a>,

   <a rid="B42-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-medicines-04-00070">42</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">Micromeria fruticosa</span> (Lamiaceae) essential oil showed exclusively (+)-α-terpineol while (−)-α-terpineol was found in 
   <span class="italic">Laurus nobilis</span> (Lauraceae) essential oil [
   <a rid="B43-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-medicines-04-00070">43</a>]. Analysis of the essential oil from the unripe fruits of 
   <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> showed a predominance of (+)-α-pinene, (+)-limonene, (+)-β-pinene, and exclusively (−)-α-terpineol [
   <a rid="B44-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-medicines-04-00070">44</a>]. Although δ-3-carene was relatively abundant in this oil (2.7%), the enantiomeric distribution was unfortunately not reported. The oleoresin of 
   <span class="italic">Boswellia carterii</span> (Burseraceae) from Ethiopia was composed of (+)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene, but the enantiomeric distribution of δ-3-carene was not determined [
   <a rid="B45-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-medicines-04-00070">45</a>]. In contrast, 
   <span class="italic">B. carterii</span> resin oil from Somalia showed (−)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating, while 
   <span class="italic">B. sacra</span> resin oil from Oman had (+)-α-thujene, (+)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Antifungal Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oleoresin essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> demonstrated antifungal activity against 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, 
   <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">A. niger</span>. 
   <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span> was most potently inhibited with a promising MIC of 156 μg/mL. Inhibition of 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> (MIC = 313 μg/mL) was also rather promising whereas inhibition of 
   <span class="italic">A. niger</span> was relatively weak (MIC = 1250 μg/mL). The major component in 
   <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> oil, δ-3-carene, has shown antifungal activity against several fungi, including 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> [
   <a rid="B47-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-medicines-04-00070">47</a>]. In addition, minor monoterpenoid components in the oil, α-pinene [
   <a rid="B48-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-medicines-04-00070">48</a>], limonene [
   <a rid="B49-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-medicines-04-00070">49</a>], and α-terpineol [
   <a rid="B50-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-medicines-04-00070">50</a>], have also shown antifungal activities. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal mechanisms of activity of monoterpenoids are poorly understood. It has been suggested that these hydrophobic compounds disrupt the cytoplasmic membranes or membrane proteins of fungal cells, leading to cytoplasmic leakage, cell lysis, and death [
   <a rid="B51-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-medicines-04-00070">51</a>]. Chirality of monoterpenoids, therefore, may not play a critical role in antimicrobial activity. Nevertheless, Kusumoto and co-workers have shown that (+)-α-pinene showed significantly better antifungal activity against 
   <span class="italic">Heterobasidion parviporum</span> than (−)-α-pinene [
   <a rid="B52-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-medicines-04-00070">52</a>]. Likewise, Filipowicz et al. showed (−)-β-pinene to be slightly more active than (+)-β-pinene against 
   <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> [
   <a rid="B53-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-medicines-04-00070">53</a>], and Omran and co-workers found that (−)-limonene had better antifungal activity than (+)-limonene [
   <a rid="B54-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-medicines-04-00070">54</a>]. (+)-δ-3-Carene has shown antifungal activity against several fungal strains [
   <a rid="B47-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-medicines-04-00070">47</a>], but there are apparently no reports on antifungal activity of (−)-δ-3-carene, which is not commercially available. Overall, these findings indicate that 
   <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> resin oil has promising potential for further antifungal consideration, in particular against 
   <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span> and potentially other yeast-like fungi.
