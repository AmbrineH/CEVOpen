 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chiral GC-MS analysis was performed to evaluate the enantiomeric distribution of the monoterpenes present in 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> essential oil (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t003" href="#medicines-04-00070-t003">Table 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f002" href="#medicines-04-00070-f002">Figure 2</a>). The levorotatory (−)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was found to be the exclusive stereoisomer while the (−)-enantiomers of α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene predominated over the (+)-isomers. The (+)-enantiomers of limonene and α-terpineol, on the other hand, were dominant. The hexane root extract of 
  <span class="italic">Angelica archangelica</span> showed predominantly (+)-δ-3-carene, but the (−)-enantiomer was detected [
  <a rid="B36-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-medicines-04-00070">36</a>]. Only the (+)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was detected in 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> (Pinaceae) essential oils, while (−)-limonene predominated [
  <a rid="B37-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-medicines-04-00070">37</a>]. The (+)-enantiomer of limonene is the more common, especially in 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span> (Rutaceae) essential oils [
  <a rid="B38-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-medicines-04-00070">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-medicines-04-00070">39</a>,
  <a rid="B40-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-medicines-04-00070">40</a>,
  <a rid="B41-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-medicines-04-00070">41</a>,
  <a rid="B42-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-medicines-04-00070">42</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Micromeria fruticosa</span> (Lamiaceae) essential oil showed exclusively (+)-α-terpineol while (−)-α-terpineol was found in 
  <span class="italic">Laurus nobilis</span> (Lauraceae) essential oil [
  <a rid="B43-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-medicines-04-00070">43</a>]. Analysis of the essential oil from the unripe fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> showed a predominance of (+)-α-pinene, (+)-limonene, (+)-β-pinene, and exclusively (−)-α-terpineol [
  <a rid="B44-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-medicines-04-00070">44</a>]. Although δ-3-carene was relatively abundant in this oil (2.7%), the enantiomeric distribution was unfortunately not reported. The oleoresin of 
  <span class="italic">Boswellia carterii</span> (Burseraceae) from Ethiopia was composed of (+)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene, but the enantiomeric distribution of δ-3-carene was not determined [
  <a rid="B45-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-medicines-04-00070">45</a>]. In contrast, 
  <span class="italic">B. carterii</span> resin oil from Somalia showed (−)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating, while 
  <span class="italic">B. sacra</span> resin oil from Oman had (+)-α-thujene, (+)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating [
