  <span class="bold">Background:</span>
  <span class="italic">Protium</span> species (Burseraceae) have been used in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as ulcers and wounds. 
  <span class="bold">Methods:</span> The essential oil from the oleoresin of 
  <span class="italic">Protium amazonicum</span> was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID, and chiral GC-MS. 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> oleoresin oil was screened for antifungal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>. 
  <span class="bold">Results:</span> A total of 54 components representing 99.6% of the composition were identified in the oil. The essential oil was dominated by δ-3-carene (47.9%) with lesser quantities of other monoterpenoids α-pinene (4.0%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), α-terpineol (5.5%) and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymen-8-ol (4.8%). Chiral GC-MS revealed most of the monoterpenoids to have a majority of 
  <span class="italic">levo</span> enantiomers present with the exceptions of limonene and α-terpineol, which showed a 
  <span class="italic">dextro</span> majority. 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> oleoresin oil showed promising activity against 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, with MIC = 156 μg/mL. 
  <span class="bold">Conclusions:</span> This account is the first reporting of both the chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of the oleoresin essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> from Ecuador. The oil was dominated by (−)-δ-3-carene, and this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely accounts for the observed antifungal activity of the oil.
