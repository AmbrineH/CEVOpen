   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Ribeiro et al. (2013)</a>. Briefly, different ppm of CMEO (up to 1000 ppm) and Tween 80 at a ratio of 2:1 (v/v) were added to 100 mL of 4% chitosan solution and homogenized continuously for 10 min at 50 rpm under a magnetic stirrer. Next, attained emulsion was incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 3 days to form Ce-CMEO-NPs. The characterizations of prepared Ce-CMEO-NPs were assessed by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, Zeta potential and size, and

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive identification (quality) of Ce-CMEO-NPs was determined by FT-IR on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer attached with ZnSe single crystals (Bruker, Billerica, United States) and data were analyzed using OPUS 7 spectroscopy software program. The analysis was carried out in a mode of a horizontal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell and working conditions were retained as relative humidity of 30% and temperature of 27°C. The samples were placed on ZnSe single crystal and infrared (IR) spectra were documented with resolution of 4 cm

Briefly, 5 mg of Ce-CMEO-NPs was dispersed in 5 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 and 0.1 M and loaded into dialysis bag. The dialysis was carried out in a beaker containing 50 mL of PBS (0.1 M) with 20% ethanol (99.99% pure) at 28°C and pH of 1.5 and 7.4 for duration of 48 h under gentle agitation. At definite time intervals (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h), the amount of CMEO releases from a dialysis bag was quantified spectrophotometrically (190–350 nm) using calibration curve. The CMEO release was calculated by the formula:
