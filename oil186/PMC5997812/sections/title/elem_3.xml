   <span class="italic">C. martinii</span> were collected prior inflorescence from Ooty, Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu state, India, and voucher (PEO: 24) was safeguarded. The collection location was sited at latitude 11.41° N and longitude 76.70°E with an altitude of 7350 feet above the sea level. The plant material was cleaned with distilled water and dried in sheltered enclosure at room temperature for 2 weeks and crushed to fine powder. A quantity of 250 g dried powder was employed for extraction of essential oil by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type device (Teknik, Ambala, India) implementing the technique of European Pharmacopeia (
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Council of Europe, 1997</a>). The moisture content was detached from oil by aeration over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in sealed dark-brown glass vials at 4°C for further studies. The percentage yield of oil was calculated from the dry weight of the plant material by applying the following formula:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical constituent of CMEO was revealed using GC-MS (PerkinElmer Clarus 600 C, Waltham, United States) attached with DB-5MS silica fused column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness), flame-ionization detector (FID), and Turbo Mass software program. Briefly, CMEO was diluted with acetone (10 μL/mL) and 1 μL was injected in a split mode of 1:30. Helium (He) was carrier gas at a delivery rate of 1 mL/min. The mass spectra of compounds were determined at an

   <span class="italic">z</span> range of 40–450 and ionization energy of 70 eV under vacuum. Identification of the compounds was carried out matching the mass spectra and retention indices of n-alkanes (C-9 to C-24) with NIST05.LIB/Wiley 8th Edition and literature of 
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Adams (2007)</a>, respectively. The quantification of compounds was attained from GC peak areas with devoid of FID response correction factors.
