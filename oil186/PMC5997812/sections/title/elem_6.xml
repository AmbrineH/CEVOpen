 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antifungal activity of CMEO was tested on mycotoxigenic 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> (DFRL FgM: 18), which was originally isolated from freshly harvested maize kernels in our earlier study (
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Mudili et al., 2014</a>). The fungal culture was allowed to grow for 14 days at 28°C on CD agar and spores were collected in sterile peptone water made up of 0.05% of Tween 80 by soft scrap, and the sum of spores was attained to 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> spores/mL using a hemocytometer and used in further studies. The antifungal activity of CMEO was determined by the micro-well dilution method. Furthermore, deleterious effects of CMEO on micromorphology of macroconidia were observed by SEM. The mechanism of antifungal activity of CMEO was unveiled by comparing the content of intracellular ROS, lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol content of CMEO-treated fungi with untreated control fungi.

The wells devoid of CMEO and with nystatin were control and reference, respectively. The plate was incubated for 3 days at 28°C. Following, MIC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed. The incubation period was continued for 7 days at 28°C and 10 μL was spread on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28°C and MFC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed on CD agar plates.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was evidenced by estimating the content of intracellular ROS in CMEO treated (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) and untreated control samples using DCFH-DA adopting a technique of 
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Liu et al. (2010)</a> with minor modification. A different concentration of CMEO (up to MFC value) was mixed with 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> spores per mL) in 96-well microtiter plate and total volume brought up to 100 μL with CD broth and incubated for 7 days at 28°C. The sample not treated with CMEO was considered as a control. Subsequently, samples were stained for 20 min with 5 μM DCFH-DA. The fluorescence intensity was determined at excitation of 495 nm and emission of 550 nm in a multimode reader (Biotek-H1M synergy, Germany) and percentage of intracellular ROS in CMEO-treated samples was determined with respect to the untreated control (100%). The phase-contrast and fluorescent images were captured under an EVOS fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies, United States) at a magnification of 200 μm.

   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Gao et al. (2016)</a> with minor modifications. Different concentrations of CMEO (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) along with 10 μl of fungal spore suspension were added to 100 mL of CD broth in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 7 days at 28°C, and fungal sample without CMEO was considered as a control. Next, fungal mycelia were separated from broth by sieving through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and used for estimation of lipid peroxidation. The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) present in the fungal sample was determined as an indicator of the level of lipid peroxidation. The quantification of MDA was done using spectrometric-dependent lipid-peroxidation assay kit as per instructions from the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich).

   <span class="sup">6</span> spores per mL) in 100 mL CD broth of 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for a period of 7 days at 28°C. Subsequently, the mycelia were separated from the broth employing Whatman no. 1 filter paper. A quantity of 5 mg of mycelia was used for determination of ergosterol and blended with 1 mL of ethanol, 5 mL of methanol, and 0.5 g of potassium hydroxide. The mixture was kept in dark at 70°C for 40 min and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and thoroughly mixed for 10 min with n-hexane (v/v, 1:1). The blend was dried out at 60°C using water bath and re-solubilized in 1 mL of methanol and quantification of ergosterol was deducted from the calibration curve of standard ergosterol and results were compared with CMEO untreated control. A calibration curve for standard ergosterol was constructed with peak area vs. concentration of ergosterol using HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The system was equipped with C18 column, 5 μm thickness, 250 mm × 4.60 mm (Phenomenex, CA, United States) and working conditions were as follows: stock solution of ergosterol was prepared in methanol, injecting volume was 25 μL for both test and standard samples, UV detector was used with an excitation of 240 nm and emission of 300 nm wavelengths, and mobile phase was acetonitrile and water in a ratio of 6.5:3.5 (v/v) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
