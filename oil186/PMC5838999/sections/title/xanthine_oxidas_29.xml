 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RaEO was tested for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at various concentrations and thereafter the IC
  <sub>50</sub> value was deduced. It can be observed that this essential oil has a very interesting IC
  <sub>50</sub> value (2.20 ± 0.10 μg/mL), which is comparable to that of the reference compound, allopurinol (2.6 ± 0.16 μg/mL).

 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under non-inhibitory conditions, kinetic parameters for xanthine oxidase were K
  <sub>m</sub> = 0.003 μM and V
  <sub>max</sub> = 1.052 ΔOD/min. Assays with the essential oil induced a modification on V
  <sub>max</sub> (from 0.26 to 0.66 ΔOD/min), whereas the K
  <sub>m</sub> value was not changed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the slope and the vertical axis intercept increase with increasing essential oil concentration (2.5, 3.75 and 5 μg/mL). This result indicates that the essential oil components affected the velocity of the reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, without affecting the Michaelis constant (K
  <sub>m</sub>). From these results, we can conclude that this inhibition is a non-competitive one, indicating that the components of the essential oil bind to a site other than the active one of the enzyme, without competing with the substrate.

 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ki value derived from the secondary plot (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) was 10 μg/mL, indicating that this essential oil tended to bind more easily to the xanthine oxidase. Indeed, smaller value of inhibition constant indicates stronger inhibition, which explains that the inhibitor-enzyme binding affinity exceeds the binding affinity of the enzyme-substrate.
