 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this assay, the antioxidant capacity of RaEO was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method as described by Prieto et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The basic principle to assess the antioxidant capacity through this assay includes the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) by the antioxidant compounds contained in the oil. Similarly to the two methods above, this test further confirms that the essential oil was very effective in the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) (EC
  <sub>50</sub> = 0.167 ± 0.019 mg/mL).
