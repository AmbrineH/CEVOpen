 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil is a hydrophobic liquid extracted from various parts of plants such as flowers, leaves, stems and roots [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Due to its aromatic characteristic, essential oil has long been used in the food and cosmetic industries as a flavoring agent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Furthermore, many essential oils exhibit antioxidant properties, which can have a positive effect on biological systems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>] as well as on food production by preventing oxidation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a long time, essential oils have been the basis of traditional medicine in many countries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. They are used with many biological properties including bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, insecticidal, as well as with other medicinal properties such as analgesic, sedative, antiinflammatory, spasmolytic, and locally anesthetic remedies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. At present, promising researches have been reportedly using essential oils in medicinal products for human health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. These recent works have shown the importance of essential oils in treating other diseases like respiratory tract, digestive system, gynecological, andrological, endocrine, cardiovascular, nervous system, and skin infections. Many of them have shown anticancer activities, too [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum</span> genus which belongs to the Asteraceae family is among the aromatic plants. This genus consists of about 30 species that are spread over the world [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. As shown by the literature, several species of this genus are used in the traditional medicine. Indeed, the root of 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum uniflorum</span> has been used for the treatment of fever and intoxication. It has been found that this species possesses anti-atherosclerotic activity and inhibits the lipids peroxidation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. On the other hand, 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</span> has long been employed in cases of overstrain and common weakness after illness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Actually, the extracts and isolated compounds from rhizomes and roots of this species are used for their adaptogenic and tonic properties in various dietary supplements or nutraceutical preparations to eliminate physical weakness, promote muscle growth, and treat impotency [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum acaule</span> (L) DC, also known as 
  <span class="italic">Leuzeaacaulis</span> L. or 
  <span class="italic">Centaurea chamaerhaponticum Ball</span>., is one of the most remarkable aromatic plants having an earlier spring flowering, from January to March. It grows wild in rosette on the slopes and in sandy pastures. It is a North African endemic species, distributed in the north and central areas of Tunisia.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only work published about the chemical composition of the aerial parts essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> reported its richness in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (21.3%), aromatic compounds (23.6%) and diterpenoids (23.7%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. In the same work, it was also found that the essential oil exhibited an interesting antibacterial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. However, to the best of our knowledge and according to literature, there are no reports on the antioxidant activities and enzyme inhibition effects of the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, the goal of this study was to establish the chemical composition, the antioxidant effects of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> collected in a very different habitat of Tunisia and its inhibitory power against Î±-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase. Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.
