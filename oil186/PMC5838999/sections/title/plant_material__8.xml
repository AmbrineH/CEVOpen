 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plants were collected at the flowering stage in January 2015 from the area of M’Saken (Sousse-Tunisia). The plant material was identified by Pr. Fethia Harzallah Skhiri (High Institute of Biotechnology of Monastir, Tunisia). A voucher specimen (N°.Ra15) has been deposited in the Herbarium of the Laboratory of Bioressources: Biologie Integrative and Valorization, High Institute of Biotechnology of Monastir, University of Monastir, Tunisia.</p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An amount of 100 g of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> flowers freshly collected were cut in small pieces and submitted to hydrodistillation for 5–6 h with 500 ml of boiling distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus [
