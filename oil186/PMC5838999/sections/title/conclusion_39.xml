 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work we studied a medicinal and aromatic plant of the Tunisian flora, in order to find new bioactive natural compounds. In this work we described the chemical composition of the essential oil from aerial part of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span>. The major compounds identified in this oil were germacrene D, methyl eugenol, 
  <span class="italic">(E)</span>-β-ionone, β-caryophyllene, 
  <span class="italic">(E,E)</span>-α-farnesene, bicyclogermacrene and 
  <span class="italic">(Z)</span>-α-bisabolene. Our results also evidenced for the first time that this essential oil has interesting antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated for the first time the in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of RaEO with enzyme kinetics analyses. The results showed that the essential oil exhibited a strong inhibition on the α-glucosidase activity that is higher than acarbose, and the inhibition was a mixed-type mechanism. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of this essential oil on xanthine oxidase was conducted. Lineweaver-Burk representation of the inhibition kinetics data proved that it was a non-competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and its Ki value was 10 μg/mL. Finally, RaEO exhibited a high inhibitory effect against pancreatic lipase. This suggests that it is a promising essential oil for inactivating digestive lipase in order to decrease incidence of common diseases caused by diets rich in carbohydrates and fats.

Particularly, major constituents of the essential oil need to be tested for their antioxidant, anti-α-glucosidase, anti-xanthine oxidase and anti-lipase activities. Furthermore, it is still worthwhile to investigate the other parts of 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum acaule</span> as a natural source for essential oil composition or phytochemical studies.
