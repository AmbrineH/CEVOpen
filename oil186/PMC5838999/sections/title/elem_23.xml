This method is widely used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of several substances since it can be applied both to liposoluble and hydrosoluble substances. This can be explained by the fact that this method evaluates the scavenging potential of lipid or hydrogen peroxyl radicals in an aqueous phase [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The basic principle to assess the antioxidant capacity through this assay includes the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) by the antioxidant compounds contained in the oil. Similarly to the two methods above, this test further confirms that the essential oil was very effective in the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) (EC
   <sub>50</sub> = 0.167 ± 0.019 mg/mL).

  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydroxyl radicals are known for their capacity to cause oxidative damage to biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA. The antioxidant effect of RaEO using DNA nicking assay is presented in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The untreated plasmid (lane 1) represents three conformations: the nicked, the linear and the supercoiled forms. On the other hand, incubation of plasmid DNA with Fenton’s reagent resulted in the total degradation of the plasmid and the loss of the three bands (lane 2). We can notice essentially that the pre-incubation of DNA with the essential oil at 2 mg/mL, before the incubation with Fenton’s reagent, protected the plasmid DNA against oxidation. Furthermore, the RaEO, with 2 mg/mL as concentration shows significant protective effect with important conservation of the supercoiled DNA band intensity.
