 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ABTS-radical-scavenging activity test measures the capacity of the sample to decrease the amount of ABTS
  <span class="sup">•+</span> cation radical in the solution. This method is widely used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of several substances since it can be applied both to liposoluble and hydrosoluble substances. This can be explained by the fact that this method evaluates the scavenging potential of lipid or hydrogen peroxyl radicals in an aqueous phase [
