 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The means and standard deviation (SD) of data were calculated from independent experiments. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> (α-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase inhibition) and EC
  <sub>50</sub> (ABTS, reducing power and phosphomolybdenum methods) values were calculated by linear regression analysis and the limits of their confidence intervals were carried out under the normality assumption. Data analysis was carried out using an unpaired Student’s 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test. GraphPad Software (USA) was used to fit sigmoid curves models and data were analyzed using a statistical analysis computer software (Graphpad Instat v.3.0a for MacIntosh, San Diego, CA, USA). For all statistical tests, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-values that were less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.
