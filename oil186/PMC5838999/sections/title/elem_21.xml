   <sub>max</sub> = 1.052 ΔOD/min. Assays with the essential oil induced a modification on V
   <sub>max</sub> (from 0.26 to 0.66 ΔOD/min), whereas the K
   <sub>m</sub> value was not changed (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As illustrated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the slope and the vertical axis intercept increase with increasing essential oil concentration (2.5, 3.75 and 5 μg/mL). This result indicates that the essential oil components affected the velocity of the reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, without affecting the Michaelis constant (K
   <sub>m</sub>). From these results, we can conclude that this inhibition is a non-competitive one, indicating that the components of the essential oil bind to a site other than the active one of the enzyme, without competing with the substrate.

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) was 10 μg/mL, indicating that this essential oil tended to bind more easily to the xanthine oxidase. Indeed, smaller value of inhibition constant indicates stronger inhibition, which explains that the inhibitor-enzyme binding affinity exceeds the binding affinity of the enzyme-substrate.

  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, TPL was used to measure the anti-lipase activity of RaEO. This enzyme was totally purified and its relation structure–function is previously determined [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. These authors showed that the biochemical properties and structures of TPL are similar to those of mammals. For this reason, TPL was used instead of the mammalian one. The anti-lipase activity of the essential oil was conducted using two methods, which differ in the order of the inhibitor addition.

   <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this method was to test, in an aqueous medium and in the absence of the substrate, the possible reactions between the pancreatic lipase and the inhibitor. The residual lipase activity was investigated at different concentrations of essential oil (0.05 to 2.00 mg/mL) (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). As shown by the figure, a dose–response curve was obtained, with maximum inhibition (80%) achieved at 2.00 mg/mL of essential oil. The inhibitory activity of the essential oil expressed as IC
    <sub>50</sub> value was about 0.22 ± 0.002 mg/mL, which is lower than that of pure THL (0.16 ± 0.001) used as a standard inhibitor against pancreatic lipase.

   <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This method was performed to observe the behavior of the lipase (inactivation or not) at the lipid/water interface during the hydrolysis of the water-insoluble substrate. The hydrolysis rate of olive oil emulsion was measured at pH 8.5 with TPL in the presence of colipase and NaDC. The essential oil was then added during substrate hydrolysis and the residual activity was measured. As depicted by Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>, the rate of olive oil hydrolysis by TPL decreased rapidly. The addition of an excess of substrate (olive oil emulsion) at the end of the kinetic does not succeed in restoring the initial velocity of the enzyme, showing that the lipase inhibition was irreversible.
