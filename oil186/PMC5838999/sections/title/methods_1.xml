  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum acaule</span> (L) DC (
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span>) was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activities of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> essential oil (RaEO) were also determined using 2,2’-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), reducing power, phosphomolybdenum, and DNA nicking assays. The inhibitory power of RaEO against α-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase was evaluated. Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.
