   <span class="bold">a</span>: Residual pancreatic lipase activity at various concentrations of RaEO. Lipase activity was measured using olive oil as substrate, in the presence of 4 mM of NaDC. Results are expressed as means ± S.D., 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 3. 
   <span class="bold">b</span>: Kinetic experiment of hydrolysis of olive oil emulsion by TPL. The kinetic curve was recorded continuously during the automated titration of liberated fatty acids under standard conditions using pH-stat apparatus. The arrows indicate the successive injections into the reaction medium of olive oil emulsion (OOE), (NaDC + colipase), TPL and RaEO
