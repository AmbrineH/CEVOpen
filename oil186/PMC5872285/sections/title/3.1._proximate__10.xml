 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proximate composition (based on dry weight) is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t001" href="#insects-09-00020-t001">Table 1</a>. Protein was the most abundant nutrient followed by fat, carbohydrate and ash.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insect composition varies largely due to species, diet, habitat, metamorphic stage, and processing method [

  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> also varies. The crude protein, fat, and ash content of the present study were similar to results reported by Osimani et al. [
  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] for whole dried locusts (
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span>) sourced from The Netherlands. The crude protein content (50.79%) was also similar to reports by Mohamed [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00020">6</a>], while other studies reported higher percentages, ranging from 55.5% to 65.9% [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fat content (34.9%) was much higher than the average (13%) for orthopteran species (locust, crickets, grasshoppers) [
  <a rid="B5-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-insects-09-00020">5</a>]. A study on adult 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> conducted by Oonincx and van der Poel [
  <a rid="B7-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-insects-09-00020">7</a>] did identify higher numbers (18.6% to 29.6%), with higher fat and lower protein contents acknowledged after wheat bran was added to their diet. Consequently, the grass and ground oat diet of the locusts in the current study would have impacted the protein and fat content found. Furthermore, the locusts were constantly active due to a constant artificial light source, and were domestically reared in incubated plastic boxes. This could alter the fat content identified, compared to literature that sourced insects from the wild [
  <a rid="B5-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-insects-09-00020">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ash content was lower than reported contents for 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span>, ranging from 3.3% to 5.72% [

  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00020">19</a>]. The mineral content varies depending on species and other factors such as habitat, diet, and season. Mohamed [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00020">6</a>] found high amounts of phosphorous but low amounts of all other nutrients. Whereas, Kouřimská et al. [
  <a rid="B29-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-insects-09-00020">29</a>] identified high amounts of iron (8–20 mg) in 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span>. Further research concerning the mineral content and bioavailability would provide more in depth information about locusts’ health benefits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the carbohydrate (CHO) content of orthopteran species is low. Mohamed [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00020">6</a>] reported 4% CHO and 14% fiber in migratory locusts from Sudan. Although the present study did not separately measure the fiber content, reports indicate a large portion of this is sourced from the polysaccharide chitin, found in the exoskeleton of insects [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00020">6</a>]. Chitin is an interesting fiber, with recent studies identifying populations that commonly consume insects and other chitinous foods, can contain the enzyme chitinase, indicating it may be digestible for certain consumers [
  <a rid="B30-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-insects-09-00020">30</a>]. Further investigation into chitin and its digestibility and nutritional benefits are needed with no data concerning migratory locusts currently available. Overall, the high protein, fat, and fiber content found in the present study outline the nutritional benefits of adding locusts to your diet.
