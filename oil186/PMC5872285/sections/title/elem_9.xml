Consequently, the grass and ground oat diet of the locusts in the current study would have impacted the protein and fat content found. Furthermore, the locusts were constantly active due to a constant artificial light source, and were domestically reared in incubated plastic boxes.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the carbohydrate (CHO) content of orthopteran species is low. Mohamed [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When investigating nutritional benefits, locusts also contain appreciable amounts of essential fatty acids known for their health benefits. The FA composition of crude locust oil from 
   <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> is shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t002" href="#insects-09-00020-t002">Table 2</a>. The chain lengths ranged from 14 to 18 carbons. To the authors knowledge, only Mohamed [
   <a rid="B31-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-insects-09-00020">31</a>], Osimani et al. [
   <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] and Ramos-Bueno et al. [
   <a rid="B32-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-insects-09-00020">32</a>] have investigated 
   <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span>. As a general trend, data was consistent with findings, with some differences in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents identified. Oleic acid is the most abundant FA documented in migratory species, followed by palmitic acid, leading to reasonably similar overall SFA and MUFA contents. α-linolenic acid (omega-3) content (15.7%) in the present study was within the range identified in literature (13.9% to 16.2%). However, Osimani et al. [
   <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] found significantly lower content (3%) in whole dried locusts sourced from Netherlands, which consequently leads to a large variation in overall PUFA content of 
   <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> generally found in literature (12.5% to 32.3%). Moreover, linoleic acid (omega-6) in the present study was also within the range of 5.2% to 18.3% [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many variables influence the FA composition of locusts. For example, the study conducted by Osimani et al. [
   <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] found large differences in SFA and PUFA contents of whole dried locusts samples sourced from either Belgium or the Netherlands. The FA composition of locusts or other insect species is significantly influenced by their diet. Insects that consume grass or plants containing high PUFA are linked to high α-linolenic acid content in the FA composition [
   <a rid="B33-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-insects-09-00020">33</a>]. Dreassi et al. [
   <a rid="B34-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-insects-09-00020">34</a>] found yellow mealworms fed on wheat, oat, cornflour, and chickpea flour had much 10% higher PUFA’s content compared to mealworms fed on 100% oat flour.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, the diet of locusts can be advantageously designed to optimise the omega-3 and PUFA content in order to produce a healthy lipid source. Still, locusts from the present study provided desirably low SFA/UFA and n−6/n−3 ratios of 0.58 and 0.55, respectively. The recommended n−6/n−3 ratio is around one, which is far from reach for many Western consumers who consume too much omega-6 in their diets, leading to ratios above 15/1 [
   <a rid="B35-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-insects-09-00020">35</a>]. High omega-6 consumption in vegetable oils and grains for example, has been linked to various health diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Greater consumption of omega-3 rich lipids and food sources that have lower n−6/n−3 ratios can help reduce risk of these chronic diseases [
   <a rid="B4-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-insects-09-00020">4</a>,
   <a rid="B35-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-insects-09-00020">35</a>,
   <a rid="B36-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-insects-09-00020">36</a>]. Lipid extraction is often a by-product of protein extraction making locust oil a sustainable and healthy alternative lipid and food source. In another study conducted by the researcher, consumer acceptance of locust oil was explored through focus group discussions. It found the omega-3 content, as well as the sustainability or novelty of locust oil is an attractive feature for some participants, indicating these features should be appropriately marketed and explored in order to improve acceptance.

The soluble proteins may not have aggregated efficiently at pH 4, causing a large proportion to remain in the supernatant fraction, leading to a higher SF yield and protein percentage. pH 4 was used to precipitate the soluble locust protein following Bußler et al. [
    <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] methodology on five different insects. Purschke et al. [

    <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. The ability to hold this water is dependent on many factors such as the amino acids, charges, conformation, and hydrophobicity of the protein, pH, temperature, ionic strength and protein concentration [
    <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>]. The reason for the high WHC of the insoluble locust fraction is unknown. The porous structure or large particle size, due to absence of sieving during preparation, could have caused greater entrapment of water into the particle domains. Furthermore, larger particle size has been linked to higher contents of chitin, as found in 
    <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> grist [
    <a rid="B40-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-insects-09-00020">40</a>], which could additionally entrap the water into the ILF matrix, creating the high WHC result found. Ability of locust fractions to hold water illustrates protein-water interactions and can be used to interpret other functional properties such as solubility, emulsification, viscosity, gelation, and foaming [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high ILF OHC result is also inconsistent with the literature. Contradicting the current results, Bußler et al. [
    <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] found fat binding capacity (g/g) was significantly higher in the soluble and lower in insoluble fractions of yellow mealworms. The current findings could again be due to the larger particle size and porous structure, causing physical entrapment of oil [
    <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>]. Additionally, higher OHC is linked to non-polar side chains in the protein structure, which was not investigated in the current study. Research on this is limited and further information on the water and oil holding capacity of protein extracts from 
    <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> and insects in general is needed. Nevertheless, the WHC and OHC findings indicate the possible food applications of each fraction.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another consumer study conducted by the researcher, it asked thirty-five participants to design an ideal hypothetical solid and liquid food product containing the ILF and SLF fractions. Participants who were open to trying new or novel foods were screened prior to investigation in order to gain insights from potential end consumers. The liquid product designs (containing soluble locust fraction) designed by participants included chocolate flavoured health drinks, protein powders, an ice cream, and a coconut yoghurt product. Solid food products (containing insoluble locust fraction) included protein packed breadcrumbs, muesli bars, cereals, bread, cookies and a nut substitute. The majority of these products were designed as a healthy, convenient, and eco-friendly snack or breakfast for active consumers or children. These results indicate the exciting future of whole or extracted locust protein as a value-added ingredient.</p>
