 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, there has been a growing interest into the benefits of consuming insects, also known as entomophagy. Instead of viewing insects, such as locusts, as pests that should be kept away from the kitchen, certain consumers and food companies are purposely and creatively incorporating them into food products and meals. Migratory locusts (
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span>, Linnaeus, 1758 (Orthoptera: Acrididae)) are prevalent in African and Arabian diets, but are also widespread across the world [
  <a rid="B1-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-insects-09-00020">1</a>]. Popular preparations include fried, roasted, or boiled. However, there are over 2000 edible insect species that can be eaten at egg, larval, pupal, or adult stages, either whole or ground up into meals or snack products [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>]. Locusts are historically associated as pests that destroy crops, which has influenced research and consumer opinions. In recent years however, through growing interest concerning entomophagy, locusts have received attention for their promising sensory properties, nutritionally rich composition, and sustainable production prospects as a food ingredient [
  <a rid="B1-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-insects-09-00020">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rearing locusts and other edible insects requires significantly less feed, land, and water compared to livestock production, which is known to have a significant impact on the environment where greenhouse gas emissions are minimal with only cockroaches, termites and scarab beetles that emit methane gas [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-insects-09-00020">3</a>]. Locusts have short life cycles in which adulthood can be reached at four to eight weeks depending on rearing conditions. They can also increase their numbers 10 to 16-fold between each generation, illustrating the rapid and efficient domestic rearing prospects [
  <a rid="B1-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-insects-09-00020">1</a>]. Land required for rearing is minimal as they can be farmed vertically. The cold-blooded insects obtain moisture from their food decreasing water requirements, and along with the high feed conversion efficiency, insects resource requirements are lower compared to other traditional livestock such as beef [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, locusts are nutritionally rich in protein, fiber, and essential fatty acids. Compositional data concerning locusts is scarce and exact values are highly variable depending on species, habitat, diet, metamorphic stage, and processing method. Orthopteran species contain high amounts of fat averaging around 13% (dry weight basis), with promising amounts of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); omega-3 (Î±-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) [
  <a rid="B4-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-insects-09-00020">4</a>]. Moreover, insects are particularly noted for their high protein content. Orthopteran species can range from 15% to 81% protein [
  <a rid="B5-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-insects-09-00020">5</a>], with averages around 50% to 65% for 
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span> [
  <a rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-insects-09-00020">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-insects-09-00020">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>]. Orthopteran species also contain satisfactory ratios of essential amino acids recommended for human consumption, making them a sustainable protein option for consumers looking for alternatives to traditional meat sources such as beef [
  <a rid="B5-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-insects-09-00020">5</a>]. Yet, some studies have recognised the potential overestimation of insect protein contents when the nitrogen to protein conversion for meat (6.25) is used [
  <a rid="B9-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-insects-09-00020">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-insects-09-00020">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>]. The high amount of chitin, a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) polysaccharide found in the exoskeleton of insects, can cause an overestimation of digestible protein documented in literature. To more accurately determine insect protein content, Jonas-Levi and Martinez [
  <a rid="B10-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-insects-09-00020">10</a>] recommended subtracting NPN from the total nitrogen content, or lowering the conversion factor. Nonetheless, the high protein and fat content of insects and locusts is comparable to traditional meat sources, indicating potential as a meat or protein alternative for the growing population [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>,
  <a rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-insects-09-00020">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, extracting the protein from insects has been suggested as a worthwhile practice [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>]. Not only does it increase the protein content (per 100 g) and digestibility for certain fractions [
  <a rid="B13-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-insects-09-00020">13</a>], it can overcome initial consumer acceptance barriers. Many studies have found consumers are more willing to eat insects when they cannot be seen [
  <a rid="B14-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-insects-09-00020">14</a>], illustrating opportunities as an value-added ingredient as opposed to a whole insect. Protein extraction is usually carried out via aqueous or alkali isoelectric precipitation, in which different pH, temperature, and physical separation (centrifugation) methods are used to separate different fractions [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. These fractions include a layer comprising of water insoluble proteins and other constituents, and a layer of protein water soluble proteins. Each fraction is different in terms of yield, chemical composition, digestibility, colour, and functionality. Consequently, insoluble and soluble proteins have different potential applications as an ingredient. To the authors knowledge, only a small number of studies have explored any of these parameters, which include analysis of house crickets

  <span class="italic">(Hermeia illucens)</span>, yellow mealworms 
  <span class="italic">(Tenebrio molitor</span>), Mexican fruit fly larvae 
  <span class="italic">(Anastepha ludens)</span> and migratory locusts (
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span>) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insects in New Zealand, including locusts, are classified as novel food by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), with the exception of three species, due to lack of safety concerns. Studies have found microbial and fungal loads of fresh insects are reasonably high [
  <a rid="B20-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-insects-09-00020">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-insects-09-00020">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-insects-09-00020">22</a>]. However, processing steps such as blanching, heat treatments, and sterilization are sufficient methods to reduce safety risks in various insect species [
  <a rid="B20-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-insects-09-00020">20</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presently, there are only a few commercial insect products sold on the Western market, which include ground insect flour (often cricket), sold on its own or incorporated into bars, chips, protein powders, cookies and even pasta. Locusts are less popular and very few products have utilised extracted insect protein as an ingredient. Even with the promising potential of locusts as an alternative food or protein source, consumers must first be accepting of the idea. Entomophagy is practiced by over two billion people in mostly African, Asian, and Latin American societies [
  <a rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-insects-09-00020">2</a>]. Nevertheless, in areas where they are not traditionally consumed, such as Western culture, eating insects is met with great resistance, surfacing feelings of disgust and fear [
  <a rid="B24-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-insects-09-00020">24</a>]. Enculturation of viewing animal products as a protein and fat source, and viewing insects as a pest that people try to avoid, has caused avoidance of novel insect products, also known as food neophobia. In order to successfully introduce locust products, greater understanding of the locust protein properties could help the limited research and industrial product development, in the hope to improve adoption in the future. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the proximate and fatty acid composition of the adult migratory locusts (
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span>) and the properties, yield, and composition of extracted protein fractions via alkali isoelectric precipitation methodology.
