 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both AE and AO were effective to modulate biomarkers of oxidative damage including FRAP, LPO, TTM, and MPO. In FRAP, LPO, and TTM test, all doses of fruit extract and essential oil were able to produce a significant difference in comparison to vehicle-treated group [
