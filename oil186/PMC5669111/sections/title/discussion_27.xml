 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with the World Health Organization, a perfect scolicidal agent for dropping the risk of protoscoleces spillage through hydatid cyst surgery is explained by elevated effectiveness in a shorter time of contact, high influence at lower doses, higher accessibility, constancy in the attendance of cystic fluid, and lower toxicity.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] Historically, herbs and spices as pure compounds, because of having low toxicity, low cost, high efficacy, and high availability, give boundless opportunities for new drug improvement.[
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>] Therefore, this investigation was designed to analyze the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> barks, its scolicidal effects on the hydrated cyst protoscoleces, and its acute toxicity in the mice model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained findings demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> at concentrations of 100 and 50 μL/mL completely killed hydatid cyst protoscoleces after 5 min of incubation, whereas lower concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil motivated deferred protoscolicidal effects. It was also found that the scolicidal activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> was analogous with the current scolicidal agents such as 20% hypertonic saline, 20% silver nitrate, 0.5%–1% cetrimide, H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> 3% (15 min), and 95% ethyl alcohol with potent scolicidal effects between 10 and 20 min.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common scolicidal agents had serious side effects such as sclerosing cholangitis (biliary tract fibrosis), liver necrosis, and methemoglobinemia.[
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>] For this reason, the present results supported the idea that 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> could be a natural origin for producing a new protoscolicidal agent which can be applied in CE surgery. Previously, Sharififar 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>] reported the presence of high amounts of tannin and alkaloid as well as lack of saponins in the phytochemical screening of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> barks. Individual activities of these compounds were proven by Cowan.[
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>] It was found that the main components were cinnamaldehyde (91.8%), r-metoxicinamate (1.57%), and α-pinene (1.25%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In line with the present results, Saleem 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. reported cinnamaldehyde (49.15%), limonene (15.10%), and α-pinene (1.25%) as the main components of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> bark essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation method.[
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] In several studies, antimicrobial activities of cinnamaldehyde as the main component of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> against some pathogenic strains have been shown.[
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a>] Therefore, phytoconstituents in this plant could be answerable for their scolicidal effects although their accurate manner of action is inadequately understood. However, some researchers have shown its effects on the energy creation of microorganisms.[
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>] The possible inhibition mechanisms of energy generation are the inhibition of glucose uptake or utilization of glucose and effects on membrane permeability.[
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>] Moreover, in the case of the antimicrobial mechanism of some monoterpene hydrocarbons such as limonene and α-pinene, Sikkema 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. indicated that they were dim into pathogen and hurt cell membrane structures.[
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a>] In addition, other studies demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of these compounds is related to their capability to affect not only permeability but also other functions of cell wall; these compounds might cross the cell membranes and thus penetrate into the interior of the cell and interact with the critical intracellular sites.[
  <a rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref39">39</a>
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">40</a>] Previous investigations on laboratory animals have demonstrated that liver and kidney is the main object limb of drug toxicity.[
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">41</a>
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">42</a>] Injure to the structural integrity of the liver is evaluated by increased serum levels of enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin. On the other hand, the Cr blood test and BUN are used to evaluate kidney function. Acute and subacute toxicity is the first steps of evaluation toxicity effects all drugs. In these methods, tested drugs used in both routes of oral and intraperitoneal administration. In this study, we have used manifold concentrations in comparison with concentrations applied for its protoscolicidal scolicidal effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to the toxicity of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil, it was found that the essential oil showed no mortality up to the dose of 2 mL/kg. However, 25% of mortality occurred at the dose of 4 mL/kg. No significant differences (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05) in the clinical chemistry and hematological parameters following oral administrations of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil for 14 days were detected. According to the toxicity classification, 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil induced no significant toxicity among male NMRI mice.[
