  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was carried out by a Shimadzu QP5050 with a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm). The column temperature was retained at 60°C for 3 min and programmed to 180°C at a rate of 5°C/min and maintained constant at 275°C for 5 min. Injector and interface temperatures were 230 and 280°C, respectively. The flow rate of helium as carrier gas was (0.9 mL/min C.F). The percentages were calculated by electronic integration of FID peak areas without the use of response factors correction. Linear retention indices for all components were determined by coinjection of the samples with a solution containing homologous series of C8-C20

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was carried out by a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) coupled with a TRACE mass (Manchester, UK). Helium was used as carrier gas with ionization voltage of 70 eV. Ion source and interface temperatures were 230 and 280°C, respectively. Mass range was from 40 to 300 U. Oven temperature program was the same given above for the GC.</p>
