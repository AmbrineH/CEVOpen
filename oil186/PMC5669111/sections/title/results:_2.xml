 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main components were found to be cinnamaldehyde (91.8%), ρ metoxicinamate (1.57%), and α pinene (1.25%). Findings indicate that 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil with the concentrations of 100 and 50 µL/mL killed 100% of protoscoleces after 5 min of exposure. Also, the lower concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil motivated a late protoscolicidal effect. The LD
  <sub>50</sub> value of intraperitoneal injection of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil was 2.07 mL/kg body weight after 48 h, and the maximum nonfatal dose was 1.52 mL/kg body weight. The results also showed that there was no significant toxicity following oral administration of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil for 2 weeks.
