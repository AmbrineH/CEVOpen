 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The water absorption capacity (WAC) and oil absorption capacity (OAC) were determined as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0043">2015</a>) adapted from Rodriguez‐Ambriz, Martinez‐Ayala, Millan, and Davila‐Ortiz (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0048">2005</a>). Briefly, sample (1.0 g) was weighed into a 15 ml pre‐weighed centrifuge tube to which 10 ml of distilled water (for WAC) or 10 ml of soybean oil (for OAC) was added stepwise with continuous stirring at room temperature for 10 min. The suspension in the tube was centrifuged at 2,500 × 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 20 min and the volume of supernatant measured. The WAC or OAC was calculated as the difference between the initial volume of water or oil used and the final volume of the decanted supernatant and calculated in percentages, taking into consideration the density of the oil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The least gelation concentration (LGC) was determined according to the method described by Abbey and Ibeh (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0001">1988</a>). The sample was weighed and mixed with 5 ml of distilled water in a test tube to obtain 2%–20% (w/v) concentrations. The test tube was heated for 1 hr in a boiling water bath followed by rapid cooling under running tap water and further cooled for 2 hr in a refrigerator at 4°C. The LGC was regarded as the least concentration at which the sample from the inverted tube did not fall or slip.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bulk density was determined essentially as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0043">2015</a>). Foaming capacity (FC) and foaming stability (FS) were carried out as described by Sze‐Tao and Sathe (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0051">2000</a>). The sample (0.5 g) was dispersed in 50 ml of distilled water in a 100 ml graduated cylinder and the solutions homogenized at a speed of 1,600 × 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 5 min. The volume was recorded before and after whipping. FC was expressed as the volume (%) increase due to whipping. This was then stored for 1 hr and the foam‐volume changes in the graduated cylinder were recorded as FS. Both were calculated in percentages as shown below:
