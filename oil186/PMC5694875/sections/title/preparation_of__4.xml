 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The various samples of conophor nuts were defatted as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo, Fagbemi, Ogunbusola, and Badejo (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0043">2015</a>) and the resultant flour stored at 4°C for further analyses. Protein isolates were prepared from the defatted flour samples using isoelectric point method as described by Gbadamosi, Abiose, and Aluko (
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0029">2012b</a>) with slight modification. Briefly, the flour:water (1:20 [w/v]) was stirred on a magnetic stirrer continually for 2 hr at room temperature at pH 10, and the slurry formed was centrifuged at 4,000 × 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 40 min at 4°C. The insoluble conophor nut residue was redissolved with pH adjusted as above and cold‐centrifuged again. The two supernatants were mixed together and adjusted to pH 4.5 and kept for 2 hr at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 4,000 x 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 40 min at 4°C. The precipitate was washed with distilled water, redissolved in water, neutralized to pH 7 at room temperature, dialyzed for 6 hr and then freeze‐dried.
