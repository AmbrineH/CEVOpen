 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emulsion capacities of the raw, boiled, and toasted defatted nuts were 9.65%, 10.44% and 10.53%, respectively. Toasting significantly decreased the emulsion capacity and stability of the conophor nut protein isolates, but significantly (

  <a rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3508-tbl-0004">4</a>). The emulsion formed by the protein isolate when the nuts were boiled was more stable which might be due to the presence of strong protein–protein interactions at the oil–water interface of the protein isolates preventing oil droplet coalescence (Malomo et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0036">2014</a>). The nature of the proteins with the composition of charged, non‐charged polar and non‐polar amino acids make them potential emulsifiers and surfactants possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and are able to interact with both water and oil components in food systems (Ulloa, Rosas‐Ulloa, &amp; Ulloa‐Rangel,
