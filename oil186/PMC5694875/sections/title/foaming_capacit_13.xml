 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foaming capacity and foam stability</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foam capacity is a measure of the increase observed when 1% of protein isolate is whipped in 100 ml water while foam stability is a measure of the volume of foam remaining, relative to the initial state after the whipping, when the solution is left for a specified period of time. A protein with good foaming properties and flexible surfactant molecules must be rapidly adsorbed at the air‐water interface and rearranged to form a cohesive visco‐elastic film via intermolecular interactions (Malomo et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0036">2014</a>). The FC of the defatted flours ranges from 11.54–14.91%, and was improved by boiling and toasting. The FC of defatted conophor nuts flour compared favorably with 13.2% reported for fluted pumpkin flours (Oshodi &amp; Fagbemi, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0044">1992</a>). The corresponding protein isolates had poor FC of 4.21–4.65% (Table 
  <a rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3508-tbl-0004">4</a>), albeit with improvement upon boiling and toasting. Foams are very vital in foods like whipped toppings and beverages where the proteins unfold forming a layer that keep air bubbles in suspension and prevents them from collapsing. The stabilized foams of the conophor protein flours (3.98%–5.70%) and isolates (2.11%–2.87%) were observed to be very low when compared to 95%–100% for hemp protein isolates (Malomo et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0036">2014</a>). The poor FS of the flours and isolates is indicative of the very slow film formation at the air‐water interfaces coupled with poor film visco‐elasticity (Wani et al.,
