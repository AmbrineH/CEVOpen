 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main constituents of MEO as shown by current results were 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, linalool, α-terpineol, nonadecane, linalyl acetate, and β-phellandrene. The potent antibacterial activity of EOs has mostly been related to oxygenated terpenes, such as 1,8-cineole, linalool and α-terpineol. Randrianarivelo, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. demonstrated that potent antibacterial activity of MEO can be related to 1,8-cineole and linalool components (
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>). Moreover, linalool has previously been reported to be an antimicrobial agent (
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">Table 4</a>, MEO and F6 formulation have antibacterial activity against the selected microorganisms. No lysis zone was observed in control group consisting of empty niosomes treated-bacteria. In the zone of inhibition determination, nMEO inhibited growth of S. aureus, S.epidermidis, S. marcescens, and B. subtilis at lower concentrations than MEO did. Furthermore, the results revealed that F6 formulation were slightly more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, F6 formulation is more effective against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. epidermidis</span> compared to MEO. This may be depends on the permeability of niosome to the membrane of Gram-positive coccid.
