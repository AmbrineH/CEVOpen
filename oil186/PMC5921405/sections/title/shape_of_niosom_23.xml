  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, the optical and scanning electron micrographs of nMEO illustrated that the vesicles were nearly spherical in shape, uniform in size, and more often were multi-lamellar. MLVs formation may be related to our nMEO preparation method. Coordinately, previous report has shown that film hydration method usually leads to MLVs (
