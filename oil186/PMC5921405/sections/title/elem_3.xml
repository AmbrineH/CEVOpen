  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aerial parts of myrtle were collected from Haji Abad, Iran during July/August 2015 and then identified by Dr. Mirtajadini at Department of Botany, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran. Voucher specimen was prepared (KF 1356) and deposited at the herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Kerman University of medical sciences, Kerman, Iran. Moreover, MEO was obtained from dried harvested leaves by hydro distillation assay in a Clevenger apparatus (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the volatile constituents of MEO was determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses, which was performed via a GC/MS-QP5050 equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (40 m × 1.8 mm (internal diameter)), film thickness: 0.18 μm) and a QP5050 mass selective detector. In order to detect GC/MS, an electron ionizations system with ionization energy of 70 eV was adopted. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injector and detector line temperature were set at 260 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Moreover, column temperature was initially kept at 60 °C for 5 min, after which it was gradually increased to 260 °C at a 5 °C/min rate. One μL diluted samples were injected manually and the split ratio was equaled 1/40.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The components of the oil were identified by comparing their retention index (RI) with Kovats’ index (KI). RI is relative to C8-C24 n-alkenes series injected to the GC/MS in the present study. KI was obtained from mass spectra published by Adams (
   <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>). Further identifications were made by matching the mass spectra with those stored in the Wiley 275.L mass spectral library of the GC/MS data system using computer.

   <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>). A precise amount of 1200 μmol of the nonionic surfactants (Span and Tween) and Chol in different molar ratios, 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30 were dissolved in chloroform in a round-bottom flask. Afterwards, 2.5 mL of MEO solution 2% in chloroform was added to the lipid phase. After removing the organic solvents at 50 °C under vacuum in a rotary evaporator (EYELA SB-1200, Japan), the film was hydrated with 10 mL deionized water with a gentle rotation at 50 °C for 60 min to produce an aqueous niosomal suspension containing 0.5% MEO.

According to the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, Iran is categorized in zone II. As far as accelerated and intermediate testing condition is concerned, formulations were stored under three conditions such as 4 °C, 25 °C with relative humidity (RH) of 30%, and 40 °C with RH of 70% for 3 months (

The membrane was fixed between donor and receptor compartments. The receptor compartment was filled with 50% ethanol 98° and 50% distilled water, then it was continuously stirred and thermostated at 37 ± 1 °C throughout the experiment. The donor compartment was filled with 1 mL nMEO. Total MEO solution and empty niosomal formulation were used as the control group. One mL sample was withdrawn at fixed time intervals from receptor compartment and replaced with an equal volume of fresh acceptor phase to ensure sink conditions. The permeated drug concentrations were measured by GC/MS analyses.

Muller-Hinton-broth with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80 was used for preparing nMEO two-fold dilutions ranging from 2000 to 250 μg/100 μL. Empty sterilized discs (6.4 mm) were impregnated with 100 μL of different concentrations and placed on the agar surface. Paper disc moistened with 10% DMSO or empty niosome were used as a vehicle control and blank, respectively. Also antibiotic discs including ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were used as positive controls. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the zone of inhibition was measured.
