 <p>The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and the identification and quantification of components were achieved with the use of GC-MS analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the method of sequestration of DPPH. Essential oils were used for study the cytotoxic front larvae of
  <span class="italic"> Artemia salina</span>. In the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, we employed the disk-diffusion method. The potential larvicide in mosquito larvae of the third stage of development of
  <span class="italic"> Aedes aegypti</span> to different concentrations of essential oils was evaluated. The major compounds found in the essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> M. piperita</span> were linalool (51.8%) and epoxyocimene (19.3%). The percentage of antioxidant activity was 79.9 ± 1.6%. The essential oil showed LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 414.6 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL front of
  <span class="italic"> A. saline</span> and is considered highly toxic. It shows sensitivity and halos significant inhibition against
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>. The essential possessed partial larvicidal efficiency against
  <span class="italic"> A. aegypti</span>.
