  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a> refers to the average mortality readings performed within 48 h, in the cytotoxic activity of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. piperita</span>. The results are significant and expressed in percentage of mortality (%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. piperita</span> showed LC
  <sub>50</sub> 414.6 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and correlation coefficient of 0.7443, confirming its moderate toxicity front of
  <span class="italic"> A. salina</span>. The oil of
  <span class="italic"> Mentha </span>spp. has a calming pain action and is clinically used as an ingredient in many analgesics creams and in the treatment of arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. The chemical compound menthol relieves discomfort by afferent modulator, causing pain impulses, as part of an astringent effect, and exciting the nerves that recognize the sensation of cold.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils were characterized as good bioactive agents, because of oils and extracts from plants presenting LC
