 <p id="Par1">Due to the role of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) in the transmission of many serious pathogens, personal protection against bites of this tick is essential. In the present study the essential oils from 11 aromatic Egyptian plants were isolated and their repellent activity against 
  <span class="italic">I</span>. 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> nymphs was evaluated Three oils (i.e. 
  <span class="italic">Conyza dioscoridis</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia herba-alba</span> Asso and 
  <span class="italic">Calendula officinalis</span> L.) elicited high repellent activity in vitro of 94, 84.2 and 82%, respectively. The most active essential oil (
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span>) was applied in the field at a concentration of 6.5 µg/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span> and elicited a significant repellent activity against 
  <span class="italic">I</span>. 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> nymphs by 61.1%. The most repellent plants 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba-alba</span> yielded essential oils by 0.17, 0.11 and 0.14%, respectively. These oils were further investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. α-Cadinol (10.7%) and hexadecanoic acid (10.5%) were the major components of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span> whereas in 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span>, α-cadinol (21.2%) and carvone (18.2%) were major components. 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span>
  <span class="italic">herba-alba</span> contained piperitone (26.5%), ethyl cinnamate (9.5%), camphor (7.7%) and hexadecanoic acid (6.9%). Essential oils of these three plants have a potential to be used for personal protection against tick bites.
