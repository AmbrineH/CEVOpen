 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eleven plants originating from Egypt were investigated as potentially active against blood sucking ticks. The Egyptian plants used in the present study (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) were found to be rich in essential oils, which were obtained by steam distillation. The largest yield of essential oil was obtained from the seeds of 
  <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> Mill. (1.1%) followed by 
  <span class="italic">Matricaria recutita</span> L. (0.2%), whereas 
  <span class="italic">Ricinus communis</span> L. exhibited the lowest yield (0.01%). Furthermore, the oils obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Conyza dioscoridis</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Calendula officinalis</span> L. and 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia herba-alba</span> Asso were 0.17, 0.14 and 0.11% yield, respectively (Table
