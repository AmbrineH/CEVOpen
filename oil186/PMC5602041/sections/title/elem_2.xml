The distillate was collected and extracted three times with 100 ml of HPLC grade n-hexane (VWR Int. Sweden), dehydrated using anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Alfa Aesar UK), filtered and solvent was evaporated using rotary evaporator at 20 °C under reduced pressure. The essential oils were weighed and reconstituted in hexane as 20 mg/ml, stored in tightly closed glass vials in freezer at −20 °C until further investigations.

The GC was equipped with a split/split less injector (split less mode, 30 s; injector temperature, 230 °C; carrier gas, Helium with a constant pressure of 10 psi). A DB-WAX capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, and 0.25 µm film thickness, J &amp; W USA) was used. The temperature program was: 40 °C for 1 min then increased with a rate of 4 °C/min up till 235 °C and held at 235 °C for 10 min. Transfer line connecting GC to the MS was isothermally set to 240 °C throughout the analysis. The temperature of MS ion source was 150 °C and mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with a mass range of 30–400

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>). Briefly, two wooden poles of 1 m length and 3 cm diameter were attached to two opposite sides of a white flannel cloth (1 × 1 m) and a long string was tied on both ends of one wooden pool attached to the cloth. The cloth was dragged over the vegetation by holding string in hand whereas the two wooden poles made it possible to expand the cloth during dragging so that maximum cloth surface could be exposed and touch the vegetation. Nymphs attached to the cloth were removed with the help of soft forceps and put into tubes having wet filter paper. Nymphs were maintained in complete darkness at 4 °C and 80–95% relative humidity until they were used in laboratory bioassay. Before starting experiment the ticks were kept in room temperature for 24 h.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2007</a>) was used. The walls of transparent-plastic Falcon tubes (50 ml centrifugal tube: 116 × 29 mm) were perforated, to prevent the internal air saturation with the observer odor, test or control substances. A 100 µl of each EO solution (1 mg/ml) was applied evenly on a cotton cloth with a pipette to get a final concentration of 15 µg/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Control cotton cloths were treated with 100 µl hexane. The treated and control cloths were air dried for 2 min for solvent evaporation. Freshly collected unfed 
   <span class="italic">I</span>. 
   <span class="italic">ricinus</span> nymph was introduced into Falcon tube and firstly tested with hexane treated cloth (that fixed to the Falcon upper end with the help of rubber band) for 5 min and immediately after the same nymph was tested against the EO treated cloth for another 5 min (one cloth used for each nymph). In order to simulate the nymph, the observer held his hand palm on the outer surface of the cloth during the observation period (5 min). The same observer conducted the entire bioassay who was attractive to ticks. A tick nymph was considered “attracted” to the cloth if it detached all its legs from the wall of the Falcon tube and clung towards the treated cloth within 5 min, whereas the nymph which failed to reach the cloth in this time or/and turned around the Falcon tube wall was regarded as “repelled” (El-Seedi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>). Ten nymphs were used/each oil/each replicate. Five replicates were used, thus the overall tick number was 50 nymphs for each EO and control group. The percentage of repellency was calculated using the formula of Jaenson et al. (
