 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental results revealed that all essential oils from eleven Egyptian plants were to various degree repellent to 
  <span class="italic">I</span>. 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> nymphs. The most active essential oils were 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba alba</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> that elicited strong repellent activity against tick nymphs by 94, 84.2 and 82.0%, respectively (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. majus</span> oils revealed moderate repellent activity by 70.6 and 68.3%, respectively. The oils from

  <span class="italic">camara</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. visnaga</span>, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>.

  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">oleander</span> elicited repellency by 63.3, 62.4, 61.2, and 60%, respectively. A minimum repellent activity was observed by the oils of
