 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Usually the biological activity of a plant extract is due the presence of one or more major compounds (El-Seedi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>) but in the case of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span> essential oil, it seems the greater activity is due to presence of blend of diverse type of compounds which might have additional or synergistic effects. However, in case of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> there was a number of major compounds which could be responsible for its higher activity. 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> produced the same oxygenated sesquiterpene as major compounds but the amount and bioactivity was slightly different between species. The most abundant compound of these plant oils was α-cadinol that was detected only in the essential oils of these two plants. α-Cadinol was found to be highly effective for controlling two house mite species 
  <span class="italic">Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. farinae</span> (Chang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2001</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span> in the present study is partly in accordance with Grace (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2002</a>), where he presented the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Pluchea</span> (=
  <span class="italic">Conyza</span>) 
  <span class="italic">dioscoridis</span> which consisted of both sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in large proportions with α-cadinol as the major constituent. However, our results are different from other previous studies (Nassar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>; Elshamy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2015</a>). Both studies showed that the major constituents of 
  <span class="italic">C. dioscoridis</span> essential oil were mainly sesquiterpene hydrocarbons comprising more than 40% of the oil whereas there are more of oxygenated sesquiterpenes in the present essential oil. This difference in chemical composition might partly be explained by harvesting time, soil fertility, cultivation and drying methods of the plant materials have a significant impact on the chemical composition of essential oils (Okoh et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2007</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2008</a>; Hussain et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2011</a>). The effect of soil type and the seasonal variations on the quality and quantity of essential oil constituents was investigated by Omer et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2008</a>) and Hussain et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2008</a>). There is also a correlation between the age of plants and their essential oil yield and composition (Okoh et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2007</a>) as well as harvesting season of three rose-scented geranium (
  <span class="italic">Pelargonium grayeolens</span> L’Her ex Ait; Geraniaceae) cultivars (Verma et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2013</a>).

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Egyptian 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> studied here with α-cadinol as major component of the essential oil and is in accordance with previous studies conducted in South Africa (Okoh et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2007</a>) and Brazil (Gazim et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2008</a>). The effect of plant age on the yield and constituents of the oil extracted from the 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> grown in South Africa was determined by Okoh et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2007</a>) and found that the most interesting stage is the post-flowering period, the oil of which rich in α-cadinene, α-cadinol, τ-muurolol, limonene and 1,8-cineole. Gazim et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2008</a>) stated the presence of α-cadinol in Brazilian 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> essential oil. The species has a long history in traditional medicine as Ibn El Bitar reported the use of this species in the treatment of epilepsy and as remedy for cold, colic and rheumatic pains (Boulos and El-Hadidi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">1984</a>).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, different chemotypes of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba alba</span> have been previously described originating from different localities. Identification of Sinai chemotype was achieved by GC–MS and two main oils were discerned, the cineole-bornane type and pinene type. The oils were rich in monoterpenes but did not contain any sesquiterpene components (Feuerstein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1986</a>). This is not consistent with our findings where we found piperitone as main compound. Essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">A. herba alba</span> from Israel revealed the presence of sesquiterpene lactone and oxygenated monoterpenes (Segal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1985</a>). The population in Israel consist of a larger number of chemotypes of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba alba</span> than was previously believed (Fleisher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2002</a>). An additional 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba alba</span> chemotype was described in Spain (Salido et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2004</a>). Some Tunisian 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">herba alba</span> chemotypes showed the presence of similar compounds as in our essential oil however, the composition of the constituents was different (Mohsen and Ali 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2009</a>). Another study from 
  <span class="italic">A. herba alba</span> essential oil from Tunisia described the presence of a number of potential tick repellent compounds; α-thujone (24.9%), germacrene D (14.5%), camphor (10.8%), 1,8-cineole (8.9%), β-thujone (8.3%), chrysanthenone (4.7%) and borneol (3.1%) in Kadri et al.

  <span class="italic">majus</span> (68.3%) essential oil towards tick 
  <span class="italic">I</span>. 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> in the present study could be explained by the presence of carvone, dihydrocarvone and piperitone. These three in combination are possible candidates for the repellent activity. The essential oil of

  <span class="italic">vulgare</span> consisted of only six compounds contributing more than 98% of the oil. Limonene, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-allylanisole, and fenchone were the most abundant compounds in this essential oil that could be responsible for its biological activity. Limonene is used as an insecticide to control ectoparasites and has activity against many plant-feeding insects as the pine weevil (Nordlander

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the analyzed plants, exhibited repellent behavior against 
  <span class="italic">I</span>. 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> and all the oils contained oxygenated terpenes. However, the most active essential oils did not have similar volatile profiles. The current result strongly indicate that the oils contain a number of compounds having repellent properties and that many of them belong to the oxygenated group of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The recent analyses did not include separation of the enantiomers of the chiral constituents. This lacking information might explain why essential oils with similar constituents have different repellent activity. However, it seems unlikely to find a specific compound in common that can explain the whole repellent activity, and most probably there is a combined effect of several constituents (Jaenson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2005</a>). The essential oils containing many tick repellent compounds might then be more useful and sustainable in tick control strategies.
