 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) are two commonly used gene fingerprinting techniques that separate different DNA/RNA in the same sample via chemical or temperature gradients. Muyzer et al. (
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">1993</a>) first introduced DGGE into the field of microbial ecology to describe the composition of bacterial communities. Different bands on the gel indicate different bacterial phylotypes and band intensity shows the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa. By cutting DGGE/TGGE strips, building clone libraries, and sequencing, the information related to a band can be further interpreted. Although the information provided by these two techniques are thought to be insufficient (as there are always dozens of bands for one sample) and NGS can generate more data, DGGE/TGGE techniques are still widely used to study microbial communities as they can intuitively display the differences between different samples via gel profiles within short time periods (1–2 d for an experimental cycle).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the DWH oil spills, DGGE provided some of the first information on naturally occurring microbial communities in the sediment from shorelines along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Lisle, 
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">2011</a>). Some active bacterial species exhibited increases in biomass during the degradation process. Bacosa et al. (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2015a</a>) used 16S rRNA gene-based DGGE to detect microbial community dynamics and composition with the stressor of Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude oil under dark and natural light conditions. The results demonstrated that different bacterial groups were involved in the degradation of n-alkane under the dark and light conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like DGGE/TGGE, TRFLP, or sometimes T-RLP is another gene fingerprinting technique. By generating a fingerprint for pattern comparison and then complementing the data with a clone library, resolving peaks using a database, and performing multivariate analysis, TRFLP can reveal the differences in unknown microbial communities in various environmental samples (Liu et al., 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">1997</a>). T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group 
  <span class="italic">Flavobacteria</span>, which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>). Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with 
  <span class="italic">Flavobacteria</span>, whereas this number was only 10–30% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>). In a recent study, the TRFLP analysis for community composition of ammonia oxidizers in salt marshes after the DWH oil spill revealed that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, could contribute to subtle changes in population dynamics of bacterial communities (Bernhard et al., 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2016</a>). Although T-RFLP could provide more authentic data compared to clone libraries, it could still underestimate community diversity, especially when complex and large amounts of data were applied. In the abovementioned study (Redmond and Valentine, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>), some terminal restriction fragments could be assigned to multiple groups. Due to the significant overlaps between the 
  <span class="italic">methanotrophs, methylotrophs</span>, and some other γ-
  <span class="italic">proteobacteria</span>, it was not possible to distinguish the δ-
  <span class="italic">proteobacteria, Actinobacteria</span>, and SAR406 clades from each other. Nevertheless, some groups, such as 
  <span class="italic">Flavobacteria</span>, α-
  <span class="italic">proteobacteria</span>, and γ-
  <span class="italic">proteobacteria</span> could be readily differentiated.
