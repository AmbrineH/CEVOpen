 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA microarrays are collections of microscopic DNA spots, representing single target genes, that are attached to a chemical matrix and arrayed on a solid surface. By DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization, DNA microarrays can provide qualitative or quantitative measurements of microbial diversity and functional gene expression (Loy et al., 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2002</a>; Bodrossy et al., 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2003</a>). This method has been used for nearly 20 years and has experienced several generations of improvement. By hybridizing target genes with probes attached to a specific microchip, DNA microarrays can provide a deep understanding of indigenous microbial communities because of its advantages of specificity, sensitivity, quantitative analysis, and high-throughput methods (Gentry et al., 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2006</a>). Two different DNA microarray methods (PhyloChip and GeoChip) have been extensively used in the field of environmental microbiology. PhyloChip can be used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities, while the GeoChip method can be used to study the activity of functional microbes by targeting functional genes. These two different microarrays can be used together to study and compare microbial communities from different treatments or environments.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both PhyloChip and GeoChip were applied to investigate the succession of bacterial communities and reveal the functional genes in the biodegradation of oil pollution during the DWH oil spill (Bodrossy et al., 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2003</a>; Hazen et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>; Beazley et al., 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>). The PhyloChip analysis of 16S rRNA microarray conducted by Hazen et al. (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>) suggested that the oil plume significantly altered the microbial community composition and structure. In addition, the functional gene-based GeoChip microarray analysis revealed significant increases in the expression of more than 1,600 genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (BTEX, alkane, cycloalkanes, and PAH) compared to the background non-plume samples (Hazen et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>). In another study, the microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico's coastal marshes during and after the oil spill were determined via both GeoChip and PhyloChip (Beazley et al., 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>). A total of 12,018 operation taxonomy units (OTUs) were successfully identified by PhyloChip microarray-based analysis, and the result demonstrated that bacterial phyla with potential genes for oil degradation exhibited significant increases after the oil spill. For instance, bacterial phyla affiliated to 
  <span class="italic">Actinomycetaceae, Dietziaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Erythrobacteraceae</span>, and others, which have been shown to be capable of degrading alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dramatically increased during the oil infiltration of sediments. In contrast, bacterial phyla of 
  <span class="italic">Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Planctomycete</span> showed obvious decreases due to their relatively low tolerance to oil pollution. GeoChip microarray-based analysis was used to identify 16,383 unique functional genes. The results indicated that a relative abundance of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">alkB, alkH, phaB, dsrA/B</span>, and others) were significantly increased between June and July in the inlet sediments (Beazley et al., 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A single chip can be used to analyze thousands of genes in one assay. Therefore, microarrays are becoming one of the major culture-independent identification/quantification methods. However, the microarray technique faces the challenges of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridization in complex environmental bioaerosols (Li and Huang, 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2006</a>). Lack of a probe sequence and the complexity of the gene chip's interactive hybridization have been shown to induce low specificity and poor sensitivity of experimental results (Zhou and Thompson, 
  <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">2002</a>; Gentry et al., 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2006</a>).
