 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 16S rRNA gene has been applied to study the diversity of bacterial communities via cultivation, cloning, T-RFLP, and other traditional microbiological approaches. While the information generated from these approaches can preliminarily illustrate the composition of bacterial communities, their application has been restricted by limited information, high cost, and omission of “rare biospheres.” The NGS techniques, e.g., Roche's 454 GS20 pyrosequencing (Margulies et al., 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2005</a>), Illumina Hiseq/Miseq sequencing (Bennett, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2004</a>), ion torrent sequencing (Rothberg et al., 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">2011</a>), and “single-molecule real-time” (SMRT) sequencing (Eid et al., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2009</a>), allowed the generation of massive data sets at a much lower cost (Medini et al., 
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">2008</a>; Armougom and Raoult, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2009</a>; Klindworth et al., 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DWH oil spill occurred in 2010, when the use of high-throughput sequencing was on the rise. The new techniques of microbial ecology were comprehensively applied after the event to reveal the impacts of the oil spill on bacterial communities and the responses of different bacterial phyla (Gutierrez, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2011</a>). 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was the first NGS technique applied in this event (Bælum et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2012</a>), providing information on the succession of bacterial communities. The results, based on the NGS data, specifically showed the increase in the bacterial phyla 
  <span class="italic">Colwelliaceae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Oceanospirillales</span>, which was consistent with the results from 16S rRNA gene-based clone library and PhyloChip (Hazen et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>; Redmond and Valentine, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>). The results were based on the analysis of 148,276 quality-filtered reads from 16 samples, whereas the first study after the spill which applied 16S rRNA gene based clone library only generated 250 high qualitied sequences from three samples (Hazen et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>). The great amount of sequencing could produce more useful information for revealing the bacterial responses to the oil spill. Illumina sequencing was also used in later studies (Mason et al., 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>, 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2014b</a>; Simister et al., 
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2016</a>). For instance, by analyzing massive amounts of data generated by Illumina sequencing, Simister et al. (
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2016</a>) found that the dominant bacteria in both sediment and floc samples were 
  <span class="italic">Proteobacteria</span> (55–64%). They also found that the bacterial composition of the floc samples (mostly aerobic or facultative aerobic phylotypes including 
  <span class="italic">Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, Rickettsiales, Alteromonadales</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonadales</span>) was different from those in the sediment samples (aforementioned aerobic species and anaerobic phylotypes such as 
  <span class="italic">Desulfobacterales, Desulfuromonadales</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Desulfarculales</span>).
