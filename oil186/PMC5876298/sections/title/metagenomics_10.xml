 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metagenomics is a genetic analysis aimed at studying the genetic composition and community structure of microorganisms by directly analyzing DNA mixtures from microbial communities in different environmental samples (Warnecke and Hess, 
  <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">2009</a>; Coyotzi et al., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2016</a>). Metagenomic approaches have revolutionized our ability to explore the microbial world by producing results that conventional cloning and sequencing methods have not been able to achieve (Gutierrez, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2011</a>). 16S rRNA gene based analysis mainly characterize a bacterial community by defining its composition, succession and the relative abundance of different groups, while metagenomics analysis can afford useful metabolic information for investigating microbe functions (Scholz et al., 
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">2012</a>). It is helpful to fully understand uncultured microbes and provide a complete understanding of microbial activity at community levels. Specifically, metagenomic approaches enable a mechanistic understanding of the bioremediating processes and can provide some hints for optimizing the efficiency of bioremediation (Techtmann and Hazen, 
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">2016</a>). For instance, by analyzing metagenomic sequence data, some overlooked but important functional executor and functional genes can be explored (Jackson et al., 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2015</a>; Campeão et al., 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2017</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before NGS became prevalent, metagenomic analysis based on shotgun sequencing data was constrained by the limited data on individual genomes and environmental genetic data. The high-throughput, short runtime, and low-cost attributes of NGS have altered our overview of microbial metagenomics (Scholz et al., 
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">2012</a>). By applying metagenomic analysis, (Mason et al. (
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>, 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2014b</a>)) investigated the responses of bacterial communities in deep sea oil plumes and sediment. Metagenomic data from these two studies demonstrated that the indigenous microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service of oil remediation in the Gulf of Mexico. Functional genes encoding for the degradation of aliphatic and simple aromatics hydrocarbon were significantly enriched after the oil spill. Nevertheless, no dramatic changes were found in the abundance of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs. This indicated that recalcitrant compounds could not be actively degraded at the sampling time and that these compounds might need a longer period for biodegradation. Another study based on metagenomic analysis found that a greater number of δ
  <span class="italic">-proteobacteria</span> and anaerobic functional genes were present in sediments closer to the DWH blowout site, which indicated that δ
  <span class="italic">-proteobacteria</span> might play a dominant role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Kimes et al., 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">2013</a>).
