 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional approaches applied in ecological microbiology have promoted developments in this field for decades and have provided general information on the existence (FISH), composition (Clone Library, DGGE/TGGE, FISH, and T-RTLP), and abundance (Clone Library and RT-qPCR) of microbes. Nevertheless, the information generated by these approaches is finite, and the unit cost (the cost per sequence) is relatively expensive. For instance, only dozens of DGGE bands or clones could be identified by combining the techniques of DGGE and clone libraries which could only generate limited information and hardly reflected on the real composition of bacterial communities. Furthermore, the unit cost for a single sequence can be much higher by Sanger sequencing than NGS. With the development of new approaches, such as DNA/RNA microarrays, NGS, and SIP, ecological microbiology research is faced with new opportunities. These currently prevalent techniques can generate massive data sets for detailed investigation on the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in different habitats or following particular events. Some new techniques that provide impressive information have been used in investigating the succession and function of the microbial communities after the DWH oil spill.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA microarray</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA microarrays are collections of microscopic DNA spots, representing single target genes, that are attached to a chemical matrix and arrayed on a solid surface. By DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization, DNA microarrays can provide qualitative or quantitative measurements of microbial diversity and functional gene expression (Loy et al., 
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2002</a>; Bodrossy et al., 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2003</a>). This method has been used for nearly 20 years and has experienced several generations of improvement. By hybridizing target genes with probes attached to a specific microchip, DNA microarrays can provide a deep understanding of indigenous microbial communities because of its advantages of specificity, sensitivity, quantitative analysis, and high-throughput methods (Gentry et al., 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2006</a>). Two different DNA microarray methods (PhyloChip and GeoChip) have been extensively used in the field of environmental microbiology. PhyloChip can be used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities, while the GeoChip method can be used to study the activity of functional microbes by targeting functional genes. These two different microarrays can be used together to study and compare microbial communities from different treatments or environments.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both PhyloChip and GeoChip were applied to investigate the succession of bacterial communities and reveal the functional genes in the biodegradation of oil pollution during the DWH oil spill (Bodrossy et al., 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2003</a>; Hazen et al., 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>; Beazley et al., 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>). The PhyloChip analysis of 16S rRNA microarray conducted by Hazen et al. (
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>) suggested that the oil plume significantly altered the microbial community composition and structure. In addition, the functional gene-based GeoChip microarray analysis revealed significant increases in the expression of more than 1,600 genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (BTEX, alkane, cycloalkanes, and PAH) compared to the background non-plume samples (Hazen et al., 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>). In another study, the microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico's coastal marshes during and after the oil spill were determined via both GeoChip and PhyloChip (Beazley et al., 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>). A total of 12,018 operation taxonomy units (OTUs) were successfully identified by PhyloChip microarray-based analysis, and the result demonstrated that bacterial phyla with potential genes for oil degradation exhibited significant increases after the oil spill. For instance, bacterial phyla affiliated to 
   <span class="italic">Actinomycetaceae, Dietziaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Erythrobacteraceae</span>, and others, which have been shown to be capable of degrading alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dramatically increased during the oil infiltration of sediments. In contrast, bacterial phyla of 
   <span class="italic">Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Planctomycete</span> showed obvious decreases due to their relatively low tolerance to oil pollution. GeoChip microarray-based analysis was used to identify 16,383 unique functional genes. The results indicated that a relative abundance of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">alkB, alkH, phaB, dsrA/B</span>, and others) were significantly increased between June and July in the inlet sediments (Beazley et al., 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A single chip can be used to analyze thousands of genes in one assay. Therefore, microarrays are becoming one of the major culture-independent identification/quantification methods. However, the microarray technique faces the challenges of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridization in complex environmental bioaerosols (Li and Huang, 
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2006</a>). Lack of a probe sequence and the complexity of the gene chip's interactive hybridization have been shown to induce low specificity and poor sensitivity of experimental results (Zhou and Thompson, 
   <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">2002</a>; Gentry et al., 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2006</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">16S rRNA gene based high-throughput sequencing</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 16S rRNA gene has been applied to study the diversity of bacterial communities via cultivation, cloning, T-RFLP, and other traditional microbiological approaches. While the information generated from these approaches can preliminarily illustrate the composition of bacterial communities, their application has been restricted by limited information, high cost, and omission of “rare biospheres.” The NGS techniques, e.g., Roche's 454 GS20 pyrosequencing (Margulies et al., 
   <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2005</a>), Illumina Hiseq/Miseq sequencing (Bennett, 
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2004</a>), ion torrent sequencing (Rothberg et al., 
   <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">2011</a>), and “single-molecule real-time” (SMRT) sequencing (Eid et al., 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2009</a>), allowed the generation of massive data sets at a much lower cost (Medini et al., 
   <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">2008</a>; Armougom and Raoult, 
   <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2009</a>; Klindworth et al., 
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DWH oil spill occurred in 2010, when the use of high-throughput sequencing was on the rise. The new techniques of microbial ecology were comprehensively applied after the event to reveal the impacts of the oil spill on bacterial communities and the responses of different bacterial phyla (Gutierrez, 
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2011</a>). 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was the first NGS technique applied in this event (Bælum et al., 
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2012</a>), providing information on the succession of bacterial communities. The results, based on the NGS data, specifically showed the increase in the bacterial phyla 
   <span class="italic">Colwelliaceae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Oceanospirillales</span>, which was consistent with the results from 16S rRNA gene-based clone library and PhyloChip (Hazen et al., 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>; Redmond and Valentine, 
   <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>). The results were based on the analysis of 148,276 quality-filtered reads from 16 samples, whereas the first study after the spill which applied 16S rRNA gene based clone library only generated 250 high qualitied sequences from three samples (Hazen et al., 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>). The great amount of sequencing could produce more useful information for revealing the bacterial responses to the oil spill. Illumina sequencing was also used in later studies (Mason et al., 
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>, 
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2014b</a>; Simister et al., 
   <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2016</a>). For instance, by analyzing massive amounts of data generated by Illumina sequencing, Simister et al. (
   <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2016</a>) found that the dominant bacteria in both sediment and floc samples were 
   <span class="italic">Proteobacteria</span> (55–64%). They also found that the bacterial composition of the floc samples (mostly aerobic or facultative aerobic phylotypes including 
   <span class="italic">Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, Rickettsiales, Alteromonadales</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Pseudomonadales</span>) was different from those in the sediment samples (aforementioned aerobic species and anaerobic phylotypes such as 
   <span class="italic">Desulfobacterales, Desulfuromonadales</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Desulfarculales</span>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metagenomics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metagenomics is a genetic analysis aimed at studying the genetic composition and community structure of microorganisms by directly analyzing DNA mixtures from microbial communities in different environmental samples (Warnecke and Hess, 
   <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">2009</a>; Coyotzi et al., 
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2016</a>). Metagenomic approaches have revolutionized our ability to explore the microbial world by producing results that conventional cloning and sequencing methods have not been able to achieve (Gutierrez, 
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2011</a>). 16S rRNA gene based analysis mainly characterize a bacterial community by defining its composition, succession and the relative abundance of different groups, while metagenomics analysis can afford useful metabolic information for investigating microbe functions (Scholz et al., 
   <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">2012</a>). It is helpful to fully understand uncultured microbes and provide a complete understanding of microbial activity at community levels. Specifically, metagenomic approaches enable a mechanistic understanding of the bioremediating processes and can provide some hints for optimizing the efficiency of bioremediation (Techtmann and Hazen, 
   <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">2016</a>). For instance, by analyzing metagenomic sequence data, some overlooked but important functional executor and functional genes can be explored (Jackson et al., 
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2015</a>; Campeão et al., 
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before NGS became prevalent, metagenomic analysis based on shotgun sequencing data was constrained by the limited data on individual genomes and environmental genetic data. The high-throughput, short runtime, and low-cost attributes of NGS have altered our overview of microbial metagenomics (Scholz et al., 
   <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">2012</a>). By applying metagenomic analysis, (Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>, 
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2014b</a>)) investigated the responses of bacterial communities in deep sea oil plumes and sediment. Metagenomic data from these two studies demonstrated that the indigenous microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service of oil remediation in the Gulf of Mexico. Functional genes encoding for the degradation of aliphatic and simple aromatics hydrocarbon were significantly enriched after the oil spill. Nevertheless, no dramatic changes were found in the abundance of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs. This indicated that recalcitrant compounds could not be actively degraded at the sampling time and that these compounds might need a longer period for biodegradation. Another study based on metagenomic analysis found that a greater number of δ
   <span class="italic">-proteobacteria</span> and anaerobic functional genes were present in sediments closer to the DWH blowout site, which indicated that δ
   <span class="italic">-proteobacteria</span> might play a dominant role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Kimes et al., 
   <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">2013</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metatranscriptomics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metagenomics can provide useful information on the genomic potential of a microbial community, whereas metatranscriptomics can be used to investigate genes that are transcribed under certain environmental conditions. It can assess microbial gene expression in a special environment or under unusual conditions via pyrosequencing of total RNA directly extracted from natural microbial assemblages (Shi et al., 
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">2009</a>; Warnecke and Hess, 
   <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">2009</a>). Metatranscriptomic data takes into account the dynamic state of RNA levels and thereby overcomes the constraint of metagenomics which relies on DNA for the reconstruction of metabolic models to improve prediction accuracy. Thus, metatranscriptomic analysis could provide supporting data or more convincing data in comparison to metagenomic analysis. In addition to metagenomic analysis, Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>) conducted metatranscriptomic analysis to determine the expressed functional genes in the active microbial community in the oil plume. Metatranscriptomic data revealed more pronounced differences in the relative abundance of active genes that have the potential for biodegradation compared to DNA-based analysis. These active genes were mostly associated with aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation but not PAH degradation, which is consistent with metagenomic analysis. In a study that considered the microbial communities of methane degradation (Lesniewski et al., 
   <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">2012</a>), data generated from metatranscriptomics revealed that the bacterial communities of both the plume and background samples were dominated by the same groups of methanotrophs and chemolithoautotrophs despite marked increases in plume total RNA concentrations (3–4 times) and microbial-mediated manganese oxidation rates (15–125 times background levels).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Single-cell sequencing</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Single-cell sequencing is a newly developed technique to obtain genomes of individual microorganisms. This technique was first reported by Raghunathan et al. (
   <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">2005</a>) and was selected as the method of the year in 2013 by “Nature Publishing Group.” Single cells can be first isolated from various environments (soil, seawater, marine sediments, and human gastrointestinal tracts) by micro manipulation, flow cytometry or microfluidics. The whole genomes of selected single cells are then amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to generate sufficient amounts of genetic material for sequencing. Genomes can be sequenced by NGS and analyzed by new methods in bioinformatics (SPAdes) (Woyke et al., 
   <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">2009</a>). By generating genomic information on previously inaccessible species from different environments, the structure of microbial communities and the physiology of single cells can be deeply investigated. Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>) successfully obtained two single-cell genomes of the genus 
   <span class="italic">Oceanospirillales</span>, which have been shown to be dominant phylotypes after the DWH oil spill (Hazen et al., 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2010</a>; Redmond and Valentine, 
   <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>). Single-cell sequencing revealed that both cells possessed genes encoding for n-alkane and cycloalkane degradation. Furthermore, the genomic information helped in the reconstruction of the near-complete pathway for cyclohexane oxidation in the two single cells. This provided powerful evidence proving that bacteria in the order 
   <span class="italic">Oceanospirillales</span> were responsible for the biodegradation of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the deep sea (Mason et al., 
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>). Thus, with the support of metagenomic sequencing data, single-cell sequencing analysis (e.g., the genomic properties of 
   <span class="italic">Colwellia</span>) could extend our understanding of the successional changes of the dominant microbial players (Mason et al., 
   <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">2014a</a>) and their specific metabolic activities in biochemical cycle (Musat et al., 
   <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">2012</a>).
