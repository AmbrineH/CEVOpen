  <p>Summary of various methods that have been applied and techniques that could be applied, but have not yet been conducted, to investigate the responses of microbial communities to the DWH oil spill. 
   <span class="bold">(A)</span> The histogram based on 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput data can reveal microbial diversity and community succession. 
   <span class="bold">(B)</span> The histogram based on genomic and transcriptomic data analysis can identify and classify different functional genes involved in different pathways based on the COG database. 
   <span class="bold">(C)</span> The reconstructed molecular ecological network between microorganisms based on 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data can indicate the interactions and co-acclimation of microorganisms in a changing environment. 
   <span class="bold">(D)</span> Phylogenetic relationship and community succession can be detected by generating a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene and genomic information. All these figures were generated based on our own unpublished data.
