 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stable DPPH free radical has been widely approved as a tool for the free radical-scavenging activity assessment in antioxidants (Nagai et al., 2003). In the DPPH test, the antioxidants managed to reduce the stable DPPH radical to yellow-colored diphenylpricryhydrazine. The effects of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging are attributed to their hydrogen-donating ability (Ye et al., 2013). In this study, an 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> examination of the free radical scavenging activity of the essential oils is presented. The essential oils showed the highest reduction ability with an IC50 of 49.2 μg/m1. BHT and ascorbic acid were employed as positive controls that exhibited antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 28.7 μg/m1 and 87.3 μg/m1, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschy</span> essential oils can be attributed to their richness in monoterpenes (70%), especially oxygenated monoterpenes (43%). Previous studies also revealed that essential oils with high percentage of monoterpenes (Ghasemi Pirbalouti et al., 2014; Luís, et al., 2016) exhibit antioxidant activities, which is in good agreement with our results. The current results suggest that synergistic activities of multiform unsaturated compounds of essential oils can be responsible for their antioxidant activity.

  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> showed good cytotoxic action towards the human tumor cell line. Based on the cytotoxic activity obtained from MTT assay, the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for HeLa and lymphocyte cells were calculated to be 26.4 μg/m1 and 4266.7 μg/m1, respectively. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> showed higher cytotoxicity of the oil towards the human tumor cell line in comparison with healthy human cells requirement.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that the essential oil of a plant at the concentrations that is has antibacterial properties has no damaging effect on the Lymphocyte cells is accepted as an indicator to measure the safety in oil consumption in foods (Taherkhani, 2014). These results also suggest lower adverse side effects of the 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschy</span> essential oils. Geranial (12.08%) and Neral (8.9%) composed over twenty percent of the 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> oil. Neral and geranial are the two stereoisomers of citral. Geranial (also known as citral a) is an 
  <span class="italic">(E</span>)-isomer and neral (also known as citral b) has a (Z)- configuration. Studies showed anticancer properties of citral (Dubey et al., 1997). Citral was reported to be cytotoxic to P388 mouse leukemia cells at an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 7.1 μg/m1.
