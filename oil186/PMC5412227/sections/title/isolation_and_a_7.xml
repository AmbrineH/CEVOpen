 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A portion (300 g) of the dried and compeletly ground aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> was submitted to water distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus (British type) for 3 h. The average yield of the extraction was 0.6% w/w according to the dry weight of the sample. The yellow oil of the plant was dried over dry sodium sulfate and stored at +4 ° C after filtration.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of the essential oil were performed by application of gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). According to the property of the essential oil extract, the condition of GC or GC-MS was optimized. GC-FID analysis was conducted on a HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m*0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Helium (purity 99.999%) with flow rate of 0.9 ml/min was employed as the carrier gas. The column oven temperature was incresed from 50 °C (hold 1 min) to 240 °C (hold 10 min) with the rate of 5 °C/min. The injector and FID detector temperatures were aslo 230 and 300 °C, respectively. The injector was operated in the split less mode and programmed to return to the split mode after 1 min from the beginning of the run. Diluted samples (1/10 in ether, v/v) of 0.3 μL were injected manually, and the split ratio was adjusted to 50:1.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis was carried out in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973 MSD applying helium as the carrier gas (0.9 ml/min, and the same capillary column previously mentioned). The column temperature was raised from 50 (hold 3 min) to 180 “C at the rate of 5 “C/min and to 240 “C at 10 “C/min rate; and then was kept stable for an additional 20 min at 280 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 280 °C, respectively. A 0.3-μl sample was injected using the split mode (split ratio 50:1). Oil components were analyzed and identified by comparison of MS fragmentation pattern with that of pure compounds, corresponding data in the literature (Adams 2007) and/or computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley 138K and NIST 98). For gaining the retention indices, a standard solution of 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C6-C26) was used (Jennings and Shibamoto 1980). Also, the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without using any correction factors was employed for obtaining quantitative data.
