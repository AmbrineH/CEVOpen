  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A portion (300 g) of the dried and compeletly ground aerial parts of 
   <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> was submitted to water distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus (British type) for 3 h. The average yield of the extraction was 0.6% w/w according to the dry weight of the sample. The yellow oil of the plant was dried over dry sodium sulfate and stored at +4 ° C after filtration.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of the essential oil were performed by application of gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). According to the property of the essential oil extract, the condition of GC or GC-MS was optimized. GC-FID analysis was conducted on a HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m*0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Helium (purity 99.999%) with flow rate of 0.9 ml/min was employed as the carrier gas. The column oven temperature was incresed from 50 °C (hold 1 min) to 240 °C (hold 10 min) with the rate of 5 °C/min. The injector and FID detector temperatures were aslo 230 and 300 °C, respectively. The injector was operated in the split less mode and programmed to return to the split mode after 1 min from the beginning of the run. Diluted samples (1/10 in ether, v/v) of 0.3 μL were injected manually, and the split ratio was adjusted to 50:1.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis was carried out in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973 MSD applying helium as the carrier gas (0.9 ml/min, and the same capillary column previously mentioned). The column temperature was raised from 50 (hold 3 min) to 180 “C at the rate of 5 “C/min and to 240 “C at 10 “C/min rate; and then was kept stable for an additional 20 min at 280 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 280 °C, respectively. A 0.3-μl sample was injected using the split mode (split ratio 50:1). Oil components were analyzed and identified by comparison of MS fragmentation pattern with that of pure compounds, corresponding data in the literature (Adams 2007) and/or computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley 138K and NIST 98). For gaining the retention indices, a standard solution of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C6-C26) was used (Jennings and Shibamoto 1980). Also, the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without using any correction factors was employed for obtaining quantitative data.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The protocols used in this study were conducted according to the guidelines of CLSI, formerly known as NCCLS (Wayne 2007) with slight modifications. In summary, each sterile Petri dish with a diameter of 9 cm was prepared with 20 ml of Mueller-Hinton medium. Then, 100 μL of a bacterial suspension (10
   <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/mL) was spread on the plates. After 5 min, a sterile filter paper disc (6 mm) containing 20 μL of 
   <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> essential oil was placed on the surface of the plate. In order to accelerate essential oil diffusion into the agar, the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 °C, for 24 to 48 h. The diameters of the inhibition zones (mm) were measured, including the diameter of the disks. Gentamycin (30 μg/disk) and vancomycin (30 μg/disk) served as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative, respectively. All tests were performed in triplicate.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since it is an essential oil and not easily dissolved in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) nutrient medium, in order to dissolve the essential oil in the nutrient medium, first it is dissolved in the organic solvent DMSO and then added to the nutrient medium MHB located on a shaker (100 rpm) so that the oil is uniformly dissolved in all parts of the medium. Each ml of 
   <span class="italic">D.kotschyi</span> oil weights 0.68 g. 300 ml oil is dissolved in 300 μl DMSO solution and then using a nutrient solution MHB, the volume is increased to 1000 μl and spin and vortex for 5 minutes (2000 rpm) so that a stock with a concentration of 20480 μg/m1 is prepared and then by serial dilution in nutrient medium MHB the concentrations of 20 to 5120 μg/m1 oil are prepared in the wells. The final DMSO concentration was 5% (v/v), and this solution was selected as a negative control.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">96-well microtiter plates utilizing broth microdilution method was applied for the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations determination. In a typical procedure, the bacterial strains were cultured overnight at 37 °C on MHB, adjusted to a final density of 8 log CFU/mL, and used to inoculate (1-10) 96-well microtiter plates containing serial dilutions of the essential oils (5120-20 μg/m1) on MHB. A positive control containing the bacterial culture and broth without the plant oils was included in each test. The contents of each well were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 r/min for 30 seconds and then incubated at 37 C for 24 h, while 
   <span class="italic">Streptococcus agalactiae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</span> were incubated for 48 h. Then, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, T8877) was used for the visual indicator of bacterial growth. The MIC of the essential oils was regarded as the lowest concentration showing no growth.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples exhibiting no turbidity were sub-cultured; however, the lowest concentration from which the microorganisms did not recover was the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity: Free radical scavenging Capacity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The free radical scavenging capacity of the essential oils and two positive controls, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; Sigma, W218405) and ascorbic acid (Sigma A4403), was assessed from bleaching the purple-colored methanol solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) according to the method of Brand-Williams et al. (1995). In such process, various methanolic oil concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 μg/m1) were mixed with the same volume of a 0.2 mM methanolic solution of DPPH (Sigma, D9132). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The free radical scavenging capacity was calculated as follows:</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">% scavenging = 100 - (Abs sample - Abs control)/Abs DPPH × 100 %, where the Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample without DPPH. The oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentages against the oil concentrations. The assay was repeated three times.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line (NCBI code No.: 115; ATCC No.: CCL-2) and the human normal healthy lymphocyte cell line (NCBI code No.: 124; ECACC No.: 91112124) were obtained from the Pasteur Institute, Tehran-Iran. The lymphocyte cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% (w/v) glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/m1 streptomycin. They were cultured in a humid atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO2.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity assay detected the reduction of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to the formazan blue product, which is a reflection of the normal mitochondrial functioning and cell viability (Lau et al., 2004). Briefly, the cells (5× 10
   <span class="sup">4</span>) were seeded in wells containing 100 μl of the RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 96-well plate. After 24 hours of adhesion, different concentrations of the essential oils were added to triplicate wells over the range of 5120 to 20 μg/m1. After 2 days, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml stock solution) was added and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 hours. The medium was discarded, and the formazan blue formed in the cells was dissolved with 100 μl of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Quantification of formazan was performed using an ELISA microplate reader (SLT, Austria) at 490 nm. The cell viability curves were calculated with regard to the control cells. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50). All tests and analyses were run in triplicate, and the mean values were recorded.
