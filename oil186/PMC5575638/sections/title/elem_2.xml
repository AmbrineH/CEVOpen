  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bulbs of 
   <span class="italic">Allium sativum</span> were collected from a field in Las Pedroñeras, Spain (39°26′59″ N, 2°40′23″ W, 745 m elevation), in December 2015. Garlic bulbs were finely chopped, and were subjected to three different distillation methods: laboratory hydrodistillation using a Clevenger apparatus for 3 h, industrial hydrodistillation for 4 h, and industrial steam distillation for 5 h. Pale yellow essential oils were obtained in 0.2%, 0.22% and 0.18% yields, respectively. The obtained essential oils and hydrosol were separated by decantation; remaining water was removed from the essential oils with sodium chloride. The collected essential oil samples were stored under refrigeration (−4 °C) until analysis.

   <sub>2</sub>Cl
   <sub>2</sub>). Evaporation of the dichloromethane yielded pale yellow essential oils with an extremely pungent odor (
