  <span class="italic">Murraya koenigii</span> L. belongs to the family Rutaceae and is commonly known as Meethi neem or curry-leaf in Hindi, and is a native of south Asia. It is found almost everywhere in the Indian subcontinent and has an aromatic nature, growing up to 6 m in height. It is especially cultivated for its aromatic leaves [
  <a rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" href="#B159">159</a>]. Leaves are aromatic and contain proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, carotene, nicotinic acid and vitamin C. The leaves contain high amount of oxalic acid and also contain crystalline glycosides, carbazole alkaloids, koenigin and resin. Fresh leaves contain yellow-colored volatile oil that is also rich in vitamin A and calcium. It also contains girinimbin, iso-mahanimbin, koenine, koenigine, koenidine and koenimbine. Mahanimbicine, bicyclomahanimbicine, phebalosin, coumarine as murrayone imperatoxin etc are isolated from leaves. Triterpenoid alkaloids-cyclomahanimbine and tetrahydromahanmbine are present in the leaves. Alkaloids-murrayastine, murrayaline, pypayafolinecarbazole have been reported in the leaves of

  <span class="italic">M. koenigii</span> leaf extract was evaluated against 4 Gy γ-irradiation in liver of mice. The leaf extract itself was effective for significantly increasing reduced glutathione (GSH) content and antioxidant enzyme levels in liver as well as it reduced the radiation induced decrease in lipid peroxidation, thus indicating the antioxidant properties of extract possibly contributing for radioprotection [
