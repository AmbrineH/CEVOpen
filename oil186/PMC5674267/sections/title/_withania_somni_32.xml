  <span class="italic">W. somnifera</span> against radiation-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in liver were investigated in rats. 
  <span class="italic">Withania somnifera</span> treatment prior to radiation exposure showed significant decrease in hepatic enzymes, hepatic nitrate/nitrite ratio, MDA levels and DNA damage. Also, significant increase in heme oxygenase activity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione content suggests a possible role of
