  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> extract and oil was studied in mice and rats. The extract of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> was evaluated in mice to assess protection against radiation-induced damage [
  <a rid="B172" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172">172</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Nigella sativa</span> extract treatment showed significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and intracellular reactive oxygen species in splenocytes and increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, suggesting a radioprotective potential of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span>. Oral administration of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil before irradiation resulted in significant increase in blood malondialdehyde, nitrate and nitrite levels [
