It contains triterpenoids such as asiatcoside, centelloside, madecossoside, thankuniside, isothankunic acid, centellose, asiatic, centellic and madecassic acids. The other constituents includes brahmoside, brahminoside and brahmic acid. The structure of genin and brahmic acid has been elucidated as 2,6-hydroxy, 23-hydroxy-methyl ursolic acid. The fatty oil consists of glycerides of palmitic, stearic, lignoceric, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. An alkaloid, hydrocotylin, has been isolated from the dried plants. Asiaticoside, madecossoside and centelloside have been isolated from the plant parts. Flavanoids, 3-glucosylquercetin, 3-glucosylkaemferol and 7-glucosylkaemferol have been isolated from the leaves [
