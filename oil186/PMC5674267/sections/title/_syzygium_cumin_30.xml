  <span class="italic">Syzigium cumini</span> belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is also called 
  <span class="italic">Syzigium jambolanum</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Eugenia cumini</span>. It is grown throughout Asia, Africa and America, and also naturalized to Florida and Hawaii [
  <a rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" href="#B215">215</a>]. The plant has been reported to possess acetyl oleanolic acid, triterpenoids, ellagic acid, isoquercitin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin in different concentrations [
  <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">94</a>]. The radioprotective effects were studied in cultured human lymphocytes; it was noted that treatment with 
  <span class="italic">S. cumini</span> leaf extract prior to radiation exposure resulted in significant decrease in micronuclei induction [
  <a rid="B216" ref-type="bibr" href="#B216">216</a>]. Radioprotective effects of 
  <span class="italic">S. cumini</span> seed and leaf extracts were also studied in mice and found that pretreatment protected mice against radiation-induced sickness and mortality. The histopathological investigations showed that 
  <span class="italic">S. cumini</span> leaf extract treatment prior to radiation exposure increased villus height, number of crypts and reduced goblet and dead cells [
