  <span class="italic">Zingiber officinale</span> is commonly called ginger and belongs to the family Zingiberaceae. It is found in Asia and America. It is medicinal and aromatic and generally employed for culinary practices and remedial uses. The essential oil possesses antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities [

  <a rid="B229" ref-type="bibr" href="#B229">229</a>]. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antinoceceptive properties have also been reported [

  <a rid="B231" ref-type="bibr" href="#B231">231</a>]. Gingerol-related compounds such as gingerol, shagaols, gengediols, zingerone, dehydrozingerone, gingerinone and diarylheptanoids accord antioxidant capacity to the ginger rhizome. Geranial, camphene, p-cineole, α-terpineole, zingiberene and petandeconoic acid were the major components of the essential oil. However, eugenol was major components in ethanol oleoresin, and in methanol, CCl4 and isooctane oleoresin the zingerone was major component [

  <a rid="B232" ref-type="bibr" href="#B232">232–234</a>]. Radioprotective effects of ginger extract were demonstrated in rats exposed to X-irradiation on the liver, kidney and heart. Results indicated that ginger extract had significant antiradiation activity [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Antioxidant status and antioxidant enzymes were studied in rats with pretreatment of ginger extract and whole-body irradiated with γ-radiation. Hematological parameters were found to have significant recovery with respect to radiation-induced damage [
  <a rid="B174" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174">174</a>]. Essential oil of ginger was also evaluated for its radioprotective effects in mice, yielding a dose reduction factor of 1.4. Ginger oil was found to be effective in restoring antioxidant status and reducing the cytogenetic damage in terms of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei frequency and DNA damage in mice [
