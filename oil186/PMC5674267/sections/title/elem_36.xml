 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enhanced adverse effects of synthetic drugs and antibiotics has paved way toward utilization of natural products of plant origin in recent years in developed as well as developing countries. The present review explored the protection against radiation at cellular damage of approximately thirty aromatic plant extracts or plant-derived compounds. Most of the aromatic plant extracts or plant products have shown significant radioprotection in different model systems such as 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, 
  <span class="italic">ex vivo</span> and/or 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> for assessment of radiation-induced damage. The radical scavenging and antioxidant properties such as reduction in radiation-induced lipid peroxidation are some of the notable characteristics of aromatic plant extracts studied in various models of radiation insult. In most of the studies, it has been shown that while protecting against the detrimental effects of radiation, it also had capacity to significant increase survival rates in small animals exposed to radiation. Results of such studies point at possible application during radiotherapy as well as the possibility of finding application in treatment for victims of nuclear plant accidents or leakage, or radiation terrorism. Use of aromatic plants and their products has gained momentum globally during recent times with wide applications in the herbal drug industry. Natural resources such as wastelands and forests could serve as reservoir for the same. However, with the increasing burden on natural resources, alternatively, introduction of crops through cropping systems could help out to great extent with a check on activity including chemical composition. Also, the scientific community must be encouraged to focus studies to screen more and more aromatic compounds of plant origin for their different bioactivities, including radioprotection, and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved for the same.
