 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity test was performed by a similar procedure as antibacterial activity test. But PDA growth medium was used instead of NA medium. Positive control (Flucanozole 100 μg/mL) and essential oil containing petri dishs were incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 72 h. The MICs and MBCs of the selected fungi were also done by the micro dilution method as described in the antibacterial activity test.</p>
