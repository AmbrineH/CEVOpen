   <span class="italic">Pelargonium roseum </span>Willd. (Geraniaceae) is widely grown as an ornamental plant due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor. The present study evaluates the antitrichomonal effect of 
   <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>essential oil (EO) against 
   <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> both 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
   <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and compares it to that of metronidazole (MTZ) as a standard antitrichomonal drug.

   <span class="italic">In vitro</span> assays were accomplished in multi-well plates containing MTZ and EO at final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL. 
   <span class="italic">In vivo</span> assay was carried out on 40 experimentally infected pigeons receiving MTZ and EO at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 24-hr MIC of MTZ was 10 µg/mL, while for EO it was 20 µg/mL. Treatment with MTZ 50 mg/kg after 4 days led to full recovery of infected pigeons however EO 50 mg/kg resulted in the same outcome after 5 days. No mortality or clinical side effects were seen in treated birds.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study introduced 
   <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>EO as a potent natural antitrichomonal agent effective against 
   <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. Bioactive components of 
   <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> can be used as potential therapeutic compounds in development of novel antitrichomonal drugs.
