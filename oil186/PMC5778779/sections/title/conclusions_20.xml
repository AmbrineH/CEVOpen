 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets primarily comprised terpinen-4-ol, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-phellandrene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellol, and citronellal, while in 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> the oil consisted primarily of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellal, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellol, citronellol acetate, isopulegol, and eucalyptol. Moderate activity was found against the studied bacterial strain. However, the EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves showed more potency than the 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets did against the studied fungi. The EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> showed higher activity than the positive control did. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of tested EOs was lower than that of the standard BHT used.
