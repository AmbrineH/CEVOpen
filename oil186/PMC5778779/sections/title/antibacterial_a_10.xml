 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were used for analyses. The Gram-positive bacteria included 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> (clinical isolate), 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> (ATCC 19113), 
  <span class="italic">Micrococcus flavus</span> (ATCC 10240) and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC 6538). The Gram-negative bacteria included 
  <span class="italic">Dickeya solani</span> (D s0432–1), 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC 35210), 
  <span class="italic">Pectobacterium atrosepticum</span> (ATCC 33260), 
  <span class="italic">Pectobacterium carotovorum</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">carotovorum</span> (ATCC 15713), and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (D s0432–1). The micro-dilution method [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] was used to determine the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The concentration of the bacteria was adjusted to 1.0 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> CFU/mL by using sterile saline, and then stored at 4 °C. The essential oils were added to 100 μL Triptic Soy broth (TSB) containing a bacteria inoculum (1.0 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> CFU/well) in a microtiter plate, then the MICs and MBCs were determined. The microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a rotary shaker.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A serial sub-cultivation of 2 μL was placed in microtiter plates containing 100 μL of TSB for each well and incubated for 24 h to determine the MIC and MBC. The optical density was measured using a microplate manager at 655 nm. Experiments were completed in triplicate. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 5%) and streptomycin (1 mg/mL) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.</p>
