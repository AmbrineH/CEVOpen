 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIC values of EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves ranged from 0.06 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> to 0.20 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, and those values were lower than the MIC values of streptomycin (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Additionally, activity of this oil was comparable or even higher than reference antibiotic in case of 
  <span class="italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> or 
  <span class="italic">B. cereus</span>. EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets showed less activity against bacterial strains. The MIC values ranged from 0.07 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> to 0.31 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>. The MBC values of EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> ranged from 0.12 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> to 0.41 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, whereas, the values were between 0.15 mg/mL (
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>) and 0.63 mg/mL (
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>) using EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets. The EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> showed noticeable activity against phytopathogenic bacteria including 
  <span class="italic">Pectobacterium atrosepticum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. carotovorum,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dickeya solani</span>, which causes many diseases in potato production, such as the blackleg in the field and soft rot during storage. Furthermore, all MIC values reported against the potato pathogenic bacteria were lower than those reported for the negative control, streptomycin.
