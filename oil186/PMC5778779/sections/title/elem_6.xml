The plants were identified by Prof. Ahmed A. El-Settawy (Head of Forestry and Wood Technology Department) and given the voucher numbers Zidan00312 and Zidan313, respectively at the Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University. The plants were further morphologically approved by Dr. Hosam Elansary at the department of Floriculture, Ornamental horticulture and Garden Design.

   <span class="italic">Micrococcus flavus</span> (ATCC 10240) and

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lowest concentration that inhibits fungi growth at the binocular microscope level was defined as the MIC. The MFC was defined as the minimum concentration showing no visible growth, which is consistent with a 99.5% killing of the original inoculum. Serial sub-cultivations (2 μL) of essential oils were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h in microtiter plates containing 100 μL of broth and inoculum were used to calculate the MIC. Ketoconazole (KTZ) (1–3500 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. The experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
