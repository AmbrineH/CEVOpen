 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the free radical scavenging activity of the obtained EOs, the 2,2′-diphenypicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method was employed [

  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene-linoleic acid assay [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] (absorbance at 470 nm). A blank was prepared in the same manner as the samples and the antioxidant activities of the samples were compared with the blank and standard antioxidant, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). All experiments were repeated twice in triplicates.
