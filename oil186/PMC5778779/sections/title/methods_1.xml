 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of essential oils (EOs) from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets and 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves was analyzed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Antibacterial and antifungal activities were assessed by the micro-dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs), and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Further, the antioxidant capacity of the EOs was determined via 2,2′-diphenypicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene-linoleic acid assays.
