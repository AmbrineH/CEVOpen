 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before evaluating the sedative activity of the formulations, mice were trained in the rota-rod apparatus twice for 10 minutes at 5 rpm with a 30-minute interval between training sessions. After the two training sessions, mice with an average number of falls equal to or greater than nine were eliminated from the test.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two days after the training sessions, mice were placed in the chamber to inhale the formulations or controls. After inhalation, mice were removed from the chamber and placed in the rota-rod apparatus where they were tested for 5 minutes at 5 rpm immediately and 30 minutes after inhalation. In the training and testing sessions, the number of times that each mouse lost its balance and fell from the device during the period of time was counted [
