 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species belonging to the
  <span class="italic"> Protium</span> genus (Burseraceae) produce a characteristic fragrant oleoresin with economic, medicinal, and cultural values [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. In the Brazilian Amazon region, these oleoresins are known as
  <span class="italic"> breu, breu-branco</span> (white-tar), and
  <span class="italic"> breu-preto</span> (black-tar) [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>–
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>].
  <span class="italic"> Breu</span> oleoresins are a combination of two fractions—a volatile fraction that is mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes and a solid nonvolatile fraction that is mainly composed of triterpenes—and have a complex chemical composition with varying concentrations of each component responsible for
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> therapeutic activities [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>–
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>]. Despite traditional communities' belief that there is a difference between white and black
  <span class="italic"> breu</span>, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to establish this nomenclature based on chemical, botanical, or regional names [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. This traditional classification is probably associated with the darkening of the oleoresin caused by volatilization of select components and/or oxidation of others [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Among the mono and sesquiterpenes that characterize the volatile
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> fractions, some present antimicrobial, antioxidant [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>], analgesic [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], anti-inflammatory, and antitumor [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>] activities. Because of its high sensorial quality,
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oil is also used as a fragrance in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In March 2012, our research group embarked on an expedition to the
  <span class="italic"> quilombola</span> territories along the Erepecuru River (Oriximiná, Brazil) in search of different
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> trees and oleoresins to collect, analyze, and understand their use by the
  <span class="italic"> quilombolas</span>. This journey was called “The Malungo Expedition” [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>].
  <span class="italic"> Quilombola</span> communities (descendants of African slaves) from Oriximiná, in the State of Pará, Brazil, use
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> in their popular medicine to treat headaches and migraines by burning and inhaling the smoke produced during its combustion [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. It can also be used as a nasal decongestant by inhalation for severe colds [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>] as well as a topical treatment for contusions and inflammation and can be administered as a patch [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>] for colds, coughs, and bronchitis [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. Furthermore,
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> is employed for mystical, spiritual [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>], and superstitious purposes [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>] as well as for caulking boats [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since The Malungo Expedition [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>], our group has been interested in evaluating the traditional uses of
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> resins as a remedy for headaches and migraines by inhalation of the smoke produced during its combustion, but a literature search for pharmacological animals models resulted in no validated studies. Several pharmacological models of pain involve inflammatory mediators. We selected the formalin-induced licking model to evaluate inflammatory pain. This model also involves direct activation of nociceptors (via C-fibers). According to the
  <span class="italic"> quilombola</span> tradition, the
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> oleoresin is burned to generate smoke, which is inhaled. In this procedure, some of the original
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> compounds may undergo pyrolysis reactions and some are simply transferred to the vapor phase and therefore inhaled without a chemical change. In the inhalation model developed for this study, we only tested the volatile fractions of the oleoresins because they had been fully characterized in previous work from our group. The present study was designed to explore the form of administration performed by the
  <span class="italic"> quilombolas</span> and to investigate whether the compounds in
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oils, when included in an inhalation formulation, could produce a pharmacological response in
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory models. In addition, the sedative activity of these formulations was also evaluated to exclude a possible relationship with the observed pharmacological effects.
