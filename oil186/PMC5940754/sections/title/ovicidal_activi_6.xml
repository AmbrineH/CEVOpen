  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span> was evaluated by immersing groups of 10 eggs for 30 seconds into a solution of the oil mixed with DMSO at 2% (v/v) in distilled water. The oil concentration used was equivalent to LC
  <sub>10</sub> (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span>: LC
  <sub>10</sub> = 3.34 μL/mL and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gemmatalis</span>: LC
  <sub>10</sub> = 0.32 μL/mL). DMSO at 2% (v/v) in distilled water served as the control. A completely randomized experimental design was used with four replicates for 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span> and ten replicates for 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gemmatalis</span>. Egg viability (%) was recorded by counting the larva emergence after 72 h of exposure.
