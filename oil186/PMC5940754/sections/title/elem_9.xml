  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gemmatalis</span>) were performed 3, 6, and 16 h after contact exposure to the respective LC
  <sub>10</sub> and LC
  <sub>50</sub> values of the 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">guianensis</span> essential oil determined for each Lepidoptera pest species (
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span>: 3.34 (LC
  <sub>10</sub>) and 8.09 (LC
  <sub>50</sub>) μL/mL; 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gemmatalis</span>: 0.32 (LC
  <sub>10</sub>) and 2.45 (LC
  <sub>50</sub>) μL/mL). The contact exposure was performed using filter paper impregnated with 1 mL of the oil solution (or control) and left to dry at air temperature. The exposed larvae were placed (either individually or in group) in an arena consisting of an uncontaminated filter paper placed in a Petri dish (135 × 20 mm); the movement of the larvae within the arena was recorded for 10 min using an automated video tracking system equipped with a CCD camera (ViewPoint Life Sciences, Montreal, Canada).

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two behavioral bioassays were carried out in arenas that were either fully treated or half-treated with essential oils. The third instar larvae of each studied population were exposed by contact to filter paper impregnated with the 
   <span class="italic">S</span>. 
   <span class="italic">guianensis</span> essential oil at a concentration equivalent to the LC
   <sub>50</sub> for 3 h and subsequently submitted to individual walking bioassays. The 3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> instar was chosen due to its greater walking activity compared to the other instars. No mortality was observed during the 3 h oil exposure period. In the bioassays with fully treated arenas, the procedure was similar to the one described for the group locomotory bioassay except that the walking activity was recorded for 30 min. The parameters recorded included the walked distance (cm), velocity (cm/s), resting time (s) and number of stops in the arena. Twenty larvae were used for each population. In each trial or replicate, the Petri dish and the filter paper were replaced. In the bioassays with half-treated arenas, the amount of time spent on the oil-treated and on the untreated zones were recorded and used to calculate the proportions of time spent on each side of the arena. Forty larvae were used for each population and essential oil treatment. In each trial or replicate, the Petri dish and the filter paper were replaced.
