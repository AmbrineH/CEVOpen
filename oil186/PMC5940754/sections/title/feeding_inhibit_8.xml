  </span> with some adjustments. Plants of maize (variety AG1051 Agroceres, Santa Cruz das Palmeiras, SP, Brazil) and soybean (MSOY 8866, Monsanto, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) were grown in the greenhouse at the Horticulture Section of the Federal University of Tocantins (Gurupi, TO, Brazil). The maize and soybean leaves were obtained from 30-day-old plants. At the beginning of the experiment, 4 cm
  <span class="sup">2</span> leaf sections as well as 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> instar larvae of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frugiperda</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gemmatalis</span> were weighted separately. Each leaf section was dipped for 10 seconds in a 15 mL solution of the essential oil and then left to air dry at room temperature before being offered to individual larvae. The leaf sections and larvae were put in 30 mL plastic containers. In the free-choice bioassay, both treated and untreated leaf sections were offered simultaneously to the larvae. The two leaf sections were put on the bottom of the cup without touching each other.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the no-choice bioassay, either a treated or an untreated leaf section was offered to a single larva in a single plastic container. The containers were kept closed with a plastic lid where small holes were made to allow gas exchange. After 24 h of exposure, the changes in the leaf sections and the larvae weights were recorded. The oil concentration equivalent to LC
  <sub>10</sub> was used and the control treatment consisted of water and DMSO. The experimental design was completely randomized with 25 replicates per concentration; the experiment was replicated four times.
