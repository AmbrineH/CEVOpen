 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the mineral content of seed flour, a 5.0 g sample was incinerated in a furnace at 550°C and the residues were dissolved in 50 mL of 0.5 M HNO
  <sub>3</sub> solution. The concentrations of Ca, Na, K, Mg, Zn, and Fe were determined using atomic spectrophotometer (Varian AA240 FS) absorption, following the method of Pinheiro et al. [
