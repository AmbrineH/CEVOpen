 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> depicts the amino acid composition of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed flour. The results indicated that the essential amino acids formed 36.48% of the total amino acid content and most were at higher levels than in the requirements recommended by FAO/WHO/UNU [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>], with the exception for lysine which appeared as a limiting amino acid. Tryptophan had the highest amino acid score, followed by phenylalanine + tyrosine, histidine, isoleucine, methionine + cysteine, valine, threonine, leucine, and lysine.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonessential amino acids represented 53.39% of total amino acid content. The highest levels were recorded for glutamine, followed by arginine, asparagine, glycine, serine, alanine, proline, hydroxylysine, and hydroxyproline. The total amino acid composition of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed flour is far greater than the one of soybean [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>].
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed flour is rich in both essential and nonessential amino acids. It constitutes a potential source of protein for human food and livestock fodder.
