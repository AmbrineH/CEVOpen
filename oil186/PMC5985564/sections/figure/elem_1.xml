  <p>Different black-white-masks derived from the original composed root-slice image. 
   <span class="bold">A</span> Root-slice image with green shining oil droplets. 
   <span class="bold">B</span>–
   <span class="bold">D</span> Black-white masks of 
   <span class="bold">B</span>: the oil droplets, 
   <span class="bold">C</span> the center of the root slice, 
   <span class="bold">D</span> the edge of the root-slice. The x–y-coordinates of the oil droplets and the center (black particles in 
   <span class="bold">B</span> and 
   <span class="bold">C</span>) and each point of the edge in 
   <span class="bold">D</span>, and the size of the grey area (seen in 
   <span class="bold">B</span>–
