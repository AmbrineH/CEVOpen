 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical-analytical data does not exist for the currently studied plant tissue, but genetically identical plant material has been investigated analytically by Penzkofer et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. We tried to compare and re-estimate the results of both studies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the four clones gives only limited information for the relationship between oil droplet occurrence and oil content, due to the low number of clones, the limited genetic variability among clones and the environmental and year’s effect, which all potentially influence the essential oil content [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Even Penzkofer et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] could only detect trends in this regard, but identified clone CE2 as the one with the highest essential oil content. This did not coincide with our essential oil mapping data. Concerning the number of oil droplets per root cross-section, clone CE3 shows the highest values, followed by clone CE4 and CE2 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Thus, the number of oil droplets was not a suitable identifier for the essential oil content. This may be due to the varying oil droplet sizes in the inner parenchyma.
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the essential oil droplet density based on total root cross-section area is more informative. Clone CE2 had the highest oil droplet number/mm
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) and it showed the highest oil content in the study by Penzkofer et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. However, to evaluate the relationship between essential oil droplet density and essential oil content, more data is needed.
