 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the current investigations, we were able to show that oil droplets can be found in the whole parenchyma. These results are in good agreement with previous studies of Violon et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and Szentpetery et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Besides the identification of the oil droplets, the number and density of oil droplets are also now available for different varieties, different root diameters on the same plant or for different positions along the roots.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions about the relationship of oil droplet occurrence and essential oil content of genotypes are limited</div>
  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical-analytical data does not exist for the currently studied plant tissue, but genetically identical plant material has been investigated analytically by Penzkofer et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. We tried to compare and re-estimate the results of both studies.
  </p>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the four clones gives only limited information for the relationship between oil droplet occurrence and oil content, due to the low number of clones, the limited genetic variability among clones and the environmental and year’s effect, which all potentially influence the essential oil content [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Even Penzkofer et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] could only detect trends in this regard, but identified clone CE2 as the one with the highest essential oil content. This did not coincide with our essential oil mapping data. Concerning the number of oil droplets per root cross-section, clone CE3 shows the highest values, followed by clone CE4 and CE2 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Thus, the number of oil droplets was not a suitable identifier for the essential oil content. This may be due to the varying oil droplet sizes in the inner parenchyma.
  </p>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the essential oil droplet density based on total root cross-section area is more informative. Clone CE2 had the highest oil droplet number/mm
   <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) and it showed the highest oil content in the study by Penzkofer et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. However, to evaluate the relationship between essential oil droplet density and essential oil content, more data is needed.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number and density of oil droplets are not negatively related to the root thickness</div>
  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mapping results showed an expected increase of the number of oil droplets per cross-section from thinner to thicker roots (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). For the fractions with low to high root diameters (RF1-RF3), the number of oil droplets was in accordance with the essential oil content results of Penzkofer et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The fraction with the largest root diameter (RF4) showed the highest number of oil droplets in our study, but the lowest essential oil content in their study. It has to be noted that the essential oil content was determined by a very small number of data points and comprised only the clone CE4, because the other clones did not develop roots of this diameter. Considering CE4 only, the oil droplet number was the same for thick and very thick roots (RF3 and RF4, respectively).
  </p>
  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil droplet density of total root cross-sections was highest in the thin roots (RF1) and lower in medium to thick roots (RF2-4). Thus, no linear relationship between oil drop density and root thickness can be derived. The high oil droplet density in thin roots may partially be an effect of root age, assuming that a higher portion of young roots occurred in this root fraction, and that oil droplets are formed at a very early stage of development, a phenomenon we were able to see with our image of a young lateral root. However, root age may not entirely explain the difference in oil droplet density between RF1 and RF2 as there was no difference between RF2 and RF3.</p>
  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerning the breeding target of thicker roots, we found a positive relationship between root thickness and number of oil droplets per root cross-section. We did not find a negative relationship between root thickness and oil droplet density, especially when medium to very thick roots were considered. Consequently, there is a potential for selection of thick roots that have high oil droplet densities and, therefore, also likely high essential oil content. This is supported by the experience that many inbred lines with coarse roots and high essential oil content could be derived from clone CE4.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil droplet distribution should be considered in cultivation, harvesting and breeding</div>
  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that 43% of the oil droplets were localized in the outer section of the roots (class nine), it is evident that a careful root harvest and processing, without damaging the root surface, is important. This also means that a high portion of oil droplets are located in the inner parenchyma, information which is important for valerian cultivation, as well as for breeding selection.</p>
  <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heindl and Hoppe [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] reported that intense and long washing of valerian roots leads to a loss of secondary compounds. Therefore, the more essential oil is stored in the inner parenchyma, the lower should be the losses during the processing, and the higher is the processing stability of the roots.
  </p>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main breeding targets in the past was increasing the essential oil content [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. With this target in mind, the losses of oil during processing and storage are minor. We now show that in different single plants, represented by the clones of elites, different essential oil distributions exist. Choosing plant types with steadily increasing oil droplet density curves instead of plants with exponentially increasing oil droplet densities towards the root edge implies that a higher portion of the oil will be located in the inner parenchyma. Moreover, processing stability and possibly, also, storage stability of valerian roots can be increased. Our imaging and mapping method, in combination with the calculated density curves, can serve as a selection tool for identifying suitable plants.
  </p>
  <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of horizons provides further information about the reliability of the production process. The horizons represent harvest depths: The greater the depth, the thinner the formed roots, and the greater the likelihood that they will be more easily lost during the harvesting process.</p>
  <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These horizons contain a lower number of oil droplets. Thus, the harvest of the root parts in deeper soil layers does not have to be exhaustive in order to obtain high essential oil contents in the root drug, especially when 96% of the root mass is located in the topmost 10 cm of the ground [
