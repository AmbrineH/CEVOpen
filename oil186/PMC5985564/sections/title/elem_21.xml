Probably, the essential oil volatilized due to either the use of ethanol during the embedding process or due to the ethanol-containing sudan-III-solution itself. Similar effects were observed by Fridvalszky [

   <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, FTIR imaging can provide information about the distribution of different plant constituents without destructing the plant constituent containing cell structure. These constituents include lipids, carbohydrates, and lignin, as well as secondary metabolites, e.g. terpenoids [

   <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, the local accumulation of the strong absorbance at 1737 cm
    <span class="sup">−1</span> tentatively assignable to bornyl acetate indicates an essential oil distribution in distinct cellular structures. As bornyl acetate is a principal component of the essential oil of valerian, the results from FTIR imaging confirms the theory that essential oil is located within the colorless bodies. However, only very few intact oil droplets were found in the thin cryo-sections. The preparation of thin root slides of a thickness below 0.01 mm usually resulted in disruption of the oil bodies and smearing of the essential oil. Therefore, the results of FTIR imaging have to be seen as basic studies combining visual images of the sample with chemical information. The authors’ own previous studies on valerian root sections performed with FT-Raman spectroscopy did not deliver additional information about essential oil distribution. Only the differentiation of various root tissue mainly based on carbohydrate profile was obtained and with the instrument used, the local resolution was limited to around 150 µm (data not shown).
   </p>
   <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern Raman microscopes achieve a local resolution below 1 µm depending on the laser and aperture used. To gather suitable signal intensity, the Raman laser needs to be exactly focused, which demands for the extremely thin root slices. With application of the necessary laser power, the brownish root material often started burning and the spectra showed high fluorescence appearance. A reduction in laser power resulted in a lack of signals. Therefore, if the analytes don’t contain Raman active bonds (e.g. C–C double bonds in carotenoids) and the sample is colored (as the majority of plant derived material is), Raman spectroscopy investigations are technically challenging.</p>
   <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, another vibrational spectroscopy method gained attention in plant analysis. Hyperspectral (near infrared) spectroscopy imaging can be used for various analytical purposes as species identification, disease detection or nutrient quantification, but is focused on macroscopic samples due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of several 100 µm [

   <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking into account the above described characteristics of each method, FTIR imaging in combination with subsequent staining to affirm the preliminary results, seems to be the most favorable analytical strategy. The resulting FTIR distribution maps showing the strong C = O vibration at 1737 cm

   <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil droplet position was calculated as relative distance from the root center to the root edge. The relative distances were allocated to nine width classes, which allowed a comparison between the root diameter fractions and root depth (horizons), regardless of the real root diameter of the considered root slice. The root slices seldom showed a circular shape. Often, the root slices were oval or had coves. An absolute and constant class width would not have been appropriate, because the border of class nine would not necessarily be congruent with the edge of the root slice. Further information concerning the oil droplet distribution would be achieved if densities of the classes are calculated based on absolute diameters and cross-section areas. For our purposes, the absolute oil droplet densities of the total cross-section areas were sufficient.</p>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Besides the identification of the oil droplets, the number and density of oil droplets are also now available for different varieties, different root diameters on the same plant or for different positions along the roots.

   <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical-analytical data does not exist for the currently studied plant tissue, but genetically identical plant material has been investigated analytically by Penzkofer et al. [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. We tried to compare and re-estimate the results of both studies.
   </p>
   <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the four clones gives only limited information for the relationship between oil droplet occurrence and oil content, due to the low number of clones, the limited genetic variability among clones and the environmental and year’s effect, which all potentially influence the essential oil content [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Even Penzkofer et al. [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] could only detect trends in this regard, but identified clone CE2 as the one with the highest essential oil content. This did not coincide with our essential oil mapping data. Concerning the number of oil droplets per root cross-section, clone CE3 shows the highest values, followed by clone CE4 and CE2 (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Thus, the number of oil droplets was not a suitable identifier for the essential oil content. This may be due to the varying oil droplet sizes in the inner parenchyma.
   </p>
   <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the essential oil droplet density based on total root cross-section area is more informative. Clone CE2 had the highest oil droplet number/mm
    <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) and it showed the highest oil content in the study by Penzkofer et al. [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number and density of oil droplets are not negatively related to the root thickness</div>
   <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mapping results showed an expected increase of the number of oil droplets per cross-section from thinner to thicker roots (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). For the fractions with low to high root diameters (RF1-RF3), the number of oil droplets was in accordance with the essential oil content results of Penzkofer et al. [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The fraction with the largest root diameter (RF4) showed the highest number of oil droplets in our study, but the lowest essential oil content in their study. It has to be noted that the essential oil content was determined by a very small number of data points and comprised only the clone CE4, because the other clones did not develop roots of this diameter. Considering CE4 only, the oil droplet number was the same for thick and very thick roots (RF3 and RF4, respectively).
   </p>
   <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil droplet density of total root cross-sections was highest in the thin roots (RF1) and lower in medium to thick roots (RF2-4). Thus, no linear relationship between oil drop density and root thickness can be derived. The high oil droplet density in thin roots may partially be an effect of root age, assuming that a higher portion of young roots occurred in this root fraction, and that oil droplets are formed at a very early stage of development, a phenomenon we were able to see with our image of a young lateral root. However, root age may not entirely explain the difference in oil droplet density between RF1 and RF2 as there was no difference between RF2 and RF3.</p>
   <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerning the breeding target of thicker roots, we found a positive relationship between root thickness and number of oil droplets per root cross-section. We did not find a negative relationship between root thickness and oil droplet density, especially when medium to very thick roots were considered. Consequently, there is a potential for selection of thick roots that have high oil droplet densities and, therefore, also likely high essential oil content. This is supported by the experience that many inbred lines with coarse roots and high essential oil content could be derived from clone CE4.</p>

   <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that 43% of the oil droplets were localized in the outer section of the roots (class nine), it is evident that a careful root harvest and processing, without damaging the root surface, is important. This also means that a high portion of oil droplets are located in the inner parenchyma, information which is important for valerian cultivation, as well as for breeding selection.</p>
   <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heindl and Hoppe [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] reported that intense and long washing of valerian roots leads to a loss of secondary compounds. Therefore, the more essential oil is stored in the inner parenchyma, the lower should be the losses during the processing, and the higher is the processing stability of the roots.
   </p>
   <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main breeding targets in the past was increasing the essential oil content [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. With this target in mind, the losses of oil during processing and storage are minor. We now show that in different single plants, represented by the clones of elites, different essential oil distributions exist. Choosing plant types with steadily increasing oil droplet density curves instead of plants with exponentially increasing oil droplet densities towards the root edge implies that a higher portion of the oil will be located in the inner parenchyma. Moreover, processing stability and possibly, also, storage stability of valerian roots can be increased. Our imaging and mapping method, in combination with the calculated density curves, can serve as a selection tool for identifying suitable plants.
   </p>
   <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of horizons provides further information about the reliability of the production process. The horizons represent harvest depths: The greater the depth, the thinner the formed roots, and the greater the likelihood that they will be more easily lost during the harvesting process.</p>
   <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These horizons contain a lower number of oil droplets. Thus, the harvest of the root parts in deeper soil layers does not have to be exhaustive in order to obtain high essential oil contents in the root drug, especially when 96% of the root mass is located in the topmost 10 cm of the ground [
