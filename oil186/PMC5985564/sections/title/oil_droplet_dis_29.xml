 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that 43% of the oil droplets were localized in the outer section of the roots (class nine), it is evident that a careful root harvest and processing, without damaging the root surface, is important. This also means that a high portion of oil droplets are located in the inner parenchyma, information which is important for valerian cultivation, as well as for breeding selection.</p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heindl and Hoppe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] reported that intense and long washing of valerian roots leads to a loss of secondary compounds. Therefore, the more essential oil is stored in the inner parenchyma, the lower should be the losses during the processing, and the higher is the processing stability of the roots.

 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main breeding targets in the past was increasing the essential oil content [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. With this target in mind, the losses of oil during processing and storage are minor. We now show that in different single plants, represented by the clones of elites, different essential oil distributions exist. Choosing plant types with steadily increasing oil droplet density curves instead of plants with exponentially increasing oil droplet densities towards the root edge implies that a higher portion of the oil will be located in the inner parenchyma. Moreover, processing stability and possibly, also, storage stability of valerian roots can be increased. Our imaging and mapping method, in combination with the calculated density curves, can serve as a selection tool for identifying suitable plants.

 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of horizons provides further information about the reliability of the production process. The horizons represent harvest depths: The greater the depth, the thinner the formed roots, and the greater the likelihood that they will be more easily lost during the harvesting process.</p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These horizons contain a lower number of oil droplets. Thus, the harvest of the root parts in deeper soil layers does not have to be exhaustive in order to obtain high essential oil contents in the root drug, especially when 96% of the root mass is located in the topmost 10â€‰cm of the ground [
