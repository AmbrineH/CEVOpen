 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first time, the essential oil distribution in entire valerian root cross-sections of different varieties, root thicknesses and root horizons were visualized, applying an imaging and mapping fluorescence-microscopy technique. The applied methods of FTIR spectroscopy and fluorescence-microscopy allowed for the determination of oil droplets as clearly differentiated structures.</p>
 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results give insight into the cross-sectional essential oil distribution at valerian harvest time. Although the existing natural variability and the limited plant material investigated in this study only allow for a brief overview, some aspects derived from the results could be used for further investigations and for future breeding work:
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par70">The number, density and distribution of essential oil droplets of genetically different plant material vary and allow for the selection of suitable plant material for breeding purposes, independent of root thickness.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par71">The breeding plant material should generally exhibit a high oil droplet density level as this is one of the factors for the essential oil content.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par72">A high and homogeneous oil droplet density should be aspired in the inner parenchyma in order to avoid essential oil losses during harvesting and post-harvest processes.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It still remains unclear which oil droplet characteristic is preferred as a selection trait. In consequence, a compromise between the absolute oil droplet density and the oil droplet density curve must be found, while at the same time, considering root thickness and individual genetic background.</p>
 <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, a careful, but not necessarily exhaustive harvest, as well as careful post-harvest procedures, confirmed as best methods for conserving the essential oil and obtaining a high quality of the valerian root drug.</p>
