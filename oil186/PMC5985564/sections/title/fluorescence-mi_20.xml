 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 678 root-slices of valerian were evaluated. The number of root-slices was distributed quite evenly among the different levels of the factors: cloned elites (CE), root diameter and classification, root horizon (HZ). However, fewer root-slices were analyzed in regard to the root diameter fraction RF4, because the thin-rooted cloned elites did not form roots with a diameter greater than 4 mm (Tables 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>,

  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>B, C). In general, the mean number of oil droplets increased from the center to the outer cell layers. The central cylinder was almost free of oil droplets, whereas, the parenchyma included 57% (42–64%) of the mean number of oil droplets on average. In the outer cell layer, completely covered by class nine, 43% (36–56%) of the mean number of oil droplets were present, on average.

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To consider the varying areas of the classes, the oil droplet density was a more suitable parameter to compare the classes than the number of oil droplets. A constant density was not found. Similar to the mean numbers, the density of oil droplets also rose up from class one to class nine (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Each factor showed a significant effect on the density of oil droplets (Friedman: CE

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The root diameter of each factor level affected the number of oil droplets. Thicker root-slices contained more oil droplets, as presented in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. This meant, ultimately, that the number of oil droplets increased with root thickness, root diameter and in the upper located root horizons as compared to the lower horizon. As shown for the class comparison, the density of oil droplets allowed for a better comparison between factor levels. Among the cloned elites, CE2 showed the highest oil droplet density (ANOVA 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;  0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>C). RF1 was the root diameter fraction with the highest oil droplet density (ANOVA 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>C), whereas each horizon showed a significantly different oil droplet density (ANOVA

Based on the image area of the oil droplets, the size of oil droplets allocated to classes 3–7 was approximately 72% larger than the size of the oil droplets allocated to classes 1 and 2. This was more or less recognizable for all root-slices, but was not examined in detail. In the outer cell layer of young lateral roots we could already find oil droplets (Fig.
