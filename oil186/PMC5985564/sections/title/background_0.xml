 <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil is an important compound of the root and rhizome of medicinally used valerian (
  <span class="italic">Valeriana officinalis</span> L. s.l.), with a stated minimum content in the European pharmacopoeia. The essential oil is located in droplets, of which the position and distribution in the total root cross-section of different valerian varieties, root thicknesses and root horizons are determined in this study using an adapted fluorescence-microscopy and automatic imaging analysis method. The study was initiated by the following facts:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par2">A probable negative correlation between essential oil content and root thickness in selected single plants (elites), observed during the breeding of coarsely rooted valerian with high oil content.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par3">Higher essential oil content after careful hand-harvest and processing of the roots.</p>
