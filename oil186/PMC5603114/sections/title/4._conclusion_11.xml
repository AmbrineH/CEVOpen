 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span> essential oil by GC-MS led to the identification of the major constituents in both commercial and natural resins, limonene, eucalyptol, and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, whereas in the natural resin, the main components were limonene, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, and 
  <span class="italic">Î±</span>-terpineol, with a yield of 1.38% and 0.90%, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studies carried out with rat's mesenteric artery, the EOPh promoted a vasorelaxing effect independent of vascular endothelium. These effects provided us with expectancy of a therapeutic alternative for individuals with arterial hypertension. However, further study is needed to investigate the vasorelaxant cellular mechanism of EOPh.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its wide distribution in our community, frequently found in core markets and used in folk medicine and extensive potential therapeutic applications, details on seasonal variation of composition, assessment of toxicity and genotoxicity, and the mechanism of action are important points that should be better evaluated. These experimental data suggest a possible use of EOPh for the treatment of preclinical hypertension.</p>
