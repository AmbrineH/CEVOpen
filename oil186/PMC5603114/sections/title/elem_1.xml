  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two samples of resins were analyzed in this research, one of which was acquired in the central market of Teresina, PI, in February 2016 (commercial resin) and the other was collected at a private estate in the municipality of Timon, MA, a northeastern Brazilian state, in February 2012 (natural resin) and was kept in refrigeration until the moment of oil extraction. The identification of the species occurred in the Herbarium Graziela Barroso at the Federal University of Piauí, Brazil, and the voucher specimen was registered under number 28730.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resin was subjected to hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger type apparatus; 3 h after boiling, the oil was collected. The extracted oil was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na

   <sub>4</sub>), weighed, and stored at a low temperature of 5°C.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis was realized by gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, TSQ Quantum XLS Ultra, Triple Quadrupole), equipped with an AS3000 Autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). For chromatography of the components, a column EquityTM-1, length 30 m, with 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>m film thickness, was used. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow of 1.0 mL/min and injector temperature of 220°C. The column was programmed with an initial temperature of 50°C (3.0 min), followed by an increase of 3°C/min up to 180°C (for 2 min) and then 6°C/min up to 260°C (for 2 min), and detector temperature of 230°C. 1.0 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L was injected into dichloromethane in split mode (1 : 10). The conditions of MS were ion detector triple quadrupole type operating by electronic impact (70 eV; 45 to 450 Da). The identification of the respective components was done by comparing the mass spectra patterns of internal library (NIST 11) to experimental retention index, calculated from an 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane series (C
   <sub>8</sub> to C
   <sub>20</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich) and by comparison with literal data [

In order to prepare stock solutions of the drugs, all substances were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to the appropriate concentrations. EOPh was dissolved in Tyrode's solution for the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The animals were euthanized by thiopental sodium (70 mg/kg i.p.). The superior mesenteric arteries were quickly removed and cleaned of adherent connective tissues and fat. Mesenteric rings (1-2 mm length) were obtained and suspended by cotton threads in an organ bath containing 10 mL of Tyrode's solution, maintained at 37°C, and gassed with a 95% O
   <sub>2</sub> + 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> mixture (pH 7.4). The rings were stabilized with a resting tension of 0.75 g for at least 60 min, with replacement of Tyrode's solution (NaCl 158.3 mM, KCl 4.0 mM, CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> 2.0 mM, NaHCO
   <sub>3</sub> 10.0 mM, C
   <sub>6</sub>H

   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Isometric tension was recorded by a force-displacement transducer coupled to a data acquisition system (AECAD 1604, AQCAD 2.0.5; AVS Projetos, SP). When necessary, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface of the vessels with a thin stainless wire and endothelial functionality was assessed through the ability of acetylcholine (10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>M) to induce more than 70% relaxation associated with phenylephrine-Phe (10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>M) tonus. The absence of relaxation following acetylcholine administration was taken as evidence that the rings were functionally denuded of endothelium.

   <sub>2</sub> (anti-log of effective concentration that promotes 50% of maximum response). Student's 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test and posttest of Bonferroni were used in the data analysis of the results which were considered significant when 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism™ software, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
