 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The animals were euthanized by thiopental sodium (70 mg/kg i.p.). The superior mesenteric arteries were quickly removed and cleaned of adherent connective tissues and fat. Mesenteric rings (1-2 mm length) were obtained and suspended by cotton threads in an organ bath containing 10 mL of Tyrode's solution, maintained at 37°C, and gassed with a 95% O
  <sub>2</sub> + 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> mixture (pH 7.4). The rings were stabilized with a resting tension of 0.75 g for at least 60 min, with replacement of Tyrode's solution (NaCl 158.3 mM, KCl 4.0 mM, CaCl
  <sub>2</sub> 2.0 mM, NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub> 10.0 mM, C
  <sub>6</sub>H
  <sub>12</sub>O
  <sub>6</sub> 5.6 mM, MgCl
  <sub>2</sub> 1.05 mM, and NaH
  <sub>2</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub> 0.42 mM) every 15 min to prevent the accumulation of metabolites that could otherwise cause the results to be biased and thus misinterpreted [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Isometric tension was recorded by a force-displacement transducer coupled to a data acquisition system (AECAD 1604, AQCAD 2.0.5; AVS Projetos, SP). When necessary, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface of the vessels with a thin stainless wire and endothelial functionality was assessed through the ability of acetylcholine (10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>M) to induce more than 70% relaxation associated with phenylephrine-Phe (10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>M) tonus. The absence of relaxation following acetylcholine administration was taken as evidence that the rings were functionally denuded of endothelium.
