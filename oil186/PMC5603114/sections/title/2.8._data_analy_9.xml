 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All values were expressed as mean ± SEM. The experimental results were expressed as percentage of decrease of the maximum contraction of phenylephrine. The potential was expressed by pD
  <sub>2</sub> (anti-log of effective concentration that promotes 50% of maximum response). Student's 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test and posttest of Bonferroni were used in the data analysis of the results which were considered significant when 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism™ software, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
