 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis was realized by gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, TSQ Quantum XLS Ultra, Triple Quadrupole), equipped with an AS3000 Autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). For chromatography of the components, a column EquityTM-1, length 30 m, with 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m film thickness, was used. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow of 1.0 mL/min and injector temperature of 220°C. The column was programmed with an initial temperature of 50°C (3.0 min), followed by an increase of 3°C/min up to 180°C (for 2 min) and then 6°C/min up to 260°C (for 2 min), and detector temperature of 230°C. 1.0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L was injected into dichloromethane in split mode (1 : 10). The conditions of MS were ion detector triple quadrupole type operating by electronic impact (70 eV; 45 to 450 Da). The identification of the respective components was done by comparing the mass spectra patterns of internal library (NIST 11) to experimental retention index, calculated from an 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane series (C
  <sub>8</sub> to C
  <sub>20</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich) and by comparison with literal data [
