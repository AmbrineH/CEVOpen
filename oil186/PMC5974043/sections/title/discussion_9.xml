 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pomegranate seed oil has been established to have many pharmacological properties in terrestrial animal and aquatic species (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Gil et al., 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Vidal et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Badawi and Gomaa, 2016</a>). But no information to date is available about its effects on growth and immunity of rainbow trout. The results of the present study demonstrated that PSO addition up to 10 g/kg in the diets barely affected the rainbow trout growth performance. Similar to our results the growth promoting effects has been reported other plant based feed additives (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Nya and Austin, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Nootash et al., 2013</a>). In addition to this research (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Baba et al., 2017</a>) reported that Nile tilapia (
  <span class="italic">Oreochromis niloticus</span>) showed better growth performance when fed with 10 g/kg argan oil supplemented diets. This results suggesting that plant based feed additives has probable effects on modulation of intestine microbiota and digestive process therefore these supplements were improves growth performance of fish (
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">MacLennan et al., 2002</a>). Changes in RBC, Hct, Hb values, and erythrocyte indexes were important to evaluate the health status of organs (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Başusta, 2005</a>). In our study, hematocrit levels for rainbow trout fed with PSO supplemented did not show significant differences compared with the control group. Similar results were documented in different fish species fed with 
  <span class="italic">Citrus sinensis</span> peel oil (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Acar et al., 2015</a>). Studies on fish hemoglobin shows that it is an important tool for health and it can be used for finding out about factors concerning their oxygen-carrying capacity (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Wells et al., 2005</a>). Our study showed that also RBC, Hb, and MCHC levels increased in fish treated with PSO at 0.5 and 1.00% levels. Hemoglobin (Hb) is a very important protein with which RBC is the key for blood oxygen (O
  <sub>2</sub>) transport in nearly all vertebrates and some invertebrates; this protein optimizes tissue O
  <sub>2</sub> delivery by increasing the total O
  <sub>2</sub> that can be transported in the blood (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Rummer and Brauner, 2015</a>). This suggests that PSO improves the performance of the oxygen transport thus promotes a better tissue perfusion.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Serum biochemistry represents a useful index of fish health status to determine physiological changes following different feeding experiment (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Yılmaz and Ergun, 2012</a>). The present study showed that dietary PSO showed no adverse effect on serum total protein, glucose, globulin, and albumin values of fish. However, the results of this study showed significantly decreased in cholesterol values of fish fed with PSO
  <sub>5</sub> and PSO
  <sub>10</sub> diets. The reduces in cholesterol values can be explained with the polyunsaturated fatty acids and other constituents of PSO. 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Baba et al. (2017)</a> obtained similar results in tilapia (
  <span class="italic">Oreochromus niloticus</span>) fed with argan oil supplemented diets.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, it was observed a significant reduction of AST, ALT, ALP (specific enzymes that are indicators of cellular toxicity) in fish treated at PSO
  <sub>5</sub> and PSO
  <sub>10c</sub> groups compared to control; instead at PSO
  <sub>20</sub> these parameters returned control value. These results suggest an evident protective function or did not adversely effect of PSO on fish liver and are in line with those reported in a recent study by 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Badawi and Gomaa (2016)</a> who studied the effects of diets supplemented by pomegranate peel extract (PPE) at rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% in another species of fish (Nile Tilapia 
  <span class="italic">O. niloticus</span>). A marked protective effect of PSO on liver function that decreased AST; ALT and ALP was also shown by 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Ibrahim (2010)</a> in a previous study on rat. Decrease in enzyme activities can be regarded as an indicator of the protective effect of pomegranate oil on cells, tissues, and organs (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Babalola et al., 2009</a>) reported that vegetable oil sources (sunflower and cocoa butter) used in feeds of ductal fish increased liver enzymatic activities, which may be due to damage to liver cell membranes leading to the release of transaminases from the cytoplasm.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to the immunological status, in a previous study of 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Badawi and Gomaa (2016)</a>, it was shown that PPE improved immune status by causing a significant increase in two important indices values of non-specific immunity (IgM and lysozyme) with respect to control; however, in our study the levels of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase did not show any significant difference (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) in the fish fed with PSO supplemented diet with respect to control. The negligible effects on lysozyme and myeloperoxidase content showed in our results were also found in rainbow trout fed diets enrichment with herbal feed additives (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Awad and Austin, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Nya and Austin, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Bulfon et al., 2017</a>). Disagree with our results sweet orange (
  <span class="italic">Citrus sinensis</span>) essential oil (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Acar et al., 2015</a>) in tilapia seems to determine an increase of lysozyme activity. Similarly, in 
  <span class="italic">Ictalurus punctatus</span> fed with oregano (
  <span class="italic">Origanum heraleoticum</span>) essential oil it was observed an increase in lysozyme activity respect to the control group (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Zheng et al., 2009</a>). This discrepancy is mainly due to the different substance administered, experimental conditions, fish species and probably at the different absorption capacities of the fish.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of 60 days feeding trial to determine the resistance of rainbow trout to the enteric red mount disease fish were challenge with 
  <span class="italic">Y. ruckeri</span>. The cumulative survival in rainbow trout fed with PSO
  <sub>5</sub>, PSO
  <sub>10</sub>, and PSO
  <sub>20</sub> diets was 52.82, 56.86, and 56.86%, respectively and found significantly different from PSO
  <sub>0</sub> group. It was observed that cinnamon (
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</span>) and clove oils (
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span>) reduced mortality in Nile tilapia after challenge with 
  <span class="italic">S. iniae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lactococcus garvieae</span>, respectively (
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Rattanachaikunsopon and Phumkhachorn, 2009</a>, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">2010</a>). These results indicate that dietary treatment with various herb oils usually has a positive effect on infected fish, thus increasing survival rates. This aspect is probably due to the interdependent influences of the active components of herb oils and to the hormesis effect. Hormesis is a phenomenon typically associated with the fields of health and toxicology. “Hormesis is a dose-response relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition.” Depending on the nature of the parameter being affected, the direction of that response changes (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003</a>). Biological systems exposed to wide range of stimuli show diverse responses depending on the dose; hormesis is considered an adaptive function.
