 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A pathogenic pathogen 
  <span class="italic">Y. ruckeri</span> (E42 Accession No: KX388238) was used. A stock of bacteria stored in tryptic soy broth containing 15% glycerol was prepared and maintained at -80°C. Briefly, 2 days before the challenge an aliquot of the bacteria was grown in tryptic soy broth medium at 22°C in a shaker incubator. After 1 day, the bacterial suspension was serially diluted in sterile PBS until the stock bacteria contained ∼10
  <span class="sup">7</span> colony forming units (cfu)/mL.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the challenge, 51 rainbow trout per groups (17 fish/aquarium) were anesthetised with MS222 (as described above), and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 6.8 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> cfu/mL of 
  <span class="italic">Y. ruckeri</span> in PBS (0.1 mL/fish). The density of the bacteria was determined according to the previously calculated LD50 value for the rainbow trout juveniles. Dead fish were recorded daily and the fish were taken from the aquarium for 20 days. The bacterium was re-isolated from the dead fish.
