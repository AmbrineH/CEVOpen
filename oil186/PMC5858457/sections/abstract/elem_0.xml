 <p>Botanical metabolites are increasingly realized as potential replacements to chemical insecticides. In the present study, 
  <span class="italic">Acacia nilotica</span> seed essential oil and seed pod solvent extracts were tested for bioefficacy against three important types of mosquitoes. Mortality was recorded 24 h post-treatment, while smoke toxicity of adult mosquitoes was recorded at 10 min intervals for 40 min. Seed pod powder was extracted with different solvents and hydrodistilled seed oil chemical constituents were determined by using Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) -. Larvicidal and adulticidal efficacy of seed hydrodistilled essential oil and solvent extracts were tested against larval and adult mosquitoes. The seed hydrodistilled oil provided strong larvicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</span>, (LC50 (lethal concentration that kills 50% of the exposed larvae) = 5.239, LC90 (lethal concentration that kills 90% of the exposed larvae) = 9.713 mg/L); 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, (LC50 = 3.174, LC90 = 11.739 mg/L); and 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span>, (LC50 = 4.112, LC90 = 12.325 mg/L). Smoke toxicities were 82% in 
  <span class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</span>, 90% in 
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span>, and 80% mortality in 
  <span class="italic">An. stephensi</span> adults, whereas 100% mortality was recorded for commercial mosquito coil. The GC-MS profile of seed essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">A. nilotica</span> showed the presence of hexadecane (18.440%) and heptacosane (15.914%), which are the main and active compounds, and which may be involved in insecticidal activity. Overall findings suggest that the seed oil showed strong mosquitocidal activity against mosquito vectors and therefore may provide an ecofriendly replacement to chemical insecticides.
