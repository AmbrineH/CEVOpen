Chemical pyrethroids have been relied upon as the insecticides of choice for mosquito control, due to their low mammalian toxicity and quick knockdown activity. In many parts of the world, mosquito vectors have developed resistance against the synthetic chemical insecticides, thus rendering their use for control in some areas ineffective [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nature provides several bioactive compounds for the control of mosquitoes, namely plant-derived products, marine algal-derived products, microbial-derived products, and other biological compounds. The use of biological-derived products of plant origin is recommended because they are effective, environmentally friendly, and generally have a low toxicity [
