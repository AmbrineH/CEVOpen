  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seed pods were shade dried for 7–10 days. The dried seed pods were powdered mechanically using a commercial electrical stainless steel blender and the powdered seed pod (200 g) was extracted with hexane (350 mL), petroleum benzene (350 mL), chloroform (350 mL), ethyl acetate (350 mL), and acetone (350 mL) in a Soxhlet apparatus (boiling point 60–85 °C) for 7 h. Finally, the crude extract was concentrated to reduce the solvent content by using a rotary evaporator (Superfit, Mumbai, India, Model-R/150/01) under reduced pressure 23–27 mm Hg at 48 °C, with the resultant residue stored at room temperature.</p>

An equal number of controls were set up simultaneously using tap water. Dead larvae were counted 24 h post-treatment, and the percent mortality was reported from the average of three replicates using formula (1). The LC

The injector temperature was set at 260 °C during the chromatographic run. One microliter of extract sample was injected into the instrument. The oven temperature was as follows: 60 °C (2 min), followed by 300 °C at the rate of 10 °C min

The mass detector conditions were: transfer line temperature 240 °C, ion source temperature 240 °C, and ionization mode electron impact at 70 eV, a scan time 0.2 s, and scan interval of 0.1 seconds. Considering fragments from 40 to 600 Da, the spectrums of the components were compared with the database of spectrum of known components stored in the GC-MS NIST (2008) library (mass spectrometry database).
