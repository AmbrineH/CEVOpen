 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insecticide-susceptible mosquito culture was provided by IVCZ, Banahalli, Tamil Nadu, India. Larval cultures were maintained in laboratory conditions. All evaluations were carried out at laboratory temperature condition 27 ± 2 °C and 80–90% Relative Humidity (RH), under a 12:12 photoperiod period. We provided dog biscuits and yeast (3:1 ratio) as the food source for the larvae.</p>
