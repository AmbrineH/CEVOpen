 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our GC-MS results shows that two major compounds, namely hexadecane (18.440%) and heptacosane (15.914%), may harbor insecticidal potential. Further study on the isolation of hexadecane and heptacosane may be useful in identifying the mosquitocidal potential of these compounds (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00388-t005" href="#ijerph-15-00388-t005">Table 5</a>). Our findings suggest that

  <span class="italic">A. nilotica</span> seed pod powder have toxicity against mosquitoes.
