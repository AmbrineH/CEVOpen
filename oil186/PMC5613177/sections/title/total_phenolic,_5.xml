 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total phenolics were quantified in leaves according to Amerine and Ough (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">1988</a>) and Singleton and Rossi (
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">1965</a>) using a Folin-Ciocalteau method. The proline was quantified in 0.5 g (% of dry matter) following Bates et al. (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">1973</a>) spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. The chemical constituents of the soil (sandy) used were quantified following Jackson (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">1958</a>) (Table 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">S1</a>). Total chlorophyll content was determined following Moran and Porath (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">1980</a>). Total carbohydrates (%) in the leaves was determined according to Dubios et al. (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">1956</a>). Sodium and chloride contents (mg g
  <span class="sup">âˆ’1</span>) in the leaves were determined according to Piper (
