 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genes of APX, 3 SOD isoforms as well as the genes conferring tolerance to salinity (bZIP62, DREB2, ERF3, and OLPb) revealed higher levels in SA-treated rosemary under salinity, with respect to non-sprayed plants, indicating that SA treatment resulted in the modulation of such genes expression which in turn enhanced rosemary tolerance to salinity stress. SA treatments enhances the vegetative growth traits and bioactivity of rosemary plants under salt stress. Salinity stress affected specific major essential oils constitutes including reductions in α-pinene, β-pinene, and cineole along with sharp increases in linalool, camphor, borneol, and verbenone. However, SA applications at 100–300 ppm largely reversed such effects of salinity. Interestingly, SA treatments mitigated salinity stress effects by increasing the total phenolic, chlorophyll, carbohydrates, and proline compositions of leaves as well as reducing chloride and sodium salts. The increases in the leaves phenolic composition and major essential oil constitutes caused significant changes in the antioxidant activities of the leaf extracts and essential oils. The essential oils showed antibacterial activities against several bacteria. The current study proved that SA may stimulate the antioxidant mechanism pathway in plants subjected to salinity by stimulating antioxidant enzymes activities as well as increasing non-enzymatic antioxidants such as scorbate and proline.</p>
