 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2,2′-diphenypicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and β-carotene-linoleic acid assays were used following Elansary et al. (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2017</a>) to determine essential oils free radical scavenging activity of each sample which was expressed as IC
  <sub>50</sub> (μg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) or the sample concentration required to scavenge 50% of DPPH/β-carotene-linoleic acid. Total and free ascorbate (non-enzymatic antioxidants) were quantified in ground frozen leaves following Elansary et al. (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2017</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enzymes activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified in leaves tissues according to Zhang and Kirkham (
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">1996</a>) and Elansary et al. (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2017</a>). ROS accumulation was determined by quantifying H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> composition in leaves following Elansary et al. (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2017</a>) and using the Beyotime Colorimetric Assay Kit (Beyotime, China).
