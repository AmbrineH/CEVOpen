 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing salinity significantly inhibited rosemary plant growth due to the accumulation of salts in plant tissues and reduced vegetative growth which is consistent with several reports (Munns, 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>; Gupta and Huang, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2014</a>; Shrivastava and Kumar, 
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">2015</a>). The improved vegetative growth of several crops following SA treatments had been widely recorded (Gunes et al., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2007</a>; Kovácik et al., 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">2009</a>; Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2011</a>). Bagherifard et al. (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2015</a>) reported that 5% SA was effective in enhancing fresh and dry weights and overall plant growth in Artichoke (
  <span class="italic">Cynara Scolymus</span> L.) under saline conditions. These morphological effects have been associated with enhanced gas exchange parameters including stomatal closure (Mateo et al., 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">2004</a>; Melotto et al., 
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">2006</a>; Stevens et al., 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2006</a>) and hormonal status (Abreu and Munné-Bosch, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2009</a>). The relatively stable four major oil constitutes of the Egyptian rosemary found in this study were cineol, camphor, linalool, and α-pinene which showed variations in their overall ratios. Previous investigations reported that the major rosemary oil constitutes are camphor, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, camphene, β-caryophyllene, limonene, α-terpineol, myrcene, p-cymene, bornyl acetate, and linalool (Salido et al., 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2003</a>; Langroudi et al., 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2013</a>). In this study, significant changes in the essential oil composition following saline and SA treatments have been reported. Such variations following drought/SA treatments have been reported in other medicinal plants belonging to the same family (Lamiaceae) such as 
  <span class="italic">Thymus daenensis Celak. Thymus daenensis Celak</span> was subjected to drought stress conditions and higher oil yields and changes in specific oil constitutes such as a-pinene, β-caryophyllene, and thymol following SA treatments were recorded (Pribalouti et al., 
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2014</a>). Idrees et al. (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2010</a>) found that SA may increase the essential oil content of plants by increasing nutrient uptake and number of oil glands as well as influencing monoterpene biosynthesis. Langroudi et al. (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2013</a>) also reported that salinity may affect major essential oil constitutes of rosemary plants such as cineol, camphor and α-pinene which is consistent with our results.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of saline water (2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl) in irrigation of rosemary plants caused significant increases in the phenolic, chlorophyll, proline, Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>, and Cl
  <span class="sup">−</span> compositions of leaves. Interestingly, SA treatments at 200–300 ppm caused alleviation of stress effects resulting in significant increases in the total phenolic, chlorophyll, carbohydrates, and proline compositions of leaves along with reduction in Cl
  <span class="sup">−</span> and Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>. The phenolic composition of rosemary leaves increased as a response to salinity as well as SA treatments which support previous investigations (Gupta and Huang, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2014</a>; Bagherifard et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2015</a>). Bagherifard et al. (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2015</a>) found that salinity and SA may increase the flavonoid composition (phenolic compartment) and the antioxidant activity in artichoke (
  <span class="italic">Cynara Scolymus</span> L.). In the current study, under saline irrigation, salt accumulation was found due to the increased ratios of Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> and Cl
  <span class="sup">−</span> in the leaves which are in agreement with previous studies (Munns, 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>). Proline is one of the major compatible solutes that accumulate following salt stress to protect the cell and maintain continuous water influx (Hoque et al., 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2007</a>). The increase in the accumulation of proline in rosemary subjected to salinity (2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl) and SA sprays (200–300 ppm) shows the promising effect of SA during stress conditions. The accumulation of carbohydrates following SA treatments under saline irrigation indicates enhanced stress tolerance which agrees with previous investigations that reported carbohydrate accumulation as an indicator of osmotic adjustment, carbon storage, scavenging of reactive oxygen and stress tolerance in plants (Yin et al., 
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">2010</a>; Gupta and Huang, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2014</a>). Several investigations indicated that SA is a strong regulator of photosynthesis and chlorophyll composition in leaves by influencing chlorophyll content (Fariduddin et al., 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2003</a>), carotenoid composition (Gao et al., 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2012</a>), and stomatal closure (Khokon et al., 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2011</a>). SA may play a role in enhancing plant stress tolerance (Horváth et al., 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">2007</a>; Kovácik et al., 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">2009</a>; Li et al., 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">2014</a>). However, few reports studied the antioxidant mechanism driving SA-mediated stress tolerance in plants. Gholamnezhad et al. (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2016</a>) reported that SA may affect the activities of some enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase in infected wheat plants. Mutlu et al. (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">2016</a>) reported that SA alleviated cold damage in barley subjected to cold stress by stimulating the activities of SOD and POD enzymes. Zhang et al. (
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2011</a>) reported that SA may influence hydrogen peroxide production in chilled cucumber subjected. This is the first study which proves that SA may stimulate the antioxidant mechanism pathway in rosemary plants subjected to salinity by stimulating antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, APX, and CAT). These results are in agreement with that reported by He and Zhu (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">2008</a>) who found that the exogenous salicylic acid decreases NaCl toxicity and enhance antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, APX, and CAT) in tomato. However, it has been long accepted that salicylic acid enhances H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> content by inactivation of H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>-removing enzymes such as APX and CAT and the increase of H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>-producing enzymes such as SOD (Durner and Klessig, 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">1995</a>; Rao et al., 
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">1997</a>). Moreover, the exogenous salicylic acid not always has a positive effect in ameliorating the oxidative stress imposed by salinity (Barba-Espín et al., 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2011</a>). These variable results might explain that the effect of exogenous salicylic acid on antioxidant enzymes activities and stress alleviation depends on plant species. The APX and 3 SOD genes revealed higher levels in SA-treated rosemary under salt stress, when compared to non-sprayed plants, indicating the important roles of salicylic acid and antioxidants under salinity and abiotic stresses. Moreover, in order to study the effect of SA treatment at the transcriptional level, a number of important genes conferring salt tolerance such as DREB2 (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein; Chen et al., 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2007</a>), bZIP62 (Liao et al., 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2008</a>), ERF3 (Zhang et al., 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2009</a>), and OLPb (osmotin-like protein b; Tachi et al., 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2009</a>) has been selected and analyzed in this study. These specific genes were selected due to their potential use as models to study the changes at the transcriptional level under salt stress (Kim et al., 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2017</a>). Therefore, this study investigated whether SA will modulate the expression of such genes in rosemary under salt stress. The expression levels of these genes were enhanced in SA-treated rosemary under saline conditions, indicating that SA treatment resulted in the modulation of such genes expression which in turn enhanced rosemary tolerance to salinity stress.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High salinity in the plant environment produces high ratios of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may damage plant cells. Plants produce non-enzymatic antioxidants such as phenols (e.g., flavonoids) that play a pivotal role in detoxyifying signlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and others (Gupta and Huang, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2014</a>; Rakhmankulova et al., 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2015</a>; AbdElgawad et al., 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2016</a>). Rosemary plants subjected to salinity at 2,000 and 4,000 ppm NaCl showed higher antioxidant activities in their leaves extracts and their essential oils compared to NaCl-untreated plants. Also, SA treated plants with 100–300 ppm and grown under saline irrigation at 2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl showed higher antioxidant activities in leaves extracts and essential oils than SA-untreated plants. The higher antioxidant activities in leaf extracts of plants subjected to high salinity levels and/or SA treatments at 100–300 ppm are associated with higher composition of phenols. Previous reports indicated that SA application may protect the photosynthesis by reducing the oxidative stress (Ananieva et al., 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">2002</a>; Krantev et al., 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">2008</a>). In addition, SA may enhance stress tolerance by improving their antioxidant activities (Horváth et al., 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">2007</a>). The higher antioxidant activities in the essential oils of plants treated with high saline (2,000 and 4,000 ppm NaCl) and/or SA sprays compared to control might be explained by the changes in the chemical composition of the essential oil itself as well as the probable higher antioxidant activities of the fluctuating essential oils main components. Elansary et al. (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2015</a>) reported fluctuations in the main oil constitutes of 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum basilicm</span> (Lamiaceae) subjected to water stress. The fluctuation of the main oil constitutes (e.g., phenolic compounds) had been associated with SA application in other plants such as in 
  <span class="italic">Thymus daenensis</span> Celak (Lamiaceae) subjected to drought stress (Pribalouti et al., 
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2014</a>) and in 
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinallis</span> (Lamiaceae) under normal conditions (da Silva et al., 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils showed obvious antibacterial activities against several bacteria and such results agreed with previous investigations (Fu et al., 
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">2007</a>; Zaouali et al., 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2010</a>). In the current study, it was noted that increasing salinity levels as well as SA concentrations are associated with increased antibacterial activities. In most recent studies, there were a clear correlation between the nature and proportion of the main oil constitutes and the antibacterial activities found. Olfa et al. (
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2016</a>) reported specific higher antibacterial activities of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Origanum majorana</span> L. (Lamiaceae) plants subjected to saline conditions compared to normally grown plants. Pribalouti et al. (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2014</a>) suggested that stress conditions (e.g., water stress) may affect the amounts of phenolic compounds in the essential oils. In the current study, we found significant increases in specific constitutes of the essential oil of plants subjected to salinity and SA such as linalool, camphor, borneol, and caryophyllene oxide. For example, Federman et al. (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2016</a>) reported that the major oil constitute of the orange was the linalool responsible for inhibiting growth and biofilm formation in 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increases in specific essential oil constitutes as well as enhancement of leaves bioactivity as a response to SA treatment might be attributed to the antioxidant enzymatic mechanism pathway including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) as well as enhancing gene expression of APX, 3 SOD isoforms, bZIP62, DREB2, ERF3, and OLPb. The application of SA not only improve the performance of rosemary plants under stress conditions but also increases pharmaceutical value of the crop as antibacterial agent and enhances the composition of the oil and leaves.</p>
