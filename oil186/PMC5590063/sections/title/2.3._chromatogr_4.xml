 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed in order to determine the relative proportions of the components of the oils. GC analyses were carried on a Thermo TraceGC Ultra (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) and a VB-5 fused silica capillary column (ValcoBond 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 mm) (Valco Instruments Company Inc. , Houston, TX, USA). Nitrogen was employed as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min and 30 psi inlet pressure. The oven temperature program was initially 40 °C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 °C at 4 °C/min, and was then held for 5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The sample (1 µL; 2 mg/mL in n-hexane) was injected splitless. The relative amount of each component was estimated from the corresponding peak area and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the chromatogram. Analyses were carried out in triplicate.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of the compounds present in the oils was performed by GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses were carried out using an Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) quadrupole instrument equipped with an Agilent J&amp;W non-polar DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 μm) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For each sample, 1 μL was injected in split mode (50:1) with the injector temperature set to 250 °C. GC oven temperature was set to 40 °C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 °C at 4 °C/min, and was then held for 5 min. Helium (He) was used as a carrier gas at a flow of 1 mL/min, maintained at a constant pressure of 7.0 psi. MS Source and quadrupole temperatures were set to 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV (in EI mode) with a scanning speed of 1.0 scans from

Subsequently, the MS data acquired for each component were matched with the data available in the mass spectral library of the GC-MS system (MassFinder 4, Dr. Hochmuth scientific consulting, Hamburg, Germany); NIST08 Mass Spectral Library (ChemSW Inc. Fairfield, CA, USA); Wiley Registry™ of Mass Spectral Data 9th Edition (Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA) and with other published mass spectral data [
