 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidiasis is the most frequent infection caused by opportunistic fungi, with a very extensive spectrum ranging from mild manifestations (e.g., a colonization of mucosal tissues) to systemic infections with the invasion of different organs [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00027">1</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> is the most common causative agent in humans, but the species 
  <span class="italic">Candida tropicalis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Candida glabrata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Candida krusei</span> are also commonly associated with serious infections [
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00027">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-medicines-04-00027">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00027">4</a>]. In addition, 
  <span class="italic">C. glabrata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. krusei</span> are described as having intrinsic resistance to some of the more conventional antifungal drugs [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00027">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00027">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Azole antifungal agents are the most used in therapeutic regimens for the treatment of candidiasis. However, these antibiotics are not always successful because of the significant incidence of microorganism resistance [
  <a rid="B7-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-medicines-04-00027">7</a>]. This has stimulated the search for new antifungal agents in order to increase the number of alternatives to treat infections and minimize the impact of resistance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural products have been traditionally used to treat many diseases, including fungal infections, and plant compounds have been explored by the pharmaceutical industry for use as antimicrobial agents or as models for the synthesis of new drugs [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00027">8</a>]. Essential oils, which consist in liquid, are volatile, and are rarely colored mixtures of compounds soluble in organic solvents, are among these potential alternatives [
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00027">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00027">10</a>]. The essential oils are usually constituted by some components at high concentrations (20â€“70%), being deemed majoritary compounds, while the other components are present in trace amounts [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00027">11</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants from Caatinga and Atlantic Forest have also been used to obtain natural medicines by Brazilian local populations [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00027">12</a>]. However, despite the rich flora of these biomes, the biotechnological potential of plants as sources of antifungal agents has not been extensively studied. Thus, screening programs are very important in order to prospect for compounds for developing new antimicrobial drugs. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted with essential oils from three medicinal plants of Brazilian flora. 
  <span class="italic">Hymenaea courbaril</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">courbaril</span> (Fabaceae) has a broad distribution being found in Brazil at Atlantic and Amazon Forests, Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal. It has several medicinal uses; for example, the stem bark decoction or syrup can be used against coughs and anemia, and leaf infusion can be used against urinary tract disorders [
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00027">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-medicines-04-00027">14</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Myroxylon peruiferum</span> (Fabaceae) is found at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado and has heavy wood that is resistant to deterioration. Its bark is used as an anti-inflammatory, and the fruits are used to alleviate earache [
  <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00027">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00027">16</a>]. The leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Vismia guianensis</span> (Hypericaceae) are used against problems in spine and kidneys as well as to alleviate pains in general [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00027">17</a>]. This plant can be found in the Amazon and Atlantic Forests [
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00027">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this work was to determine the chemical composition of essential oils from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">courbaril</span>, 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> and to evaluate the antifungal activity of them against 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species.
