 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The powders of leaves were separately submitted to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 4 h. The essential oils obtained were then dried over an anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in sealed vials protected from the light at −20 °C. The essential oil emulsions used in antifungal assays were prepared as follows: 400 µL of essential oil plus 40 µL of Tween 80 and 4.56 mL of sterile distilled water were combined and shaken for 5 min using a vortex, obtaining emulsions with a final concentration of 80 μL/mL. </p>
