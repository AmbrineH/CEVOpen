 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, MPE was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span>. In MPE rich in menthol, l-menthone, pulegone, piperitone, caryophyllene, and menthol acetate, these are the major compounds which are reported in many articles.[
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>
  <a rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref46">46</a>] In addition, δ-cadinene, copaene, eugenol, methyl pivalate, menthomenthene, thujopsene, caryophyllene oxide also some of the compound identified in MPE and demonstrated antifungal activity and antibacterial activity.[
  <a rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref47">47</a>
  <a rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref48">48</a>
  <a rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref49">49</a>

  <a rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref51">51</a>
  <a rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref52">52</a>] Further, the anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic effects were reported by Sun 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014.[
  <a rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref53">53</a>] The MIC values of MPE obtained in this study were 500 µg/mL and 1000 µg/mL at this particular concentration; the fungal growth was minimum as compared to untreated fungal cells. The potential mechanisms of volatile compounds as reported could damage the cell and disturb the cellular metabolism.[
  <a rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref54">54</a>] The previous report concluded that volatile compounds act as H 
  <span class="sup">+</span> carriers and depletion of adenosine triphosphate takes place and disturb the cellular membrane, by reacting with the active sites of cellular enzymes.[
  <a rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref55">55</a>
  <a rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref56">56</a>] The present study clearly demonstrates that the antifungal activity of MPE supported by SEM images of MPE showing morphological changes in the fungal hyphae due to the leakage of ions, leakage of molecular substances, and lesions as well as discrepancies in cell metabolism.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extracellular enzymes are synthesized inside the cell and then secreted outside the cell, where their function is to break down complex macromolecules into smaller units to be taken up by the cell for growth and assimilation. Extracellular pH was determined to explain the release of the cellular material and the changes of membrane permeabilization. Results showed that, after the treatment of the MPE, the release of cell constituents in the fungi suspensions visibly increased compare to control. Meanwhile, after 30 min of exposure, the MPE apparently induced the leakage of intracellular protons as evidenced by the decrease in the values of extracellular pH. These findings suggest the irreversible damage to the cytoplasmic membranes of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cell membrane encoding lipids is a major component of the cell. It performs many important functions including increasing the stability of the membrane, reducing the permeability of water-soluble materials, and adjusting the liquidity of the membrane.[
  <a rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref57">57</a>] The decrease in membrane stability and increased in permeability of water-soluble materials suggest the decrease in lipid content.[
  <a rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref44">44</a>] The previous studies regarding volatile compounds have been reported to disrupt the lipid structures of the cells.[
  <a rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref58">58</a>] A significant decrease in lipid content of 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> cells in fumigated and nonfumigated cells with 1 µL/mL of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</span> essential oil (
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil (
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span>) were reported by.[
  <a rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref44">44</a>
  <a rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref59">59</a>] In the present study, the addition of MPE significantly decreased the lipid content of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span>. These results suggest that MPE is capable of acting on the cell membrane structure and disrupt the cell membrane integrity.
