 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extracellular pH was measured by Shao 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref43">43</a>] method. The extracellular pH of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span> was determined by eutech pH meter. The fungal suspension 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> CFU/mL were added to 20 mL PDB and incubated in a moist chamber at 28°C ± 2°C for 2 days. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was collected, washed for 2–3 times with sterilized double-distilled water, and resuspended in 20 mL sterilized double-distilled water. After the addition of the MPE, the extracellular pH was determined.
