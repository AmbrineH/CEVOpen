 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the present study indicate the antifungal efficacy of MPE, by changes in the morphological alteration, and growth inhibition effects on 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span>. These findings suggest that MPE may be used to control 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</span>. Future studies with its toxic metabolites should be conducted to evaluate the potency of MPE to generate more effective natural fungicides or preventives which is less risk or safe to the environment and health.
