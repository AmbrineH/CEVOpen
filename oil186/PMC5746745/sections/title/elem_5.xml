  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples analyzed showed a quite stable M+2/M+3 ratio of 1.2 ± 0.3 for camphor and 1.2 ± 0.3 for cineole. Also, the M+2/(M+2 + M+3) ratio was very stable (0.5 ± 0.1 for camphor and 0.5 ± 0.1 for cineole). If both monoterpenes are produced exclusively through the MEP pathway the expected values for their ratios would be 1 and 0.5 respectively. If the MVA pathway is involved, the ratios would rise above those numbers, because of the presence of more M+2 coming from IPP from the cytosolic space. The observed values are therefore in the range of those expected for monoterpene biosynthesis mainly via the MEP pathway in

   <sub>2</sub> Labelling in Transgenic HMGR5 Plants
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metabolic engineering studies in spike lavender demonstrated that MEP and MVA pathways may be implicated in the monoterpene biosynthesis. Nevertheless, essential oil yield was always higher in those transgenic spike lavender plants overexpressing the DXS gene. Previous work using specific inhibitors of both pathways and feeding experiments with [U-
   <span class="sup">13</span>C6]-glucose, suggested a minor contribution of the MVA pathway that was increased in transgenic (HMGR5) spike lavender plants [
   <a rid="B37-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-metabolites-07-00065">37</a>]. Results presented here using labelled 
   <span class="sup">13</span>CO
   <sub>2</sub> confirmed that in WT and transgenic HMGR spike lavender plants, the biosynthesis of camphor and cineole happen in a very robust way through the MEP pathway according to the results achieved with NMR and GC/MS. Still, outcomes with HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants cast doubt about the fact that the MVA pathway might be involved, even in a small share, on the production of monoterpenes because of the higher content of essential oil in those plants. It is well known that the MVA and MEP pathways are not totally independent as there is some crosstalk between them through common intermediates [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results herein do not clearly support that the increased monoterpene production in HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants are due to a transport of MVA-derived units from the cytoplasm to plastids. It is true that analysis of metabolic flux based on 
   <span class="sup">13</span>CO
   <sub>2</sub> labelling does not constitute a direct method for the investigation of the cross-talk between both pathways [
   <a rid="B57-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-metabolites-07-00065">57</a>]. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the MEP/monoterpene pathway is regulated by a product of the MVA-route at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational and/or posttranslational level [
   <a rid="B13-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-metabolites-07-00065">13</a>]; therefore, the increased monoterpene production in HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants could also be explained by feedback MEP pathway gene-regulation in response to HMGR overexpression. As an example, MVA-derived prenylated proteins were shown to regulate the expression of genes in the early steps of monoterpenoid biosynthesis in 
   <span class="italic">Catharanthus roseus</span> cells [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In future experiments, the expression levels of selected enzymes, specifically HMGR before the pulse period, and during/after the chase periods should be monitored in connection with

   <sub>6</sub>]glucose in combination with inhibitors of the MVA (e.g., mevinoline) and MEP pathways (e.g., fosmidomicine) might help to further clarify the role of a potential crosstalk between the terpene pathways. In any case, it will be important to include other terpenes such as sesquiterpenes, sterols and carotenoids into future studies, in order to finally clarify the distribution of MEP vs. MEV building blocks in the terpenes from
