 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To introduce NPL as a strategy to reduce mosquito bites requires governmental approval from several ministriesâ€™ (Health, Agriculture, Science and Education, Planning and Reconstruction), and collaborations from university (faculty of medicine, agriculture), UN agencies (WHO, Global Fund, UNICEF), foreign donors, governments, and agricultural cooperatives who devised the implementation strategy. Working with the media acquaints the population to the opportunities and challenges and plays an important role mobilizing the decision makers at the local and political sphere.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applying the mosquito repellent frequently demonstrates a high degree of acceptability. Rather than just lotions, the 31 individuals from the study also suggested incorporating the essential oil in perfumes (21), soaps (25), and indoor sprays (20). Rowland

  </span> reported that adding DEET to soap reduced the number of cases of malaria by 50%.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results are encouraging considering that, on average, people may be bitten 75 times per night
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. The combination of mosquito repellents and insecticide impregnated nets reduced malaria 80% more than for individuals that only slept under nets

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquitos are developing resistance to insecticide treated nets and they are changing their feeding habits to adapt to the reduced availability of their prey during the night. These adaptations by the 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> mosquito requires new strategies to ensure that the world malaria death rates continue to decline. We recommend that local populations grow and produce their own mosquito repellent with sustainable resources like coffee husks, bagasse, or other waste lignocellulosic feeds stocks. More work is required to identify alternative energy sources and extraction technologies that are more efficient to isolate the essential oil. Furthermore, we recognize that mosquitos may also develop a tolerance for any repellent and therefore, we must continue to develop other agriculturally based compounds to protect vulnerable populations, particularly children and pregnant women.
