  <sub>4</sub>-Induced Liver Fibrosis
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CCl
  <sub>4</sub> caused a marked disruption of oxidant/antioxidant balance in liver as indicated by the statistically significant elevation in MDA and NO levels to 236% and 407% in group 2 as compared to the control group (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). Besides, there was a marked reduction in SOD and CAT antioxidant enzymes activities with a dramatic depletion in hepatic GSH content to 24.4%, 43.2%, and 23.4% of the control levels, respectively (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). In the same line, TAC of the liver of CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-intoxicated group showed a significant reduction to 39.7% (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). Administration of MPOE concurrently with CCl
  <sub>4</sub> for 6 weeks (group 3) showed a significant reduction of MDA and NO levels compared to those of group 2 (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). MPOE partially restored SOD and CAT activities and GSH level (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). Improvement of CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative stress by MPOE was confirmed by the significant elevation of TAC, reaching 74% of the normal control level (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). There were no significant differences in all measured oxidative stress markers or antioxidant parameters between groups 1 and 4 (Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">4</a>).
