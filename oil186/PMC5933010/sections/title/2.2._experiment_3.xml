 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult male rats (150–170 g) were obtained from the breeding unit of the Research Institute of Ophthalmology (Giza, Egypt). Rats were housed under constant temperature and 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to water and standard chow diet. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Cairo University (CU-II-F-1-18).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 (control) was given corn oil (2 mL/kg, IP). Group 2 (fibrosis model) was given CCl
  <sub>4</sub> 1 : 4 mixture with corn oil (2.5 mL/kg, IP) twice weekly for eight weeks. Rats in group 3 received CCl
  <sub>4</sub> for two weeks to establish liver injury and fibrosis and then treated with MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP), daily from the 3rd to 8th week. Group 4 received MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP) from the 3rd to 8th week. The selected dose for MPOE (50 mg/kg) was previously reported to be hepatoprotective for rats [
