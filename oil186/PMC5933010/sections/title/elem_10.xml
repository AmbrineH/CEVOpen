  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrodistilled MPEO was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Ten chemical constituents could be identified by elution on HP-5872 column (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The major constituents of MPEO, in order of their percentage (
