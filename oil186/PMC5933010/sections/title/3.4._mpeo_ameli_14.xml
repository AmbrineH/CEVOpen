  <sub>4</sub>-Induced Liver Fibrosis
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The histopathological examination of the normal and MPOE groups revealed normal histological hepatic architecture (Figures 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2(a)</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2(d)</a>). The fibrosis control group (group 2) showed marked fatty degeneration of the hepatocytes, hepatocellular necrosis with mononuclear inflammatory cell aggregation, and collagen fibers bridging (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(b)</a>). Group 3, receiving CCl
  <sub>4</sub> + MPOE, showed marked attenuation of the previously described histopathological lesions compared to the fibrotic control group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(c)</a>). With MT staining, the liver of the control and MPEO groups showed normal distribution of collagen fibers (Figures 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">3(a)</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">3(d)</a>). The fibrotic control group showed severe bridging fibrosis with marked collagen deposition in the liver extending from portal to portal, portal to central, and central to central and formation of pseudolobules (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3(b)</a>). In group 3 (CCl
  <sub>4</sub> + MPEO), the collagen deposition was markedly reduced, and the collagenous septa became thinner than those of the fibrotic control group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3(c)</a>). The histopathological grading of liver fibrosis and the morphometric analysis of liver fibrosis % in different groups are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3(e)</a>, respectively, group 1 and 4 showed no significant difference in the liver fibrosis grading or fibrosis % (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3(e)</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>). Group 3 (CCl
  <sub>4</sub> + MPEO) showed significant reduction of the grading of liver fibrosis and fibrosis % compared to the fibrosis control group 2 as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3(e)</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>.
