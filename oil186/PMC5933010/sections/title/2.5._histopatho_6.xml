 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seven liver samples were harvested from each experimental group and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then processed to obtain 4 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m paraffin-embedded sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson's trichrome (MT). MT staining was performed to assess collagen fibers distribution and to determine liver fibrosis %. A numerical scoring system [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>] was performed to assess the grade of fibrosis, as follows: 0, no fibrosis (normal); 1, fibrous expansion of some portal areas; 2, fibrous expansion of most portal areas; 3, fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal-to-portal bridging; 4, fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal as well as portal to central); 5, marked bridging (portal to central as well as central to central) with occasional nodules formation; and 6, cirrhosis.
