 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Myracrodruon urundeuva</span> showed promising Gram-positive and Gram-negative antibacterial activity. Additionally, the in vitro cytotoxicity test results were satisfactory, since the oil was not toxic to human cells and displayed an antitumor effect, showing its potential as a reliable source for phyto-pharmaceutics in the future. Although further in vivo assays and in vitro toxicity studies are necessary in normal human cells to prove its efficacy and safety in pre-clinical use, the results obtained here for 
  <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> essential oil are already promising from a pharmacological point of view and suggest future applications.
