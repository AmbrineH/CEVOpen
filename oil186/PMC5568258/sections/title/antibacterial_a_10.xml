 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial activity of the oil was assessed quantitatively by the broth microdilution technique in 96 well microplates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. The test sample (T) was diluted serially at the following concentrations: 450; 225; 112.5; 56; 28; 14; 7; 3.52; 1.76; 0.88; 0.44; 0.22; 0.11; 0.055; 0.028 and 0.014 mg/mL. The positive control (PC) used serial dilutions of gentamicin (Gentamisan - SANTISA®) at a concentration of 0.016 mg/mL or 16 μg/mL. As a negative control (NC), an aqueous solution of 5% Tween 80 was used. We then added 20 μL of the inoculum solution to each of the wells. In the growth control (GC), only the inoculum was added. The microplate was incubated at 37 °C/24 h to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). All tests were performed in triplicate.
