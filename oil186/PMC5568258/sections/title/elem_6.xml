   <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> were collected from ten (10) specimens grown in the Núcleo de Pesquisa em Agricultura Urbana (NEPAU), Department of Plant Science, Ceará Federal University (UFC), Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. The leaves were collected with the aid of pruning shears at four different points in the tree canopy and then were mixed in paper bags to form composite samples. After being cut and mixed, they were packed in a drying oven at 75 °C. The dry weight of the collected plant material was 100 kg. The voucher specimen (No. 48904) was deposited at the Prisco Bezerra Herbarium of the Department of Biology, Ceará Federal University. To extract the essential oil, 
   <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> leaves were hydrodistilled in a Clevenger-type apparatus, as adapted by Gottlieb [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In this process, fresh 
   <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> leaves were placed in a 5 L flask, into which 2 L of distilled water were added and the system was boiled for 2 h, until it reached 80 °C, to afford yellowish oils by steam stripping. These were dried over Na
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub>, stored in sealed glass vials, and preserved under refrigeration before analysis. The yield of the oils (0.02% 
   <span class="italic">w</span>/w) was calculated from the fresh weight of the plant materials. The oily extract, weighed on a precision scale, revealed a concentration of 0.9 g/mL.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identification of essential oil constituents</div>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils were analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The same chromatographic conditions were used for GC-MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010-Plus) and GC-FID (GC-20100FI) analysis. The oil was analyzed using an RTx-5 infused-silica capillary column (30 m × 0,25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness); the splitless injection used an injector temperature of 220 °C, and the column was programmed to run from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min and held isothermal for 7 min. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, and helium and hydrogen (H
   <sub>2</sub>) were used as the gas carriers for the GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, respectively. The interface temperature of the GC-MS was 240 °C and mass spectra were recorded from 30 to 450 
   <span class="italic">m/z</span>, at a scan interval of 0.5 s and an electron impact ionization voltage of 70 eV. Individual components were identified by comparing the acquired mass spectrum with reference data using the Wiley L-Built library and by comparing their retention indices with a commercially available database (NIST 2.0) and the indices described by [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Additional identification was obtained by using a compound’s experimental Kovat’s retention index (RI), as calculated from a C9-C24 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes series.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial activity of the oil was assessed quantitatively by the broth microdilution technique in 96 well microplates [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. The test sample (T) was diluted serially at the following concentrations: 450; 225; 112.5; 56; 28; 14; 7; 3.52; 1.76; 0.88; 0.44; 0.22; 0.11; 0.055; 0.028 and 0.014 mg/mL. The positive control (PC) used serial dilutions of gentamicin (Gentamisan - SANTISA®) at a concentration of 0.016 mg/mL or 16 μg/mL. As a negative control (NC), an aqueous solution of 5% Tween 80 was used. We then added 20 μL of the inoculum solution to each of the wells. In the growth control (GC), only the inoculum was added. The microplate was incubated at 37 °C/24 h to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). All tests were performed in triplicate.

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bactericidal activity of the test oil was measured after reading the MIC by seeding the contents of the micro-titer wells into BHI agar. The most representative wells of the T, PC, NC and GC groups were chosen. From each selected well, 8 μL was seeded in specific regions numbered on the back of the Petri dishes, which were then incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h of incubation, readings were carried out to determine the bactericidal action of the oil. The MBC was considered the lowest concentration that totally prevented microbial growth in BHI agar.</p>

The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. To assess the viability and proliferation rate of the cell lines in the presence of the oil, a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT (3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was performed as described by Mosmann (1983) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. This technique evaluates the metabolic activity of the cells by quantifying the MTT reduction by NADPH and NADH-associated dehydrogenases that results in the production of formazan crystals within the cells, giving the characteristic coloration to the medium. For this study, cells were placed in 96 well plates with a density of 5 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> cells/well. After 24 h under the culture conditions, serum deprivation was performed, and, after another 24 h, we applied 
   <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> essential oil at concentrations of 0.275 mg/mL, 0.55 mg/mL, 1.1 mg/mL, 2.2 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL to the cell strains. After the cells were treated for 24 h or 48 h, 100 μL/​​well of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and incubated for 4 h. After this, the medium was removed and 100 μL of ethanol was added to each well. The plates were shaken and the absorbance obtained in a microplate reader (Epoch - BioTek Instruments Inc., USA) at 570 nm, using Gen5 Data Analysis version 2.0 software (BioTek Instruments Inc., USA). The growth control consisted only of cell culture in the culture medium. The assays were assessed in triplicate and the cell viability percentage was calculated as follows:
