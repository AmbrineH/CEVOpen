 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bactericidal activity of the test oil was measured after reading the MIC by seeding the contents of the micro-titer wells into BHI agar. The most representative wells of the T, PC, NC and GC groups were chosen. From each selected well, 8 μL was seeded in specific regions numbered on the back of the Petri dishes, which were then incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h of incubation, readings were carried out to determine the bactericidal action of the oil. The MBC was considered the lowest concentration that totally prevented microbial growth in BHI agar.</p>
