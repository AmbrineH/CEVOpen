 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a great number of unexpected environmental, social, or pathological stimuli that happen during life and that can trigger stress. Being exposed to external stressors is recognized to increase the risk of psychiatric disorders such as depression, high susceptibility to infections, cancer development, and immune dysfunctions especially due to the higher levels of glucocorticoids (
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>). There is growing evidence in recent years indicating that exposure to certain psychological experiences, including stress-induced diseases, is closely connected with variations in immune parameters. In some cases, it has been noticed that both depression and chronic stressors have had significant connections with reduced adaptive/acquired immunity and inflammation; however, only recent studies have pointed out that after being exposed to stress or during certain episodes of depression, an innate inflammatory/immune response is strongly activated (

  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>). The study by Munhoz, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., for instance, reveals that chronic unpredictable stress potentiated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus (

  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>). Recently, a number of research works have shown interest in TLRs and their potential roles in neuropathology (
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>). The finding that neurons, astrocytes and resident microglia express TLRs, just like immune cells (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>), has challenged the way neuroscience explains the role of the brain’s immune system (
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>). In an experimental model of depression in rodents, the expression of mRNA levels for Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR-4) in the brain cortex overweighed those in a normal brain (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, there is a growing interest in the use of medicinal plants as a group of natural substances that could be a good source for managing of disorders. Considerable attention has been invested in the positive effects of natural medication on alleviating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders (
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>). The Lamiaceae family is among the largest and most distinctive families of flowering plants. It has about 220 genera and almost 4000 species worldwide (
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>). Labiatae are best known for the essential oils of many family members. 
  <span class="italic">Origanum vulgare L.</span> “Oregano” as an aromatic plant is rich in phenolic compounds with therapeutic actions widely distributed throughout Asia, including Iran. Oregano is the herb widely used in cooking and natural medicine. It has applied for the treatment of respiratory and hypoglycemic diseases and microorganisms inhibition (

  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a>
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>). Previous studies have shown that oregano oil contains thymol, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, cis-terpinene, p-cymene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and sabinene hydrate as the main components (
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>). It has been reported that thymol exhibit significant anti-anxiety activity in rat (
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>). Moreover, in the plus maze test, anxiolytic effects are presented by carvacrol (5-isopropyl-2-methylphenol) (
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>), which is one of the major components of the essential oil of oregano (
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of active components such as thymol and carvacrol from oregano that have been shown to induce anti-anxiety effects and other bioactive polyphenols, prompted us to assess the antidepressant potential of oregano essential oil. To the best of our knowledge, the antidepressant effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) have not been fully investigated. In this present study, the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to further elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of oregano. In the (CUS) model (
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>), animals are subjected to a variety of unpredictable stressors continuously leading to neurochemical and behavioral changes that are similar to those found in people with depression. Furthermore, since the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are critical for stress (

  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>), the corresponding changes in TLR2/4 gene expression in these important brain areas were examined along with the behavioral evaluation.
