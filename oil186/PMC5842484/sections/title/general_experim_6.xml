 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rats were assigned randomly into seven groups (n = 7 per group): intact animal (lack of exposure to stress or treatment with drugs), control (daily treatment with saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p, 14 days), OEO daily treatment with essential oil of oregano (0.2 mL/kg, i.p, 14 days). For another four groups, the animals were treated with CUS procedures for 24 days. The details of CUS are explained in fallowing section. Afterwards, these CUS treated rats were given different drugs accompanied with CUS procedures. Administration of drugs was done daily in the evening (3-4 p.m.) for 14 consecutive days, starting on the tenth day of the CUS procedure.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rats in the CUS + OEO received essential oil of oregano (0.2 mL /kg, i.p.), CUS + fluoxetine (FLX) group was given fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p. Aria Pharmaceutical Co. Iran), CUS + diazepam (DZ) rats treated with diazepam (3 mg/kg, i.p. Sobhan Darou Co. Iran) and the CUS group only supplied with saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chronic unpredictable stress has influence on animal behavior. Here, we examined the depressive like behavior using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in rat CUS model. Before the start of the CUS protocol the animals were tested with the FST and SPT to determine the animals’ depressive state (baseline, 1 day). In the period of CUS exposure (10 days) depressive like behavior was evaluated using SPT and FST as well. At the end of treatments (25 days), anti-depressive effects of different drugs were evaluated using SPT and FST. The weights of rats were determined in parallel with behavioral tests at 1, 10, and 25 days.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the previous pilot study, our results indicated that acute administration of the OEO (50, 100, and 200 μL/kg, i.p.) produced a dose response antidepressant-like effect in the FST (unpublished data). According to results of the pilot study, the most effective dose (200 μL/kg) has been chosen for repeated administration in chronic stressed animals.</p>
