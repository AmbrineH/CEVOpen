 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantification of relative RNA expression followed established methods using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the SYBR green reporter dye. Template cDNAs in each sample tested for quantitative expression levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 genes and housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)), using a Bio-Rad iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, USA).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2× universal master mix (Takara, Japane) was used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. The amplification program was as follows: a denaturation step of 30 s at 95 °C and 35 cycles for real-time PCR including 5 s at 95 °C (denaturation), 30 s at 62 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (polymerase elongation). A final melting curve of fluorescence 
  <span class="italic">vs</span> temperature was generated to screen for primer dimers and to document single product formation. To confirm the amplification specificity of the PCR, products from each primer pairs, in addition to melting curve analysis, were subjected to subsequent agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis.

  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>. The amount of PCR products were normalized with HKG primers in separate reactions. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Linearity and efficiency of PCR amplification were assessed using standard curves generated by decreasing amount of cDNA, using five points, diluted over a twofold range. In qPCR, the relative mRNA levels were calculated by the expression 2-ΔΔCT (
