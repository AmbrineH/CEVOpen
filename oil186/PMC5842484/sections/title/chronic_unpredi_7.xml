 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For induction of chronic stress, the Katz method was used with some modifications (
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>). We used this protocol because it was used as an animal model to induce anxiety. This animal model of stress consists of chronic exposure to variable unpredictable stressors, none of which is sufficient alone to induce long-lasting effects. Vary stressors were used and applied in a different sequence each week to avoid any habituation. Each animal received two stresses per day individually for a period of 24 days. After each stressor, animals were kept in a recovery room for 1 h, following which they were placed in clean cages with fresh bedding and returned to the housing facility. Control rats were individually housed for the same period of time, and were handled daily for 1 min in the housing room, but were not stressed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The animals in stress groups were exposed to the CUS protocol as follows: Day 1, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), tail pinch; day 2, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C), 1 h cage rotation; day 3, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 1 h cold room (4 °C); day 4, 12 h wet bedding, crowded cage; day 5, 24 h food deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 6, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C), crowded cage; day 7, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h cold room isolation; day 8, reversal of the light/dark cycle, tail pinch; day 9, cold room (4 °C), 1h cage rotation; day 10, 24 h water and food deprivation, 12 h cage tilting (45°C); day 11, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), 1 h restraint; day 12, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 24 h food deprivation; day 13, tail pinch, cold room (4 °C); day 14, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 15, 12 h wet bedding, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C); day 16, 1 h cage rotation, reversal of the light/dark cycle; day 17, 1 h restraint, crowded cage; day 18, 12 h wet bedding, tail pinch; day 19, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C); day 20, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), 24 h water deprivation; day 21, 1 h cage rotation, crowded cage; day 22, 24 h food deprivation, tail pinch; day 23, 1 h restraint, 12 h wet bedding; day 24, 24 h water and food deprivation, crowded cage. Definitions: restraint (rats were placed in a restraining device made of plexiglass and flexible nylon, which restricting movement but allowing free respiration and air circulation), tail pinch (tail pinch involved placing the rat in the previously described restraining device, and applying a clothespin 1 cm from the base of the tail), busy cage (high-density housing was 8 rats per cage).</p>
