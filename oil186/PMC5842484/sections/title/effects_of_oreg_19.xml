 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TLR2, TLR4, and GAPDH mRNA amplified and quantitatively detected by the SYBR green I real-time PCR. Melting curve analysis demonstrated that each primer pairs amplified a single product with a distinct melting temperature as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>. Also, all primer pairs produced a single band of the expected size on agarose gel electrophoresis including TLR2, 182; TLR4, 419 and 392 bp for GAPDH; as depicted in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>. There were no significant differences between molecular data in saline (control) and intact animal groups (data not shown). Therefore, the data from these two groups were averaged and used as the control (saline) group.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> a higher levels of TLR2 mRNA was seen in the CUS group compared to control rats in the prefrontal and hippocampus (

Thus, there was no difference in the TLR2 mRNA expression levels between rats treated with CUS + OEO and the CUS group. A significant difference was observed between CUS + OEO group compared to control group in hippocampus (
