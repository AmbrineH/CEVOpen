  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Male Wistar rats with an average weight of 190-240 g were obtained from the animal house of the University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran and animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle condition with free access to food and water. The rats were acclimated to the laboratory for 1 week prior to the start of the experiment. All procedures were in accordance with guidelines for caring and using of laboratory animals in Neuroscience Research Center of Kerman University of Medical Sciences and the Neuroscience Ethic Committee (EC/KNRC/89-5A).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aerial parts of oregano were collected in early summer 2014, near the town of Yazd (Yazd Province, Iran). The plant materials were identified by Dr Seyed Mansour Mirtadzadini, a botanist at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran. The aerial parts of the plant were dried at room temperature and the essential oil (EO) was extracted by hydrodistillation for approximately 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5973 connected with a mass detector HP 6890 fitted with a HP-1 column (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). Helium (at a flow rate 1 mL/min) was used as a carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was programmed 40 °C and then raised at a rate of 3 °C/min to 250 °C; injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization at 70 eV. The identification of the components of the essential oil was accomplished by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra with those of authentic samples also with NIST mass spectral library or those reported in the literature data (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General experimental procedure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rats were assigned randomly into seven groups (n = 7 per group): intact animal (lack of exposure to stress or treatment with drugs), control (daily treatment with saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p, 14 days), OEO daily treatment with essential oil of oregano (0.2 mL/kg, i.p, 14 days). For another four groups, the animals were treated with CUS procedures for 24 days. The details of CUS are explained in fallowing section. Afterwards, these CUS treated rats were given different drugs accompanied with CUS procedures. Administration of drugs was done daily in the evening (3-4 p.m.) for 14 consecutive days, starting on the tenth day of the CUS procedure.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rats in the CUS + OEO received essential oil of oregano (0.2 mL /kg, i.p.), CUS + fluoxetine (FLX) group was given fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p. Aria Pharmaceutical Co. Iran), CUS + diazepam (DZ) rats treated with diazepam (3 mg/kg, i.p. Sobhan Darou Co. Iran) and the CUS group only supplied with saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chronic unpredictable stress has influence on animal behavior. Here, we examined the depressive like behavior using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in rat CUS model. Before the start of the CUS protocol the animals were tested with the FST and SPT to determine the animals’ depressive state (baseline, 1 day). In the period of CUS exposure (10 days) depressive like behavior was evaluated using SPT and FST as well. At the end of treatments (25 days), anti-depressive effects of different drugs were evaluated using SPT and FST. The weights of rats were determined in parallel with behavioral tests at 1, 10, and 25 days.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the previous pilot study, our results indicated that acute administration of the OEO (50, 100, and 200 μL/kg, i.p.) produced a dose response antidepressant-like effect in the FST (unpublished data). According to results of the pilot study, the most effective dose (200 μL/kg) has been chosen for repeated administration in chronic stressed animals.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chronic unpredictable stress</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For induction of chronic stress, the Katz method was used with some modifications (
   <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>). We used this protocol because it was used as an animal model to induce anxiety. This animal model of stress consists of chronic exposure to variable unpredictable stressors, none of which is sufficient alone to induce long-lasting effects. Vary stressors were used and applied in a different sequence each week to avoid any habituation. Each animal received two stresses per day individually for a period of 24 days. After each stressor, animals were kept in a recovery room for 1 h, following which they were placed in clean cages with fresh bedding and returned to the housing facility. Control rats were individually housed for the same period of time, and were handled daily for 1 min in the housing room, but were not stressed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The animals in stress groups were exposed to the CUS protocol as follows: Day 1, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), tail pinch; day 2, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C), 1 h cage rotation; day 3, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 1 h cold room (4 °C); day 4, 12 h wet bedding, crowded cage; day 5, 24 h food deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 6, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C), crowded cage; day 7, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h cold room isolation; day 8, reversal of the light/dark cycle, tail pinch; day 9, cold room (4 °C), 1h cage rotation; day 10, 24 h water and food deprivation, 12 h cage tilting (45°C); day 11, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), 1 h restraint; day 12, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 24 h food deprivation; day 13, tail pinch, cold room (4 °C); day 14, 24 h water deprivation, 1 h restraint; day 15, 12 h wet bedding, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C); day 16, 1 h cage rotation, reversal of the light/dark cycle; day 17, 1 h restraint, crowded cage; day 18, 12 h wet bedding, tail pinch; day 19, reversal of the light/dark cycle, 12 h cage tilting (45 °C); day 20, 15 min forced swim (20 °C), 24 h water deprivation; day 21, 1 h cage rotation, crowded cage; day 22, 24 h food deprivation, tail pinch; day 23, 1 h restraint, 12 h wet bedding; day 24, 24 h water and food deprivation, crowded cage. Definitions: restraint (rats were placed in a restraining device made of plexiglass and flexible nylon, which restricting movement but allowing free respiration and air circulation), tail pinch (tail pinch involved placing the rat in the previously described restraining device, and applying a clothespin 1 cm from the base of the tail), busy cage (high-density housing was 8 rats per cage).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The method described by Porsolt, 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. was used in our study (
   <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>). Briefly, rats were forced to swim individually in a cylindrical glass container (70 cm height, 30 cm diameter), which contained tap water (25 ± 1 °C) to a depth 30 cm. The animals were individually allowed to swim for 15 min in the swim tank and after the test; rats were dried with a towel and returned to their home cages. After 24 h, same procedure was followed to conduct the test swim session for 5 min. The test sessions were recorded and scored by an observer who was blind to the groups of animals. The total duration of immobility during the first 5 min of the swimming session was recorded at 1, 10, and 25 days. The rat was judged to be immobile when it made only the necessary movements to keep its head above water level.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rats were individually housed in a cage and given two bottles of 1% w/v sucrose solution 72 h before the test. After 24 h, 1% sucrose in one bottle was replaced with tap water for next 24 h. After adaptation period, the animals were deprived from food and water for 24 h and sucrose preference was determined by 1 h exposure to two identical bottles filled with either sucrose solution or water. Sucrose preference was defined as the ratio of the volume of sucrose

The purification of RNA (A260/A280 ratio was ≥ 1.9) was determined according to OD 260/280 ratio by a spectro-photometer (Sigma, Germany). The integrity of RNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (Sigma, Germany). Total RNA was stored at -80 °C until further analysis.

A final melting curve of fluorescence
