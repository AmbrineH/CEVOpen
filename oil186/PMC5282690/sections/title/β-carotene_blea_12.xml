 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The β-Carotene bleaching test of AcEO was determined based on the standard procedure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. A volume of 1 ml of chloroform solution of β-carotene (0.1 mg/ml) was added to a round flask containing 20 mg of acid linoleic and 200 mg of Tween 40. Chloroform was completely removed at 40 °C under vacuum, and 50 ml of distilled water was slowly added and vigorously shaken. Three doses of AcEO and the reference standard Ascorbic acid (0.1; 1 and 2 mg/ml) were dissolved in methanol. Aliquots (200 μl) of AcEO and ascorbic acid were added to 5 ml of β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. A control preparation was obtained by adding 200 μl of methanol to 5 ml of β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. Absorbance of the preparations was measured at 490 nm before and after 2 h of incubation in a water bath at 50 °C. All trials were performed in triplicate. Antioxidative activity (AA %) in percentages was calculated using the following formula:
