 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No significant difference on the vasorelaxation effect of AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) on phenylephrine precontracted aorta have been observed in the presence of NO synthase inhibitor; L-NAME (97.27% ± 2.82; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), in the presence of NO scavenger; hydroxocobalamin (93.99% ± 2.32; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), and in the presence of guanylyl cyclase inhibitor; ODQ (92.26% ± 3.91; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05). However, relative inhibitory effect AcEO-induced vasorelaxation have been observed in the presence of the competitive cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor; Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (87.86% ± 4.28;
