The peaks were quantified by calculating the percentage of the peak area of each component by comparison to the sum of the peaks of other compounds. The identification of the components was performed on the basis of chromatographic comparison of the recorded retention time with computed mass-spectrum data libraries (Pal600K and Wiley275).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To confirm the involvement of voltage operated, and /or receptor operated calcium channels, and the enhancement of calcium release form internal stores in the vasodilator effect of AcEO, two sets of experiments were carried out as described by [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. First, cumulative doses of the AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) were added to aorta precontracted with both K

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were expressed as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). The results were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s as a post-test. A value of
