 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The involvement of potassium channels in the vasorelaxant effect was assessed following the experimental procedure previously detailed, with some variations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. Endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>-activated potassium channels, TEA (10
  <span class="sup">−2</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), the selective voltage-activated potassium channel (K
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">v</span>
  </sub>) blocker, 4-AP (10
  <span class="sup">−4</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), the selective inwardly-rectifying potassium channel blocker, BaCl
  <sub>2</sub> (10
  <span class="sup">−4</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), and the selective ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glybenclamide (10
  <span class="sup">−5</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with Phen (1 μM), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.
