 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wistar rats weighing 250–380 g were slightly anesthetized with ether. Abdominal aorta was catheterized and blood was collected in anti-coagulated tubes with a mixture of acid citric (130 mM)-trisodium citrate (170 mM)-glucose 4% (9:1, v/v). Washed platelets were prepared according to the experimental design reported by Gadi et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. A first centrifugation of blood (230 x g/15 min) was made and permitted to obtain a platelet rich plasma (PRP), which was centrifuged a second time (400 x g/ 15 min) to obtain the platelet pellet. The platelets were then washed once with washing buffer (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.6 mM, NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub>, 12 mM, MgCl
  <sub>2</sub> 0.9 mM, glucose 5.5 mM, gelatin 0.25%, pH 6.5), centrifuged for the last time (400 × 
  <span class="italic">g</span>/ 15 min) and suspended in the final buffer with the following composition (mM): NaCl 137, KCl 2.6, CaCl
  <sub>2</sub> 1.3, MgCl
  <sub>2</sub> 0.9, glucose 5.5, Hepes 5, gelatin 0.25%, pH 7.4) in order to have a final platelet concentration of 5 × 10

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Platelet aggregation was performed using an aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA, USA). In a special tube containing 400 μl of washed platelets at 37 °C with continual stirring at 1000 rpm, the aggregation was stimulated with aggregating agents, thrombin (0.1 U/ml) and ADP (1 μM). For test studies, platelets were preincubated with different concentrations of AcEO (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml) for 1 min in the cuvette before the stimulation by the aggregating agents cited above. In all experiments, the platelet aggregation was then recorded during 5 min. AcEO was dissolved in 0.5% DMSO. Control experiments demonstrated that the concentrations of DMSO had no significant effect on the aggregatory effect.</p>
