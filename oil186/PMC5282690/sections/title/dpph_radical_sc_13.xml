 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the EOs was evaluated as described by Senthilkumar et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>], with slight modifications. A volume of 1 ml of 0.1 mM of methanolic solution of the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) was added to 1 ml of increased doses of AcEO ranging from 0.1 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml previously dissolved in methanol. A control sample using methanol instead of AcEO was prepared. Ascorbic acid dissolved in methanol (0.1–2 mg/ml) was used as standard. The preparations were incubated for 30 min in obscurity at room temperature, then after, absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Pure methanol was used as blank. Measurements were carried out in triplicate for each experiment.
