  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> leaves against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> was determined using the microdilution technique. The in vitro proliferative activity of human fibroblast (hFB) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells treated with these extracts was evaluated using the MTT test. The hFB cell line was also evaluated using Trypan Blue assay.
