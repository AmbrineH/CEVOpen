 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before performing the MTT test, the pH and osmolality of the culture media, which was supplemented with the extracts, were evaluated with the purpose of verifying that the values were in the optimum range and to avoid cytotoxic effects by osmotic shock or pH and, in this way, assess only the effect of the extracts on the cell lines. All osmolality measurements were performed with an osmometer (Advanced Instrument Inc. model 3320) using the freezing point depression method. The pH measurements were carried out with a VWRÂ® SB90M5 pH meter.</p>
