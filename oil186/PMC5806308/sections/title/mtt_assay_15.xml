  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> leaves on CHO-K1 and hFB cell lines was assessed using the tetrazolium colorimetric MTT assay [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. The cells were seeded at a density 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> in a humidified environment for 24 h. Subsequently, 100 μL of six different concentrations of each extract was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 48 h. The final concentrations of the extracts in the wells were 0.0075%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.125% and 0.25% for essential oil; 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%,8% for aqueous extract and 0.0075%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.125% and 0.25% for ethanolic extract. After that, 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in RPMI-1640 without phenol red, Sigma Aldrich®) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following the incubation period, 100 μL of MTT solvent (0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol) was added to the wells to solubilize the formazan crystals. Multiskan FC (®Thermo Scientific) microplate reader at 570 nm was used for the measurement of the absorbance. The measurement of the color control of all concentrations of each extract was carried out to ensure that no interference occurred in the measurement of each well. The percentage of relative cell proliferation was calculated based on a comparison with untreated cells (control) as [extract absorbance/control absorbance] × 100. Microscopic viewing of the cell cultures was performed before and after the assay using an inverted microscope Axio Vert 200 (Carl Zeiss) coupled to a video camera.
