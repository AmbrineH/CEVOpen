  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> was more susceptible to the ethanolic extract and the aqueous extract (MIC value of 5 μL/mL and 80 μL/mL respectively). In the case of 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, the MIC of the aqueous and ethanolic extract was 125 μL/mL.

In CHO-K1 cells an antiproliferative effect was observed at a concentration of 8% of aqueous extract and from 0.06% to 0.25% of ethanolic extract using the MTT method.
