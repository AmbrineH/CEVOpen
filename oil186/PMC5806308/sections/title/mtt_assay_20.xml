 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the extracts on cell lines was determined through the calculation of the relative cell proliferation percentage in the MTT assay. The extract concentrations tested were chosen according to the results of the osmolality assay, where the optimum range for testing for cell proliferation is from 230 to 400 mOsm/kg. The parameter of the pH was also verified, and the optimum range, in this case, is from 6.60 to 7.80 [

At concentrations of 4% and 8%, the human fibroblast cell line displayed relative cell proliferation percentage values of 73.56% and 46.93% respectively. The same effect was observed on the CHO-K1 cell line but at a concentration of 8% with a relative cell proliferation percentage value of 50.82%. A slight proliferative effect was observed on the CHO-K1 cell line at concentrations of 0.25% and 0.50%.
