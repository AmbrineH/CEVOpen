  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The kiwifruit infected by anthracnose appeared on round spots from brown to dark brown launched from center, whose surface was depression, dried-up, and severe dehydration, while the tissue obviously turned into soft (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1A</a>
   </span>). The pathogenic sarcocarp turned from green into pale yellow. Subsequently, the whole fruit was rotten (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a>
   </span>). The colony of pathogen was circular on PDA after 7-day incubation, and its texture was soft and villous, as well as the color was pink (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1C</a>
   </span>). The aerial mycelia grew radially from the center to the surrounding area. Mycelia were hyaline and septate (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1D</a>
   </span>). The ellipsoidal spores produced the pale pink spore heaps, while the spore was single, colorless, and hyaline, diameter of 13.1–18.6 × 3.0–4.0 μm (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1E</a>
   </span>). The germinal spore was spheroidal and the diameter of the germinal spore was 11.0–15.0 × 2.0–3.0 μm (
   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1F</a>
   </span>). Thus it could be considered as 
   <span class="italic">Colletotrichum</span> sp. It was verified that the isolated pathogen could cause the kiwifruit anthracnose through pathogenicity test. The colonial morphology and some microscopic features of the isolated pathogen were accordance with previous observations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further identify the isolated pathogen, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of isolate was sequenced. The PCR product was 531 bp. The obtained sequence was submitted to GenBank, and the accession number was MF

   <span class="italic">Glomerellaceae</span> sp., 
   <span class="italic">Purpureocillium lilacinum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Hypocreomycetidae</span> sp. formed a clade with 100% bootstrap support. In this clade, the reference taxon,

   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> (AJ 749677.1) also clustered together with it, meanwhile they were same species. The result of similarity comparisons of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region sequence revealed that isolated pathogen had the highest nucleotide similarities with

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission electron microscopy could intuitively reflect the morphological alterations of the cell wall (CW), cell membrane (CM) and cytoplasm. The growth inhibition of

   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>

   <span class="bold">Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D</a>–
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">F</a>
   </span>). At the first 4 days, proteins and sugar leaked markedly in treatment, and the leakage increased slowly after 4 days (
   <span class="bold">Figures 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D,E</a>
   </span>). However, the leakage of protein and sugar stayed at a very low level for control (
   <span class="bold">Figures 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D,E</a>
   </span>). Hence, the leakages of treatment groups were significantly higher than that of control. At the first 4 days, the absorbance value for nucleic acid (OD 260 nm) of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> increased significantly (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) from 0.018 to 0.048 (control), and from 0.013 to 1.269 (CEO treatment group), respectively (

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4F</a>
   </span>). After 4 days, the value of OD 260 nm was followed by a steady state, which clearly indicated that the CM integrity of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> had been compromised after exposure to CEO, which could consequently lead to cell death.
