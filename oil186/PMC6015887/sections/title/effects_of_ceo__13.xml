  </span> showed the effects of different concentrations of CEO on the ergosterol content of the PM in 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> compared with the control. Results indicated that the total ergosterol content was reduced with the increasing of CEO concentrations. The production of ergosterol decreased at the CEO concentrations of 0, 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150, and 0.175 μL/mL, presenting a value of 0.5885, 0.4954, 0.3750, 0.2514, 0.1412, and 0.0863%, respectively. The cells treated with CEO showed inhibition rate of 15.81, 36.28, 57.28, 76.01, and 85.34% to ergosterol compared with the control, respectively. Further, the exposure of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> to different concentrations of CEO caused various levels of extracellular conductivity. The extracellular conductivity in 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> suspension was increased with exposure time and the concentrations of CEO (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4C</a>
  </span>). All CEO treated 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> showed higher electric conductivity than the control. Moreover, the electric conductivity increased rapidly in respond to increasing levels of CEO during the first 4 days (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4C</a>
  </span>). After that, the growth tended to slow down. After 4 days, the extracellular conductivity of suspensions with CEO (512 μS/cm and 526 μS/cm) remained at the same level, but the values CEO treated cells were significantly higher (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) than the control (211 μS/cm and 223 μS/cm) (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4C</a>
  </span>). Additionally, the leakage of protein, sugar, and nucleic acid could be considered as important indicators of CM damage. 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> cells were treated with the MFC of CEO, and the amounts of released protein, sugar, and nucleic acid were investigated. The results showed that 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> cells treated with CEO accumulated more protein, sugar, and nucleic acid than the untreated group (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D</a>–
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">F</a>
  </span>). In this study, protein, sugar, and nucleic acid leakages can be detected in time-dependent tests. In time-dependent killing, protein, sugar and nucleic acid leakages were initially sluggish, and the leakages increased with treatment duration (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D</a>–
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">F</a>
  </span>). At the first 4 days, proteins and sugar leaked markedly in treatment, and the leakage increased slowly after 4 days (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D,E</a>
  </span>). However, the leakage of protein and sugar stayed at a very low level for control (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4D,E</a>
  </span>). Hence, the leakages of treatment groups were significantly higher than that of control. At the first 4 days, the absorbance value for nucleic acid (OD 260 nm) of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> increased significantly (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) from 0.018 to 0.048 (control), and from 0.013 to 1.269 (CEO treatment group), respectively (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4F</a>
  </span>). After 4 days, the value of OD 260 nm was followed by a steady state, which clearly indicated that the CM integrity of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> had been compromised after exposure to CEO, which could consequently lead to cell death.
