 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The kiwifruit infected by anthracnose appeared on round spots from brown to dark brown launched from center, whose surface was depression, dried-up, and severe dehydration, while the tissue obviously turned into soft (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1A</a>
  </span>). The pathogenic sarcocarp turned from green into pale yellow. Subsequently, the whole fruit was rotten (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a>
  </span>). The colony of pathogen was circular on PDA after 7-day incubation, and its texture was soft and villous, as well as the color was pink (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1C</a>
  </span>). The aerial mycelia grew radially from the center to the surrounding area. Mycelia were hyaline and septate (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1D</a>
  </span>). The ellipsoidal spores produced the pale pink spore heaps, while the spore was single, colorless, and hyaline, diameter of 13.1–18.6 × 3.0–4.0 μm (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1E</a>
  </span>). The germinal spore was spheroidal and the diameter of the germinal spore was 11.0–15.0 × 2.0–3.0 μm (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1F</a>
  </span>). Thus it could be considered as 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum</span> sp. It was verified that the isolated pathogen could cause the kiwifruit anthracnose through pathogenicity test. The colonial morphology and some microscopic features of the isolated pathogen were accordance with previous observations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further identify the isolated pathogen, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of isolate was sequenced. The PCR product was 531 bp. The obtained sequence was submitted to GenBank, and the accession number was MF 
  <span ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="124796" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">124796</span>. The ITS sequence was preliminarily analyzed and submitted to GenBank as closest to those of 
  <span class="italic">Colletotrichum</span> sp. For the identification purposes, the sequence was compared to those available in the NCBI database using the BLAST. Furthermore, the homology sequences were analyzed with MEGA 5.02 software to construct phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining method (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1G</a>
  </span>). Confidence values above 50% obtained from a 1,000-replicate bootstrap analysis were shown at the branch nodes. Bootstrap values from neighbor-joining method were determined. 
  <span class="italic">Goidanichiella sphaerospora</span> (FR 681846.2) and 
  <span class="italic">Ascomycota</span> sp. (AF 508280.1) were used as the out group. The isolated pathogen had higher similar sequences of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> than any other reference taxa. In the neighbor-joining tree, the anthrax pathogen and other three reference taxa including 
  <span class="italic">Glomerellaceae</span> sp., 
  <span class="italic">Purpureocillium lilacinum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hypocreomycetidae</span> sp. formed a clade with 100% bootstrap support. In this clade, the reference taxon, 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> (AB 042300.1) and 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> (AJ 749677.1) also clustered together with it, meanwhile they were same species. The result of similarity comparisons of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region sequence revealed that isolated pathogen had the highest nucleotide similarities with 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>.
