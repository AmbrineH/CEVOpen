 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anisakiasis is a fish-borne parasitic disease; it is caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, as well as cephalopods, contaminated by third instar larvae of species belonging to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Anisakis</span> (Anisakidae), with special reference to 
  <span class="italic">Anisakis simplex</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anisakis pegreffii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudoterranova decipiens</span> (Grabda 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1976</a>; Mattiucci and Nascetti 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2006</a>; Audicana and Kennedy 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2008</a>; Pravettoni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2012</a>)
  <span class="italic">.</span> After ingestion, the larvae penetrate the gastric and intestinal mucosa, causing the symptoms of anisakiasis (Broglia and Kapel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2011</a>). Recently, it has been estimated that about 20,000 cases of anisakiasis are reported per year worldwide. The large majority of the cases is from Japan (&gt; 90%), due to the traditional use of 
  <span class="italic">sashimi</span> as food. Other countries characterized by a rather large number of anisakiasis cases are Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Scandinavia (Bao et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2017</a>).

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Live larvae of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> can cause a parasitic infection of the digestive tract. In addition, they can also affect other organs causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites and perforations until granulomas and masses, if the larvae are not promptly removed. Furthermore, the presence of larvae of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> can lead to allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema (Asturias et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2000</a>; Nieuwenhuizen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2003</a>; Berger and Marr 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2006</a>; Choi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2009</a>; Pravettoni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2012</a>). Notably, the larvae of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> can induce an immune adaptive response characterized by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (which are responsible for allergic symptoms), IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis (Park et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2009</a>; Pravettoni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nowadays, the endoscopic removal of live larvae still represents the main effective treatment against anisakiasis (Sugita et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2008</a>; Pravettoni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2012</a>). Furthermore, protection against anisakiasis can be enhanced educating consumers about the risks linked with eating raw or undercooked seafood. From a pharmacological point of view, antibiotics, anticholinergics and/or corticosteroids have been employed for the treatment of anisakiasis, showing patchy and limited efficacy (Matsui et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1985</a>). However, a relevant exception is represented by albendazole (Dziekońska-Rynko et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2002</a>; Romero et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2014</a>), since it has been recently showed that this compound dose-dependently reduced (500 μg/ml led to 100% 48 h post-treatment) the survival of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> third instar larvae (Arias-Diaz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2006</a>). However, it has been noted that acidic medium pH reduced its efficacy (Arias-Diaz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2006</a>). In this scenario, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective tools and drugs for the treatment of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> parasitic infections (Molina-Garcia and Sanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2002</a>; Brutti et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2010</a>), including the use of natural products (Hierro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2004</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2006</a>; Lin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2010</a>; Gómez-Rincón et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2014</a>; Valero et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils, which are complex mixtures of volatile components such as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids (Pavela and Benelli 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2016</a>), can represent a new strategy to combat several parasites including L3 larvae of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> (Giarratana et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2014</a>; Hierro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2004</a>; Romero et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2012</a>). In this regard, 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> essential oils have been shown to possess in vivo efficacy against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Anisakis</span> (Pérez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>; Abattouy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2010</a>). On this basis, we focused our attention on the essential oil obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Origanum compactum</span> Benth., belonging to the Lamiaceae family.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> is a small herbaceous aromatic plant endemic to Spain and Morocco (Emberger and Maire 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">1941</a>) where it is particularly appreciated in cuisine to enhance the flavour of foods and as natural food preservative (Ghanmi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2015</a>; Sbayou et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2014</a>). 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> enjoys a long-standing use in the traditional medicine as well as a good reputation and economic importance in the trade of medicinal and aromatic plants (Briguiche and Zidane 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2016</a>; Bouiamrine et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2017</a>). In Morocco, the plant, locally known as 
  <span class="italic">Zaetar</span>, is used under infusion to treat heart and intestinal pains or as preservative for foodstuffs (El-Hilaly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2003</a>). It is also a famous remedy for the treatment of wounds, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases, digestive and respiratory problems and gastrointestinal and gingival cancers (Ziyyat et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">1997</a>; Jouad et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2001</a>; Kabbaj et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>; Eddouks et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2002</a>; Bouhdid et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>; Jamila and Mostafa 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> has also been used as vermifuge, aphrodisiac, antispasmodic, antiulcer, laxative and antidiarrheal agent (Hmamouchi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2000</a>; Jamila and Mostafa 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the search of scalable products to use as treatments of anisakiasis, we here evaluated the activity of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil as well as its major constituents carvacrol and thymol on 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> L3 larvae. The pharmacological mechanism was studied through the inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the nematode neuromuscular function.
