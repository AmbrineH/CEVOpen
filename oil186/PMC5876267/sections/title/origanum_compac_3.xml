A HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × ID 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness, J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) using helium gas flow (1.0 ml/min) was used for separation. The GC temperature program was as follows: initial 50 °C for 5 min, then increasing with 20 °C/min to 300 °C. The injector temperature was 150 °C. Quali-quantitative analysis of the essential oil was performed according to the work of Benelli et al. (
