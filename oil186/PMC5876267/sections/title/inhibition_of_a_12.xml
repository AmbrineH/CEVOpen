  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil, carvacrol and thymol acted as AChE inhibitors, indicating that this could be one of the mechanisms involved in the larvicidal activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The activity profile of carvacrol on the enzyme was very similar to that of the essential oil. However, higher doses of thymol were needed to inhibit the AChE enzyme at the same level. The AChE inhibitory potential decreased in the following order: carvacrol &gt; 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> &gt; thymol. Galantamine at 0.1 mg/ml induced 100% of AChE inhibition.
