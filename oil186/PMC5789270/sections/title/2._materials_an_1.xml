 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOs of thyme (
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span>) and savory (
  <span class="italic">Satureja montana</span>) used in the assays were prepared by Soave (Turin, Italy). The compositional analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a mass spectrometer GCMS-QP 2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) and a split-splitless injector. The gas chromatograph was fitted with a 30 m × 0.25 mm fused silica capillary Zebron ZB-5MSi column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with 0.25 μm film thickness. Helium carrier gas using a linear velocity of 37 cm/s with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was used. The pressure was 55 kPa and total flow was 105 mL/min. Ion electron impact spectra at 70 eV were recorded in scan mode (30–700 m/z).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For savory essential oil, the oven program started with an initial temperature of 50 °C for 3 min, heating at 5 °C/min to 70 °C, 70 °C for 5 min, heating at 1 °C/min to 90 °C, heating at 5 °C/min to 150 °C, and finally heating at 40 °C/min to 270 °C, held for 5 min. For thyme essential oil, the same protocol was used without the isothermal phase at 70 °C for 5 min. For both essential oils, the injection temperature was set at 250 °C and the ion source and the interface were both set at 280 °C.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pure essential oil of savory and thyme were diluted at 1% and 10% in 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) for direct injection using split mode (80%). Sampling in the chambers was performed using SPME fiber assembly 100 μm PDMS (Supelco Analytical, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 5 min in triplicate at 1, 14 and 28 days of incubation whereby the injector was in splitless mode. Relative composition (percentage) of volatile compounds was calculated by comparing peak area to area of total chromatogram (from 7.5 to 40 min). Absolute quantification was calculated for carvacrol and thymolusing a standard calibration curve between 1 and 50 ppm (mg/L). Relative quantification was determined for the other compounds, by using standard calibration curve of thymol for thyme essential oil and standard calibration curve of carvacrol for savory essential oil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peaches (‘Vista Rich’) and nectarines (‘Sweet Red’) were harvested from two different orchards located in Lagnasco (Cuneo, Italy, 44°37′33″60 N, 07°33′21″24 E) at the firm-ripe stage and transported immediately to the laboratory of DISAFA, University of Torino, during the summer of 2015. All fruit were sorted by size. Defect-free fruit were randomly divided into five lots of 350 fruit each. Each lot was treated in a different way and further divided into 5 replicates of 70 fruit. Each replicate was a box kept in a container at the same temperature, but different atmosphere according to the treatment. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EO diffusors were made by adding EO (10% 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>), sterilized deionized water (88% 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) and Tween 20 (2% 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to agar-agar (Merck) (15 g/L). Lower EO concentrations were obtained by serial dilutions. 50 mL of medium were poured into Petri dishes and after agar solidification, 5 diffusors were installed in storage cabinets under the fruit boxes. Fruit were stored in refrigerator cabinets (75 × 70 × 65 cm) at 0 °C and 98% relative humidity for 28 days. Fumigation was performed at 1% and 10% EO concentrations. A total of four treatments were tested: thyme EO at 1%, thyme EO at 10%, savory EO at 1% and savory EO at 10%. An untreated control was included. The analyses were performed at 1, 14 and 28 days of cold storage. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After harvesting, healthy sound fruit were selected. Rotten fruit were counted and incidence of diseased fruit was calculated for each treatment every 7 days up to 28 days of storage, and for 5 days of shelf life at 20 °C. Pathogens were isolated by transferring small pieces of symptomatic fruit tissues, previously washed in 1% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed in sterile deionized water, onto potato dextrose agar (PDA, Merck) plates amended with 25 mg/L streptomycin sulfate (Merck). A 7-day-old culture was used for DNA extraction by using the EZNA Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of 50 isolates was amplified using the ITS1/ITS4 primers [
  <a rid="B28-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-foods-07-00007">28</a>]. The PCR reaction mixture comprised 2 µL 10 × PCR buffer, 1 µL ITS1 primer at 10 mM, 1 µL of ITS4 primer at 10 mM, 1 µL of nucleotides mixture at 5 mM, 12 µL of MilliQ autoclaved water, 0.8 µL of MgCl
  <sub>2</sub> at 25 mM, 0.2 µL of Taq polymerase and 2 µL of template DNA. PCR cycles included a denaturing step at 95 °C for 2 min and 35 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. ITS amplicons were sequenced by BMR Genomics (Padua, Italy), and DNA sequences were compared with those present in the NCBI database and deposited with accession numbers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of essential oils on conidial germination was investigated on two main peach and nectarine pathogens, 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span>. Two virulent strains isolated from peaches were stored on agar slant at 4 °C until use. 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> conidial suspension was obtained from 15 days of culture grown on PDA+ streptomycin 25 mg/L at 25 °C. 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> was cultured on tomato agar plate (250 mL of tomato puree, 750 mL of deionized water and 20 g of agar) amended with 25 mg of streptomycin for 5 days. 5 mL of sterile deionized water were added to the plate and the mycelium was gently scraped with L-shaped spreader to detach the conidia. Conidial suspension was filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth and 100 µL were spread on PDA+ streptomycin plates. PDA plates were sealed with the essential oil diffusor. EOs were added to the diffusors at 350 µL/L and 35 µL/L, a concentration proportional to the quantity present in the cabinet considering the concentration of EO diffusor, the number of diffusors per cabinet and the volume of the cabinet and the plates. Conidial germination was assessed after 20 h for 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> and 36 h for 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> counting 100 conidia per plate. Three replicates were used for each treatment and the assay was repeated twice. Conidia were considered germinated when the germ tube exceeded the conidial length.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weight loss was determined by weighing 30 fruit per treatment at the beginning of the trial (zero time) and during storage (7, 14, 21 and 28 days of storage, and at 5 days for shelf life). Values are reported as shown in Equation (1).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The color parameters were measured weekly during cold storage, with a Minolta chromameter (CR400, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan), calibrated with a standard white plate, using the CIE L*C*h (lightness, chroma/saturation and hue angle) scale. The surface of 30 fruit (ground and over color) was evaluated per treatment.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The carotenoid content was determined every 14 days, using the method reported by Talcott and Howard [
  <a rid="B29-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-foods-07-00007">29</a>]. The carotenoids were extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (ethanol/acetone 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span> with 0.2% butylhydroxytoluene) and 2 g of fresh sample from 10 fruit, homogenized at 24,000 rpm for 1 min using an Ultra-Turrax T-25 Tissue homogenizer (IKA
  <span class="sup">®</span>-Labortechnik, Saufen, Germany). The samples were then centrifuged at 2900 rpm for 20 min at 2 °C (Avanti J-25 centrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The recovered supernatants were combined with 30 mL of extraction solvent, 25 mL of hexane and 12.5 mL of nanopure water. The tubes were left in the dark at 4 °C for 1 h, then the samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes. Absorbance was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (DU 530, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at 450 nm, with β-carotene as an external standard. The results are expressed as μg β-carotene equivalents per kg weight of fruit and are an average of three replicates per treatment and per time point (at 0, 14 and 28 days of storage).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ascorbic acid (AA) was determined according to Sánchez-Moreno et al. [
  <a rid="B30-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00007">30</a>] and González-Molina et al. [
  <a rid="B31-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00007">31</a>], and evaluated at 0, 14 and 28 days (three replicates per treatment and per time point). The ascorbic acid was extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (methanol:water 5:95 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) and 10 g of fruit flesh from 10 fruit per treatment by homogenization with a T-25 Ultra-Turrax for 3 min. Then, pH was adjusted to 2.2–2.4, and the extract was adsorbed onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA, USA). The resultant solution was added to 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Fluka Chemika, Neu-Ulm, Switzerland) and left to stand for 37 min before HPLC analysis. The AA and dehydroascorbic acid contents were expressed as mg/kg fresh weight. Three replicate analyses were performed on the flesh. The chromatographic system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was equipped a Kinetex-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), a pump and a diode array detector. The system was controlled through HPLC online software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) at 40 °C. The mobile phase (isocratic) comprised 50 mM monobasic potassium phosphate and 5 mM cetrimide (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Saint Louis, MO, USA) in methanol:water (5:95 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>). The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min. The detector was set at 261 nm for AA and 348 for dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). External calibration curves for AA and DHAA, respectively, were used for quantification. The total run time was 15 min. The detection limit is 0.5 mg/kg of fresh weight.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the data using Statistica v. 6.0 (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Least significant differences (LSD) at a significance level of 0.05 were used to compare treatment means with Tukey’s test. Mean values for each time point were considered significantly different at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> ≤ 0.05.
