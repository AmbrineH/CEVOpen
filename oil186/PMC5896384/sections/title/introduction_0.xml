 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Vegetable oils are an important part of our daily diet. Many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cholestasis, obesity and other related diseases, are caused by an unbalanced diet particularly in regard to vegetable oils.

  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The nutritional quality and the potential of oils to prevent diseases can be evaluated by five factors: atherogenic index (AI), thrombogenic index (TI), hypocholesterolemic: hypercholesterolemic ratio (HH), polyunsaturated fatty acids: saturated fatty acids (PUFA:SFA) and the ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratio, which are calculated from the fatty acids in the oils. AI, TI and H:H are used as predictor factors for cardiovascular disease.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> PUFA are essential fatty acids and they can be divided into two groups; omega 3 and omega 6. Based on their structures, each group has important roles in the improvement of the immune system, prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span> Commonly consumed oils, such as sunflower, corn, grape seed and rice bran oils, have high levels of ω
  <sub>6</sub> fatty acids and, thus, lead to increases in the ratio of ω
  <sub>6</sub> compared to ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids. The optimal ratio and balance of these fatty acids has an important effect on their functional properties.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span> Unfortunately, there is no pure fat or oil that has a balanced amount of essential fatty acids, good oxidative stability and optimum nutritional characteristics. For example, linseed oil is rich in ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids, which are easily oxidized, while sesame and olive oils are very stable to oxidation but contain low levels of ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Olive oil is one of the most stable oils under heat treatments and deep frying conditions. This characteristic comes from its suitable fatty acid and triacylglycerol composition, phenolic compounds and phytosterols contents.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>,
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Sesame oil, due to its high level of tocopherols, sesamolin and sesamin lignans, has good oxidation stability and also health promoting effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects and anti-proliferative activity on cancer cells.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>
  </span> Moreover, sesame oil has high amount of ω
  <sub>6</sub> fatty acids.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>
  </span>Sesame and olive oils, despite all their healthy and nutritious effects, are low in ω
  <sub>3</sub> essential fatty acids. Therefore, blending these oils with linseed oil is a good outcome to improve their functional characteristics and increase their applications in the food industry.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Blending vegetable oils with different properties is a simple procedure to create new products with the desired physical, nutritional and oxidative properties and at an affordable price.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Rheological measurements can give useful information about the appearance, properties, consistency and sometimes food product quality.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>
  </span> Viscosity means the resistance of fluids moving from one place to another. Thus, fluids with high viscosity need more force to move.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>
  </span> The rheological properties of vegetable oils have new applications in the food industry and play important roles in the determination of their properties particularly when they are used in food formulation and processing.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Linseed oil, because of its high content of ω
  <sub>3</sub> essential fatty acids and nutritional properties, has received more attention in food formulation. However, linseed oil is very unstable oil and cannot be used alone in food preparations. In this research, linseed oil was blended with olive and sesame oils to obtain a functional oil with high bioactive compounds, optimal essential fatty acids and suitable stability during storage. The present research covers the evaluation of the chemical, nutritional and rheological properties of olive, sesame and linseed oils blends at different ratios and temperatures.
