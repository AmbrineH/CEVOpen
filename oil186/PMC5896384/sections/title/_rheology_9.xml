 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> An Anton Paar rheometer (Physica MCR 301, Anton Paar, GmbH, Graz, Austria) was used for the viscosity measurements. The measurements were performed at a shear rate of 1 to 100 s−1 at two temperatures, 4 ± 0.01°C and 25 ± 0.01°C. The Rheoplus Software (version 4.00, Physica MCR series, Anton Parr) was used as the device driver.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Equation 4: The calculation of viscosity and regression coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) was carried out using Newton’s law equation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The shear stress to shear rate data was fitted in Newton’s model using linear regression:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Equation 4 = τηγ</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Where τ is the shear stress (mPa), γ is the shear rate (s-1) and η is the dynamic viscosity (mPa.s).</p>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> All measurements were carried out in triplicate. The data obtained were analyzed by ANOVA and 16.0 SPSS as statistical software (Chicago, IL, USA) in factorial experiments with an completely randomized design. The results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the three measurements. Duncan’s multiple range post hoc test was used to analyze significant differences at the 0.05 level.</p>
