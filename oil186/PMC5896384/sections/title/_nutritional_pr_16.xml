 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The nutritional quality of linseed, sesame and olive oil blends were evaluated by nutritional indexes such as AI, TI, HH, PUFA: SFA and the ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratio
  <sub>.</sub> These indexes all evaluate the nutritional quality of foods based on their fatty acid compositions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> AI and TI can be used as predictors or risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Thus, these indexes should be kept at low levels in a healthy daily diet. AI and TI were lower than one in all three treatments due to their high PUFA content. These results were in agreement with Guimaraes et al. for levels of AI and TI for sesame and linseed oil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The HH index indicated the fatty acids effects on cholesterol metabolism and high level of this index is important from a nutritional point of view. The HH value in the treatments containing 5, 10 and 15% linseed oil were 6.88, 7.2 and 8.03, respectively‏.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Low level of PUFA: SFA ratio in diets (below 0.45) is a risk factor for increased blood cholesterol levels.

   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">27</a>
  </span> In the present study, PUFA: SFA ratio in linseed oil was very high (7.42) and increasing its content in mixtures lead to significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in this ratio for the formulated samples. PUFA: SFA ratios in 5, 10 and 15% linseed oil were 1.62, 1.8 and 2.41, respectively. Thus, these results indicated that these blended oils have suitable and balanced fatty acid compositions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Because of essential fatty acid and bioactive compounds importance in health, food products are enriched and fortified with oils and oilseeds with high essential fatty acids and bioactive compounds content.

   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>
  </span> Essential fatty acids and their balanced ratio have important health effects, therefore, should be considered in our daily diet. The optimal ratio of ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids for the cure or prevention of diseases was defined as 1:1 to 4:1.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span> This ratio in linseed, sesame and olive oils were 0.22, 9.5 and 50.1, respectively. Therefore, these oils in the pure form do not have optimal ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The addition of linseed oil due to its high levels of linolenic acid lead to an effective improvement in the ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratio of the pure oils (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). The levels of the ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratio in 65:30:10 and 60:30:15 were balanced and in agreement with the literature (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>).

   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Overall, all the five nutritional indexes for quality evaluation indicated that these formulated oils have good nutritional profiles and could have positive health effects for consumers.</p>
