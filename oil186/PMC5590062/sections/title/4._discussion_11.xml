 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> specimens showed some variations in the essential oil compositions, as presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00026-t001" href="#medicines-04-00026-t001">Table 1</a>. The Jureia-Itatins oil (
  <span class="bold">1</span>) was composed mostly of fatty acids (65.3%), having palmitic acid (46.5%) and myristic acid (11.6%) as major compounds, while in the Ilha do Cardoso oil (
  <span class="bold">2</span>), the main compounds were the phenylpropanoids eugenol (19.7%) and eugenol acetate (12.9%). In the second oil, fatty acids were only responsible for 18.1% of the oil composition, containing mainly palmitic acid (15.1%). The only 
  <span class="italic">Avicennia</span> species that has had its essential oil contents previously analyzed was 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span>, and in this oil the main compounds were 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) (41.09%) and 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (24.56%) [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00026">12</a>], while the fruit oils consisted mostly of methyl palmitate (41.9%) [
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00026">13</a>]. An interesting remark about these previous studies is the considerable amounts of synthetic compounds reported for both oils, such as BHT (41.9%), methyl 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-vinylbenzoate (9.68%), and diethyl phthalate (1.2%) [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00026">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00026">13</a>]. Some synthetic compounds were also found in both 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> oils, such as 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (2.4%–3.1%) and diisobutyl phthalate (0.7%), but not to the same extent as was reported for 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span>. The presence of these substances in the essential oils might be related to the constant exposure of mangrove plants to sea and river pollutants. It is not usual to detect these amounts of synthetic compounds in essential oils from inland plants, even when collected close to big cities as São Paulo. For example, the essential oil 
  <span class="italic">from Chromolaena laevigata</span> (Lam.) R.M.King &amp; H.Rob, collected at the São Paulo Botanical Gardens, consisted only of natural compounds [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00026">18</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variability observed for the essential oil contents between the two 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> populations analyzed in this study might indicate the presence of distinct chemotypes for this species. Similar results were obtained with the extracts from 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> leaves collected at two different Indian coasts, along the Arabic Sea and the Bay of Bengal, that were analyzed by GC-MS, showing a different chemical composition for these two populations [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00026">11</a>,
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00026">19</a>]. The major constituents characterized in the Arabic Sea 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> were the aromatic compounds 4-hydroxyphenylethanol and 3-methylbenzaldehyde (approximately 60%) [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00026">11</a>], and the major compounds characterized in the Bay of Bengal 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> were terpenes and fatty acids, such as phytol (13.3%), palmitic acid (10.70%), 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-α-ionol (8.6%) and palmitic acid ethyl ester (6.2%) [
  <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00026">19</a>]. Similar to the 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> oils, the 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> extract differences could also be explained by the occurrence of chemotypes or by environmental factors that can also have an influence on chemical composition, such as the soil composition, temperature, relative humidity, sun exposure, wind regime and exposure to pathogens [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00026">20</a>]. A more detailed study that involves other 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> populations is necessary in order to assess whether these differences are caused by environmental factors or by populational variations (chemotypes).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> essential oils presented some radical scavenging activity with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 0.90 mg/mL for oil 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 1.13 mg/mL for oil 
  <span class="bold">2</span>, while quercetin, used as a positive control, showed an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 10.47 ± 0.91 μg/mL. These results indicated that the essential oils were weaker antioxidants, when compared with quercetin. Oil 
  <span class="bold">1</span> contained mainly fatty acids, palmitic and myristic acid, which are an important source of reserve energy and are components of the cell membrane in all living organisms. Additionally, in plants, fatty acid metabolic pathways also play significant roles in pathogen defense [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00026">21</a>]. Saturated fatty acids can act as antioxidants or prooxidants [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00026">22</a>]. The antioxidant activity of fatty extracts from 10 
  <span class="italic">Cephalaria</span> species, containing myristic and palmitic acids, showed IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.77 to 15.12 mg/mL by the DPPH method [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00026">23</a>]. The radical scavenging activity of 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> oils was higher than that found in 
  <span class="italic">Cephalaria</span> species. Although oil 
  <span class="bold">2</span> contained, as one of the major compounds, eugenol, a phenolic compound, the total oil activity was lower than that obtained for oil 
  <span class="bold">1</span>. Pure eugenol showed a stronger antioxidant capacity than the positive control α-tocopherol (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 33.85 μg/mL), and presented an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 16.06 μg/mL, using the same DPPH scavenging assay [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00026">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a large pool of publications describing the antioxidant activity of essential oils with active concentrations ranging from mg/mL to μg/mL. The antioxidant capability of 423 essential oils from 48 families by the DPPH assay was evaluated, and less than 5% of the tested oils showed antioxidant activity lower than 300 μg/mL [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00026">25</a>]. The antioxidant capacity of essential oils is not very high compared with extracts and fractions rich in phenolic compounds. For example, the antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">Avicennia</span> species is reported for extracts and fractions, and the results were higher than those obtained for the 
  <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> essential oils. The extracts from 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> pneumatophores showed high antioxidant activity with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 21.22 μg/mL [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00026">26</a>]. Furthermore, aqueous and ethanol extracts from 
  <span class="italic">A. marina</span> barks, also rich in phenolic compounds, exhibited an important antioxidant activity with respective IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 112.7 μg/mL and 95.18 μg/mL [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00026">27</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial assay showed that both essential oils were not able to completely inhibit the growth in concentrations up to 217 μg/mL for all tested microorganisms. The highest activity was achieved against 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> with 66.8 and 74.5 for oils 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2</span>, respectively. This result can be interesting because, firstly, Gram-negative organisms possess an outer cell membrane impeding the diffusion of the hydrophobic essential oil constituents into the cell. Secondly, this is interesting to note because 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> can also become resistant to certain antibiotics due to its ability to form biofilm, which consists of bacterial communities embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00026">28</a>,
  <a rid="B29-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-medicines-04-00026">29</a>], making this organism a major cause of serious infection in hospitals. Higher concentrations could not be tested due the low amount of oil available. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Normally, in screening studies with plant extracts and fractions, only MIC values lower than 100 μg/mL are considered active [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00026">28</a>]. In general, most plant extracts present weak antimicrobial activity, with MIC values ranging in the mg/mL scale for crude extracts against various pathogens [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00026">28</a>]. More specifically, in the case of essential oils, MIC values can range from 36,300 μg/mL to 0.001 μg/mL, and most of the activity is found in oxygenated terpenoids, but some hydrocarbons also might also exhibit some antimicrobial effects [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00026">28</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil 
  <span class="bold">1</span>, containing mainly palmitic and myristic acids, and oil 
  <span class="bold">2</span>, containing mostly eugenol, eugenol acetate and palmitic acid, showed an antimicrobial effect within the range already described for other oils. Furthermore, some fatty acids have already been studied for antimicrobial activity, but their MIC values were not as low as expected for high activity compounds [
  <a rid="B30-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-medicines-04-00026">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-medicines-04-00026">31</a>]. The MIC values of myristic and palmitic acids were respectively 1600 μg/mL and &gt;1600 μg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> [
  <a rid="B30-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-medicines-04-00026">30</a>]. Palmitic acid was also evaluated against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> with an MIC of 312.50 μg/mL [
  <a rid="B32-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-medicines-04-00026">32</a>], and with MIC values &gt;256.42 μg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. pyogenes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> [
  <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00026">33</a>]. As can be seen in these references, the antimicrobial activity of myristic and palmitic acids always showed MIC values higher than 100 μg/mL. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eugenol has also been known for its antimicrobial properties. The antimicrobial activity of eugenol against 
  <span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pityrosporum ovale</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> MRSA, and 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> showed MIC values of 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 800 μg/mL, 800 μg/mL, 1600 μg/mL, and 1600 μg/mL, respectively [
  <a rid="B34-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-medicines-04-00026">34</a>], and only for the two first microorganisms was this compound more active. The lower activity detected for the oil rich in eugenol (
  <span class="bold">2</span>) can be caused by interactions between the oil components leading to antagonist, additive or synergistic effects [
  <a rid="B35-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-medicines-04-00026">35</a>].
