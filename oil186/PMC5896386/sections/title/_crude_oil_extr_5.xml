 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared using 2 mol/l NaOH in methanol and n-heptane. The oil samples were analyzed for chemical components using GC equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, model 6890 N, Agilent Technologies, USA) and DB-Wax capillary column having 30 meter length (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness). It was also fitted to a injector with Agilent tapered liner (4mm id). A fixed quantity of oil (1 μl) was injected into the column after dilution. Oven temperature ranged between 100-230 °C. The temperature of the FID injection system was 250 °C and that of FID detector was 280 °C. Nitrogen carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1.8 ml/min. The identification of individual component was made by running standards (Sigma, Chemical Co.St. Louis). The area under individual peak being calibrated into percent area by integrator itself, gives the percentage of individual component in the sample.</p>
