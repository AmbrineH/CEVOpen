  <span class="italic">Tagetes minuta</span> from sunflower (Asteraceae - Helenieae) family is a species native to South America but is now a widespread weed in most parts of the world.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>
  </span>
  <span class="italic"> T. minuta</span> is reported to contain a number of bioactive metabolites of high medicinal, industrial and nutritional value.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>,
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>
  </span> The majority of published studies of 
  <span class="italic">T. minuta</span> focused on the chemodiversity of volatile oils, flavonoids and thiophenes.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span> Etheric oils are a source of bioactive and valuable molecules that are used in many fields such as aromatherapy, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, nutrition, agronomic and perfume industries.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span> The essential oil compositions of
  <span class="italic"> T. minuta</span> has been studied previously in Iran and other parts of the world.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>-
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>
  </span> From these findings, it could be seen that the variation in Tagetes oil depends on several environmental as well as genetic factors.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>,
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>
  </span> In addition, according to different activities of various bioactive compounds, these differences between components of the essential oil will be important in pharmaceutical and nutritional uses.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14</a>
  </span> All these scientific facts, make a thorough evaluation necessary of the native “Tagetes oil” at regional level. Scientific evidence suggests that vegetable oils as another important class of phytochemicals play a vital role in a healthful diet.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>
  </span>They provide energy and essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acids), which are necessary for good health. The oils are also crucial to the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>
  </span> The amount of unsaturated fats is one of the most important parameter of different edible vegetable oils.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a>
  </span> On the other hand, the influence of common environment and genes on the fatty acid composition of plants has been demonstrated by several researchers.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>,
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>
  </span> Previously published investigations on 
  <span class="italic">Tagetes</span> species have demonstrated strong antioxidant properties.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>,
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>
  </span> Phenol and related compounds occur in food products, especially those of plant origin and are known to be responsible for the antioxidant activities. These secondary metabolites are the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their importance in human health.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>
  </span> In recent years, a number of researchers have reported that environmental factors (soil type, sun exposure and rainfall) can widely affect phenolic compounds of the foods.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>
  </span> However, since the biosynthesis of volatile compounds are affected by geographical variation and there is no report on the composition of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">T.minuta</span> from North of Iran, also no study has been carried out previously on phenolic and fatty acid compounds of this plant grown in Iran, therefore this work was carried out; to identification and compare volatile constituents by GC-MS; to analyze the phenolic acids by HPLC and finally; to investigate quantification of fatty acids in the oil extracted of 
  <span class="italic">Tagetes minuta</span> by GC which may be used as initial materials for medical purposes and use in relevant industries.
