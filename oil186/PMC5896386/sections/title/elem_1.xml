Plant identification was carried out by botanist, Guilan Agricultural Research Center (GARC), Dr. Morady and a voucher specimen of the plant has been deposited (no. 5543). The material was aired for a few days in a well-ventilated and protected from direct sunlight.

   <span class="italic">T.minuta</span> was performed using a complete HP/Agilent 6890/5973 GC-MS system with a FID detector (Palo Alto, USA). The GC column specified for the methods was a capillary HP-5MS column (5% phenylmethylsiloxane, 30 m X 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm). The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and helium carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1 ml/min. The samples pass through the interface heated to 200 °C into the mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV, which is scanned from 30-300 amu. The electron multiplier voltage was increased to near 3000 V, and the injection volume was 1 µl. GC oven temperature ranged from 70º to 240 °C at l0 °C /min. Qualitative identification for separated constituents was achieved using MS data libraries (Wiley7n.1 and NIST 2008), by comparison of their retention time (RT) obtained on HP-5MS column and then verified by (RI, HP-5MS) with those published in the literature.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared using 2 mol/l NaOH in methanol and n-heptane. The oil samples were analyzed for chemical components using GC equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, model 6890 N, Agilent Technologies, USA) and DB-Wax capillary column having 30 meter length (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness). It was also fitted to a injector with Agilent tapered liner (4mm id). A fixed quantity of oil (1 μl) was injected into the column after dilution. Oven temperature ranged between 100-230 °C. The temperature of the FID injection system was 250 °C and that of FID detector was 280 °C. Nitrogen carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1.8 ml/min. The identification of individual component was made by running standards (Sigma, Chemical Co.St. Louis). The area under individual peak being calibrated into percent area by integrator itself, gives the percentage of individual component in the sample.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Methanol extract (80%) and essential oil of the plant were evaluated in this study. The main Polyphenol standards were used for separation and characterisation of phenolic compounds in the aromatic herb. The analysis of phenolic acids was performed with a HPLC system Knauer-Germany equipped with UV-Vis detector according to the method proposed the authors.

   </span> The filtered samples were injected on Eurospher 100–5 C
   <sub>18</sub> column (25 cm X 4.6 mm; 5 μm) from Agilent Technologies. In this experiment, the mobile phase for the HPLC-UV system was composed of deionized water/acetic acid (2% v/v) as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B at flow rate 0.8 ml/min. The gradient used in the evaluation was as follows: from 0 to 5 min isocratic 85% A flow, from 5 to 19 min a linear gradient of 85% A to 100% B. In this process, fifteen minutes of equilibration (85% A) is required before another injection. The column temperature was maintained at 25°C and the injection volume was 20 μl. Peaks were detected at 280 nm. Finally, phenolic compounds were determined according to their UV spectra, relative retention times and comparison with reference curves.

   </span> In this study the TPC was expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram dry weight of samples. Briefly, an aliquot of (20 µl) the samples were transferred into a test tube and 1 ml reactive FC (previously diluted 10-fold) was added and mixed. Afterward, 0.8 ml of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to the mixture and mixed gently. After incubation for 30 min in the dark and at ambient temperature (25 °C), the absorbance was read at 765 nm of wave length against blank by using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer. TPC values were calculated from a standard curve plotted with known concentration of gallic acid and all determinations were done in triplicate. (The calibration equation for Gallic acid: y =0.0421 x - 0.0232, R
   <span class="sup">2</span> =0.998).

After 5 min, 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride solution was added. It was left at room temperature for 6 min and 0.5 ml of sodium hydroxide (1 mol/l) was added. Then the absorbance of each mixture was measured immediately at 510 nm with a double beam UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The calibration curve was plotted by preparing quercetin solutions in methanol.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> % inhibition of DPPH radical = 100 – 100 (AS ÷ A0)</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> where A0 is absorbance of the blank and AS is absorbance of the sample at 520 nm. Also the IC
   <sub>50</sub> of the plant was obtained by plotting the percent DPPH remaining at the steady state (60 min) of the reaction against the corresponding antioxidant level. The IC
   <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of antioxidant to quench 50% DPPH under the experimental conditions.
