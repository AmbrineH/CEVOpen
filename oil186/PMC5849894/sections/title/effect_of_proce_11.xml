 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the determination of minerals, walnut seeds were ashed at 550°C and the ash boiled with 10 ml of 20% HCl in a beaker and then filtered into a 100 ml standard flask to determine the mineral content. Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and iron (Fe) were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian 220FS Spectra AA, Les Ulis, France). Phosphorus (P) was determined colorimetrically using the vanado molybdate, according to AOAC procedure 965.17 (AOAC,
