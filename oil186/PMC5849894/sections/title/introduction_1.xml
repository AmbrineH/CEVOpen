 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">African walnut (
  <span class="italic">Tetracarpidium conophorum</span>) is a popular Central and Western Africa plant where it is planted mainly for its nuts, which are usually eaten as snacks when the unshelled nuts are boiled and cracked (Babalola, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0008">2011</a>). The proximate composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. conophorum</span> revealed that it is rich in protein (29.14%), fat (54.14%), carbohydrate (4.17%), ash (3.32%), and several vitamins (Arinola &amp; Adesina, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0005">2014</a>). A bitter taste is usually observed upon drinking water immediately after eating the nuts, due to the presence of antinutrients. The leaves, barks, and nuts of 
  <span class="italic">T. conophorum</span> have also been demonstrated as good sources of phenolic antioxidants with various biological properties. Food materials are usually processed in order to improve palatability and reduce toxicity, and as a means of preservation (Kanu, Kalu, &amp; Okorie, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0017">2015</a>). Walnuts seeds are generally consumed after several processing techniques. General method of processing of walnut prior to consumption involves prolonged cooking of the seeds by boiling and roasting with or without the shell. These processing methods usually improve the organoleptic properties of the nuts, reduce their antinutrients content, and prolong their shelf life (Ayankunbi, Keshinro, &amp; Egele, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0006">1991</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermal or heat processing is one of the most important methods developed by humans. During thermal processing, eventhough antinutritional components are reduced or eliminated; heat has a detrimental effect on the nutritional and functional properties of foods (Kanu et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0017">2015</a>). Then, the thermal treatment of walnuts can lead to chemical changes that can affect its nutritional value and the quality of its lipids. During boiling and roasting of the seeds, high temperatures can facilitate lipid oxidation and nonenzymatic browning reactions, which can reduce the nutritional value of foods, causing the loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and carbohydrates. The amount of vitamins can also be reduced as well as the proteins digestibility (Cuvelier &amp; Maillard, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0010">2012</a>). Additionally, these chemical alteration reactions may generate toxic compounds in edible seeds and the derived products, which can be harmful for the consumers (Djikeng et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0011">2017</a>).

  <span class="italic">Tetracarpidium conophorum</span> is cultivated in littoral and western Cameroon, where it is, respectively, known as “
  <span class="italic">kaso”</span> or “
  <span class="italic">ngak</span>.
  <span class="italic">”</span> The seeds are boiled and roasted for commercialization, consumption, and biscuit‐like snack food production (Babalola, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0008">2011</a>). Many studies have reported the effect of processing temperature on the nutritional, antinutritional values, and antioxidant properties, and African walnut seeds in some countries. These include: effect of boiling and traditional roasting on the nutritional, antinutritional, and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds (Arinola &amp; Adesina, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0005">2014</a>); impact of processing on the nutrient content, vitamin, and mineral composition of African walnuts (Okonkwo &amp; Ozoude, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0021">2014</a>); effect of cooking on phenolic content and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds Ademiluyi, Oboh, Aragbaiye, Oyeleye, and Ogunsuyi (
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0001">2015</a>). Though considerable attention had been given to the study of African walnut seeds, there is, however, very limited reports on the effects of processing on the walnut seeds grown in Cameroon, and especially on the quality of their lipids. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of boiling and different roasting methods on lipid quality and proximate composition of walnut seeds.
