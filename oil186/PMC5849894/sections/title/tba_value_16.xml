 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thiobarbituric acid value (TBA) value measures secondary oxidation production mainly malonaldehyde, which may contribute off‐flavor to oxidized oil (Djikeng et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0011">2017</a>). The effect of different processing methods on the TBA value of walnut oil is shown in Table 
  <a rid="fsn3570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3570-tbl-0001">1</a>. No significant difference (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; .05) was registered between the TBA values of 
  <span class="italic">FWN</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DWN</span>. However, a significant increase (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05) in this parameter was observed in the boiled and roasted samples compared to 
  <span class="italic">FWN</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DWN. DBWN</span> 60 min who previously exhibited the highest peroxide value, also presented the highest TBA value. This indicates that, the rate of primary and secondary oxidation in this sample was significantly higher (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). This is the confirmation that, drying + boiling 60 min (
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min) has significantly alters the quality of walnut oil compared to other treatments. The increase in TBA value registered in the cooked samples is the consequence of the formation of malonaldehyde, which is a secondary oxidation product obtained from the decomposition of hydroperoxides (Womeni et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0029">2016</a>). The fact that the cooking processes can increase the rate of production of secondary oxidation products in edible seeds has already been demonstrated. Tenyang et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0027">2017</a>) showed that the 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐anisidine value of sesame oil significantly increase with roasting and boiling temperatures and times.
