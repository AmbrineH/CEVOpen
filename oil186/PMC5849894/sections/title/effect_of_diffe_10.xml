 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of different processing methods on the proximate composition of walnut</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moisture, fat, ash, and protein content of all the samples were determined using standard analytical methods described by AOAC procedures (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0002">1990</a>). Moisture content was determined by drying walnut seeds in oven at 103°C until a constant weight was achieved according to the AOAC procedures 925.40 (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0002">1990</a>). Ash content was determined by incineration of walnut seeds at 550°C according to the AOAC procedures 942.05 (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0002">1990</a>). Nitrogen (N) content was determined using micro‐Kjeldahl method, according to AOAC procedures 984.13 (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0002">1990</a>), the protein content was calculated as N × 6.25. Lipid content was determined using Soxhlet apparatus with hexane, following AOAC 963.15 methodology (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0002">1990</a>). The total percentage carbohydrate content was determined by the difference method as reported by Onyeike et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0022">2015</a>). This method involved adding the total values of crude protein, crude fat, moisture and ash constituents of the sample and subtracting it from 100. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
