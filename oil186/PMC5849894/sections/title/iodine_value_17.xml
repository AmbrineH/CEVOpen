 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The iodine value (IV) generally determines the degree of unsaturation of edible oils and fats. A decrease in this parameter is generally attributed to the destruction of the double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids by free radicals (Tynek, Hazuka, Pawlowicz, &amp; Dudek, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0028">2001</a>). The changes in IV of walnut oil samples during processing are presented in Table 
  <a rid="fsn3570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3570-tbl-0001">1</a>. Generally, the treatments have significantly decreased (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05) the iodine value of walnut oil compared to the control (
  <span class="italic">FWN</span>). The most affected sample was 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min, because, its iodine value decreased from 121.81 (iodine value of the control) to 118.97 g I
  <sub>2</sub>/100 g. The significant decrease in iodine value of all the processed samples can be attributed as previously mentioned to the destruction of the double bonds of their unsaturated fatty acids by the free radicals formed during processing. The fact that the decrease was mostly pronounced in 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min indicates a serious alteration of the unsaturations of its fatty acids compared to the other processed samples. It is important to note that, the iodine values obtained in almost all the samples were not far from the range 120 to 155 g I
  <sub>2</sub>/100 g which is the recommended range of iodine value of walnut oil (Soap Dish, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0025">2002</a>). As previously observed with the TBA and PV values, 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min was the most affected sample. This means that, drying + boiling is not suitable for the preservation of the quality of walnut oil. These results are not in accordance with those of Tenyang et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0027">2017</a>) who demonstrated that, the iodine value sesame oil significantly decreases when the seeds are roasted at 120°C for 30 min.
