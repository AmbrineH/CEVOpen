  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil was performed by means of a gas chromatography (Thermo Finnigan TRACE GC-Polaris Q, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with mass spectrometry detector (Thermo Finnigan) and DB-Wax column (60 m ×0.25 mm id ×0.25 µm film thickness; Supleco, MA, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas (1 mL/min). Oven temperature was programmed at 70°C for 5 minutes, then raised up to 230°C at 2°C/min and held for 10 minutes at 230°C. Injector temperature was 230°C. EI mass spectra was recorded at 70 eV ionization voltage over the mass range 40–400 u. For gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 0.5 µL of extract and mixture solvent (1:10) containing n-hexane and methanol (1:1 v/v) was injected under split mode (1:33).
