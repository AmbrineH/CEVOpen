  <span class="italic">Nigella sativa</span>, an annual flowering plant of Ranunculaceae family, has been used in traditional medicine throughout Middle Eastern countries, such as Asia, Africa, and India, for various ailments. It is commonly used to treat asthma,
  <a rid="b1-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1-dddt-11-2221">1</a>,
  <a rid="b2-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2-dddt-11-2221">2</a> but a recent study of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> demonstrated the multiple mechanisms of actions for a range of therapeutic uses. These include its use in the remedy to treat hypercholesterolemia in menopausal women, with more benefits and less side effects than from other single pharmacological agents.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of another study showed that methanolic extract of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed inhibits SiHa human cervical cancer cell proliferation through apoptotic induction. It was found that the results of one study suggest an association between p38β not p38α and oral cancer development. Additionally, the anti cancer activity of thymoquinone (TQ) indicated that the antitumor activity of TQ may be attributed to the downregulation of p38β MAPK.

  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> can efficiently reduce the number of cells with NF200 at all the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of hippocampus and parietal and frontal areas of the rat’s brain; 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> can be used as a potential preventive supplement compound for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil and its components may represent another mechanism that contributes to its antimalarial activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The desirable effect of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> on human diseases may be due to the presence of active compounds (ie, polyunsaturated fatty acids, TQ, phenolic compounds, and other natural anti-oxidants) in 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil composition. 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed contains 26.6% oil, of which the major fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA, 64.6%) and palmitic acid (20.4%) as reported in a previous study.
  <a rid="b17-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17-dddt-11-2221">17</a> Cheikh-Rouhou et al
  <a rid="b18-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18-dddt-11-2221">18</a> also found that LA was the major unsaturated fatty acid in 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> (50.3% “Tunisian 
  <span class="italic">NS</span>” and 49.2% “Iranian 
  <span class="italic">NS</span>”). It was found that 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seeds contain 36%–38% fixed oils, proteins, alkaloids, saponin, and 0.4%–2.5% essential oil, and it was reported that the 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> essential oil is mainly composed of TQ (27.8%–57.0%), ρ-cymene (7.1%–15.5%), carvacrol (5.8%–11.6%), t-anethole (0.25%–2.3%), 4-terpineol (2%–6.6%), and longifolene (1.0%–8.0%).
  <a rid="b19-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-dddt-11-2221">19</a> Fatty acid profiles were identified for 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed oils. Also LA and oleic acids are the main fatty acids of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> essential oil. In addition, the 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> essential oil contains considerable amounts of myristic acid (C14:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), and behenic acid (C22:0).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most properties of whole seeds or their extracts are mainly attributed to quinine constituents, TQ is the most abundant compound.
  <a rid="b21-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21-dddt-11-2221">21</a> TQ, as the main constituent of the volatile oil from 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seeds, has been reported to possess strong anti-oxidant properties.
  <a rid="b22-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22-dddt-11-2221">22</a> Based on a previous study, TQ, carvacrol, t-anethole, and 4-terpineol were identified as active antioxidants and radical scavenging compounds in 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span>.
  <a rid="b23-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-dddt-11-2221">23</a> TQ can be used for the treatment of fungal skin infections.
  <a rid="b24-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24-dddt-11-2221">24</a> Previous researchers reported different contents of TQ that ranged from 27.8% to 57% in several Australian 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oils.

  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil is traditionally obtained by mechanical pressing or treating powdered 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed with organic solvents, most commonly hexane. Conventional solvent extraction techniques produce low-quality oil that requires extensive purification operations resulting in thermal degradation and loss of valuable compounds.
  <a rid="b25-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25-dddt-11-2221">25</a> The use of organic solvents and the necessity of recovering the solvent have led to a move toward cleaner extraction methods, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). SFE is becoming an efficient and worldwide used technique to obtain valuable natural substances from complex materials. SFE-CO
  <sub>2</sub> has been utilized as a nontoxic alternative to hexane and other organic solvents for the extraction of oil from corn germ,
  <a rid="b26-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26-dddt-11-2221">26</a> cottonseed,
  <a rid="b27-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27-dddt-11-2221">27</a> rapeseed,
  <a rid="b28-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28-dddt-11-2221">28</a> and other oil-bearing materials.
  <a rid="b29-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29-dddt-11-2221">29</a> Thus, the main objective of this study was to compare the oil extraction efficiency and essential oil composition of Iranian and Indian 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> L. oil extracted by SFE and solvent extraction techniques.
