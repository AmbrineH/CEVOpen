  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Refractive index</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The refractive index is usually used as a criterion for oil purity. This parameter will increase with higher chain length (however the relation is not a linear one) and the nonsaturation level. Different oils and fats have their own and particular refractive indices, so this feature is used to identify and determine the purity of oils and fats (Bakhshabadi et al., 
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0007">2017</a>). The refractive index is useful in controlling the progress of reactions such as hydrogenation and catalytic isomerization of oils. Also, it is used to recognize the oil oxidation too, and the temperature and saturation are some factors that influence the refractive index (Malek, 
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0026">2001</a>).As shown in Figure 
   <a rid="fsn3535-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3535-fig-0003">3</a>, applying various pretreatments didn't have any significant influence on the refractive index of black cumin oil (
   <span class="italic">p</span>&gt;.05) and for all samples about 1.469. Haroon et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0500">2014</a>) stated that based on the variety, the refractive index of black cumin oil is ranged from 1.4697 to 1.4730, which conformed with our results. Bakhshabadi et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0007">2017</a>) attributed no changes in refractive index of oils obtained from microwave process to the similarity of fatty acid compositions in the nontreated and treated samples. Also, Gorji et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0012">2016</a>) through studying the physicochemical properties of orange seed oil extracted by various methods, indicated that modern extraction technologies in comparison with common and usual methods, do not change physical properties of oils such as refractive index.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil density</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was found that different pretreatments in oil extraction from black cumin led to an increase in oil density (Figure 
   <a rid="fsn3535-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3535-fig-0004">4</a>). When the microwave and PEF were used, the oil density was increased 1.51% and 0.96%, respectively in comparison with samples that didn't have any pretreatments. Likely, this increase can be attributed to the more decomposition of seed cell walls and increase in resulted particles within the oil. Anjum, Anwar, Jamil, and Iqbal (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0003">2006</a>) reported that microwave leads to a higher oil density that was inconsistent with the findings of Uquiche et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0042">2008</a>) and Kittiphoom et al. (2015). Theoretically, density is not an important property but economically it is very important. Although the oil shipments are sold on the basis of their weight but they are measured on the basis of their volume and also their relationship is defined by density. This parameter is not similar for all the oils and it is dependent on the composition of fatty acids, the trace and low compounds that exist in oil, and also the temperature (Hamm, Hamilton, &amp; Calliauw, 
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0015">2013</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The color index of extracted oils</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of variance indicated that the influence of pretreatment type on the color index of oils extracted from black cumin seeds was completely significant (
   <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;.01). Comparing the means of data obtained from samples (Figure 
   <a rid="fsn3535-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3535-fig-0005">5</a>) revealed that the color index ranged between 82.1–155.34. As it is clear, the use of PEF and microwave pretreatments caused an increase in the color index of black cumin oil and the maximum color index was obtained for microwave pretreatment. The increase in color index can be attributed to the fracture of plant tissues during treatment and therefore more extraction of the pigments. In this regard, Lee, Oh, Chang, and Kim (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0023">2004</a>) studied the influence of different temperatures of parching the safflower seeds on its oil color. They stated that formation of color in oil was under the influence of parching temperatures in such a manner that when the temperature is increased, the oil color would change from light yellow to dark brown. Also, Kim et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0020">2002</a>) reported a distinct color increase in the rice bran oil at higher parching temperatures. Megahad (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0029">2001</a>) attributed the increase in color in peanut oil as the result of treating the seeds with microwave to the nonenzymatic browning reactions and destruction of phospholipids during the parching process; so an increase in the brown components can be occurred together with elevation of other components as a result of decomposition of phospholipids. Guderjan, Elez‐Martínez, and Knorr (
   <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0013">2007</a>) observed similar results at the time of using PEF.
