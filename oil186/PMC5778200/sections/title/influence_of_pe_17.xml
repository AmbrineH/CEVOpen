 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stability is the time required to reach a point in which one oxidation index such as peroxide value or carbonyl number increases suddenly and it causes an undesirable taste and aroma in the oil. There are several methods to evaluate the chemicals resulted from heating processes which have so many influences on the quality and nutritional properties of oils, and the oxidative stability index is the most important one (Holser, 
  <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0016">2003</a>). Measurement of oxidative stability index alone during the heating processes of oils is not sufficient to evaluate the quality of oils, but it gives some information about the initial situation of oil sample (Matthaus, 
  <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0028">2006</a>). As can be seen in Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3535-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3535-fig-0006">6</a>, our results indicated that PEF and microwave pretreatments increased the oxidative stability of black cumin seed oils; the highest oxidative stability obtained with PEF treatment and then, with the microwave pretreatment. This can be explained by the increase in tocopherols and other antioxidant components in extracted oils as a result of these pretreatments. More details will be provided later in section 3.5. Spielmeyer, Wagner, and Jahreis (
  <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0038">2009</a>) and Guderjan et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3535-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3535-bib-0013">2007</a>)found similar results and claimed that use of different pretreatments leads to an increase in oxidative stability of extracted oils.
