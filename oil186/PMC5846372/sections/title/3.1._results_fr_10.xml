 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All three samples of “Kainari” from Mytilini, Paleochori, and Agiassos in Lesvos were studied for the first time to our knowledge. The rich aroma of the mixture was studied through Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME)/GC-MS analyses. Furthermore, the pentane and methanol extracts were also studied through GC-MS with respective results. The major constituents that have been determined through GC-MS analyses were cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, myristicin, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, curcumene, and zingiberene, which can be related to the possible contained spices as shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through analyses of all extracts of the three samples (herbal teas, methanol, and pentane extracts) and the simultaneous use of bibliography we conclude that the main components in all three samples are cinnamon (~6/10) and clove (~3/10) and the remaining part (1/10) corresponds to both nutmeg and ginger.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is remarkable that, according to the analyses of the volatiles in KN3, they were not identified as the main components of ginger
  <span class="italic"> (Zingiber officinale)</span> and consequently we assume that ginger is not included in the mixture or it is included in small quantities. As for the presence of cardamom and pepper, due to the lack of some of their main metabolites (some of them exist in other contained plants at the same time), we conclude that if they are present they will be in small quantities.
