   <span class="italic">(i) Isolation of Volatile Compounds</span>. The essential oil of sample KN2 was received by Clevenger distillation using 15.00 g of sample KN2. The distillate A (35 mL), consisting of essential oil and aromatic water, was collected in a flask, while 2 ml of pure essential oil B was collected separately and analyzed through GC-MS.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the distillate A was added 2 g of NaCl and the solution was cooled in ice water and transferred to a separatory funnel with 50 mL of hexane. The aqueous layer A1 was discarded, and the organic layer A2 was evaporated via rotary evaporation (R-200, Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland) to yield an oily extract C. In the extract C 15 mL hexane and 25 mL of 5% NaOH were added for further liquid-liquid separation. The aqueous layer C1 contained the sodium salt of eugenol, while the eugenol acetate,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Layer C1 was then evaporated and cooled on ice, while 50 mL of 6 M HCl was added to the solution, ensuring that the solution was acidic and it was extracted with 15 mL hexane yielding eugenol, which was identified through NMR, GC-MS, and comparison with literature data [

For SPME extraction, 10 mg of each sample in a glass vial (15 mL) closed with PTFE coated silicone rubber septum was used. The temperature in our experiment was set at 70–75°C and the vial with sample was placed on the hot-plate for 15 minutes. After that time, the fiber was exposed for 5 minutes and then it was transferred to perform GC-MS analysis.

   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. As referred to literature, 10 mg of each crude methanol extract or lyophilized herbal tea was dissolved in 1 mL of corresponding extracting solvent to produce the stock of sample solution. The lower concentrations of sample were prepared by diluting 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of the stock sample solution with 900 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L methanol or distilled water. Then, 50 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of sample was put in a test tube and mixed with 60 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, followed by an addition of 120 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of 35% sodium carbonate after 3 minutes. Then, the resulting mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for an hour and absorbance was measured at 725 nm (UV-1700, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) after incubation. Caffeic acid was used as calibrated standard and results were expressed as milligram Caffeic Acid Equivalent per gram of dry extract (mg CAE/g dry extract).

   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of sodium carbonate (7.5% w/v) in a 96-well plate. The reagents were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 765 nm.

   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of the DPPH solution and 10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L of gallic acid or samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A negative control containing 10

   <span class="italic">(iii) 2,2-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic Acid) (ABTS) Assay. </span>The ABTS radical cation scavenging assay was performed using the method reported by Re et al. (1999) with slight modifications [
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. In brief, a stock ABTS aqua solution (7 mM) was reacted with potassium persulfate aqua solution (2.45 mM) and kept overnight in dark to yield a dark colored solution containing ABTS
   <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation. Trolox was used as a positive control (IC50: 8.3 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations. Prior to use in the assay, the ABTS
   <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation was diluted with distilled water for an initial absorbance of about 0.700 (±0.02) at 734 nm. Afterwards, in a 96-well plate 100

   <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation solution and 50 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of Trolox or samples were added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. A negative control containing 50
