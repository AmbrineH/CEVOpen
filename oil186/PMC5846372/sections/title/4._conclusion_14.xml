 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the chemical composition, as well as the total phenolic content (TPC) and the potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, of three Kainari-herbal teas from different areas of Lesvos Island (Greece) was evaluated. All samples exerted very broad and strong antimicrobial activities against almost all Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria, as well as strong antioxidant activities.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the determined chemical analysis and total phenolic content, it could be concluded that “Kainari” herbal infusion, except its very pleasant taste, could be also further used as a functional herbal beverage, due to its beneficial properties, strong antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities for consumers. Certainly, more studies along the potential further bioactivities, as well as the entire process of the production of stable batches of “Kainari” combination at industrial level, have to be designed in future.</p>
