 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total phenolic content (TPC) of the three samples was notably high, probably due to the known rich phenolic concentration of all spices that they contain [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. The sample KN3 revealed the higher concentration of phenolic content (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The free radical scavenging activities of herbal teas and methanol extracts were determined by DPPH and ABTS assays (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). All extracts showed significant antioxidant activity performing 30–64% inhibition at DPPH assay (50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL), as well as 26–48% inhibition at ABTS assay (10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL). The herbal tea KN3 performed the higher inhibition at DPPH (64.7%) and at ABTS (46.9%) which is in accordance with the high TPC. Also, the methanol extracts of KN1 and KN3 showed high inhibition.
