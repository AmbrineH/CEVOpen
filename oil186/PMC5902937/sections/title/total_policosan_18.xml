 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, the policosanol composition of milk thistle oil has never been previously reported. As seen in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, the total policosanol content of the mature milk thistle seeds was 574.4 mg/kg of oil (equivalent to about 175.2 mg/kg of dry weight) and was higher than those of grape seed and rice bran oils (171.17–245.15 mg/kg of oil) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. However, it was lower than those of other plant sources such as sorghum kernel (800 mg/kg dry weight) and green tea leaves (726.2–1363.6 mg/kg dry weight) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Milk thistle seed oil had high content of policosanols which are considered important from a nutritional and functional point of view. Policosanol contents in vegetables are shown to vary due to many factors like species, ripening grade of fruits and type of tissue [

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The content of policosanol in milk thistle oil was affected by seed maturity stages (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). It was higher in the immature seeds (987.68 mg/kg oil) and then decreased during seed maturation. Also, a decreasing trend was observed for the policosanol content during the early stages of corn kernel development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. In contrast, during 
  <span class="italic">Tilia tomentosa</span> leaf development, total primary alcohol content was found to increase from 0.031% to 0.197% of dry weight [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. These quantitative differences observed in the policosanol content during seed development could be linked to change in the activity of fatty acyl-coA reductase which converts fatty acyl-coA into fatty alcohol.
