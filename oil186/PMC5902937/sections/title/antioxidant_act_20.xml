 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of the milk thistle oil samples was evaluated using the two most common radical scavenging assays DPPH and ABTS. The DPPH test has been widely used for the estimation of the antioxidant capacity of plant and health food extracts due to its simplicity, stability and reproducibility [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. All the tested oil samples showed strong radical scavenging activity which varied from 70.25 to 96.42% (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The difference between DPPH and ABTS values obtained for the same sample might be due to the fact that ABTS assay is applicable to both hydropholic and lipopholic antioxidants systems, however DDPH assay is applicable to hydrophobic system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Milk thistle seed oil had a higher DPPH value compared with other vegetables oils such as unheated sesame oil which had DPPH value of 69.2% [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. This result is in agreement with previous studies that showed a high free radical scavenging capacity for cold-pressed milk thistle oil [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] and ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Kiralan et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] reported that olive oil was able to quench 52.31–94.91% of DPPH radicals, depending in olive cultivar. Using toluene to dissolve the DPPH and the oil samples, the order of effectiveness of some vegetable oils in inhibiting free radicals was as follows: coriander &gt;black cumin&gt; cottonseed&gt; peanut&gt; sunflower&gt; walnut&gt; hemp seed&gt; linseed &gt;olive &gt;niger seed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Solvent may influence the hydrogen-donating capacity of the antioxidant and affect the antioxidant activity of samples [

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed that the antiradical action of oil samples was affected by the seed maturity stage (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The immature seed oil that contained the highest policosanol amount showed the maximum antiradical activity (96.42% and 90.35% for DPPH test and ABTS assay, respectively). A decline in the antioxidant activity was also observed for carob, pepper and guava throughout fruit ripening [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The stronger antioxidant capacity of immature seed oil compared to mature seed oil may be due to the differences in their content and composition of unsaponifiable matter. In our previous study, we found that the amount of total unsaponifiable matter decreased during milk thistle seed maturation, while the total lipid content increased [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Additionally, Ramadan and Mörsel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] reported a positive correlation between the radical scavenging activity of vegetable oils and their levels of unsaponifiables.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During seed maturation, a high positive correlation was observed between total policosanol content and antiradical activity of seed oil samples through DPPH (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.952) and ABTS (r = 0.899) assays (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). This result suggested that policosanol content may contribute to the antioxidant potential of oil sample. The antioxidant activity was correlated not only with the total amount of antioxidants, but also with the presence of selected compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Dabbour et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] reported that the high free radical scavenging capacity of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds and alpha-tocopherol. For the ethanolic extract of milk thistle seeds, the antioxidant potential was mainly correlated to the total content of flavonoids and phenolics rather than the content of individual compounds including silybin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Other reports indicated a positive correlation between radical scavenging capacity of seed oils and their levels of unsaponifiables and phytosterols, while a negative relation was noted with the amounts of phenolics and tocopherols [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Conversely, Kozłowska et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] reported a positive correlation between total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of seed oils and a negative correlation with total sterols. The general consensus within the literature is that the antioxidant capacity appears to be related to the complementary role of different synergic compounds rather than being ascribed to one or a few compounds [
