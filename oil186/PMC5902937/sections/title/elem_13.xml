  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Test solution (0.5 ml) consisted of 0.45 ml bovine serum albumin (0.5% 
   <span class="italic">w</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span> aqueous solution) and 0.05 ml of oil samples. Then the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min followed by incubation at 57 °C for 3 min. After cooling the samples, 2.5 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) was added to each tube. UV-Visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 660 nm. The control represents 100% protein denaturation. For test control solution (0.5 ml) 0.05 ml distilled water was used instead of oil sample while for product control (0.5 ml) 0.45 ml distilled water and test solution (0.05 ml) were used. The percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated by the following formula:
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Percentage inhibition = {(Absorbance of test solution- Absorbance of the control)/Absorbance of the control}/ × 100.</p>

  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reaction mixture (5 ml) was comprised of 0.2 ml of fresh hen’s egg albumin, 2.8 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.4) and 2mlof oil samples. Similar volume of double distilled water served as control. Then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C in the incubator for 15 min and then heated at 7°0 C for 5 min. After cooling, their absorbance was measured at 660 nm by using pure blank. The percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated as mentioned in Bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation method.</p>
