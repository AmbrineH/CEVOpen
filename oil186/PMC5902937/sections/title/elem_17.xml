   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, the total policosanol content of the mature milk thistle seeds was 574.4 mg/kg of oil (equivalent to about 175.2 mg/kg of dry weight) and was higher than those of grape seed and rice bran oils (171.17–245.15 mg/kg of oil) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. However, it was lower than those of other plant sources such as sorghum kernel (800 mg/kg dry weight) and green tea leaves (726.2–1363.6 mg/kg dry weight) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Milk thistle seed oil had high content of policosanols which are considered important from a nutritional and functional point of view.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Octacosanol is also the single most abundant policosanol in sugar cane wax (60–70%) and perilla seeds (55.93%) with a minor quantity of many other policosanols [

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows that the percentages of octacosanol, triacontanol and dotriacontanol were largely influenced by seed maturity stages. In immature seeds, the dominant alcohol was C
   <sub>30</sub> (40.25%), followed by C
   <sub>28</sub> (30.42%) and C
   <sub>32</sub> (16.36%). During seed maturation, the percentage of octacosanol increased rapidly, while those of triacontanol and dotriacontanol decreased. The levels of the other detected compounds were relatively constant, as the seed developed. In agreement to our present trends, the level of triacontanol was also found to decrease during corn kernel development [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Immature seeds are rich in triacontanol which is essential for their development. In fact, triacontanol has been reported to stimulate plant growth, increase dry weight, prevent oxidative stress and act as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. The variation in the policosanol composition might be due to the physiological changes that accompany ripening of seeds. Triacontanol exhibited anti-inflammatory action in animals and has been suggested to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Thus, immature milk thistle seeds could be exploited as a natural source of this bioactive compound.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of the milk thistle oil samples was evaluated using the two most common radical scavenging assays DPPH and ABTS. The DPPH test has been widely used for the estimation of the antioxidant capacity of plant and health food extracts due to its simplicity, stability and reproducibility [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. All the tested oil samples showed strong radical scavenging activity which varied from 70.25 to 96.42% (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The difference between DPPH and ABTS values obtained for the same sample might be due to the fact that ABTS assay is applicable to both hydropholic and lipopholic antioxidants systems, however DDPH assay is applicable to hydrophobic system [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Milk thistle seed oil had a higher DPPH value compared with other vegetables oils such as unheated sesame oil which had DPPH value of 69.2% [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. This result is in agreement with previous studies that showed a high free radical scavenging capacity for cold-pressed milk thistle oil [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] and ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Kiralan et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] reported that olive oil was able to quench 52.31–94.91% of DPPH radicals, depending in olive cultivar. Using toluene to dissolve the DPPH and the oil samples, the order of effectiveness of some vegetable oils in inhibiting free radicals was as follows: coriander &gt;black cumin&gt; cottonseed&gt; peanut&gt; sunflower&gt; walnut&gt; hemp seed&gt; linseed &gt;olive &gt;niger seed [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Solvent may influence the hydrogen-donating capacity of the antioxidant and affect the antioxidant activity of samples [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed that the antiradical action of oil samples was affected by the seed maturity stage (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The immature seed oil that contained the highest policosanol amount showed the maximum antiradical activity (96.42% and 90.35% for DPPH test and ABTS assay, respectively). A decline in the antioxidant activity was also observed for carob, pepper and guava throughout fruit ripening [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The stronger antioxidant capacity of immature seed oil compared to mature seed oil may be due to the differences in their content and composition of unsaponifiable matter. In our previous study, we found that the amount of total unsaponifiable matter decreased during milk thistle seed maturation, while the total lipid content increased [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Additionally, Ramadan and Mörsel [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] reported a positive correlation between the radical scavenging activity of vegetable oils and their levels of unsaponifiables.
  </p>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During seed maturation, a high positive correlation was observed between total policosanol content and antiradical activity of seed oil samples through DPPH (

   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). This result suggested that policosanol content may contribute to the antioxidant potential of oil sample. The antioxidant activity was correlated not only with the total amount of antioxidants, but also with the presence of selected compounds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Dabbour et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] reported that the high free radical scavenging capacity of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds and alpha-tocopherol. For the ethanolic extract of milk thistle seeds, the antioxidant potential was mainly correlated to the total content of flavonoids and phenolics rather than the content of individual compounds including silybin [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Other reports indicated a positive correlation between radical scavenging capacity of seed oils and their levels of unsaponifiables and phytosterols, while a negative relation was noted with the amounts of phenolics and tocopherols [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Conversely, Kozłowska et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] reported a positive correlation between total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of seed oils and a negative correlation with total sterols. The general consensus within the literature is that the antioxidant capacity appears to be related to the complementary role of different synergic compounds rather than being ascribed to one or a few compounds [

In vitro anti-arthritic activity of studied oil samples was evaluated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation and egg albumin denaturation methods. Our study reveals that the milk thistle oil is capable to inhibit the denaturation of protein (Table

Previously published studies examined the anti-arthritic activity of various plant extracts. The ethanolic extract of
