  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The ABTS
  <span class="sup">+</span> radical was generated by oxidation of 2.5 ml of ABTS solution (7 mM) with potassium persulfate (14.7 mM). The mixture is kept in the dark for 16 h at room temperature (25 °C). Before usage, the mixture was diluted with water to obtain an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.05 at 734 nm. The radical scavenging activity is assessed by mixing 2 ml of this diluted ABTS+ solution with different oil samples dissolved in benzene. After 30 min, the percentage inhibition at 734 nm was calculated for each sample relative to blank absorbance. The percentage inhibition of ABTS radical by the oils was calculated using the equation described in the DPPH assay.
