 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reaction mixture (5 ml) was comprised of 0.2 ml of fresh hen’s egg albumin, 2.8 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.4) and 2mlof oil samples. Similar volume of double distilled water served as control. Then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C in the incubator for 15 min and then heated at 7°0 C for 5 min. After cooling, their absorbance was measured at 660 nm by using pure blank. The percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated as mentioned in Bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation method.</p>
