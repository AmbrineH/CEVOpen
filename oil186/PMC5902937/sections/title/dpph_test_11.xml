 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of seed oil samples was determined using DPPH radicals as described by Kozłowska et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Fifty mg of oil was dissolved in 3 mL of ethyl acetate and then 1 mL of oil solution was diluted with 2.75 mL ethyl acetate. 0.25 mL of DPPH solution (1 mM) was added and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 10s in a vortex apparatus. After 20 min, the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using UV/Vis scanning spectrophotometer (Model 2650, Labomed, Inc. U.S.A) and the percent of inhibition was calculated using this formula:
