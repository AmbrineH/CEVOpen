 <p id="par0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vision is a key strategy by which individual aquatic species avoid predators. However, in low-light or turbid conditions the injury-induced release of chemical messengers play a key in allowing an individual to communicate threat to conspecifics (reviewed by 
  <a rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0005">[1]</a>). Among fish in the superorder Ostariophysi, anatomically distinct club cells in the epidermis produce an alarm substance, which is released if those cells are damaged (reviewed by 
  <a rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0010">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">[3]</a>). The alarm substance then binds to olfactory receptors of conspecifics, resulting in a range of anti-predatory behaviors (including freezing, darting, schooling, feeding, and hiding) which may persist for up to 4 h after withdrawal of the alarm substance 
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">[4]</a>. The precise composition of the alarm substance is unknown and thus, a purified preparation of alarm substance is not commercially available. However, determining the precise composition of alarm substance is an active area of study 
  <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0030">[6]</a>. Most recently, chondroitin and hypoxanthine 3-
  <span class="italic">N</span>-oxide have been shown to induce anti-predatory behaviors in fish 
  <a rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0035">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0040">[8]</a>. This suggests that alarm substance contains these compounds as active ingredients or other chemicals that are similar in structure. In bioassays, fish epithelium is usually used as a “natural” source of alarm substance. A prescribed section of skin is removed and homogenized in water; fish exposed to the solution exhibit anti-predator behavior 
  <a rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0035">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0050">[10]</a>. Alternately, shallow incisions are made in the epidermis and flushed with water; this solution induces anti-predator behavior as well 
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">[9]</a>. The aforementioned procedures are effective at extracting alarm substance but the fish from which they are obtained must be killed.

  <span class="italic">Understanding behavioral responses to alarm substance in fishes is significant because they represent a first step in understanding the neural and physiological mechanisms that mediate fear and anxiety in humans</span>. The method we present in this manuscript allows for the development of a sustainable source of alarm substance for use in chemical characterization and bioassays without killing the research model. Our method for collecting epithelial cells is inexpensive, non-invasive, and allows for fast recovery of the experimental model. Additionally, cells can be collected from the same fish multiple times. We also demonstrate that our source of alarm substance significantly increases darting behavior in wild caught Creek Chub minnows (
