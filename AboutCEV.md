# CEV Project

(CEV = ContentMine, EssoilDB and Verriclear, the 3 organizations which have started this project).

This project aims to mine the whole Open scientific literature for plant chemistry (phytochemistry).
It's inspired by Gitanjali's EssoilDB project http://www.nipgr.ac.in/Essoildb/ and heavily reliant on the content and contributors. 
While EssoilDB V1.0 used manual entry of data, mainly from closed access papers, CEV will crawl the Open Access (OA) literature and automatically
extract plant and chemical data. We have no ideas how successful this will be, but initial searches suggest that there are many thousands of
of OA phytochemical papers and it's OA that has made this project possible.
