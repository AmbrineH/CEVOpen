# CEV Project

(CEV = ContentMine, EssoilDB and Verriclear, the 3 organizations which have started this project).

## Goal
This project aims to mine the whole Open scientific literature for plant chemistry (phytochemistry).
It's inspired by Gitanjali Yadav's (GY) EssoilDB project http://www.nipgr.ac.in/Essoildb/ and heavily reliant on the content and contributors. 
While EssoilDB V1.0 used manual entry of data, mainly from closed access papers, CEV will crawl the Open Access (OA) literature and automatically
extract plant and chemical data. We have no idea how successful this will be (that's research), but initial searches suggest that there are many thousands
of OA phytochemical papers and it's OA that has made this project possible.

### Hopes
We hope that we will be able to create a rapid proof of concept (PoC), which will give an indication of what phytochemical activites can be retrieved from the
literature with current tools (a "scoping review"). It is NOT be a medically quotable result. It will also allow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis (the sectioning and labelling of parts of the document). Ultimately this will lead to the identification of the most important scientific objects in the document ("entities"). In time these will be incoporated into dictionaries which can automatically label objects such as
* diseases
* instruments and procedures
* drugs
* countries
* institutions

### ContentMine
ContentMine (https://contentmine.org). was funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation (Fellowship to PMR) and Rik Smith-Unna created the critically important `getpapers` search and retrieval software. PMR created the `AMI` software for analyzing downloaded materials locally.

"We hope that this huge repository of essential oil profiles will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. The data is available freely without any login requirement."

Because EssoilDB is created for free re-use we thank Gitanjali and NIPGR for the data in EssoilDB 1.0 (2019-08). Any additions and enhancements can be taken by EssoilDB and incorporated in later versions.

### VerriclearVerriclear
https://verriclear.com/ , founded by Emanuel Faria (EF) , creates 100% plant-based natural skincare formulations [for] skin conditions. 


## Volunteers and collaborators
Initially the project data will be created/extracted by EF and PMR; GY as advisor. We generally welcome
