 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laboratory tests were carried out to determine the toxicity of the essential oils from
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> on engorged females of
  <span class="italic"> R</span>.
  <span class="italic"> (B.) microplus</span>. The results referents to mortality rate of engorged females after adult immersion test (AIT) are present in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. Essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> exhibited 90% of mortality on engorged females in the highest concentration tested after 48â€‰h, reaching 100% at the end of the experiments (day 16). At concentration of 5%,
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> achieved approximately 80% mortality rate in the fourth day and getting the most for 90% mortality at the 12th day. The 2.5%
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil led to 50% mortality rate on day 16 after treatment (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> also demonstrated high efficacy against
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> tick using the highest concentration (10%), which caused a mortality of 80% of females on the 16th day. The concentrations of 5 and 2.5% essential oil led to a mortality rate of 60% and 35%, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(b)</a>)
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxic effect of the mixture of essential oils was also studied (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(c)</a>). The mixture of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> oil induced 100% death at a concentration of 10% at the end of treatments. The results of the groups treated with the combination of the oils, at all concentrations tested, were very similar to the results of the
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil. These results demonstrate the dose-dependent character of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> mortality and there was a significant difference between all treatments when compared with control group.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When AIT was performed with positive controls, the mortality of engorged females of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> for Deltamethrin and Amitraz was 57.7% and 27.7%, showing a level of resistance status (

  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> summarizes LC50 and LC90 values for individuals and combined treatments of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> oils against engorged females. The most potent modified oil was
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> with a LC90 of 4.9% whereas the combined oils exhibited a LC90 of 5.1%.
