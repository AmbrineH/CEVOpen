  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the oil from

   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. A total of 29 compounds representing 96.3% of the total oil were identified from
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil. The chromatographic profile of
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> showed a complex mixture of monoterpenes (90.3%) and sesquiterpenes (3.1%).
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil was composed mainly by the monoterpenes limonene (50.3%), 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (14.4%), and

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In
   <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> essential oil, 42 compounds were identified, comprising 89% of the oil. The essential oil was characterized by the presence of sesquiterpenes (58.9%) and monoterpenes (26.3%). The sesquiterpene 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene was identified as the major compound, representing 26.2% of the oil, followed by the monoterpenes hydrocarbons

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laboratory tests were carried out to determine the toxicity of the essential oils from
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> on engorged females of
   <span class="italic"> R</span>.
   <span class="italic"> (B.) microplus</span>. The results referents to mortality rate of engorged females after adult immersion test (AIT) are present in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. Essential oil from
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> exhibited 90% of mortality on engorged females in the highest concentration tested after 48 h, reaching 100% at the end of the experiments (day 16). At concentration of 5%,
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> achieved approximately 80% mortality rate in the fourth day and getting the most for 90% mortality at the 12th day. The 2.5%
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil led to 50% mortality rate on day 16 after treatment (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> also demonstrated high efficacy against
   <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> tick using the highest concentration (10%), which caused a mortality of 80% of females on the 16th day. The concentrations of 5 and 2.5% essential oil led to a mortality rate of 60% and 35%, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(b)</a>)
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxic effect of the mixture of essential oils was also studied (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(c)</a>). The mixture of
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> oil induced 100% death at a concentration of 10% at the end of treatments. The results of the groups treated with the combination of the oils, at all concentrations tested, were very similar to the results of the
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil. These results demonstrate the dose-dependent character of
   <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> mortality and there was a significant difference between all treatments when compared with control group.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When AIT was performed with positive controls, the mortality of engorged females of
   <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> for Deltamethrin and Amitraz was 57.7% and 27.7%, showing a level of resistance status (

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the AIT the efficacy of treatment against engorged females was also evaluated by measuring egg production. The results are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. Ours results showed that
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and the oil mixture have the best inhibition of oviposition rate, which is 100% in a dilution of 10%. However, at 5% the group with combined oils exhibited greater inhibition of oviposition with 94%, compared to 81.6% inhibition by individual
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span>.
   <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> essential oil, at concentrations of 10%, 5%, and 2.5%, inhibited egg-laying by 96%, 83%, and 50%, respectively. Data were significantly different in relation to the control (DMSO 2% and water) group (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The few eggs laid by the females treated with 5% of
   <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil have not hatched into larvae. This result showed that oviposition is also dose-dependent (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). Thus, analysis of variance 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 for treatments confirmed the positive development of inhibition oviposition with increasing concentration. The mixture is effective against
   <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> engorged females since its effect is fast and is expressed at a low concentration on reducing the rate of lay. However, the essential oils did not interfere in the hatchability of the larvae.
