 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of chemical composition of
  <span class="italic"> Citrus limonum</span> essential oil by GC/MS showed as major compounds limonene (50.3%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (14.4%), and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-terpinene (11.7%). This result agrees with that found by others groups in previous studies with species of genus
  <span class="italic"> Citrus</span>, where the same chemical compounds can be found, although in different proportions [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>]. The essential oil chemical compositions of
  <span class="italic"> Piper nigrum</span> consisted primarily of the sesquiterpene 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene and the monoterpenes hydrocarbons 
  <span class="italic">σ</span>-ocymene and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, at 26.2%, 5.8%, and 5.5%, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> exhibited greater activity on engorged females than
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span>, reaching a mortality of 100% at concentrations of 10%, on 16th day. The values of LC50 and LC90 of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> were 2.2% and 4,9%, respectively.
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> exhibited LC50 of 3.7% and LC90 of 14.8%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Components such as limonene and pinene have already been reported to possess acaricidal activity against ticks. Limonene, extracted from
  <span class="italic"> Lippia alba</span> (Verbenaceae) essential oils of two chemotypes, demonstrated toxic effect on
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> larvae [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. In another study, it was shown that limonene inhibited 91% of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B</span>.
  <span class="italic">) microplus</span> hatching eggs at concentration of 1.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Moreover, this chemical constituent has also exhibited insecticide potential and proved to be highly toxic to mosquito larvae of
  <span class="italic"> Aedes aegypti</span> (Diptera: Culicidae),
  <span class="italic"> Culex pipiens pallens</span> (Diptera: Culicidae), and
  <span class="italic"> Ochlerotatus togoi</span> (Diptera: Culicidae) [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>], for grain insect pests stored
  <span class="italic"> Rhyzopertha dominica</span> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and
  <span class="italic"> Tribolium castaneum</span> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>] and lice
  <span class="italic"> Pediculus humanus capitis</span> (Anoplura: Pediculidae) [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. Acaricide activity in
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> larvae has also been demonstrated with essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> Cunila incana</span> (Lamiaceae), rich in 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (27.5%) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (26.7%), reaching 100% mortality with concentration of 2.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/mL [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. This suggests the major constituents of the essential oil are acting in an additive or added effect manner, thus contributing equally to the observed toxic effects. However, the added effect action of other minor constituents cannot be disregarded. Some studies have shown that essential oils have higher efficiency than their isolated components [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chungsamarnyart and Jansawan in [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>] observed that the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> Citrus maxima</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</span> showed over 90% mortality of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> engorged females at a concentration of 1/5 in 24 hours. This concentration is higher than that found in our study. Already
  <span class="italic"> Citrus reticulata</span> oil demonstrated a similar profile to
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span>, reaching about 95% mortality within 24 h at a concentration of 1/10. Plants of the same genus could have the same class of substances and so present similar activity. However, such substances may vary in concentration according to seasonality, circadian rhythm, and development of the plant [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Citrus limonum</span> has already shown biological activity in several species of insects. The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> caused antifeedant activity in
  <span class="italic"> Spodoptera litura</span> larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and took the mortality
  <span class="italic"> Spodoptera littoralis</span> larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the test by contact [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]. Pavela in [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>] also demonstrated that essential oil of these specie showed fumigant and contact activity on the house fly
  <span class="italic"> Musca domestica</span> (Diptera: Muscidae).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduction in the number of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> eggs is probably due to female mortality in the first few days after treatment. However, it is possible that the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> has caused a reduction in female's fecundity, since exposure to sublethal concentrations of the oil significantly reduced the number of eggs. The same effect was observed with the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> Piper marginatum</span> used as fumigant against the mite
  <span class="italic"> Tetranychus urticae</span> (Acari: Tetranychidae), where the fecundity was drastically reduced. The 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene was one of the main compounds (16%) found in the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. marginatum</span>, as well as the oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> in the present work. This constituent was also evaluated against
  <span class="italic"> T. urticae</span> and this also reduced the females' fecundity in sublethal concentrations [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to chemical analysis, the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> majority has the sesquiterpene 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene (26.2%) and the monoterpenes hydrocarbons 
  <span class="italic">σ</span>-ocymene (5.8%) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (5.5%). However, Ferreira et al. in [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] analyzed the essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> and found as main components the sesquiterpene 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene (21.8%) and the monoterpenes limonene (19.8%) and 3-
  <span class="italic">σ</span>-carene (14.3%). The constituents of essential oils can vary with environmental conditions, such as climate, soil type and brightness. The biological properties of 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene have been confirmed in previous studies involving
  <span class="italic"> Leptinotarsa decemlineata </span>(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae),
  <span class="italic"> S. littoralis</span> [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>], larvae of
  <span class="italic"> A. aegypti</span> [
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>], and
  <span class="italic"> T. urticae</span> [
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>]. The compound 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene has been reported with insecticidal activity in larvae of
  <span class="italic"> C. pipiens</span> [
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>] and as a fumigant against the adult mushroom fly
  <span class="italic"> Lycoriella mali</span> (Diptera: Sciaridae) [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants of the genus
  <span class="italic"> Piper</span> have demonstrated toxic effect on
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus.</span> Ferraz et al. in [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>] showed that the essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> Piper mikanianum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Piper xylosteoides</span> were active against
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> larvae (LC50 of 2.3 and 6.2 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/mL, resp.).
  <span class="italic"> Piper tuberculatum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Piper aduncum</span> extracts were also highly effective against the larvae and engorged female tick
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>, 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>]. In addition, other studies have shown that the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> has insecticidal activity against mosquitoes
  <span class="italic"> A. aegypti</span>,
  <span class="italic"> A. stephensi</span> (Diptera: Culicidae), and
  <span class="italic"> C. quinquefasciatus</span> (Diptera: Culicidae) [
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ours results showed that the oil mixture has a high acaricidal activity on engorged females of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span>, reaching 100% mortality, at a concentration a little larger than that of the
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> essential oil (LC90 = 4,9%). However, the oils combination showed to be more effective in the inhibition of oviposition compared to the oil
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span>. Considering that
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil caused high mortality of females and
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> oil reduced fertility, it is possible that the essential oils have an additive effect when mixed in the same solution, exhibiting both effects against
  <span class="italic"> R (B.) microplus</span> tick females. Yessinou et al. in [
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>] recently showed that the mixture of
  <span class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum</span> (Myrtaceae) and
  <span class="italic"> Cymbopogon citratus</span> (Poaceae) essential oils was more effective in engorged females of
  <span class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</span> than when tested separately, confirming the action potential of essential oils when used simultaneously.
