 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the oil from
  <span class="italic"> Citrus limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Piper nigrum</span>, together with the relative retention index and percentage of the identified compounds, is listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. A total of 29 compounds representing 96.3% of the total oil were identified from

  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> showed a complex mixture of monoterpenes (90.3%) and sesquiterpenes (3.1%).
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> oil was composed mainly by the monoterpenes limonene (50.3%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (14.4%), and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-terpinene (11.7%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> essential oil, 42 compounds were identified, comprising 89% of the oil. The essential oil was characterized by the presence of sesquiterpenes (58.9%) and monoterpenes (26.3%). The sesquiterpene 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene was identified as the major compound, representing 26.2% of the oil, followed by the monoterpenes hydrocarbons
