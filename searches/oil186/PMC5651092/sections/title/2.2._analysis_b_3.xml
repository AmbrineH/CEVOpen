 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The crude essential oil was analyzed on a GC-MS QP2010 (SHIMADZU) gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization detection. The gas chromatographic (GC) conditions were as follows: injector temperature: 260°C; detector temperature: 290°C; carrier gas (Helium): flow rate 1 mL/min; and split injection with split ratio 1 : 40. Oven temperature was raised from 60°C to 290°C at a rate of 3°C/min. One microliter of each sample, dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1 : 100 mg/
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L), was injected on a RTX-5 column (i.d. = 0.25 mm, length 30 m, film thickness = 0.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m). Mass spectra (MS) were recorded 70 eV and scan rate of 1 scan/s. The retention indices were calculated by interpolation of retention times of the substances to the retention times of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C7-C40) (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO) analyzed in the same conditions (Van den Dool H. &amp; Kratz). The identification of substances was performed by comparison of their retention indices and mass spectra with those reported in literature [
