 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment was conducted in two phases. Essential oils were tested separately and after mixing were performed at equal concentrations, in 1 : 1 proportions (50%
  <span class="italic"> Citrus limonum </span>and 50%
  <span class="italic"> Piper nigrum</span>). The essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> C. limonum</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. nigrum</span> were dissolved in an aqueous solution with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) as an emulsifying agent, as described by Gazim et al. in [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Solutions were serially diluted in order to obtain the concentrations of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (v/v), obtaining a final volume of 5 mL. The emulsifying solution (2% DMSO) was used as the negative control. A control with water was also carried out. Amitraz (2 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/mL) and Deltamethrin (1 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/mL) in water were used as positive control. The test was repeated three times in duplicate.
