<p>In the AIT the efficacy of treatment against engorged females was also evaluated by measuring egg production. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. Ours results showed that
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> and the oil mixture have the best inhibition of oviposition rate, which is 100% in a dilution of 10%. However, at 5% the group with combined oils exhibited greater inhibition of oviposition with 94%, compared to 81.6% inhibition by individual
 <italic> C. limonum</italic>.
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> essential oil, at concentrations of 10%, 5%, and 2.5%, inhibited egg-laying by 96%, 83%, and 50%, respectively. Data were significantly different in relation to the control (DMSO 2% and water) group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The few eggs laid by the females treated with 5% of
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> essential oil have not hatched into larvae. This result showed that oviposition is also dose-dependent (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, analysis of variance 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for treatments confirmed the positive development of inhibition oviposition with increasing concentration. The mixture is effective against
 <italic> R. (B.) microplus</italic> engorged females since its effect is fast and is expressed at a low concentration on reducing the rate of lay. However, the essential oils did not interfere in the hatchability of the larvae.
