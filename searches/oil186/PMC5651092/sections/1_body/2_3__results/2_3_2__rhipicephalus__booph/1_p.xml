<p>Laboratory tests were carried out to determine the toxicity of the essential oils from
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> and
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> on engorged females of
 <italic> R</italic>.
 <italic> (B.) microplus</italic>. The results referents to mortality rate of engorged females after adult immersion test (AIT) are present in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. Essential oil from
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> exhibited 90% of mortality on engorged females in the highest concentration tested after 48â€‰h, reaching 100% at the end of the experiments (day 16). At concentration of 5%,
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> achieved approximately 80% mortality rate in the fourth day and getting the most for 90% mortality at the 12th day. The 2.5%
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> essential oil led to 50% mortality rate on day 16 after treatment (
