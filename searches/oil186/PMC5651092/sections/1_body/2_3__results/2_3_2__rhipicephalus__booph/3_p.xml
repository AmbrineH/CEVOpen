<p class="p">The toxic effect of the mixture of essential oils was also studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(c)</xref>). The mixture of
 <italic class="italic"> C. limonum</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. nigrum</italic> oil induced 100% death at a concentration of 10% at the end of treatments. The results of the groups treated with the combination of the oils, at all concentrations tested, were very similar to the results of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. limonum</italic> oil. These results demonstrate the dose-dependent character of
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</italic> mortality and there was a significant difference between all treatments when compared with control group.
