<p>The experiment was conducted in two phases. Essential oils were tested separately and after mixing were performed at equal concentrations, in 1 : 1 proportions (50%
 <italic> Citrus limonum </italic>and 50%
 <italic> Piper nigrum</italic>). The essential oils of
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> and
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> were dissolved in an aqueous solution with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) as an emulsifying agent, as described by Gazim et al. in [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Solutions were serially diluted in order to obtain the concentrations of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (v/v), obtaining a final volume of 5 mL. The emulsifying solution (2% DMSO) was used as the negative control. A control with water was also carried out. Amitraz (2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL) and Deltamethrin (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL) in water were used as positive control. The test was repeated three times in duplicate.
