<p>Chungsamarnyart and Jansawan in [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] observed that the essential oil of
 <italic> Citrus maxima</italic> and
 <italic> Citrus sinensis</italic> showed over 90% mortality of
 <italic> R. (B.) microplus</italic> engorged females at a concentration of 1/5 in 24 hours. This concentration is higher than that found in our study. Already
 <italic> Citrus reticulata</italic> oil demonstrated a similar profile to
 <italic> C. limonum</italic>, reaching about 95% mortality within 24â€‰h at a concentration of 1/10. Plants of the same genus could have the same class of substances and so present similar activity. However, such substances may vary in concentration according to seasonality, circadian rhythm, and development of the plant [
