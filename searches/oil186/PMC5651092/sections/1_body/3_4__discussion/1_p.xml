<p>The analysis of chemical composition of
 <italic> Citrus limonum</italic> essential oil by GC/MS showed as major compounds limonene (50.3%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (14.4%), and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (11.7%). This result agrees with that found by others groups in previous studies with species of genus
 <italic> Citrus</italic>, where the same chemical compounds can be found, although in different proportions [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The essential oil chemical compositions of
 <italic> Piper nigrum</italic> consisted primarily of the sesquiterpene 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and the monoterpenes hydrocarbons 
 <italic>σ</italic>-ocymene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, at 26.2%, 5.8%, and 5.5%, respectively.
