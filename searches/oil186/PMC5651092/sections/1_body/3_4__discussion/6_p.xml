<p>The reduction in the number of
 <italic> C. limonum</italic> eggs is probably due to female mortality in the first few days after treatment. However, it is possible that the essential oil of
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> has caused a reduction in female's fecundity, since exposure to sublethal concentrations of the oil significantly reduced the number of eggs. The same effect was observed with the essential oil of
 <italic> Piper marginatum</italic> used as fumigant against the mite
 <italic> Tetranychus urticae</italic> (Acari: Tetranychidae), where the fecundity was drastically reduced. The 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene was one of the main compounds (16%) found in the essential oil of
 <italic> P. marginatum</italic>, as well as the oil of
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> in the present work. This constituent was also evaluated against
 <italic> T. urticae</italic> and this also reduced the females' fecundity in sublethal concentrations [
