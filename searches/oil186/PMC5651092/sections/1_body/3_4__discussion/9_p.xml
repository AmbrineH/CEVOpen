<p class="p">Ours results showed that the oil mixture has a high acaricidal activity on engorged females of
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</italic>, reaching 100% mortality, at a concentration a little larger than that of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. limonum</italic> essential oil (LC90 = 4,9%). However, the oils combination showed to be more effective in the inhibition of oviposition compared to the oil
 <italic class="italic"> C. limonum</italic>. Considering that
 <italic class="italic"> C. limonum</italic> oil caused high mortality of females and
 <italic class="italic"> P. nigrum</italic> oil reduced fertility, it is possible that the essential oils have an additive effect when mixed in the same solution, exhibiting both effects against
 <italic class="italic"> R (B.) microplus</italic> tick females. Yessinou et al. in [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] recently showed that the mixture of
 <italic class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (Myrtaceae) and
 <italic class="italic"> Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (Poaceae) essential oils was more effective in engorged females of
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</italic> than when tested separately, confirming the action potential of essential oils when used simultaneously.
