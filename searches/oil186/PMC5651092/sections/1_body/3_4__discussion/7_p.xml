<p>According to chemical analysis, the essential oil of
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> majority has the sesquiterpene 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (26.2%) and the monoterpenes hydrocarbons 
 <italic>σ</italic>-ocymene (5.8%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (5.5%). However, Ferreira et al. in [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] analyzed the essential oil from
 <italic> P. nigrum</italic> and found as main components the sesquiterpene 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (21.8%) and the monoterpenes limonene (19.8%) and 3-
 <italic>σ</italic>-carene (14.3%). The constituents of essential oils can vary with environmental conditions, such as climate, soil type and brightness. The biological properties of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene have been confirmed in previous studies involving
 <italic> Leptinotarsa decemlineata </italic>(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae),
 <italic> S. littoralis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], larvae of
 <italic> A. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and
 <italic> T. urticae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The compound 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene has been reported with insecticidal activity in larvae of
 <italic> C. pipiens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and as a fumigant against the adult mushroom fly
 <italic> Lycoriella mali</italic> (Diptera: Sciaridae) [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
