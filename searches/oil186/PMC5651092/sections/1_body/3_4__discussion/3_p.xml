<p>Components such as limonene and pinene have already been reported to possess acaricidal activity against ticks. Limonene, extracted from
 <italic> Lippia alba</italic> (Verbenaceae) essential oils of two chemotypes, demonstrated toxic effect on
 <italic> R. (B.) microplus</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In another study, it was shown that limonene inhibited 91% of
 <italic> R. (B</italic>.
 <italic>) microplus</italic> hatching eggs at concentration of 1.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, this chemical constituent has also exhibited insecticide potential and proved to be highly toxic to mosquito larvae of
 <italic> Aedes aegypti</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae),
 <italic> Culex pipiens pallens</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae), and
 <italic> Ochlerotatus togoi</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], for grain insect pests stored
 <italic> Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and
 <italic> Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and lice
 <italic> Pediculus humanus capitis</italic> (Anoplura: Pediculidae) [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Acaricide activity in
 <italic> R. (B.) microplus</italic> larvae has also been demonstrated with essential oil of
 <italic> Cunila incana</italic> (Lamiaceae), rich in 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (27.5%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (26.7%), reaching 100% mortality with concentration of 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This suggests the major constituents of the essential oil are acting in an additive or added effect manner, thus contributing equally to the observed toxic effects. However, the added effect action of other minor constituents cannot be disregarded. Some studies have shown that essential oils have higher efficiency than their isolated components [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
