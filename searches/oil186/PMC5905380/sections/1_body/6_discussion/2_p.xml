<p>The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for individual oils and their combinations against larvae of the two mosquito species ranged from 2.7 ppm for garlic to 13.5 ppm for asafoetida. These values are much lower than those of many essential oils that have been examined for larvicidal activity against mosquitoes (

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Koliopoulos et al. 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Dias and Moraes 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Benelli et al. 2017</xref>). Garlic was the more toxic of the two essential oils and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> larvae were more susceptible to both oils compared to 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. Differential sensitivity of mosquito species to essential oils is a common observation (

 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Govindarajan et al. 2016</xref>). The high toxicity of garlic essential oil against mosquito larvae is well documented (

 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kimbaris et al. 2009</xref>). In fact, previous studies have shown that garlic essential oil can be an effective pesticide against mosquitoes when microencapsulated and used in an attractive toxic sugar baits system (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Junnila et al. 2015</xref>). Asafoetida is used as a flavoring agent and as a traditional medicine for many diseases in many parts of the world (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mahendra and Bisht 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Divya et al. 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Amalraj and Gopi 2017</xref>). Asafoetida leaf extracts are also effective against a variety of cotton pests (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Noonari et al. 2016</xref>) and moderately (acetone extracts LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 65.02 ppm; petroleum ether extracts LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.61 ppm) toxic to 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Harve and Kamath 2004</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that asafoetida essential oil is more potent to mosquito larvae than acetone and petroleum ether leaf extracts of the same plant and could be developed as a novel mosquito larvicide.
