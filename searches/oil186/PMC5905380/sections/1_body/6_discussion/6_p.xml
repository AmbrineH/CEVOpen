<p>In conclusion, we investigated the individual and combined toxicity of garlic and asafoetida essential oils. We found that both essential oils possess ovicidal and larvicidal properties, suggesting that the application of these oils could be integrated with other vector control methods. However, the two essential oils had antagonist effects against mosquito larvae when combined, suggesting their potential to undermine vector control programs if used jointly. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of all components in the overall toxicity of each essential oil. This knowledge may facilitate discovery of components that work in synergy which could provide leads for development of cheap, effective, and eco-friendly botanicals for mosquito control.</p>
