<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that allyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide are the primary constituents responsible for the larvicidal activity of garlic essential oil with the former being more toxic than the later (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kimbaris et al. 2009</xref>). The two compounds were the most abundant constituents in our garlic essential oil accounting for 80.2% (ally disulfide = 49.13%; diallyl trisulfide = 31.08%) of the total oil. These values are much higher than the 7.2% (allyl disulfide) and 16.3% (diallyl trisulfide) reported by

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>s were much lower than those reported in their study. Allyl disulfide (7.38%) and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%) occurred as minor components in asafoetida essential oil, and were two of only three constituents that occurred in both essential oils. Thus, despite their low abundance, both compounds are likely among the minor components influencing the toxicity of asafoetida essential oil. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the major constituents towards the overall toxicity of asafoetida essential oil and how these constituents may interact with allyl disulfide and other minor constituents.
