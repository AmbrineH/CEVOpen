<p>Some essential oils contain bioactive compounds that may interact synergistically or antagonistically against mosquitoes when combined (

The discovery of essential oil combinations that interact synergistically may provide critical leads for the development of cheap, effective, and safe alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Nevertheless, we found that garlic and asafoetida essential oils interacted antagonistically against

 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> and would thus be more effective when used individually than in combination. These findings indicate that combining two highly toxic essential oils may not necessary yield optimal results, and knowledge-guided decision-making processes should be used to select essential oil combinations that do not undermine vector control programs (
