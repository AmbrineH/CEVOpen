<p class="p">We used field populations of two WNV vectors, 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic>, to examine the ovicidal potential of 
 <italic class="italic">F. asafoetida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. sativum</italic> (garlic) essential oils as well as their individual and combined toxicity against larvae of the two mosquito species. We also characterized the chemical composition of the two essential oils and examined the ovicidal and larvicidal activity of ally disulfide, one of the major and minor components of garlic and asafoetida essential oils, respectively. Both essential oils were quite effective at suppressing egg hatch and killing the larvae, demonstrating their potential application as mosquito ovicides and larvicides. Although garlic extracts and/or essential oil have been shown to possess ovicidal and larvicidal activities against a wide range of insects including mosquitoes (
