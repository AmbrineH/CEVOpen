<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined effects of garlic (
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.) and asafoetida (
 <italic>Ferula asafoetida</italic> L.) essential oils against larvae of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex restuans</italic>, the primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in northeastern United States. The ovicidal potential of the two essential oils against the two mosquito species was also assessed. Both mosquito species occur in large numbers in urban ecosystems where they colonize and develop in thousands of storm water catch basins that are intended for storm water management (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Harbison et al. 2017</xref>). Although the larvicidal activity of garlic essential oil against mosquitoes has been documented before, it remains unknown how this oil may interact with other essential oils. In addition, the biological activity of asafoetida essential oil against mosquitoes remains poorly understood. The results of our study show that essential oils of these plants show promise for development as ovicides and larvicides.
