<p>Garlic essential oil was more toxic than asafoetida essential oil with 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> larvae being more sensitive to both oils compared to 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> larvae (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for garlic and asafoetida essential oils against 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> larvae were 7.5 and 13.5 ppm, respectively, while the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> larvae were 2.7 ppm for garlic essential oil and 10.1 ppm for asafoetida essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Allyl disulfide was also highly toxic to larvae of both mosquito species (LC
 <sub>50</sub>, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> = 12.5 ppm, 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> = 9.4 ppm), suggesting its important contribution to overall toxicity of both oils. The cotoxicity coefficient values were 80.3% for 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 46.9% for 
 <italic>Cx. Restuans</italic>, suggesting that the two oils interacted antagonistically.
