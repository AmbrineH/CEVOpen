<p>Out of 52 
 <italic>Culex</italic> egg rafts that were exposed to garlic essential oil, 38 (73.1%) did not hatch while the remaining 14 (26.9%) hatched but the larvae died as first instars (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For the 52 egg rafts that were exposed to asafoetida essential oil, 29 (55.8%) did not hatch, 19 (36.5%) hatched but the larvae died as first instars, and 4 (7.7%) hatched and the larvae survived (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Allyl disulfide had similar effects suggesting it was one of the principle compounds responsible for inhibiting egg hatch. Of the 52 egg rafts that were exposed to allyl disulfide, 50 (96.2%) did not hatch and 2 (3.8%) hatched but the larvae died as first instars.
