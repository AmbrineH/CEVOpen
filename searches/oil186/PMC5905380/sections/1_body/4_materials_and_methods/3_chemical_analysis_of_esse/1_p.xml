<p>Ten microliters of either oil was diluted in 4.990 ml of hexane and vortexed. Ten microliters of this solution were again mixed with 990 µl of hexane and vortexed: 1 µl samples of this mixture were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific ISQ QD mass selective detector interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Inlet temperatures were maintained at 200°C and samples were injected in splitless mode. A 30-m DB-5 capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 µm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was employed. Helium, the carrier gas, was set at constant pressure (6 psi) and injector temperature was set at 280°C. Oven temperature was increased from 50 to 280°C at 10°C/min. The NIST mass spectral library on the MS data system was used for identification.</p>
