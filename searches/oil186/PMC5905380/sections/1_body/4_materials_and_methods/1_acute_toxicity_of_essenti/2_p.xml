<p class="p">Twenty late third instar larvae of either 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic> were added into 120 ml of DI water held in 400-ml tripour beakers. Treatments included garlic essential oil, asafoetida essential oil purchased from New Directions Aromatics (Mississauga, Ontario Canada), a combination of the two essential oils, and allyl disulfide (≥80%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which was one of the major constituents of garlic essential oil and a minor constituent of asafoetida essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The two essential oils were extracted through steam distillation of bulbs (garlic) and stem and roots (asafoetida) originating from India. Each treatment was tested at 10 concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 ppm. A control group received 20 µl of absolute ethanol without oil treatment. The stock solution for each essential oil (100,000 ppm) was prepared by mixing 900 µl of absolute ethanol with 100 µl of the target essential oil. The stock solution for oil combination treatment was prepared by mixing 50 µl garlic essential oil with 50 µl of asafoetida essential oil and 900 µl of absolute ethanol. The experiment was replicated three times for a total of 246 containers. The containers were held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle and the total number of larvae surviving 24 h post-treatment were counted and recorded.
