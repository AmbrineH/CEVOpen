<p class="p">The hatch rate of larvae from 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> egg rafts was examined following exposure to allyl disulfide, garlic oil, or asafoetida oil at concentrations that resulted in 50% larval mortality. These concentrations were 5, 12, and 11 ppm, respectively, for garlic, asafoetida, and allyl disulfide. These values were derived by summing the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for both mosquito species and dividing the resulting value by two (i.e., mean LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for the two mosquito species). The stock solutions (100,000 ppm) were prepared as described above and 200 ml of 5, 12, and 11 ppm solutions of garlic oil, asafoetida oil, and allyl disulfide were prepared in 500-ml glass bottles. The glass bottles were vigorously shaken to homogenize the content and 3 ml of respective treatment were dispensed in 12-well cell culture plates. A single 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> egg raft was transferred onto each well and held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle. A control treatment received 24 Âµl of ethanol (equivalent to the highest volume of oil used) instead of oil. Fifty-two egg rafts were evaluated for each treatment. The eggs were monitored every day for 7 days and the number of eggs that hatched in each treatment counted and recorded.
