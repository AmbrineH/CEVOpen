<p class="p">In many parts of the world, botanical insecticides were commonly used to control insects of agricultural and public health significance from ancient times (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Isman 2006</xref>) until the practice was pushed into the periphery in the mid-1930s and 1950s when the major classes of synthetic insecticides were discovered. However, it is now being promoted as an attractive alternative to synthetic insecticides. Among plant-derived compounds, essential oils have shown great potential for vector control because they are relatively easy to obtain, have low mammalian toxicity, degrade quickly in soil and water (

Unfortunately, the commercial market for these oils has lagged behind due to a myriad of factors, among them their inferior performance relative to synthetic insecticides and availability of other products with low environmental impact such as

 <italic class="italic">Lysinibacillus sphaericus</italic>. These microbe-based products have a proven efficacy in mosquito control but in the long term, mosquitoes can develop resistance to them (
