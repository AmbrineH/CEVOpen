<p class="p">Although several hundreds of essential oils are commercially available, a substantial number of them have not been examined for their biological activity against mosquitoes. In addition, most studies focus on biological activity of individual oils. However, a growing number of studies have shown that certain essential oils can interact synergistically against the target insect populations including mosquitoes (

These studies suggest that in-depth understanding of the combined toxicity of essential oils may propel discovery of essential oils that may work in synergy against mosquitoes and could thus be developed for application in integrated vector management.
