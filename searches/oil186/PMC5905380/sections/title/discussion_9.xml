 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used field populations of two WNV vectors, 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span>, to examine the ovicidal potential of 
  <span class="italic">F. asafoetida</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. sativum</span> (garlic) essential oils as well as their individual and combined toxicity against larvae of the two mosquito species. We also characterized the chemical composition of the two essential oils and examined the ovicidal and larvicidal activity of ally disulfide, one of the major and minor components of garlic and asafoetida essential oils, respectively. Both essential oils were quite effective at suppressing egg hatch and killing the larvae, demonstrating their potential application as mosquito ovicides and larvicides. Although garlic extracts and/or essential oil have been shown to possess ovicidal and larvicidal activities against a wide range of insects including mosquitoes (

  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">Sangha et al. 2017</a>), this is the first report of the biological activity of asafoetida and a mixture of the two essential oils against mosquitoes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LC
  <sub>50</sub> values for individual oils and their combinations against larvae of the two mosquito species ranged from 2.7 ppm for garlic to 13.5 ppm for asafoetida. These values are much lower than those of many essential oils that have been examined for larvicidal activity against mosquitoes (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">Amer and Mehlhorn 2006a</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">Koliopoulos et al. 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">Dias and Moraes 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">Benelli et al. 2017</a>). Garlic was the more toxic of the two essential oils and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> larvae were more susceptible to both oils compared to 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span>. Differential sensitivity of mosquito species to essential oils is a common observation (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">Amer and Mehlhorn 2006a</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">Fayemiwo et al. 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Govindarajan et al. 2016</a>). The high toxicity of garlic essential oil against mosquito larvae is well documented (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">Amonkar and Reeves 1970</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Kimbaris et al. 2009</a>). In fact, previous studies have shown that garlic essential oil can be an effective pesticide against mosquitoes when microencapsulated and used in an attractive toxic sugar baits system (
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">Junnila et al. 2015</a>). Asafoetida is used as a flavoring agent and as a traditional medicine for many diseases in many parts of the world (
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">Mahendra and Bisht 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">Divya et al. 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Amalraj and Gopi 2017</a>). Asafoetida leaf extracts are also effective against a variety of cotton pests (
  <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">Noonari et al. 2016</a>) and moderately (acetone extracts LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 65.02 ppm; petroleum ether extracts LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 62.61 ppm) toxic to 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> larvae (
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Harve and Kamath 2004</a>). Thus, our results demonstrate that asafoetida essential oil is more potent to mosquito larvae than acetone and petroleum ether leaf extracts of the same plant and could be developed as a novel mosquito larvicide.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that allyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide are the primary constituents responsible for the larvicidal activity of garlic essential oil with the former being more toxic than the later (
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Kimbaris et al. 2009</a>). The two compounds were the most abundant constituents in our garlic essential oil accounting for 80.2% (ally disulfide = 49.13%; diallyl trisulfide = 31.08%) of the total oil. These values are much higher than the 7.2% (allyl disulfide) and 16.3% (diallyl trisulfide) reported by 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Kimbaris et al. (2009)</a> and may explain why our LC
  <sub>50</sub>s were much lower than those reported in their study. Allyl disulfide (7.38%) and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%) occurred as minor components in asafoetida essential oil, and were two of only three constituents that occurred in both essential oils. Thus, despite their low abundance, both compounds are likely among the minor components influencing the toxicity of asafoetida essential oil. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the major constituents towards the overall toxicity of asafoetida essential oil and how these constituents may interact with allyl disulfide and other minor constituents.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some essential oils contain bioactive compounds that may interact synergistically or antagonistically against mosquitoes when combined (
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">Intirach et al. 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">Pavela 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">Muturi et al. 2017</a>). The discovery of essential oil combinations that interact synergistically may provide critical leads for the development of cheap, effective, and safe alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Nevertheless, we found that garlic and asafoetida essential oils interacted antagonistically against 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> and would thus be more effective when used individually than in combination. These findings indicate that combining two highly toxic essential oils may not necessary yield optimal results, and knowledge-guided decision-making processes should be used to select essential oil combinations that do not undermine vector control programs (
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">Muturi et al. 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When exposure to oil concentrations that killed 50% of the larvae (LC
  <sub>50</sub>), the majority of eggs rafts from both garlic (73.1%) and asafoetida (55.8%) essential oil treatments did not hatch. In addition, larvae from 19 of the 23 egg rafts that hatched in asafoetida essential oil treatments and all the 14 egg rafts that hatched in garlic essential oil treatments died as first instars. Similar bioassays using allyl disulfide revealed its significant role towards inhibition of egg hatch: 96.2% of eggs exposed to this compound failed to hatch and larvae from the two egg rafts that hatched died as first instars. Diallyl trisulfide which was also a major component of garlic essential oil is also known to suppress egg hatch in some beetle species and may also have contributed to egg hatch inhibition by garlic essential oil (
  <a rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0021">Huang et al. 2000</a>). Because allyl disulfide (7.38%) and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%) were minor components of asafoetida essential oil, our results suggest that either only small amounts of allyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide are required to inhibit egg hatch or that other components of asafoetida essential oil also contribute to egg hatch inhibition. Further studies are needed to determine the role of various components of asafoetida essential oil towards inhibition of egg hatch. The ovicidal properties of garlic essential oils have been demonstrated in diamondback moth 
  <span class="italic">Plutella xylostella</span> (L.) (
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">Sangha et al. 2017</a>) and garlic extracts are also known to exhibit ovicidal effects against red spider mite, 
  <span class="italic">Oligonychus coffeae</span> (Nietner) (
  <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">Roobakkumar et al. 2010</a>) and mosquitoes (
  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">Jarial 2001</a>). In contrast, this is the first report of ovicidal effects of asafoetida essential oil against mosquitoes. We did not examine the mechanism(s) underlying the ovicidal properties of the two essential oils but previous studies suggest that garlic extracts inhibit egg hatch by interfering with the ability of mosquito embryos to break the egg shells (
  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">Jarial 2001</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we investigated the individual and combined toxicity of garlic and asafoetida essential oils. We found that both essential oils possess ovicidal and larvicidal properties, suggesting that the application of these oils could be integrated with other vector control methods. However, the two essential oils had antagonist effects against mosquito larvae when combined, suggesting their potential to undermine vector control programs if used jointly. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of all components in the overall toxicity of each essential oil. This knowledge may facilitate discovery of components that work in synergy which could provide leads for development of cheap, effective, and eco-friendly botanicals for mosquito control.</p>
