  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bioassays were conducted using field-collected samples of 
   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> from Peoria, IL. 
   <span class="italic">Culex</span> egg rafts were collected using ovitraps baited with grass infusion prepared by fermenting approximately 500 g of fresh grass clippings in 160 liters of tap water for 5 d (
   <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">Reiter 1986</a>). Egg rafts from multiple locations were hatched individually in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water held in tripour beakers and supplemented with 0.1 g of Tetramin fish food (Spectrum Brands Inc., Blacksburg, VA). The containers were maintained at 26°C, 70% relative humidity, and 10:14 light: dark cycle. At first instar stage, a single larva from each container was identified either as 
   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> based on the presence of a clear scale anterior to the sclerotized egg-breaker which is lacking in 
   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> but present in 
   <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> (
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Crabtree et al. 1995</a>). The species identity was further confirmed at the third instar stage based on the arrangement and morphology of setae on the siphon. For each species, late third instar larvae from all locations were pooled for use in bioassays.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty late third instar larvae of either 
   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span> were added into 120 ml of DI water held in 400-ml tripour beakers. Treatments included garlic essential oil, asafoetida essential oil purchased from New Directions Aromatics (Mississauga, Ontario Canada), a combination of the two essential oils, and allyl disulfide (≥80%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which was one of the major constituents of garlic essential oil and a minor constituent of asafoetida essential oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The two essential oils were extracted through steam distillation of bulbs (garlic) and stem and roots (asafoetida) originating from India. Each treatment was tested at 10 concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 ppm. A control group received 20 µl of absolute ethanol without oil treatment. The stock solution for each essential oil (100,000 ppm) was prepared by mixing 900 µl of absolute ethanol with 100 µl of the target essential oil. The stock solution for oil combination treatment was prepared by mixing 50 µl garlic essential oil with 50 µl of asafoetida essential oil and 900 µl of absolute ethanol. The experiment was replicated three times for a total of 246 containers. The containers were held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle and the total number of larvae surviving 24 h post-treatment were counted and recorded.

   <span class="italic">Culex</span> egg rafts was examined following exposure to allyl disulfide, garlic oil, or asafoetida oil at concentrations that resulted in 50% larval mortality. These concentrations were 5, 12, and 11 ppm, respectively, for garlic, asafoetida, and allyl disulfide. These values were derived by summing the LC
   <sub>50</sub> for both mosquito species and dividing the resulting value by two (i.e., mean LC
   <sub>50</sub> for the two mosquito species). The stock solutions (100,000 ppm) were prepared as described above and 200 ml of 5, 12, and 11 ppm solutions of garlic oil, asafoetida oil, and allyl disulfide were prepared in 500-ml glass bottles. The glass bottles were vigorously shaken to homogenize the content and 3 ml of respective treatment were dispensed in 12-well cell culture plates. A single 
   <span class="italic">Culex</span> egg raft was transferred onto each well and held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle. A control treatment received 24 µl of ethanol (equivalent to the highest volume of oil used) instead of oil. Fifty-two egg rafts were evaluated for each treatment. The eggs were monitored every day for 7 days and the number of eggs that hatched in each treatment counted and recorded.

Ten microliters of this solution were again mixed with 990 µl of hexane and vortexed: 1 µl samples of this mixture were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific ISQ QD mass selective detector interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Inlet temperatures were maintained at 200°C and samples were injected in splitless mode. A 30-m DB-5 capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 µm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was employed. Helium, the carrier gas, was set at constant pressure (6 psi) and injector temperature was set at 280°C. Oven temperature was increased from 50 to 280°C at 10°C/min. The NIST mass spectral library on the MS data system was used for identification.</p>
