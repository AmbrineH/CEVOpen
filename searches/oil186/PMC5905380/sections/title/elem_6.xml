  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical Composition of Garlic and Asafoetida Essential Oils</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed the presence of 10 compounds in garlic essential oil and 12 compounds in asafoetida essential oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The five most abundant compounds obtained in garlic essential oil were allyl disulfide (49.13%), diallyl trisulfide (31.08%), diallyl tetrasulfide (11.01%), allyl methyl trisulfide (4.67%), and allyl methyl disulfide (1.18%). For asafoetida essential oil, the five most abundant compounds were (E)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (30.03%), (Z)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (24.32%), disulfide, methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl (21.87), allyl disulfide (7.38%), and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%). Only three compounds, allyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and 4-Methyl-1,2,3-trithiolane, occurred in both oils.

   <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). Allyl disulfide had similar effects suggesting it was one of the principle compounds responsible for inhibiting egg hatch. Of the 52 egg rafts that were exposed to allyl disulfide, 50 (96.2%) did not hatch and 2 (3.8%) hatched but the larvae died as first instars.
