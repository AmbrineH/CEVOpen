 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed the presence of 10 compounds in garlic essential oil and 12 compounds in asafoetida essential oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The five most abundant compounds obtained in garlic essential oil were allyl disulfide (49.13%), diallyl trisulfide (31.08%), diallyl tetrasulfide (11.01%), allyl methyl trisulfide (4.67%), and allyl methyl disulfide (1.18%). For asafoetida essential oil, the five most abundant compounds were (E)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (30.03%), (Z)-sec-butyl propenyl disulfide (24.32%), disulfide, methyl 1-(methylthio)propyl (21.87), allyl disulfide (7.38%), and diallyl trisulfide (4.55%). Only three compounds, allyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and 4-Methyl-1,2,3-trithiolane, occurred in both oils.
