 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although viruses, bacteria or fungi are commonly known to be pathogenic to animals and humans, the algae of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca</span> may also present a threat. Potentially pathogenic species of this type are 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca wickerhamii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca zopfii</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Prototheca zopfii</span> is mainly responsible for infection in animals, and the most common protothecosis is mastitis. The disease causes serious economic losses. Infection results in reduced production and poorer quality of milk, and the infected cows are usually slaughtered. The pathogen is transmitted through sick animals and the environment: drinking water, slurry, feces, the walls and floors in stalls, equipment and cups of milk [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. A number of factors are known to promote infection, including age of cows, number of episodes, past inflammation and treatment method. The cows are more vulnerable in the early lactation stage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Treating 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca mastitis</span> is difficult, and the applied therapy is beset by resistance, which may be caused by the presence of sporopollenin in the algal cell wall [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents are ineffective, despite demonstrating biological activity in vitro. Despite many attempts, the use of intramammary administration of levamisole and tetramisole has failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the increasing resistance of microbial strains, including pathogenic algae, to synthetic drugs and the limited use of chemotherapeutics, increasing numbers of anti-algae are being sought in nature. Fortunately, plants are sources of many new and potentially effective substances [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] that may be employed in the treatment of protothecosis. The healing and antimicrobial properties of essential oils derived from plants have been known for centuries. Various studies have examined the effects of essential oil application against 
  <span class="italic">Prototheca</span> strains [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of essential oils obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Origanum vulgare</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Origanum majerana</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Mentha</span> × 
  <span class="italic">piperita</span> L. and 
  <span class="italic">Allium ursinum</span> L. against 
  <span class="italic">P. zopfii</span> strains that cause inflammation of the udder (mastitis) in cows. The study used thyme, marjoram, mint [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], oregano [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] and bear garlic oils [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], which are believed to have antifungal and anti-algae effects. Peppermint oil is recommended for mastitis therapy. Japanese mint oil is a particularly effective remedy for inflammation due to its higher menthol content [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
