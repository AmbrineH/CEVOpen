<p id="Par18">The 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> strains isolated from cow milk samples were found to be highly resistant to most of the recommended chemotherapeutics for fungal cells (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). None of the antifungal agents influenced strain 71/IV. All other 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> strains were susceptible to nystatin. Three of the ten tested strains acted only this one antibiotic. Of these two strains, one was sensitive to nystatin and miconazole (166/IV), and the other to nystatin and ketoconazole (764/IV). Three of the chemotherapeutic agents tested were susceptible strains: 801/IV, 44/IV and 48/IV. Strain 49/IV was the least sensitive—four showed sensitivity to chemotherapeutics (nystatin, ketoconazole, miconazole and econazole). All tested strains were resistant to fluconazole and flucytosine.
