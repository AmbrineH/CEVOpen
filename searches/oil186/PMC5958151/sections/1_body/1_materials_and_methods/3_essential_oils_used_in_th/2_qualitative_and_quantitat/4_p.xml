<p id="Par12">A qualitative analysis was performed on the MS spectra of the samples; the results were compared with those of the NIST library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and with data available in the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The identity of the compounds was confirmed by their retention indices, taken from the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and our own data. The quantity composition of the volatile oil was determined by GC(FID), assuming that a total area percents of all the particular oil constituted 100%. All determinations were performed in triplicate and averaged.
