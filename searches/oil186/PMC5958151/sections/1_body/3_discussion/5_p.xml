<p id="Par25">The 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> strains showed low sensitivity to routine chemotherapeutics. All were 100% resistant to fluconazole and flucytosine and 90% resistant to clotrimazole, econazole and amphotericin B. The most sensitive were nystatin (90% of strains showed sensitivity) and ketoconazole (50% of strains were sensitive). Similar results were obtained by Wawron et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] who conducted a study on 27 strains of 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic>. The strains of algae showed 100% resistance against clotrimazole, fluconazole, econazole and flucytosine and nearly 93% for miconazole. The most effective agents were nystatin (88.9% of strains), ketoconazole (51.9% of strains) and amphotericin B (48.1%). It is interesting that while only one strain was found to be susceptible to amphotericin B (801/IV) in the present study, Wawron et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] report that almost half of the tested strains were susceptible. Grzesiak et al. found that while eight tested strains of 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> were susceptible to nystatin, they were 100% resistant to amphotericin B, clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, econazole, fluorocytosine, amoxicillin, piperacillin and ceftazidime. Some strains were also resistant to gentamicin and tetracycline.
