<p id="Par24" class="p">Grzesiak et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>] tested eight essential oils: cinnamon (
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylandicum</italic>), geranium (
 <italic class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</italic>), clove (
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic>), thyme (
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic>), lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>), basil (
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic>), rosemary (
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) and clary sage (
 <italic class="italic">Salvia sclarea</italic>). The activity of these oils was tested against eight strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. zopfii</italic> isolated from milk samples taken from cows suffering from mastitis using the broth microdilution method. All studied oils were effective against algal strains, of which cinnamon, clove and thyme had the greatest effectiveness (MIC: 0.6–1 μl/ml). While the MIC values of thyme oil were found to range from 0.25 to 1 μl/ml in the present study, they were found to range from 0.6 to 1 μl/ml by Grzesiak et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Although these are similar values, slight discrepancies may result from differences in the composition of the oil.
