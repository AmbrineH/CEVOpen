<p id="Par24">Grzesiak et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] tested eight essential oils: cinnamon (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylandicum</italic>), geranium (
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic>), clove (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>), thyme (
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>), lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>), basil (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>), rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) and clary sage (
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic>). The activity of these oils was tested against eight strains of 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> isolated from milk samples taken from cows suffering from mastitis using the broth microdilution method. All studied oils were effective against algal strains, of which cinnamon, clove and thyme had the greatest effectiveness (MIC: 0.6–1 μl/ml). While the MIC values of thyme oil were found to range from 0.25 to 1 μl/ml in the present study, they were found to range from 0.6 to 1 μl/ml by Grzesiak et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although these are similar values, slight discrepancies may result from differences in the composition of the oil.
