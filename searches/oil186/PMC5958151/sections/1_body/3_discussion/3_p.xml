<p id="Par23">The in vitro effectiveness of essential oils against 
 <italic>Prototheca</italic> algae strains has also been confirmed by other researchers. Bouari (Cuc) et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] tested the effects of oils from 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> on 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic>. The strains of 
 <italic>P. zopfii</italic> were derived from milk samples from mastitis cows and cow excrement. The MIC values for the essential oils (0.25–1 μl/ml) are the same as those for the marjoram, thyme and oregano oils. Fir oil is characterized by lower anti-algae activity (MIC: 1–4 μl/ml) than those tested in the present study.
