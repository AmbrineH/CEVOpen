 <italic>Prototheca zopfii</italic> is mainly responsible for infection in animals, and the most common protothecosis is mastitis. The disease causes serious economic losses. Infection results in reduced production and poorer quality of milk, and the infected cows are usually slaughtered. The pathogen is transmitted through sick animals and the environment: drinking water, slurry, feces, the walls and floors in stalls, equipment and cups of milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A number of factors are known to promote infection, including age of cows, number of episodes, past inflammation and treatment method. The cows are more vulnerable in the early lactation stage [

 <italic>Prototheca mastitis</italic> is difficult, and the applied therapy is beset by resistance, which may be caused by the presence of sporopollenin in the algal cell wall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents are ineffective, despite demonstrating biological activity in vitro. Despite many attempts, the use of intramammary administration of levamisole and tetramisole has failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy [
