 <p id="Par1">The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of essential oils obtained from 
  <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L., 
  <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., 
  <italic>Origanum majerana</italic> L., 
  <italic>Mentha</italic> × 
  <italic>piperita</italic> L. and 
  <italic>Allium ursinum</italic> L. against 
  <italic>Prototheca zopfii</italic> strains that cause inflammation of the udder (mastitis) in cows. The study was conducted on ten strains derived from milk samples. The microdilution method was used to determine the sensitivity of 
  <italic>P. zopfii</italic> strains to the studied essential oils, and the disk diffusion method was used to determine the sensitivity to antifungal chemotherapeutics. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. All strains of algae were sensitive to the essential oils marjoram, thyme and oregano and resistant to mint and garlic oils. MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 1 μl/ml. Marjoram oil demonstrated the greatest activity, and oregano oil the weakest. Among the antifungal agents tested, 90% of strains showed sensitivity to nystatin. One of the tested strains (71/IV) was resistant to all investigated antifungal agents. The tested essential oils are known to have anti-algae activity and can be used as natural agents for prophylaxis in animals, particularly in mastitis-affected cows.
