<p>Trans-cinnamaldehyde, an organic compound that gives cinnamon its flavor and odor is responsible for many biological activities observed with cinnamon. It has been reported that cinnamaldehyde constitutes 65 to 80% of cinnamon bark (

 <italic>O-</italic> cinnamaldehyde diethyl acetal (87.32%, 3.31%, and 2.34%, respectively). Anti-inflammatory effect of turmerone has been reported to be via microglia activation inhibition (

Trans-cinnamaldehyde represented neuroprotective activity in a model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in rats via suppressing protein levels of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway (

In an investigation by Sahib, antidiabetic activity of cinnamon in poorly controlled diabetic patients was associated with increased serum levels of antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and decreased levels of malondialdehyde as a marker of lipid peroxidation in the cinnamon treated group (
