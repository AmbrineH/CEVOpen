<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the total squares crossed by animals treated with cinnamon or fluoxetine/ desipramine was not different from those receiving the vehicle during a 5-min observation period in the open field test. There was a reduction in the number of squares crossed by diazepam-treated animals, although it did not reach a significant difference with the control animals.
