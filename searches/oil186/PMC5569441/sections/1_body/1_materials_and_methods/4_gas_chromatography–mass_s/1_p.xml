<p>The oil analysis was carried on a GC7890N AGILENT &amp; MS 5975 (EI mass detector), in the following conditions: chromatography was achieved using a (5%-phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness) with a helium carrier gas, adjusted to a linear velocity of 1 ml/min. the column was with a 50:1 split ratio. The injector temperature was regulated at 260 °C. also, The column oven temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 4 min and programmed to 100 °C at 3 °C/min for 2 min and then to 250 °C at 6 °C/min for 6 min; electron energy at 70 eV. Positive ions were observed while the analyzer was scanned from mass 50 to 550. The Kovats indices were determined for all volatile constituents using a mixture of homologous series of n-alkanes C9–C23 on HP-5MS column. The components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the NIST 5 mass spectra library. The Kovats indices were calculated using by following formula (
