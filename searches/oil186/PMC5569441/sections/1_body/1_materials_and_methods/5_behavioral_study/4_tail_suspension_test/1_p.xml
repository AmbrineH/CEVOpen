<p>TST was performed one day before FST in the sub-acute study. In this test, the mice were suspended by their tails, using tape, from a wire at the height of 33 cm. In such a position the animal was not able to escape or hold onto nearby surfaces. The absence of initiated movements was defined as immobility and recorded during a short-time period of 6 min and the first 2 min was considered as trial (pre-test). Mice were returned to the box after each animal was tested (
