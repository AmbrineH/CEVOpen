<p>For conducting this test, different groups of animals received normal saline or essential oil for 14 days, and were individually placed in the center of a wooden cross elevated 40 cm above the floor. This apparatus consisted of two open (30⊆5 ⊆0.25 cm) and two closed arms (30⊆5⊆40 cm) as described previously (

Anxiety was evaluated during 5 min by recording the entries to open arms/total entries and the time spent in the open arms/time spent in all arms of the apparatus.
