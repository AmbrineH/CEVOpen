Cinnamon was administered same as the previous protocol in the sub-acute administration for 14 days. Cinnamon was solved in normal saline + Tween 80 (1%). The solution was freshly prepared before administration. Fluoxetine (Dr. Abidi Pharm Co, Iran) and desipramine (Pars Daru Co, Iran) were used as positive control drugs in depressive behaviors. Diazepam (Darupakhsh Co. Iran) was used as a positive control drug in the elevated plus maze test. Dosage selection was based on previous studies (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil analysis was carried on a GC7890N AGILENT &amp; MS 5975 (EI mass detector), in the following conditions: chromatography was achieved using a (5%-phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness) with a helium carrier gas, adjusted to a linear velocity of 1 ml/min. the column was with a 50:1 split ratio. The injector temperature was regulated at 260 °C. also, The column oven temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 4 min and programmed to 100 °C at 3 °C/min for 2 min and then to 250 °C at 6 °C/min for 6 min; electron energy at 70 eV. Positive ions were observed while the analyzer was scanned from mass 50 to 550. The Kovats indices were determined for all volatile constituents using a mixture of homologous series of n-alkanes C9–C23 on HP-5MS column. The components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the NIST 5 mass spectra library. The Kovats indices were calculated using by following formula (

One hour after the last treatment of acute study or 24 hr after tTST of sub-acute study, mice were individually placed in an inescapable transparent cylinder (15 cm in diameter), filled with 35 cm of room temperature water, such that the animals could not touch the bottom of the container with their hind paws or their tails. Immobility of animals was recorded during 6 min and the first 2 min was considered as trial (pre-test) (

In this test, the mice were suspended by their tails, using tape, from a wire at the height of 33 cm. In such a position the animal was not able to escape or hold onto nearby surfaces. The absence of initiated movements was defined as immobility and recorded during a short-time period of 6 min and the first 2 min was considered as trial (pre-test).
