  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>, one-way ANOVA of the data obtained from the cinnamon essential oil at the dose of 2 mg/kg showed a significant increase in the percent of time spent in the open arms/time spent in all arms or the percent of entries to open arm/total entries in mice placed at the center of EPM, in comparison with the vehicle-treated control group (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05). The diazepam-treated (2 mg/kg, IP) positive control group showed significantly more time spent in the open arms/ time spent in all arms (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05), and more entries to open arms/ all arms (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001), compared with the vehicle-treated control group.
