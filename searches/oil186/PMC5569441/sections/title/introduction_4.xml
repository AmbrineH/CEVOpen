 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depression is a major chronic psychiatric dis-order affecting nearly 21% of the world population and imposes a substantial health burden on the society (
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>). People with a depressed mood are characterized by despair, loss of interest in daily working and social relationship, sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, helplessness, and guilt (
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>). There are three main kinds of classical antidepressants in clinical practice, including tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine), selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) including moclobemide and tranylcypromine. Although approved antidepre-ssant drugs are effective, a significant number of people do not efficiently respond. In addition, these drugs are accompanied with many adverse effects (

  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>). Accordingly, there is a need for the development of new drugs with more efficacies and less adverse effects. Natural products displaying antidepressant effects are of great interest and may be important sources of new antidepressant drugs (

  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum</span>
  <span class="italic">verum</span> (true cinnamon tree or Ceylon cinnamon tree), belonging to the Lauraceae family, is native to Southern India and Sri Lanka. Since ancient times cinnamon has been commonly used as a spice and flavoring material for desserts, candies, chocolate, etc.; it has a long history as a medicine, as well. Medieval physicians used cinnamon to treat a variety of disorders including headaches, neuralgia, gastritis, coughing, hoarseness, sore throats, etc. (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>). In many experimental as well as clinical studies, cinnamon has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory (

  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>), anti-oxidant (

  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>) and wound-healing (
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a>) properties. Anticancer (

  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>), and cardiovascular- disease protective effects of this compound have also been investigated (
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>). In addition, cinnamon has shown promising effects against neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific aim of this study was to examine whether the essential oil obtained from cinnamon bark has anti-anxiety and/or antidepressant-like properties in acute (triple doses) or sub-acute regimen (14 days), in behavioral models of anxiety and depression in mice.</p>
