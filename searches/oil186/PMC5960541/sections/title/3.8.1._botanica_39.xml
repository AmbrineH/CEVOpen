 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a large annual plant, from 1 to 1.50 meters high, with a simple stem or barely branched at the top, glabrous, with leaves of a glaucous and ashen green, which seem covered with a kind of wax. The leaves of the base are petiolate, but those of the top are sessile. All are oval-shaped, irregularly divided, and glabrous.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flowers are solitary; they present first two deciduous sepals that fall at the time of flowering and four petals pink or white, with a black tab on the base, many stamens, and a gynoecium made of about twenty carpels that weld together so as to finally form a large capsule covered by traces of stigmata. This capsule contains a large amount of small, wrinkled seeds [
