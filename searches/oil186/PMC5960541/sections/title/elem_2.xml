Like THC and most other lipids, CBD is hydrophobic and lipophilic, which means that it does not dissolve in water and cannot be converted into an aqueous emulsion but dissolves in the fat (as well as in most organic solvents such as butane and alcohol).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an acid medium, CBD is cyclized (it forms a new carbon ring) to become THC. In an alkaline medium (in the presence of water), CBD is oxidized to become cannabidiol-hydroxyquinone, which has been the subject of few studies to date but may have an inhibitory effect on liver enzymes (liver) that are vital for the metabolism of ingested drugs.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruit is an ovoid capsule. It includes a thick, fleshy pericarp, which is eaten once confit, and a seed. The seed is surrounded by a laced aril, which gives the spice called mace. It has a thick integument and lignified shell. Nutmeg can be marketed in shell, or in albumen removed from its hull. This albumen is ruminated, which gives the many curved lines that we see in section. In the kitchen, it is used as a spice.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nutmeg is a tree producing nutmeg and is a tropical tree native to the Banda Islands in the Maluku archipelago in Indonesia and is now grown in various tropical climate regions, including the West Indies and Grenada. Production reaches 30 to 40% of world production [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In small doses, nutmeg and mace are safe (in medical or culinary use). But, in excessive doses, they are hallucinogenic and toxic.</p>
