 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a dioecious tree, with aromatic evergreen leaves and small yellow flowers in clusters. It can reach a dozen meters high and be centenarian. Only females bear fruit. The tree bears fruit after 8 years and can continue producing for more than 60 years. The ripe fruits are picked at the time of the dehiscence of the pericarp.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruit is an ovoid capsule. It includes a thick, fleshy pericarp, which is eaten once confit, and a seed. The seed is surrounded by a laced aril, which gives the spice called mace. It has a thick integument and lignified shell. Nutmeg can be marketed in shell, or in albumen removed from its hull. This albumen is ruminated, which gives the many curved lines that we see in section. In the kitchen, it is used as a spice.</p>
