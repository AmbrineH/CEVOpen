  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a large annual plant, from 1 to 1.50 meters high, with a simple stem or barely branched at the top, glabrous, with leaves of a glaucous and ashen green, which seem covered with a kind of wax. The leaves of the base are petiolate, but those of the top are sessile. All are oval-shaped, irregularly divided, and glabrous.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flowers are solitary; they present first two deciduous sepals that fall at the time of flowering and four petals pink or white, with a black tab on the base, many stamens, and a gynoecium made of about twenty carpels that weld together so as to finally form a large capsule covered by traces of stigmata. This capsule contains a large amount of small, wrinkled seeds [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This plant is native to southern Europe and North Africa. The plant was well known to many ancient civilizations such as Egyptian civilization and ancient Greece. It is also grown in western countries.
