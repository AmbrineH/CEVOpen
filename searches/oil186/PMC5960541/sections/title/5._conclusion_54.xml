So the people use them in a variety of contexts.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This public health problem has been the subject of several outreaching programs to citizens by all means of the media. In hospitals, the security measures are applied by emergency doctors, pharmacists, and nurses bringing first aid to addicts.
