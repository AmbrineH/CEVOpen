 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The datura is annual, from 50 to 100 centimeters tall, ramose, and with broad leaves both hairy and somewhat viscous and repulsive odor.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flowers in broad funnel are white, erect, shortly pedunculate, and 6 to 10 centimeters wide. The calyx is pale green, equaling almost two-thirds of the corolla. After that the flower forms a capsule as large as a walnut, erect, robust, and bristling, which opens at maturity in four valves and lets out its many black seeds, richer in toxins than the rest of the plant. It is sometimes found with purple flowers instead of white ones [
