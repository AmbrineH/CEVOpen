 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The poisoning reported in the ACPM shows that the use of plants and products of the traditional pharmacopoeia (PPTP) is far from being negligible. Indeed, faced with the abundance of Moroccan flora, a large slice of the population prefers to heal naturally by herbal preparations alone or in mixtures. However, PPTP may contain powerful chemical compounds, responsible for adverse effects and significant toxicity and hence the need for continuous vigilance [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the ACPM study from 1980 to 2008, plant poisoning accounted for 5.1% of all poisonings and ranked 7th after drugs (28.3%), gaseous products (23.3%), food (15.2%), pesticides (11.2%), household products (5.8%), and industrial products (5.2%) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So, we used the classification of ACPM for toxic plants in Morocco, to try to develop the monographs in order of gravity according to

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indeed, to get closer to these plants and before developing their monographs, we present in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, the different nomenclatures and the families to which they belong.
