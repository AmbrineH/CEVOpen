 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Castor is a dioecious, herbaceous, or arboreal species, annual or perennial depending on climatic conditions. The branching stem bears large palm-lobed leaves (5 to 12 lobes), saw-toothed, the petiole, and the underside, which are, in some varieties, purple in color. All flowers are in clusters of cymes, males with numerous stamens with branched fillet and females with tricarpel ovaries and long reddish styles. The fruit is a euphorbia capsule bristling with spikes. The seed usually has a smooth, shiny integument, usually marbled with red, black, or brown. With a fleshy prominence, the caruncle extends the upper extremity; it leaves a prominent line, clearly visible on the ventral side [
