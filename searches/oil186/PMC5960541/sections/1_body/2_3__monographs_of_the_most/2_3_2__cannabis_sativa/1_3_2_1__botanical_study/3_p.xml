<p class="p">Sown in May and harvested in September hemp is an excellent rotating head. Thanks to its deep and much branched roots, it improves the soil structure, increases the water capacity of the soil, and protects it from hydromorphy. Sown last among spring crops, hemp grows very rapidly from 2.5 meters to 3.5 meters between May and September.</p>
