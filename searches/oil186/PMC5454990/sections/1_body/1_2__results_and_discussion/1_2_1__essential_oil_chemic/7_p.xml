<p class="p">In order to differentiate between the analyzed 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic> samples, a hierarchical cluster analysis using the chemical constituents was carried out and the resulting dendrogram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. According to these results, the samples were grouped in two main groups with similarity of 46.6%. Group I is characterized by oils from 
 <italic class="italic">O. caudata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. whitei</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O. floribunda</italic>, which present high amounts of α-pinene (9.8–22.5%) and β-pinene (7.3–21.3%). A higher similarity (74.1%) was found with 
 <italic class="italic">O. caudata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. whitei</italic> due the proportions of α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The main compound of 
 <italic class="italic">O. floribunda</italic> oil was the diterpene kaurene (34.0%) and it decreased its similarity level. Group II includes 
 <italic class="italic">O. cujumary</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. caniculata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O. veraguensis</italic> oils, the samples 
 <bold class="bold">Cuj-L</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Can-L</bold> present similar amounts of β-caryophyllene (22.2% and 18.9%, respectively). A lower similarity was found in sample 
 <bold class="bold">Ver-L</bold>, which was rich in bulnesol (29.0%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (19.8%).
