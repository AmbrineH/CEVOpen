 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> sequences of 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> (Nees) Mez, 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> Mart., and 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> (Rich.) were assembled and edited using FinchTV (biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Sequences were checked against those in GenBank using the BLAST algorithm. The 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> sequences from 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> (Nees) Mez, 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> Mart., and 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> (Rich.) were aligned with sequences from 
  <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span> (gbEU153866.1), 
  <span class="italic">O. veraguensis</span> (gb.JQ589849.1), and 
  <span class="italic">O. whitei</span> (gb. JQ589831.1) available in GenBank. The sequences were edited using BioEdit V7.2.5 [
  <a rid="B47-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijms-18-01081">47</a>] and the alignment was performed using the Clustal W [
  <a rid="B48-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijms-18-01081">48</a>]. The distance genetic and Phylogenetic Tree was determined using Mega 7 Program [
  <a rid="B49-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijms-18-01081">49</a>]. The evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model with 10,000 replicates. The outgroups used for the construct phylogenetic tree were the 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> sequences from 
  <span class="italic">Calycanthus chinensis</span> (Cc) (gb|AY525339.1), 
  <span class="italic">Idiospermum australiense</span> (Ia) (gi71891392), and 
  <span class="italic">Chimonanthus zhejiangensis</span> (Cz) (gb|AY525341.1) belonging to the order Laurales and Calycanthaceae family.
