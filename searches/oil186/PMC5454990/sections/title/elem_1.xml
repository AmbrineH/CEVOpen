  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil (EO) of 
   <span class="italic">Ocotea</span> species provided different yields and the higher yields were found in the leaf EO for all samples (0.7–0.8%) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t001" href="#ijms-18-01081-t001">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most representative compounds class was sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (56.3–82.0%) in all samples from Caxianuã Forest (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f001" href="#ijms-18-01081-f001">Figure 1</a>). The 
   <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> oils showed different chemical profiles in the tissues; in the EO from leaves (
   <span class="bold">Cau-L</span>) the monoterpene hydrocarbons (21.5%) were present, while in the branches (
   <span class="bold">Cau-B</span>) there was a high accumulation of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (35.9%). The EO of 
   <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> leaves (
   <span class="bold">Cuj-L</span>) showed higher concentrations of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (25.8%) than branches (
   <span class="bold">Cuj-B</span>, 4.0%), which showed significant amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (22.7%) and fatty acid derivatives (34.6%). The 
   <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> oils showed amounts of phenylpropanoids, especially in the branches (
   <span class="bold">Can-B</span>, 15.5%). Seventy volatile components were identified, comprising approximately 95.1% of the total composition of the oils (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main compounds identified in

   <span class="bold">Cau-B</span>). β-Caryophyllene, germacrene-D, α-pinene, and β-pinene were the principal common constituents of the EOs of leaves of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, these chemical compounds were identified in the leaves in other Lauraceae species. The EO of leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Endlicheria arenosa</span> was dominated by bicyclogermacrene (42.2%), germacrene D (12.5%), and β-caryophyllene (10.1%) [

   <a rid="B24-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-01081">24</a>]. The sesquiterpene δ-cadinene identified in the EO of branches was detected as the main compound in EOs of leaf and bark of 
   <span class="italic">Beilschmiedia madang</span> (17.0% and 20.5%, respectively) and was associated with germacrene D in the oil of barks of

   <span class="bold">Cuj-B</span>) was dominated by 2-tridecanone (30.0%), limonene (20.5%), and β-caryophyllene (8.1%). The occurrence of fatty acid derivatives such as 2-tridecanone in Lauraceae species is not very common. However, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and δ-cadinene were the main compounds of the EO oil from leaves of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to differentiate between the analyzed

   <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span>, which present high amounts of α-pinene (9.8–22.5%) and β-pinene (7.3–21.3%). A higher similarity (74.1%) was found with 
   <span class="italic">O. caudata</span> and 
   <span class="italic">O. whitei</span> due the proportions of α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t002" href="#ijms-18-01081-t002">Table 2</a>). The main compound of 
   <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span> oil was the diterpene kaurene (34.0%) and it decreased its similarity level. Group II includes 
   <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span>, 
   <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">O. veraguensis</span> oils, the samples
