 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this present study, the main compounds identified in the essential oils of species collected in Caxiuan√£ Forest were terpenoid hydrocarbons and oxygenated terpenoids, which had good antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The main class of chemical compounds displayed a good correlation with chloroplast DNA region (
  <span class="italic">matK</span> gene) analysis. However, the analysis of phylogenetic data and specific chemical compounds showed differences. These results suggest that 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> gene was not efficient for representing this relationship.
