  <span class="italic">Ocotea</span> species present economic importance and biological activities attributed to their essential oils (EOs) and extracts. For this reason, various strategies have been developed for their conservation. The chemical compositions of the essential oils and 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> DNA sequences of 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> were subjected to comparison with data from 
  <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. veraguensis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O. whitei</span>, previously reported. The multivariate analysis of chemical composition classified the EOs into two main clusters. Group I was characterized by the presence of α-pinene (9.8–22.5%) and β-pinene (9.7–21.3%) and it includes 
  <span class="italic">O. caudata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. whitei</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O. floribunda</span>. In group II, the oils of 
  <span class="italic">O. cujumary</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O. caniculata</span> showed high similarity due amounts of β-caryophyllene (22.2% and 18.9%, respectively). The EO of 
  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">veraguensis</span>, rich in 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (19.8%), showed minor similarity among all samples. The oils displayed promising antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &lt; 19.5 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and MCF-7 cells (median inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) ≅ 65.0 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), respectively. The analysis of 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> gene displayed a good correlation with the main class of chemical compounds present in the EOs. However, the 
  <span class="italic">matK</span> gene data did not show correlation with specific compounds.
