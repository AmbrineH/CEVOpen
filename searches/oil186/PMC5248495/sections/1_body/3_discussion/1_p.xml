<p class="p">Under the experimental conditions of the present study it was revealed that the dominant constituent for 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> is methyl chavicol (estragol), whereas the major component for the other variety of the same species, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> is linalool. At the same time, the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorium</italic> hybrid plant differed substantially from the first two basil varieties: it had significant aldehyde content, represented by citral, with another prevalent constituent being nerol (monoterpene alcohol). Neither citral nor nerol was detected in the two other species of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We observed that the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">O. citriodorum</italic> species displayed the highest antimicrobial activity against the most of microorganisms tested. The experiments showed that essential oils from all three varieties of basil can significantly inhibit the growth of ampicillin-resistant strain of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria. It is interesting to notice, that the observed antibacterial activities of the essential oils from O
 <italic class="italic">. citriodorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> where much higher in case of ampicillin-resistant strain than in the case of a non-resistant one. At the same time, the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">O. thyrsiflora</italic> cultivar displayed the same, relatively high antibacterial activity in both cases (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
