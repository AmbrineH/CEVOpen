<p class="p">The results of radical DPPH assay for of 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var.purpureum, O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oils are shown on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The highest antioxidant activity was demonstrated by 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oil: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for it was equal to the standardized Grapefruit Seed Extract which was used as a control sample (2.5 μL/mL). The antiradical activity for the other two basil species was lower: IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic> essential oil was 20 μL/mL and for 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> was 22 μL/mL. These results were somewhat unexpected, since usually the oils with higher phenolic content are the ones exhibiting higher radical scavenging abilities, whereas in our case the highest antioxidant properties were displayed by the cultivar with the highest linalool (terpene alcohol) content.
