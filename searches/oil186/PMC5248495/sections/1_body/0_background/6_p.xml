<p class="p">In the present study the comparative analysis of the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils distilled from three varieties of basil, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">purpureum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">thyrsiflora</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum,</italic> was carried out
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> The plants under investigation were grown in the same soil, at the same elevation, and under the same climatic conditions. The first two cultivars were varieties of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> specie
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>, or Sweet basil, and the third one, the Lemon basil (
 <italic class="italic">O. x citriodorum</italic>) was a hybrid between 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum and O. americanum</italic>. The purpose of this paper was also to study the biological activities of given oils and to evaluate their potential using in food industry, cosmetics and medicine.
