  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">purpureum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thyrsiflor</span>a, and 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span>) were grown from the seeds sown in the greenhouse, with subsequent transplantation of the seedlings to the same field, in the Kotayk Region of Armenia, where they have been growing side by side, at an elevation of 1600 m above the sea level. Plant materials were collected during blossoming period (July–August, 2014). The plant materials were identified at the Institute of Botany, National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Yerevan (Armenia). The plants were not included in the herbarium as there were cultivated species and not typical for the flora of Armenia. The samples of basil cultivars are available at the Department of Microbiology &amp; Plants and Microbes Biotechnology, Biology Faculty, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia.
