 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The qualitative and quantitative composition of the three essential oils of three basil cultivars (
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span>), cultivated in Armenia, was quite different: 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</span> essential oil contained 57.3% methyl-chavicol (estragol); 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</span> oil had 68.0% linalool, and the main constituents of 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span> oil were nerol (23.0%) and citral (20.7%). The presence of thyrosinase inhibitory activity is enhances the pharmacological value of these oils. They had also high antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activity and could be used as good sources of natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents, with possible application in food industry, cosmetics or medicine.
