 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present investigation revealed that Gram-positive bacteria tested were more sensitive to all three essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Such tendency is also observed by other authors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span> was quite active against 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">St. aureus, with the</span> MIC of 3.125 μL/mL. The same MIC was recorded for the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</span> against 
  <span class="italic">St. aureus</span>, and O
  <span class="italic">. basilicum var. purpureum</span> essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>. The MIC of 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</span> essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> and MIC of 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</span> against 
  <span class="italic">St. aureus</span> were twice as high, 6.25 μL/mL. The ampicillin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> bacteria also displayed sensitivity against the essential oils tested: thus the MIC values of 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. purpureum</span> against those bacteria were 6.25 μL/mL, while 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</span> displayed MIC of 12.5 μL/mL. The action of the essential oils on the all bacteria in this study was evaluated as bactericidal.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All three essential oils have also displayed high antifungal activity, with 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span> being the strongest antifungal amongst them: MIC of 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum</span> against 
  <span class="italic">D. hansenii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. guillermondii</span> were 1.56 and 3.125 μL/mL, respectively (see Fig.
