 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plants belonging to the basil genome or 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> genus of the Lamiaceae family are aromatic ones [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] and are considered to be a rich source of essential oils-the metabolites, synthesized by plants for specific functions, using various secondary metabolic pathways. Humans have learned to use these metabolites since antiquity for food preservation, flavoring, and as medicine. The basil essential oils are usually extracted from the leaves and flowering tops of basil plants. Through the centuries basil was cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes in many countries, which created a great diversity of species within the 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> genus: the genus 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> comprises more than 150 species and is considered as one of the largest genera of the Lamiaceae family.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is known, that different cultivars of basil have the genetic ability to generate and keep different sets of chemical compounds. This ability leads to a great variety of chemotypes within the same basil species. According to some investigations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>], the essential oils distilled from various basil cultivars can contain alcohols (linalool), oxides (1,8-cineole), phenols (eugenol, methyl eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, thymol), esters (methyl cinnamate), aldehydes (citral), and camphor. The 1,8-cineole, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, and linalool are constituents responsible for the distinct aroma of basil plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawrence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>] named four major chemotypes of basil: methyl chavicol-rich, linalool-rich, methyl eugenol-rich, and methyl cinnamate-rich. Both methyl chavicol and methyl eugenol are phenylpropanoids produced by shikimic acid pathway and are reported to be toxic to insects and microbes. Linalool is a terpenoid produced by mevalonic acid pathway and known to possess antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Methyl cinnamate is the methyl ester of cinnamic acid. It is found naturally in many aromatic plants, including fruits like strawberry and is known to attract pollinators. According to Marotti et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] the European basils are mostly of linalool and methyl chavicol types, whereas tropical basils have methyl cinnamate as their major constituent. Basils of methyl eugenol chemotype could be found growing in North Africa, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous papers have been published on the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of basil essential oils and its constituents. Koeduka et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] and Zabka et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] reported the antimicrobial activity of eugenol with analgesic properties for humans. Liu et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] investigated the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of linalool and geraniol. While Soković et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and Huang et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] investigated the usage of linalool, methyl chavicol, and thymol for skin protection against all sources of environmental skin aggressors and treatment of various dermatological disorders.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the chemical composition (chemotype) and biological activity of essential oils distilled from the plants belonging to the same species may vary significantly, depending on the variety of cultivars, environment, elevation and cultivation methods, it is interesting to study the essential oils obtained from the different kinds of basil grown in Armenia, in similar conditions, at a significant elevation (1600 m above sea level).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study the comparative analysis of the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils distilled from three varieties of basil, 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">purpureum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thyrsiflora</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">O.</span> x 
  <span class="italic">citriodorum,</span> was carried out
  <span class="italic">.</span> The plants under investigation were grown in the same soil, at the same elevation, and under the same climatic conditions. The first two cultivars were varieties of 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> specie
  <span class="italic">s</span>, or Sweet basil, and the third one, the Lemon basil (
  <span class="italic">O. x citriodorum</span>) was a hybrid between 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum and O. americanum</span>. The purpose of this paper was also to study the biological activities of given oils and to evaluate their potential using in food industry, cosmetics and medicine.
