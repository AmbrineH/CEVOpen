<p id="Par21">The commercial samples of whole unpearled (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) and pearled (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) quinoa seed, whole lupin seed (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), rapeseed press cake (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), dehulled buckwheat seed (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), buckwheat bran (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), whole faba bean (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), hulled and grinded faba bean (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), whole flaxseed (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), whole oil hemp seed (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), and hulls of oil hemp (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were purchased from local grocery stores or directly from farmers/producers. The sample size varied 500-1000 g. Pearled quinoa seeds were pre-processed by the farmer using abrasive milling (i.e. pearling) to remove the saponin-rich outer layer of the seed. Buckwheat samples were dehulled and rapeseed press cakes were produced from cold-pressing processes by the manufacturers. All unmilled or coarse samples were milled before analyses using a KT-120 hammer mill with a ø1mm sieve (Koneteollisuus Oy, Klaukkala, Finland). All milled samples were stored in a freezer at −20 °C before being analyzed.
