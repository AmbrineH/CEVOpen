<p id="Par35">The highest protein content was found in faba bean, blue lupin and rapeseed press cake, while quinoa samples and whole dehulled buckwheat appeared to contain lower levels (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our mean protein results for commercial whole faba bean and blue lupin samples are in accordance with earlier studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, Multari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] obtained somewhat lower results for commercial faba bean flour and higher results for lupin flour than were found in the present study. Similar protein content of hemp and flaxseed is documented in the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, in line with our study lower protein levels have previously been found in buckwheat and quinoa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It seemed that protein was mostly located in the outer layer of the buckwheat and quinoa seeds, while the opposite was found in the case of oil hemp. Protein content of plant foods is influenced by cultivar, environment and grade of processing which explains variabilities between various studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
