<p id="Par36">A great part of the total carbohydrates of whole lupin, hemp seed, and flaxseed as well as rapeseed press cake were constituted in fiber. Especially whole lupin contained a lot of insoluble fiber (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Whole faba bean contained 63.3 ± 0.5 g/100 g DW carbohydrates, of which 39% was fiber, also mostly insoluble. Buckwheat and quinoa contained lower levels of fiber and higher levels of other carbohydrates. Generally, our fiber results for lupin, hemp, flaxseed, buckwheat, quinoa, and faba bean are in accordance with earlier reports [

However, the total fiber content of rapeseed press cake found in our study was much higher than the mean crude fiber content (11.6%) calculated by Lomascolo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] from various studies. One reason for this discrepancy is that crude fiber method measures basically only cellulose and insoluble lignin. The remaining carbohydrates–after excluding the amount of dietary fiber–are mainly starch [
