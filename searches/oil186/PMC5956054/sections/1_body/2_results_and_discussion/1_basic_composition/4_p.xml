<p id="Par38">The ash content varied from &lt;0.2 to 7.6 ± 0.1 g/100 g DW among the samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Processing affects the nutrient content of commercial products. For example, pearled quinoa contained less protein, ash, fat and dietary fiber than whole quinoa, buckwheat bran contained more protein, fat, and ash than whole dehulled buckwheat, and grinded faba bean contained less dietary fiber than the whole faba bean. Hemp hulls contained more carbohydrates but less protein, fat and ash than the whole seed (Table
