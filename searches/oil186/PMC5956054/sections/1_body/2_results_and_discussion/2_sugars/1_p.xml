<p id="Par39" class="p">The content of free mono- and disaccharides in the samples is presented in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The total sugar content was highest in rapeseed press cake, where only sucrose was found. The result is in accordance with Jiang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. In case of sucrose in faba bean, lupin and buckwheat, our results are similar to those presented earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Contrary to Repo-Carrasco et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], maltose was not found in the quinoa samples. Interestingly, pearling of quinoa reduced the sucrose content in particular, whereas glucose remained in the pearled seed. Further research would be needed to verify the effect of dehulling on the sucrose content.
