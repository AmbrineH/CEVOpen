<p id="Par41">It has been known for some time that plant proteins contain significant levels of non-protein nitrogen, and thus require a lower NP factor than 6.25 traditionally used in protein analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. According to Greenfield and Southgate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it would be more appropriate to base estimates of protein on AAdata. However, when comparing the sum of AAs in protein plants (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) with the protein content gained using the Kjeldahl method with a protein conversion factor 6.25 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), it appeared that quite similar results were obtained.
