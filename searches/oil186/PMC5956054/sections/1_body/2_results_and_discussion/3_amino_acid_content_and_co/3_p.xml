<p id="Par43">AA composition is an essential factor in evaluating the nutritional quality of a dietary protein source. According to Alsmeyer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] the nutritional value should be expressed in terms of Leu and Tyr contents (PER-value) while other classifications are based on the chemical scores for 9â€“11 EAA. For humans, adequate quantities of Lys, Met and Try are considered necessary in food that is of high nutritional value [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Results in this study indicated that the PER-values ranged from 1.39 (oil hemp peel) to 2.53 (faba bean) are lower than the standard 2.7 (for casein).
