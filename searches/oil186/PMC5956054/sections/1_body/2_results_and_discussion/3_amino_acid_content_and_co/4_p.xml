<p id="Par44" class="p">As seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> the total amount of EAAs (g/16 g N) ranged from 25.8 in oil hemp peel to 41.5 in pearled quinoa. Favier et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] recommended that the EAA tot should be above 36 g/16 g N. In this study, only lupin, hemp seed, and hemp seed peel samples had lower values. The EAA levels were compared to the recommended EAA values found in whole egg protein (Lys 5.5–7.0, Met+Cys 3.5–5.7, Thr 4.0–4.7, Ile 4.0–5.4, Trp 1.0–1.7, Val 5.0–6.6, Leu 7.0–8.6, His 0–2.2, Phe + Tyr 6.0–9.3 g/16 gN) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The species examined contained all EAAs, among which Leu and Lys were the most available. Lys level was high especially in faba bean, quinoa and buckwheat. Met+Cys levels were low in legumes (faba bean and lupin), while in other samples the amount was comparable to egg. Moreover, the concentrations of Phe and Tyr were above the recommended levels in all samples except the peeled oil hemp seeds. Overall, among the samples rapeseed press cake was the most efficient source of high quality protein, with an EAA composition comparable to those of bovine milk and egg. On the other hand, faba bean species with high Lys levels could be used for balancing the AA composition of cereal-based products typically low in Lys.
