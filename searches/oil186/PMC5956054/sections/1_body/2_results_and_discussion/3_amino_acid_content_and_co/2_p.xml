 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the AA composition and contents of the samples. The contents of individual AA, AA tot, individual EAA and EAA tot are expressed as grams of an AA per 16 g nitrogen. The AA tot and EAA tot are also expressed as g/100 g DW. Rapeseed press cake and legumes (faba bean and lupin) had the highest amounts of AA tot (g/100 g DW). However, if the oil is removed from hemp seed and flaxseed their press cakes would also be excellent sources of AA tot with levels that are comparable to those of rapeseed press cake. Also, buckwheat bran is a rich source of AA tot and EAA tot, whereas peeled buckwheat and pearled quinoa are comparatively low in AA tot and EAA tot.
