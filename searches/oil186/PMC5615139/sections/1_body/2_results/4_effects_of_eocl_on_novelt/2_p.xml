<p>The EOCL at 200 mg/kg, i.p. significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased rearing {F
 <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 6.4} and at 50–200 mg/kg, significantly {p &lt; 0.01; F
 <sub>(4,20)</sub> = 24} decreased spontaneous locomotive activity in mice compared to vehicle. Diazepam also caused significant (p &lt; 0.01) decrease in rearing and locomotor activity when compared to the negative control (
