<p>Twenty-three compounds were detected while 21 compounds were fully characterized in the gas chromatogram of EOCL (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The most abundant components were oxygenated sesquiterpenes with tumerone (35.9%), curlone (12.9%), and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-tumerone (10.0%). The monoterpene alcohol 1,8-cineole was found to be 10.3% while the monoterpene hydrocarbon α-phellandrene was 15.5%. The five compounds alone accounted for 84.5% of the oil (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Other minor constituents of EOCL that exceed 1% in composition includes two monoterpenes hydrocarbons; 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (2.1%) and terpinolene (3.2%), and two sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons; α-zingiberene (2.0) and β-sesquiphellandrene (1.8%). The relative density of the oil was estimated to be 960 mg/mL.
