<p class="p">Several pharmacological properties have been reported for curcumin, a major component of the alcohol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. domestica</italic> rhizomes 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> has been reported to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and ketones 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Terpinolene and α-phellandrene have been identified as the predominant constituents of leaf oil of a Nigerian grown 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[11]</xref>, while 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref> reported a different chemotype α-tumerone from Southwest Nigeria. The main focus of previous research study was on the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and other nutritional properties of the plant as well as on curcumin, ethanolic extract of the rhizome. However, there has been no report on the central nervous system effects of the plant, this study therefore aimed at evaluating the 
 <italic class="italic">in-vivo</italic> neuropharmacological activity, determine the acute toxicity profile and investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the studied species since there were different chemotypes of the Nigerian 
 <italic class="italic">C longa</italic>. Therefore this study reveals the contribution of the plant’s volatile component to its central nervous system activities, toxicological profile and provides rationale for its ethnomedicinal uses.
