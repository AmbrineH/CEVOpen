<p>Animals were randomly selected into 5 groups (n = 5). Group I serve as the negative control and received the vehicle (5% Tween 80, 10 ml/kg) only. Test groups II–IV were treated with the EOCL at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg respectively, while group V (positive control) received diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). All treatments were by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and each treatment was administered 30 min prior to test. The oil forms stable emulsion with Tween 80 and was subsequently used in the formulation of the oil while maintaining the concentration of Tween 80 at ≤5% for all the subsequent bioassays.</p>
