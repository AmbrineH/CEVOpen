<p>EOCL (0.5 mg/mL in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) was analyzed by GC–MS (Focus-ISQ, Thermo Scientific). Separation was achieved using a ZB–5 ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm Ф, Phenomenex) and a temperature program of 40 °C (2 min) ramped to 250 °C (10 m) at 5 °C/min. The eluted compounds were identified by determining the Kovat indices, spectral matching with the 2008 National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) spectral library and known standard and literatures
