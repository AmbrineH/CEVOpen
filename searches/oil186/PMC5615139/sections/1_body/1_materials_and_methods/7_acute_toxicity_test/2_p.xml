 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[15]</xref> via both oral and intraperitoneal routes. Three doses (10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg) of emulsified EOCL were administered to three different groups of mice (n = 3). In the second phase, doses of 1000, 2000, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the oral route because there was no mortality at 1000 mg/kg in this route; while 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the intraperitoneal route because there was 100% mortality at 1000 mg/kg in the first phase for this route. The animals were monitored for 2 h and incidence of mortality recorded after 24 h for each group. The LD

  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = √(A x B),
