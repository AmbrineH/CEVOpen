<p>The major constituents of essential oil from the fresh rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> in this study included turmerone, Î±-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone and curlone. The neuropharmacological studies showed that the essential oil of the plant displayed significant CNS depressant activity, and exhibited hypothermic, sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties in mice, thus providing evidence that may support the folkloric application of this extract.
