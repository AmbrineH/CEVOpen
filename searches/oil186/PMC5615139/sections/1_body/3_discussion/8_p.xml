<p>Furthermore, it was observed that EOCL failed to protect against PTZ-induced convulsions at the lowest dose (50 mg/kg, i.p), but there was significant (p &lt; 0.05) delay in time of death compared to negative control (
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, EOCL higher doses (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented episodes of convulsions and offered 100% protections comparable to diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This result indicates that this oil demonstrated significant anticonvulsant effect and may be effective in the management of generalized convulsion such as tonic-clonic and myoclonic convulsions as suggested in other studies

 <sub>A</sub> neurotransmission in CNS may be involved 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Strychnine-induced convulsions are closely linked with glycine inhibition in the spinal cord and the brain stem. The ability to reduce percentage mortality after seizures is suggestive of some potential usefulness of a drug against neurotoxicity which normally causes death following extensive seizures. However, the oil at all the tested doses failed to protect the mice against the strychnine-induced convulsions indicating that the oil or its constituent(s) may not have significant facilitatory effect on the glycine neural circuit
