<p>Dose-dependent inhibitory effects were observed for all exploratory behaviours. The novelty-induced behaviours including rearing and spontaneous locomotor activity were found to decrease significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at all the doses used (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A–B). It is has been reported in previous studies that CNS depressant suppresses exploration or inquisitiveness of animals and common sedative drugs have inhibitory effects on exploratory behaviours of animals

 <italic>C. domestica</italic> on novelty-induced behaviour could be mediated through augmentation of GABA neurotransmission in the CNS as reported for some medicinal plants

 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Rearing is also associated closely with the excitability of the CNS 
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and since this oil significantly decreased rearing and locomotor activity in this study, central inhibitory activity is suggested.
