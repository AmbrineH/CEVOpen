<p>The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of the oil were 693 mg/kg (i.p.) and 2154 mg/kg, p.o. The results of the acute toxicity study revealed that the oil is moderately toxic intraperitoneally but slightly toxic orally 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Low oral bioavailability could be responsible for the wide variation in the lethal effect of this oil compare to its effect after intraperitoneal administration as observed in this study and similarly to previous report 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The implication of this acute toxicity result is that at high doses, the oil could be harmful due to accumulative toxic effect, therefore, its consumption as a spice, condiment, medicinal recipes and flavouring agents should be with caution and closely monitored 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The intraperitoneal route was used for further tests because the test agent could be subjected to unpredictable metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and low systemic bioavailability through oral route has been reported for extract of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the parenteral route is preferable in neuropharmacological tests in order to prevent the biodegradation or inactivation of the test compounds if given through the oral route 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There is no pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic data from human studies on the essential oil component of this plant. However, in previous animal study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>L. longa</italic> was found to cause 20% mortality in mice at ≥28 mg/kg/day for 28 days 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Low oral bioavailability could be responsible for the wide variation in the lethal effect of this oil compare to its effect after intraperitoneal administration as observed in this study and similarly to previous report 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In a clinical trial study, 0.6 ml (≈0.5 g) of Turmeric oil administered orally thrice daily for 12 weeks produce no clinical, hematological, renal or hepatic-toxicity in the volunteers 
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This report however has the shortcomings of using very few subjects (7) and short duration (12 weeks), which are grossly inadequate statistically and fell short of the minimal standard for chronic studies in humans. Future studies are imperative to evaluate the long term toxicological profile of oral administration of this extract in preclinical and clinical studies.
