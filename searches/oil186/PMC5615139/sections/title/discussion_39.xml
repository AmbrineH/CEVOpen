 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition and the chemotype of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> were established and its neuropharmacological profile assessed for novelty induced behaviour (NIB), anxiolytic, hypothermic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities in mice. The oil was dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes, turmerone and manifested remarkable central effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LD
  <sub>50</sub> values of the oil were 693 mg/kg (i.p.) and 2154 mg/kg, p.o. The results of the acute toxicity study revealed that the oil is moderately toxic intraperitoneally but slightly toxic orally 
  <a rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0130">[26]</a>. Low oral bioavailability could be responsible for the wide variation in the lethal effect of this oil compare to its effect after intraperitoneal administration as observed in this study and similarly to previous report 
  <a rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0135">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0140">[28]</a>. The implication of this acute toxicity result is that at high doses, the oil could be harmful due to accumulative toxic effect, therefore, its consumption as a spice, condiment, medicinal recipes and flavouring agents should be with caution and closely monitored 
  <a rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0145">[29]</a>. The intraperitoneal route was used for further tests because the test agent could be subjected to unpredictable metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract 
  <a rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0135">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0150">[30]</a> and low systemic bioavailability through oral route has been reported for extract of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span>
  <a rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0140">[28]</a>. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the parenteral route is preferable in neuropharmacological tests in order to prevent the biodegradation or inactivation of the test compounds if given through the oral route 
  <a rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0155">[31]</a>. There is no pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic data from human studies on the essential oil component of this plant. However, in previous animal study, the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">L. longa</span> was found to cause 20% mortality in mice at ≥28 mg/kg/day for 28 days 
  <a rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0135">[27]</a>. Low oral bioavailability could be responsible for the wide variation in the lethal effect of this oil compare to its effect after intraperitoneal administration as observed in this study and similarly to previous report 
  <a rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0135">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0140">[28]</a>. In a clinical trial study, 0.6 ml (≈0.5 g) of Turmeric oil administered orally thrice daily for 12 weeks produce no clinical, hematological, renal or hepatic-toxicity in the volunteers 
  <a rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0160">[32]</a>. This report however has the shortcomings of using very few subjects (7) and short duration (12 weeks), which are grossly inadequate statistically and fell short of the minimal standard for chronic studies in humans. Future studies are imperative to evaluate the long term toxicological profile of oral administration of this extract in preclinical and clinical studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dose-dependent inhibitory effects were observed for all exploratory behaviours. The novelty-induced behaviours including rearing and spontaneous locomotor activity were found to decrease significantly (p &lt; 0.01) at all the doses used (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>A–B). It is has been reported in previous studies that CNS depressant suppresses exploration or inquisitiveness of animals and common sedative drugs have inhibitory effects on exploratory behaviours of animals 
  <a rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0165">[33]</a>. Locomotion is believed to be mediated through dopaminergic pathway and other neural mechanisms 
  <a rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0170">[34]</a>. It can be suggested that the inhibitory effect of the oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. domestica</span> on novelty-induced behaviour could be mediated through augmentation of GABA neurotransmission in the CNS as reported for some medicinal plants 
  <a rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0100">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0175">[35]</a>. Rearing is also associated closely with the excitability of the CNS 
  <a rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0180">[36]</a> and since this oil significantly decreased rearing and locomotor activity in this study, central inhibitory activity is suggested.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been reported that anxiolytic drugs increase exploration of the holes 
  <a rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0185">[37]</a>. It was observed that the EOCL at 50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p increased the exploratory head dipping behaviour of the animals, however, at 200 mg/kg, i.p., it decreased head dipping. This observation might likely be due to increased sedative effect of EOCL at higher doses compared to diazepam (standard sedative drug) has been shown to be effective in these models (Rabbani et al., 2003. EOCL also increased% time spent by the animals in the open arms to 49, 55 and 56% as the concentration increases compared to negative control (33%), (
  <a rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0015">Fig. 3</a>) indicating anxiolytic effect 
  <a rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0190">[38]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOCL at 100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p., significantly (p &lt; 0.05) caused reduction in rectal temperature at 30 and 60 min post treatment compared to negative control or standard agent, diazepam (1 mg/kg) which caused significant effect at 60 min only (
  <a rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table" href="#tbl0010">Table 2</a>). Hypothermia is an effect usually observed with benzodiazepine receptor agonists that produce this effect at relatively low doses hence the use of diazepam 
  <a rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0195">[39]</a>. Hypothermia has been linked with decrease metabolic heat production and/or vasodilation. The hypothalamus has been reported to regulate body temperature, hence it could be suggested that oil may be mediating its hypothermic effect in the hypothalamus through activation of DA-D2 receptor sites 
  <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">[40]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results in 
  <a rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0025">Fig. 5</a>(A–B) showed that the EOCL (50–200 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) caused significant (p &lt; 0.05–0.01) reduction in sleep latency (SL), and caused significant (p &lt; 0.05–0.01) increase in ketamine-induced total sleeping time (TST), indicating sedative effect 
  <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0110">[22]</a>. Ketamine is known to act primarily in the thalamus and limbic systems acting as a non-competitive antagonist of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-methyl-
  <span class="italic">D-</span>aspartate receptor 
  <span class="italic">(N</span>M
  <span class="italic">D</span>A
  <span class="italic">)</span> receptor. Thus the EOCD may be mediating its sedative effect through augmentation of the inhibitory activity on the NMDA receptors in addition to general CNS depression. 
  <span class="italic">Curcuma longa</span> is a component of herbal preparations used in the treatment of fever and mental disorders in Southwest Nigeria thus giving an insight into the rationale for its use in this region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, it was observed that EOCL failed to protect against PTZ-induced convulsions at the lowest dose (50 mg/kg, i.p), but there was significant (p &lt; 0.05) delay in time of death compared to negative control (
  <a rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table" href="#tbl0020">Table 4</a>). However, EOCL higher doses (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented episodes of convulsions and offered 100% protections comparable to diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This result indicates that this oil demonstrated significant anticonvulsant effect and may be effective in the management of generalized convulsion such as tonic-clonic and myoclonic convulsions as suggested in other studies 
  <a rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0205">[41]</a>. The mechanism of action of the anticonvulsant effect of the oil was not evaluated but enhancement or augmentation of GABA
  <sub>A</sub> neurotransmission in CNS may be involved 
  <a rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0210">[42]</a>. Strychnine-induced convulsions are closely linked with glycine inhibition in the spinal cord and the brain stem. The ability to reduce percentage mortality after seizures is suggestive of some potential usefulness of a drug against neurotoxicity which normally causes death following extensive seizures. However, the oil at all the tested doses failed to protect the mice against the strychnine-induced convulsions indicating that the oil or its constituent(s) may not have significant facilitatory effect on the glycine neural circuit 
  <a rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0215">[43]</a>. The anticonvulsant result obtained in this study provides additional justification for the use of this plant in treating epilepsy by the traditional medical practitioners. Generally, this study gives further evidence for the contribution of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> to several CNS activities that have been reported for the plant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical analysis of the essential oil by GC–MS (
  <a rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" href="#tbl0005">Table 1</a>) showed the presence of twenty-three (23) components. Four major classes of compounds were displayed in the chemical profile of the oil which are monoterpenes (24.6%), monoterpenoids (10.9%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (58.7%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (4.8%). The chemical composition of our rhizome oil seems unique when compared to those in literature 
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">[9]</a>. Our results showed marked differences in composition of rhizomes collected from North Central Nigeria in which β-bisabolene (13.9%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-ocimene (9.8%) and myrcene (7.6%) were identified as the major constituents 
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">[9]</a>. Interestingly, the rhizome oil showed a close similarity with an earlier study conducted on a Southwest, Nigerian grown 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> spp. leaf and rhizome essential oils. However, the lower monoterpenes α-pinene and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene and the monoterpene alcohol 1,8-cineol present in our oil were not detected in the previous report 
  <a rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0060">[12]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Nigeria has similar climate with India, reports show that the leaf and rhizome oils from India have varying chemical composition 
  <a rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0220">[44]</a>. Studies on 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> from other regions also confirmed substantial variability in their chemical composition which may be associated with climatic and geographical factors 
  <a rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0225">[45]</a>. There were also global variation in the oil composition of rhizomes from different regions, for instance, α-turmerone (45.3%), linalool (14.9%) and β-turmerone (13.5%) were reported as the main constituent compounds in the oil of the fresh rhizome of Malaysian 
  <span class="italic">C. domestica</span>
  <a rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0230">[46]</a>. While α-phellandrene (24.5%), 1,8-cineole (15.9%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (13.2%) and β-pinene (8.9%) were the major ones in found in the leaf oil of the Vietnam species 
  <a rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0235">[47]</a>. It is however noteworthy that turmerone or its isomers appears to be present in substantial quantity in most species so far reported but the isomeric curlone is being reported here as a constituent of the essential oil of fresh rhizome from Nigeria for the first time. This report therefore confirms that the Nigerian spp. 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> is unique in its chemical composition compare to either 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> from other regions where α-turmerone (20.1%) and ar-turmerone (68.9%) have been reported to be the major constituents of an Iranian 
  <span class="italic">Curcuma</span> species 
  <a rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0240">[48]</a>. The constituent(s) of the oil responsible for the observed neuropharmacological effects could not be ascertained in this study. However, α-phellandrene has been reported to possess both antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect 
  <a rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0245">[49]</a>. Also, 1,8-cineol which is the major constituent of many essential oils especially, 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</span>, has been reported to possess CNS inhibitory activity 
  <a rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0250">[50]</a>, hypotensive activity in rat 
  <a rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0225">[45]</a> and anti-inflammatory activity 
  <a rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0255">[51]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0260">[52]</a>. Moreover, 
  <span class="italic">E. tereticornis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. globulus</span> essential oils have been reported to contain 60–90% of 1,8-cineole 
  <a rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0265">[53]</a> which have also been shown to possess both analgesic and antiinflammatory activities in animals 
  <a rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0250">[50]</a>. Therefore, the prominent components of the oil in the present study, contributed majorly to the central inhibitory activities observed for the oil. In view of the remarkable potentials displayed by the plant, its use in ethnomedicine should further be harnessed. We do not have data concerning the pharmacokinetic of this oil in systemic circulation in humans; hence it is imperative to carry out further studies to unravel this.
