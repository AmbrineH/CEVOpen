  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animals were randomly selected into 5 groups (n = 5). Group I serve as the negative control and received the vehicle (5% Tween 80, 10 ml/kg) only. Test groups II–IV were treated with the EOCL at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg respectively, while group V (positive control) received diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). All treatments were by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and each treatment was administered 30 min prior to test. The oil forms stable emulsion with Tween 80 and was subsequently used in the formulation of the oil while maintaining the concentration of Tween 80 at ≤5% for all the subsequent bioassays.</p>

The novelty-induced behavioural effects scored were rearing (number of times the mouse raised its forepaws in the air or against the wall of the cage for 20 min) and locomotion (the number of squares crossed with all the fore and hind limbs within 10 min).

The level of significance was set at 95% confidence interval (p &lt; 0.05) for all treatment carried out compared to control group. The results of the anticonvulsant tests for percentage mortality or protection were analyzed with Chi square (non-parametric), while the latency to convulsion and time of death after chemo-convulsant treatment were analyzed with ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test.</p>
