 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to induce tonic-clonic convulsions 
  <a rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0125">[25]</a>. Strychnine was administered to different groups of mice (n = 5) as described in previous section. Each mouse in each group was individually monitored for incidence of convulsions, latency of convulsions, death and mortality. Mice that survived beyond 30 min after strychnine injection were considered protected.
