 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acute toxicity (LD
  <sub>50</sub>) of EOCL was determined as described by 
  <a rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0075">[15]</a> via both oral and intraperitoneal routes. Three doses (10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg) of emulsified EOCL were administered to three different groups of mice (n = 3). In the second phase, doses of 1000, 2000, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the oral route because there was no mortality at 1000 mg/kg in this route; while 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the intraperitoneal route because there was 100% mortality at 1000 mg/kg in the first phase for this route. The animals were monitored for 2 h and incidence of mortality recorded after 24 h for each group. The LD
  <sub>50</sub> values were calculated with the following formula:
  <div id="eq0005" class="disp-formula">LD
   <sub>50</sub> = √(A x B),
  </div>Where A and B represent maximum non-lethal and minimum lethal doses respectively
