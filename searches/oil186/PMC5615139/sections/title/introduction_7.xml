 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current trend in natural product research involves identifying and validating plant derived substances used ethno-medicinally in the management of various diseases. Incidentally, essential oils obtained from plant materials have been evaluated extensively for biological activities with promising results. Thus many compounds have been isolated from essential oils with proven potency and providing pharmacological basis for ethno-medicinal uses of several plants. 
  <span class="italic">Curcuma longa</span>, commonly known as turmeric is a tropical herb, native to southern Asia and some parts of Africa. The aromatic yellow powder from its mature rhizomes is extensively used for imparting colour and flavor to food 
  <a rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0005">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0010">[2]</a>. 
  <span class="italic">Curcuma</span> spp. is used worldwide for its antioxidant, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties 
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">[4]</a>. In Southwest Nigeria, the plant especially the rhizome is locally called 
  <span class="italic">Ata ilẹ pupa</span>
  <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">[5]</a>. The rhizome of the plant is normally boiled and sipped but it is also added to other herbal agents to manage several ailments. Its folkloric uses includes the treatment of malaria, jaundice, gastric ulcer, skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, cold and flu symptoms, convulsions and emotional disorders

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several pharmacological properties have been reported for curcumin, a major component of the alcohol extract of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. domestica</span> rhizomes 
  <a rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0040">[8]</a>. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span> has been reported to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and ketones 
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0050">[10]</a>. Terpinolene and α-phellandrene have been identified as the predominant constituents of leaf oil of a Nigerian grown 
  <span class="italic">C. longa</span>
  <a rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0055">[11]</a>, while 
  <a rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0060">[12]</a> reported a different chemotype α-tumerone from Southwest Nigeria. The main focus of previous research study was on the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and other nutritional properties of the plant as well as on curcumin, ethanolic extract of the rhizome. However, there has been no report on the central nervous system effects of the plant, this study therefore aimed at evaluating the 
  <span class="italic">in-vivo</span> neuropharmacological activity, determine the acute toxicity profile and investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the studied species since there were different chemotypes of the Nigerian 
  <span class="italic">C longa</span>. Therefore this study reveals the contribution of the plant’s volatile component to its central nervous system activities, toxicological profile and provides rationale for its ethnomedicinal uses.
