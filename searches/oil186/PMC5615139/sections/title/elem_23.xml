  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PTZ was used to induce tonic-clonic convulsions 
   <a rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0115">[23]</a>. PTZ (85 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to different groups of mice (n = 5), which were pretreated with 5% Tween 80, oil (50,100 or 200 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg) for 30 min. Each mouse in each group was individually monitored for incidence of convulsions, latency of convulsions, death and mortality. Mice that survived beyond 30 min after PTZ injection were considered protected 
   <a rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0120">[24]</a>. Cut-off time of 1800 s was used for mice that did not convulse or died within 30 min for the purpose of statistical analysis.
