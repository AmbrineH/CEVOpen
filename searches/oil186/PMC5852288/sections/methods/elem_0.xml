  <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Freshly fermented cocoa beans (4 Kg) were divided into two different groups (G1 and G2). The first group (G1) was dried in an electric air-dried oven at 45 °C for a period of 48 h. The dried beans were then divided into 05 sub-groups of 200 g each (SG0, SG1, SG2, SG3 and SG4). SG1 and SG2 samples were traditionally roasted in cooking pot by continuous stirring for 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes 
   <span class="italic">DTRCB 5</span>
   <span class="italic">min</span> and 
   <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> respectively. The temperature between the heat source and cooking pot was ranged between 200–220 °C. SG3 and SG4 were also roasted, but in the oven at 180 °C for a period of 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes 
   <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
   <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> respectively. SG0 served as dried control and was coded 
   <span class="italic">DCB</span>. G2 was extracted fresh and served as unprocessed control and was coded

    <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">[13]</a>. The beans were separately grinded to pass 1 mm sieve. Eighty grams of each power was separately macerated in 400 mL of hexane at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking. After that, the mixture was filtered using the Whatman paper N°1, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotatory evaporator at 40 °C. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis. The remaining solid fractions were dried in the oven at 50 °C for the determination of their proximate composition.

    <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">[14]</a>. About 80 g of beans were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 mL of chloroform and 200 mL of methanol were subsequently added. The mixture was grinded for 3 min; followed by the addition of 100 mL of chloroform and 100 mL of distilled water. The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered. The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol and water respectively. After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous. The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45 °C under reduced pressure. The extracted oil was stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis.

In a test tube of 5 mL volume, 20 μl of a 2 mg/mL extract solution of cocoa beans was added, followed by the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (0.2 mL) and distilled water (2 mL). After 3 min incubation of the solution mixture at room temperature, 1 mL of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added and the mixture re-incubated for 20 min under the same conditions. The absorbance of the resulting blue-coloured solution was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer. The total phenolic content of the extract was calculated from the gallic acid standard curve, and expressed as milligrams equivalents gallic acid per gram of extract.
