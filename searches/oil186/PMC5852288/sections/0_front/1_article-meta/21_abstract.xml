 <p>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of oven and traditional roasting on the polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, lipid quality, proximate composition and mineral content of fermented cocoa beans. Results showed that traditional roasting significantly decrease (p &lt; 0.05) the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity of cocoa beans. The analysis of oil showed that oven and traditional roasting significantly increase (p &lt; 0.05) the peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values of cocoa butter and that traditional roasting samples were the most deteriorated. Oven and traditional roasting for 10 min reduce the iodine value of the oil, but increase its acidity. The proximate and mineral composition of cocoa beans was also seriously affected during cooking. Drying and oven roasting for 5 and 10 min; and drying and traditional roasting for 5 min appear to be the best processing methods of cocoa beans for production of cocoa based foods like chocolate.</p>
