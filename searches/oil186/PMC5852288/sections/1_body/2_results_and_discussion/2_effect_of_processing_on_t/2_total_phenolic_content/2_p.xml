<p id="p0090">The changes in total polyphenol of processed cocoa beans samples compared to the control 
 <italic>(DCB)</italic> are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in polyphenol content was registered in 
 <italic>DTRCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DTRCB 10 min</italic>, meaning that the traditional roasting has significantly affected the polyphenol of this sample. It is also observed that, the rate of reduction of the total polyphenol was increasing with roasting time. However, no significant difference was observed between the samples roasted in the oven (
 <italic>DORCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DORCB 10 min</italic>) compared to the control 
 <italic>(DCB)</italic>. From these observations, it clearly appears that, oven roasting preserve better the total polyphenol of cocoa beans compared to the traditional roasting. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in total polyphenol registered in 
 <italic>DTRCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DTRCB 10 min</italic> compared to 
 <italic>DORCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DORCB 10 min</italic> might be attributed to the high processing temperature, because the traditional roasting temperature (200–220 °C) was higher than the oven roasting temperature (180 °C). It has been proven that at high temperature, low molecular weight phenolic compounds easily volatilize. These results are in agreement with those of Endraiyani
