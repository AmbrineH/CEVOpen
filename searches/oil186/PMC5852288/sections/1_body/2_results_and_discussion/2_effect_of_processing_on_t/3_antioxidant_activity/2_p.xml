 <italic>DORCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DORCB 10 min</italic>. These results are in accordance with those previously obtained with the total polyphenol, because samples which exhibited low polyphenol content also exhibited lowest antiradical activity. In previous studies, the relation between polyphenol concentration and antioxidant activity has been demonstrated [

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> who showed that the decrease in antioxidant activity of cocoa beans during roasting was related to the destruction of their polyphenols.
