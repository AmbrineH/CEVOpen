 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The changes in peroxide value of cocoa bean oil samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. A significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in PV was registered in almost all the processed samples compared to the controls 
 <italic class="italic">(FCB</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DCB)</italic>. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the PV of controls 
 <italic class="italic">(FCB and DCB)</italic> and that of 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic>. Among the processed samples, 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</italic> were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) primarily oxidized compared to 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 10 min</italic> respectively. Apart of 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</italic> who exhibited a PV higher than the recommended value which is 10 meq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/Kg 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref>; all samples have presented a PV in the accepted range 1–10 meq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/Kg. This indicates that the formation rate of hydroperoxides was elevated with traditional roasting than oven roasting. It has been demonstrated that, heat facilitates the initiation of lipid oxidation which leads to the formation of free radicals, which can easily react with molecular oxygen and form hydroperoxides at the propagation stage 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. So, the high PV of traditionally roasted cocoa beans oil indicates its poor resistance towards peroxidation during storage. These results are in line with those reported by Tenyang et al. 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[11]</xref>, who showed that the peroxide values of oils extracted from two varieties of sesame seeds was increasing with the roasting temperature and time.
