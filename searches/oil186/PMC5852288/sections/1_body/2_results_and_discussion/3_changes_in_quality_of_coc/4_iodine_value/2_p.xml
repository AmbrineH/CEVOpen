<p id="p0110">The degree of unsaturation of oils and fats is generally measured through the determination of the iodine value. Generally, during lipid oxidation, the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids are attacked by free radicals, resulting in the reduction of the number of unsaturation 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The changes in IV of cocoa bean oil samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in Iodine value was registered in 
 <italic>DTRCB 10 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DORCB 10 min</italic> compared to 
 <italic>DTRCB 5 min, DORCB 5 min</italic> and controls 
 <italic>(FCB and DCB)</italic>. This indicates that traditional and oven roasting for 10 min significantly alter (p &lt; 0.05) the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids of cocoa bean oil. However, the iodine values of 
 <italic>DORCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DTRCB 5 min</italic>, were similar (p &gt; 0.01) to those of 
 <italic>controls (FCB and DCB)</italic>, meaning that these oil samples were less affected by the treatment. It is however important to note that the iodine values obtained in this work were ranged between 30–35 gI
 <sub>2</sub>/100 g as recommended by the regulation

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> who demonstrated that heating of palm olein at 180 °C significantly reduce its iodine value.
