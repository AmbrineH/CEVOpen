<p id="p0110" class="p">The degree of unsaturation of oils and fats is generally measured through the determination of the iodine value. Generally, during lipid oxidation, the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids are attacked by free radicals, resulting in the reduction of the number of unsaturation
