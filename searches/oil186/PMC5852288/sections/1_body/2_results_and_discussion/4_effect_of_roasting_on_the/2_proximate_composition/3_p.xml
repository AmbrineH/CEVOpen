<p id="p0125" class="p">The analysis of the macronutrients composition showed that cocoa beans are rich in lipids (38.16–41.23%), proteins (15.54–17.91%) and carbohydrates (27.67–30.78 %). The amount of lipids was similar to that reported by Amaiz et al

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[31]</xref> who showed that, the lipids content of cocoa beans varied between 45.42 and 46.27%. Those of proteins and carbohydrates were closed to the data reported by Rucker 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[4]</xref> who demonstrated that the protein and carbohydrate content of cocoa beans fall in the ranges 18–19% and 45–55% respectively. Generally, the amount of lipids was significantly reducing (p &lt; 0.05) with the treatments. These results are in agreement with those reported by Amaiz et al

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[31]</xref> and Ajala and Ojewande 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref> who have proven that the amount of lipids of cocoa beans reduces with processing. Similar tendencies were observed with the protein content of these samples. This can be attributed to the involvement of proteins in non-enzymatic browning reactions. Similar results were obtained by Ajala and Ojewande 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref> during drying of fermented cocoa beans. Concerning the total carbohydrates content, its amount was significantly increasing (p &lt; 0.05) in the oven and traditionally roasted cocoa beans samples compared to the control. These results are not in agreement with those of Ihemeje et al

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[32]</xref> who demonstrated that the amount of carbohydrate of walnut seeds significantly decreases (p &lt; 0.05) with the treatments. However, they are in accordance with those of Tenyang et al

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[11]</xref> who showed that roasting of white sesame seeds at 120 °C for 30 min considerably increases its carbohydrates content.
