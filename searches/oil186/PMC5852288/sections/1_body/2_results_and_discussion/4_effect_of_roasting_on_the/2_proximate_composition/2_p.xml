<p id="p0120" class="p">The changes in proximate composition of cocoa beans during processing are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The moisture content obtained in this study varies from 3.98 to 6.40% and is similar to that reported by Ajala and Ojewande 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref>. These authors reported that the amount of moisture in cocoa beans falls between 4.96 and 7.00% during drying at different temperatures. A significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in moisture content of cocoa beans was registered with 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 5 min, DTRCB 10 min</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 10 min</italic> compared to the control 
 <italic class="italic">(DCB)</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic>. However, no difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the amount of moisture of 
 <italic class="italic">DCB</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic>. High temperatures generally contribute to the reduction of the moisture content of foods to a minimum value. Abiola and Tewe 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[29]</xref> have reported that, the key factors for long shelf life of cocoa powder are the reduction of its moisture content which will reduce the water activity and inhibit several chemical reactions and biological activities which can reduce the quality of food. From the same table (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), it appears that the amount of ash varied from 7.25 to 9.15%. Similar range was reported in cocoa beans by Ndjife et al
 <italic class="italic">.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[30]</xref>. No significant difference was observed between the ash content of the control 
 <italic class="italic">(DCB)</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 5 min,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic>. However, the total ash content of 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 10 min</italic> were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) compared to those above mentioned. This suggests that oven and traditional roasting increase the amount of ash in cocoa beans. These results are in agreement with those of Amaiz et al
 <italic class="italic">.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[31]</xref> who demonstrated that, the ash content of cocoa beans was increasing with roasting. However, these results were not in accordance with those of Ajala and Ojewande 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref> who showed that the ash content of cocoa beans decreases with the elevation of the temperature.
