 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The changes in potassium content revealed that traditional and oven roasting for 10 min significantly reduce the concentration in this mineral in cocoa beans compared to 
 <italic>DCB, DTRCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DORCB 5 min</italic>. The amount of potassium in dried cocoa beans (947.22 mg/100 g) was lower than 1248.62 and 1199.66 mg/100 g as reported by Torres-Moreno et al

 <italic>DTRCB 10 min</italic>, while it was significantly low in 
 <italic>DORCB 10 min</italic> (51.00 mg/100 g). This indicates that oven roasting of cocoa beans for 10 min or more is not suitable for the preservation of sodium. The amount of calcium was significantly decreasing in all the roasted samples compared to the
