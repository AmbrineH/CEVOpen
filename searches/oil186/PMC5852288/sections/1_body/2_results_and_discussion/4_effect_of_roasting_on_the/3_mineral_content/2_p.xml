<p id="p0130">The changes in mineral composition of cocoa beans during processing are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Results show that cocoa beans contain various minerals element, that play important functions in the human body such as many enzymatic reactions, energy production, transmission of nerve impulses and multiple biological reactions 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It is clearly observed that the amount of iron has significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) with traditional roasting (59.12 and 53.78 mg/100g for 
 <italic>DTRCB 5 min</italic> and 
 <italic>DTRCB 10 min</italic> respectively) compared to the control 
 <italic>(DCB)</italic> (51.11 mg/100 g). However, oven drying significantly reduced the concentration in this mineral. The increase in iron registered with traditional roasting can be attributed to the fact that traditional roasting temperature increases the digestibility of walnut seeds, and then initiates the release and increase of iron 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The amount of iron was reducing with processing time. Globally, the amount of iron of all the samples was ranged between 42.26–59.12 mg/100g, which is higher than 10–15 mg/100 g as reported by Rucker 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> in dried cocoa beans. This mineral is an essential part of the respiratory pigments, myoglobin, haemoglobin and many enzymes. Its deficiency leads to anaemia, which is one of the most severe nutritional disorders in the world
