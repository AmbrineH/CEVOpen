<p id="p0050">Oils were extracted from fresh cocoa beans 
 <italic>(FCB)</italic> by the method described by Bligh and Dyer 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. About 80 g of beans were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 mL of chloroform and 200 mL of methanol were subsequently added. The mixture was grinded for 3 min; followed by the addition of 100 mL of chloroform and 100 mL of distilled water. The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered. The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol and water respectively. After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous. The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45 °C under reduced pressure. The extracted oil was stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis.
