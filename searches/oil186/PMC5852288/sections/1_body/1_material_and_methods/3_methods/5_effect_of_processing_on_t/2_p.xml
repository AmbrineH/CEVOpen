 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In a test tube of 5 mL volume, 20 μl of a 2 mg/mL extract solution of cocoa beans was added, followed by the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (0.2 mL) and distilled water (2 mL). After 3 min incubation of the solution mixture at room temperature, 1 mL of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added and the mixture re-incubated for 20 min under the same conditions. The absorbance of the resulting blue-coloured solution was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer. The total phenolic content of the extract was calculated from the gallic acid standard curve, and expressed as milligrams equivalents gallic acid per gram of extract.
