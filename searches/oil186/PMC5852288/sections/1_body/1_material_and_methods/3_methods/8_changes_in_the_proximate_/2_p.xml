<p id="p0075" class="p">The proximate composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Theobroma cacao</italic> beans was determined by evaluating the following parameters: Moisture, fat, ash and protein contents, using the standard methods described by AOAC 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[20]</xref>. The moisture content was evaluated by drying cocoa beans in the oven at 103 °C until constant weight, according to the AOAC method 925.40 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[20]</xref>. The ash content was obtained by incineration of the beans at 550 °C, following the AOAC procedure 924.05 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[20]</xref>. The Nitrogen (N) content was determined using the micro-Kjeldahl, as described in the AOAC procedure 984.13. The protein content was then calculated as N x 6.25. The lipid contain was determined on a Soxhlet apparatus using hexane, following the AOAC 963.15 method 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[20]</xref>. The total carbohydrate content was determined by difference as reported by Onyeike et al
 <italic class="italic">.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[21]</xref>. This technique involves adding the total values of crude fat, proteins, moisture and ash constituents of the sample and subtracting it from 100. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
