 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Cocoa beans that are not roasted have bitter, acidic, astringent and nutty flavor. By roasting the cocoa beans, acidity is decreased by reducing the concentration of volatile acids 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[7]</xref>. However, processing may also cause chemical changes that may decrease the nutritional value and the antioxidant property of the beans. This can negatively affect the potential health benefits arising from the consumption of cocoa beans. For example, high processing temperature can promote lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic browning, which have the property to decrease the nutritional value of foods by causing a loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and digestible carbohydrates. They also lead to the destruction of vitamins and the reduction of protein digestibility
