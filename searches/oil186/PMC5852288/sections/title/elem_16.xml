The increase in iron registered with traditional roasting can be attributed to the fact that traditional roasting temperature increases the digestibility of walnut seeds, and then initiates the release and increase of iron 
    <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">[34]</a>. The amount of iron was reducing with processing time. Globally, the amount of iron of all the samples was ranged between 42.26–59.12 mg/100g, which is higher than 10–15 mg/100 g as reported by Rucker
