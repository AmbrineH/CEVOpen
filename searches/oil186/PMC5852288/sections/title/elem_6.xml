   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">[13]</a>. The beans were separately grinded to pass 1 mm sieve. Eighty grams of each power was separately macerated in 400 mL of hexane at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking. After that, the mixture was filtered using the Whatman paper N°1, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotatory evaporator at 40 °C. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis. The remaining solid fractions were dried in the oven at 50 °C for the determination of their proximate composition.

   <span class="italic">(FCB)</span> by the method described by Bligh and Dyer 
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">[14]</a>. About 80 g of beans were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 mL of chloroform and 200 mL of methanol were subsequently added. The mixture was grinded for 3 min; followed by the addition of 100 mL of chloroform and 100 mL of distilled water. The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered. The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol and water respectively. After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous. The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45 °C under reduced pressure. The extracted oil was stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis.
