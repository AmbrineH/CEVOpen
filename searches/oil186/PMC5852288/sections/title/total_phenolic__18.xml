  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in polyphenol content was registered in 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span>, meaning that the traditional roasting has significantly affected the polyphenol of this sample. It is also observed that, the rate of reduction of the total polyphenol was increasing with roasting time. However, no significant difference was observed between the samples roasted in the oven (
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span>) compared to the control 
  <span class="italic">(DCB)</span>. From these observations, it clearly appears that, oven roasting preserve better the total polyphenol of cocoa beans compared to the traditional roasting. A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in total polyphenol registered in 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> compared to 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> might be attributed to the high processing temperature, because the traditional roasting temperature (200–220 °C) was higher than the oven roasting temperature (180 °C). It has been proven that at high temperature, low molecular weight phenolic compounds easily volatilize. These results are in agreement with those of Endraiyani 
  <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">[23]</a> who demonstrated that the total polyphenol of cocoa pulps significantly decrease with the number of pasteurization. They are also in accordance with those of Rizki et al

  <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">[10]</a> who showed that, the total phenolic content of sesame seeds significantly decrease with roasting time.
