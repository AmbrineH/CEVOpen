 <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The changes in mineral composition of cocoa beans during processing are presented in 
  <a rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>. Results show that cocoa beans contain various minerals element, that play important functions in the human body such as many enzymatic reactions, energy production, transmission of nerve impulses and multiple biological reactions 
  <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">[33]</a>. It is clearly observed that the amount of iron has significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) with traditional roasting (59.12 and 53.78 mg/100g for 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> respectively) compared to the control 
  <span class="italic">(DCB)</span> (51.11 mg/100 g). However, oven drying significantly reduced the concentration in this mineral. The increase in iron registered with traditional roasting can be attributed to the fact that traditional roasting temperature increases the digestibility of walnut seeds, and then initiates the release and increase of iron 
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">[34]</a>. The amount of iron was reducing with processing time. Globally, the amount of iron of all the samples was ranged between 42.26–59.12 mg/100g, which is higher than 10–15 mg/100 g as reported by Rucker 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">[4]</a> in dried cocoa beans. This mineral is an essential part of the respiratory pigments, myoglobin, haemoglobin and many enzymes. Its deficiency leads to anaemia, which is one of the most severe nutritional disorders in the world

 <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerning the phosphorus, a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in its concentration compared to the control 
  <span class="italic">(DCB)</span> was registered in 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span>, and were respectively 16.72 and 11.56 mg/100 g, while that of 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> considerably increased to 26.97 mg/100 g. This shows that traditional roasting for 10 min is the best treatment to increase the amount of phosphorus in cocoa beans. Together with calcium, they plays crucial roles in bones mineralization 
  <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">[36]</a>. The changes in potassium content revealed that traditional and oven roasting for 10 min significantly reduce the concentration in this mineral in cocoa beans compared to 
  <span class="italic">DCB, DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>. The amount of potassium in dried cocoa beans (947.22 mg/100 g) was lower than 1248.62 and 1199.66 mg/100 g as reported by Torres-Moreno et al
  <span class="italic">.</span>
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">[37]</a> in cocoa beans from Ecuador and Ghana respectively. Talking about the sodium, no significant difference was observed between its concentrations in 
  <span class="italic">DCB, DTRCB 5 min, DORCB 5min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span>, while it was significantly low in 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> (51.00 mg/100 g). This indicates that oven roasting of cocoa beans for 10 min or more is not suitable for the preservation of sodium. The amount of calcium was significantly decreasing in all the roasted samples compared to the 
  <span class="italic">control (DCB)</span>. The calcium content of 
  <span class="italic">DCB</span> was 229.25 mg/100 g and was higher than to that reported by Torres-Moreno et al
