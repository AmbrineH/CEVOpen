  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">[13]</a>. The beans were separately grinded to pass 1 mm sieve. Eighty grams of each power was separately macerated in 400 mL of hexane at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking. After that, the mixture was filtered using the Whatman paper N°1, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotatory evaporator at 40 °C. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for further analysis. The remaining solid fractions were dried in the oven at 50 °C for the determination of their proximate composition.
