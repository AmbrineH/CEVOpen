  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the acid value of 
  <span class="italic">FCB, DCB, DTRCB 5 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 5 min</span>; meaning that the hydrolytic activities were less in these samples. However, the acid value of 
  <span class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</span> and 
  <span class="italic">DORCB 10 min</span> were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05). This might be attributed to the thermal hydrolysis of triglycerides of these samples. The acid value in all the samples was lower than 4 mg KOH/g which is the recommended acid value in crude oils
