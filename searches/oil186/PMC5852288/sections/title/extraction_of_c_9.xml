The extract was filtered with a Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and residue was again extracted with 200 mL of methanol to ensure maximum extraction of phenolic compounds. The combined filtrates were subjected to rotary evaporation at 40 °C under reduced pressure for the removal of the solvent. The dried extract was used for further analysis.
