<p>The growth of the standard and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was inhibited by 
 <italic>Salvia mirzayanii</italic> essential oil at concentrations of 0.0.13 and 0.32 μL/mL, respectively. In a previous study, MIC for this essential oil to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was 2.5 ± 0.3 and for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus hydrangea</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus santolinifolia</italic> it was 15 μL/mL.

 </sup> Thus, it seems that our samples are more effective than previous samples. The proper effects of this essential oil on these resistant bacteria may be related to different antibacterial mechanisms of essential oils in comparison to β-lactam antibiotics.
