<p class="p">According to previous studies, the predominant antimicrobial activity of essential oil are the cell wall and cell membranes damages follow by cell lysis and leakage of cell content such as K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. Antimicrobial functions of essential oil severely depend on their chemical composition. Essential oils with hydrophobic characteristic penetrate microbial membrane, interfere in constitution of cell wall/membranes, and destruct cellular activities.

 </sup> In gram-positive bacteria, hydrophobiciy of bacterial and cytoplasmic membrane is affected by essential oil, while in gram-positive bacteria they unable to penetrate bacteria cell wall.

 </sup> Some other accepted mechanisms of essential oil antimicrobial effects are inhibition of biochemical pathway, inhibition of protective enzymes, and enhancement of update of other antimicrobials.

 </sup> Beside these general antimicrobial mechanism of essential oil, monoterpenes increase membrane fluidity and permeability, changing the topology of membrane proteins and disturbing the respiration chain.
