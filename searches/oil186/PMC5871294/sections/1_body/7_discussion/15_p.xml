<p>It seems that the MICs and MBCs of the essential oil against the examined gram-negative bacteria were higher than gram-positive bacteria. This evidence was similar to results of other studies.

 </sup> It seems that resistance of gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobials could be related to structure and composition of their cell envelope. Presence of peptidoglycan layer, phospholipids, and lipopolysaccharides in outer membrane make the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria more complex. This lipopolysaccharide coverage limits diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through this barrier. However, without this obstruction, the membrane permeation is more easily in gram-positive bacteria.
