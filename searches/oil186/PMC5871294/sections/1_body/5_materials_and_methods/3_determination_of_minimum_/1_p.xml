 </sup> Briefly, for determination of antifungal activities, serial dilutions of the essential oil (0.031-128 µL/mL) were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates using RPMI-1640 media (Sigma, St Louis, MO) buffered with MOPS (Sigma). To determine the antibacterial activities, serial dilutions of the compounds (0.031-128 µL/mL) were prepared in Muller-Hinton media (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). For yeasts and bacteria, stock inoculums were prepared by suspending 3 colonies of the examined microorganisms in 5 mL sterile 0.85% NaCl, and adjusting the turbidity of the inoculums to 0.5 McFarland standards at 630 nm wavelength (this yields stock suspension of 1-5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL for yeasts and 1-1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria). Working suspension was prepared by making a 1/1000 dilution of the stock suspension with RPMI or Muller-Hintonbroth for yeasts and bacteria, respectively. To each well of the microtiter plates, 0.1 mL of the working inoculums was added and the plates were incubated in a humid atmosphere at 30°C for 24 to 48 hours (fungi) or at 37°C for 24 hours (bacteria). Two hundred microliters of un-inoculated medium was included as a sterility control (blank). In addition, growth controls (medium with inoculums but without the essential oil) were also included. The growth in each well was compared with that of the growth control well. MICs were visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of the compounds produced ≥50% and ≥95% growth inhibition for fungi and ≥95% growth reduction for bacteria compared with the growth control wells. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
