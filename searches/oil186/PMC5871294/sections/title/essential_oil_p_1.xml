 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> were harvested before the flowering stage in September 2012 from southern regions of Iran, Bandar Abbas (Hormozgan province), and was identified and confirmed (Voucher No. 663) by Dr Mahmoodreza Moein in the Museum of Medicinal Plants, Department of Pharmacognosy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In brief, dried leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> were ground in a grinder and 30 g of powder was hydrodistilled during 4 hours by Clevenger-type apparatus (yield 2.45%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, stored at low temperature (4°C) until tested, and analyzed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil analysis was performed using gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies Model 5975 C). The gas chromatograph was also provided a capillary column 60 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 mm. The oven program was as follows: temperature increase from 60°C at a rate of 5°C/min up to 250°C and finally held for 10 minutes. The transfer line temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min with a split ratio equal to 1/50. The quadrupole mass spectrometer was scanned over 35 to 465 amu with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and an ionization current of 150 mA.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The injector and mass spectrometry transfer line temperatures were set at 250°C. Kovat’s indices (KI) was determined by using retention times of 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C9-C5) that were injected after the essential oil under the same chromatographic conditions. Tentative identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their relative retention time and mass spectra with Wiley 275 and Adams data libraries for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry as well as those reported previously.
