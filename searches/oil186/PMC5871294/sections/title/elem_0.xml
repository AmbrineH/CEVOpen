   <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> were harvested before the flowering stage in September 2012 from southern regions of Iran, Bandar Abbas (Hormozgan province), and was identified and confirmed (Voucher No. 663) by Dr Mahmoodreza Moein in the Museum of Medicinal Plants, Department of Pharmacognosy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In brief, dried leaves of 
   <span class="italic">Salvia mirzayanii</span> were ground in a grinder and 30 g of powder was hydrodistilled during 4 hours by Clevenger-type apparatus (yield 2.45%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, stored at low temperature (4°C) until tested, and analyzed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil analysis was performed using gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies Model 5975 C). The gas chromatograph was also provided a capillary column 60 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 mm. The oven program was as follows: temperature increase from 60°C at a rate of 5°C/min up to 250°C and finally held for 10 minutes. The transfer line temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min with a split ratio equal to 1/50. The quadrupole mass spectrometer was scanned over 35 to 465 amu with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and an ionization current of 150 mA.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The injector and mass spectrometry transfer line temperatures were set at 250°C. Kovat’s indices (KI) was determined by using retention times of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C9-C5) that were injected after the essential oil under the same chromatographic conditions. Tentative identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their relative retention time and mass spectra with Wiley 275 and Adams data libraries for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry as well as those reported previously.

   </span> Briefly, for determination of antifungal activities, serial dilutions of the essential oil (0.031-128 µL/mL) were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates using RPMI-1640 media (Sigma, St Louis, MO) buffered with MOPS (Sigma). To determine the antibacterial activities, serial dilutions of the compounds (0.031-128 µL/mL) were prepared in Muller-Hinton media (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). For yeasts and bacteria, stock inoculums were prepared by suspending 3 colonies of the examined microorganisms in 5 mL sterile 0.85% NaCl, and adjusting the turbidity of the inoculums to 0.5 McFarland standards at 630 nm wavelength (this yields stock suspension of 1-5 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/mL for yeasts and 1-1.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/mL for bacteria). Working suspension was prepared by making a 1/1000 dilution of the stock suspension with RPMI or Muller-Hintonbroth for yeasts and bacteria, respectively. To each well of the microtiter plates, 0.1 mL of the working inoculums was added and the plates were incubated in a humid atmosphere at 30°C for 24 to 48 hours (fungi) or at 37°C for 24 hours (bacteria). Two hundred microliters of un-inoculated medium was included as a sterility control (blank). In addition, growth controls (medium with inoculums but without the essential oil) were also included. The growth in each well was compared with that of the growth control well. MICs were visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of the compounds produced ≥50% and ≥95% growth inhibition for fungi and ≥95% growth reduction for bacteria compared with the growth control wells. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, media from wells with fungi showing no visible growth were further cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and from wells with bacteria showing no visible growth on Muller-Hinton agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to determine the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. MFCs and MBCs were determined as the lowest concentration yielding no more than 4 colonies, which corresponds to a mortality of 98% of the microorganisms in the initial inoculums.</p>
