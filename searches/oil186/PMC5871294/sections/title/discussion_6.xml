Presence of peptidoglycan layer, phospholipids, and lipopolysaccharides in outer membrane make the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria more complex. This lipopolysaccharide coverage limits diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through this barrier. However, without this obstruction, the membrane permeation is more easily in gram-positive bacteria.
