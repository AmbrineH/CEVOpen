 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we report cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">B. salicifolius</span>. This essential oil is a promising cytotoxic agent by its action and selectivity demonstrated here, and is a diverse source of molecules that may have an important role in drug discovery for the treatment of estrogen-receptor negative tumors, which has been a challenge in oncology. Moreover, the antifungal action of this essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span>, the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, shows potential to be used in the treatment of this mycosis. Thus, relevant biological activities and high yield of the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">B. salicifolius</span> means it is a source of molecules to be exploited for medicine and by the pharmaceutical industry.
