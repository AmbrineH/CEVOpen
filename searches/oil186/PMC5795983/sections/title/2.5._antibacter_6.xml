  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and

  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene and Î±-pinene may be responsible for a certain effect against the MRSA and MSSA strains, since other authors have reported antibacterial activity against

In general, essential oils are more effective against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacterial strains, because the outer membrane surrounding the cell wall restricts the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through the lipopolysaccharide covering [
