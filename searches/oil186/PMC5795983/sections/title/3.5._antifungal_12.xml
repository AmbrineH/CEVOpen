 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5. Antifungal Activity</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tested strains were obtained from ATCC and the Laboratory of Fungi Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, São Paulo State University (UNESP-Botucatu Campus). No ATCC strains were molecularly identified and deposited at GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The following microorganisms were used in the evaluation of antifungal activity of the essential oil: 
  <span class="italic">Candida krusei</span> (ATCC 6258), 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> (ATCC 36801), 
  <span class="italic">Candida guilliermondii</span> (ATCC 22017), 
  <span class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</span> (ATCC 90018), 
  <span class="italic">Candida orthopsilosis</span> (ATCC 96141), 
  <span class="italic">Candida metapsilosis</span> (ATCC 96142), 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> (ATCC 90012), 
  <span class="italic">Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</span> (strain TLM17LM2, GenBank accession number KX774393, yeast form), 
  <span class="italic">Microsporum canis</span> (strain RS5, GenBank accession number KT443098) and 
  <span class="italic">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</span> (ATCC 11480). A microdilution broth susceptibility assay for yeasts and filamentous fungi was performed, as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
  <a rid="B65-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijms-19-00033">65</a>,
  <a rid="B66-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijms-19-00033">66</a>], with some adaptations. Assays were performed on 96-well microplates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with RPMI-1640 supplemented with glutamine without sodium bicarbonate (Cultilab, Campinas, Brazil). A sample of essential oil was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Synth, São Paulo) and a serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 2.44 to 5000 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The final DMSO concentration was 3% (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>). For inoculums, adjustment of yeast (
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. brasiliensis</span>) was performed using microscopic enumeration with a cell-counting hematocytometer (Neubauer chamber, Knittel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) from the initial growth at RPMI-1640 medium. 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp. was grown at 37 °C for 48 h, 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span> at 37 °C for 72 h and 
  <span class="italic">P. brasiliensis</span> at 35 °C for 10 days. After counting, the inoculums were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> cell mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Filamentous fungi, 
  <span class="italic">M. canis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</span>, were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) for 7 days at 25 °C before counting. Cell counting in a Neubauer chamber was also performed, and microplates were inoculated with a final concentration of 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cell mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The tested systems were incubated in a humid atmosphere, with agitation, at 37 °C for 48 h for 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp. and 72 h for 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans. P. brasiliensis</span> was incubated for 14 days at 35 °C with agitation and 
  <span class="italic">M. canis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</span> for 10 days at 25 °C without agitation. The experiment was performed in six replicates and the growth inhibition was determined by measuring turbidity of the cultured medium at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as positive control. Controls of sterility of the broth, control culture (inoculum), essential oil and DMSO (3%) were performed.
