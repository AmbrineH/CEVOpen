 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiments were performed with standard strains from ATCC and clinical isolates (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) obtained from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, São Paulo State University (UNESP-Botucatu Campus). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the use of isolated microorganisms was approved by the Institutional Committee on Human Research (number 47186415.0.0000.5411-8 March, 2015), according to the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, and the strains were submitted to biochemical tests for phenotypic confirmation of the species [
  <a rid="B67-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijms-19-00033">67</a>]. The following microorganisms were used: methicillin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MRSA) (ATCC 33591), methicillin-sensitive 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MSSA) (ATCC 25923), 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC 43895) and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (ATCC 27853). Susceptibility assays were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
  <a rid="B68-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijms-19-00033">68</a>] on 96-well microplates (Costar) with Mueller Hinton broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) culture medium. The sample of essential oil was dissolved in DMSO (Synth, 160,000 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 2.44 to 5000 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The final DMSO concentration was 3% (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>). Bacterial strains were grown (37 °C for 18–24 h) in brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco) and, after standardization by 0.5 McFarland scale, were inoculated (around 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> cfu·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) in wells at concentrations previously prepared. After incubation (37 °C for 18–24 h), the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each strain was visually recorded after addition of 50 μL of resazurin (0.01%) in respective wells. Polymyxin B (Latinofarma, Cotia, Brazil) was used as a positive control for Gram-negative bacteria and Cephalothin (Latinofarma) for Gram-positive bacteria. Controls of sterility of the broth, culture control (inoculum), essential oil and DMSO (3%) were performed.
