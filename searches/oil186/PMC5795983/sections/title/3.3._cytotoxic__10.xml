 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sample of the essential oil was solubilized in methanol (Synth, São Paulo, Brazil) and diluted in supplemented Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a stock solution of 640 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Cell viability was tested with cell lines from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). MCF-7 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor positive; ATCC HTB-22) and MDA-MB-231 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor negative; ATCC HTB-26) breast cancer cell lines, and the MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial cells; ATCC CRL-10317) normal breast cell line, were selected for cytotoxicity assays. A solution containing 1 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cells in 100 μL of supplemented DMEM was pipetted into each well and the plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C, with a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>, allowing cell adhesion in wells. Once attached and after removal of the culture medium, the stock solution of essential oil was added to the microplate and a serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 4 to 512 μg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. For this analysis, the controls of cell growth, solvent (methanol 3%), samples and negative control (100% lysed cells) were performed. Microplates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Next, a revealing solution of resazurin (3 mM) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each well [

Readings of absorbance at 595 nm were performed using a Multiskan GO Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Assays were performed in six replicates and the results of absorbance were calculated according to the growth control. The cytotoxic concentration at which 50% of the cells are viable (CC
  <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by a dose-response graph of nonlinear regression.
