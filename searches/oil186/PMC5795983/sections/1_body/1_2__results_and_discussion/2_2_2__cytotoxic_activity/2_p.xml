<p>The essential oil was toxic against MDA-MB-231 (46.60 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) cancer cell lines. MDA-MB-231 cells, which represent an aggressive phenotype, responded more favorably to the cytotoxic effect of the essential oil than the less-aggressive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Several difficulties are associated with the treatment of estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cells because these usually have poor prognosis and hormone therapies are not effective [
