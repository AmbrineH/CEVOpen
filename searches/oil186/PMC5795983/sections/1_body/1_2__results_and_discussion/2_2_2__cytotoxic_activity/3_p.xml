<p>The normal breast cell line, MCF-10A (314.44 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), was around sevenfold more resistant to essential oil action than MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. A relationship between normal breast cell lines and breast cancer cell lines was established through the selectivity index (SI) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-00033-t002">Table 2</xref>) in order to check specificity. A positive SI value is desirable, and represents more selectivity against cancer cells than toxicity to normal cells. The negative value of SI for MCF-7 (−0.21) showed selectivity by normal cells, but the SI for the MDA-MB-231 cells was 0.83, which means selectivity by cancer cells and confirms the potential of this essential oil as a good candidate as a cytotoxic agent.
