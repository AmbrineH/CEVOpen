<p>Essential oils from the leaves of this species has not been investigated previously against any bacterial organism. This study shows that, against the tested bacteria, the essential oil did not have antibacterial activity. However, some studies [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which leads to a conclusion that, regarding metabolites from this species, antibacterial activity is dependent on the presence of polar compounds not present in the essential oil. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and Î±-pinene may be responsible for a certain effect against the MRSA and MSSA strains, since other authors have reported antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> when these compounds are in a majority in essential oils [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It was observed that the essential oil had greater difficulty in acting against the Gram-negative bacteria. In general, essential oils are more effective against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacterial strains, because the outer membrane surrounding the cell wall restricts the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through the lipopolysaccharide covering [

 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is generally less susceptible to a diverse range of antimicrobial compounds, including essential oils [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This reduced susceptibility has been attributed to the outer membrane and associated properties, such as drug efflux [
