<p>Flow cytometry analysis was performed to investigate if the cytotoxicity effect induced by 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic> essential oil is related to pathways that activate cell death. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-00033-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the treatment with essential oil did not induce cell death in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A at the doses of 46 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 314 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, when compared to control cells. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of this essential oil is not involved with the activation of cell death mechanisms, but with the reduction of the cellular metabolic capacity. The resazurin reduction to verify cell viability may be indicating that there was impairment in cellular metabolism and not necessarily an interruption of electron transport and mitochondrial dysfunction [
