<p>Essential oils with strong antimicrobial activity against yeasts are characterized by a high content of thymol, carvacrol, cymene, linalool or α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Among the compounds found in the essential oil from 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic>, linalool (0.14%) and α-pinene (3.22%) may have exerted some antifungal action against yeasts of 
 <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis. Few studies related to the action of essential oils against this fungus are available, possibly because it is a mycoses restricted to some countries of Latin America. In addition to previously published studies, this work provides an indication that some terpenes from 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic> can be related to inhibition of 
 <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> growth and this essential oil is therefore a relevant target for future investigation regarding its isolated compounds. Essential oil from 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic> showed inhibition with an MIC value lower than already found for other essential oils or isolated compounds tested against this fungus [
