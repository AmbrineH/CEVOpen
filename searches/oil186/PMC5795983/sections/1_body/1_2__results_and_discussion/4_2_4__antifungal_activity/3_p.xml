<p>Until now, with regard to the antifungal activities of essential oil of the leaves from 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic>, only a fungistatic effect against 
 <italic>Phyllosticta citricarpa</italic> was described [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Against fungi that are pathogenic to humans, the essential oil of this species had not yet been evaluated. Except for 
 <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, the results found for the other fungi indicate that this essential oil was not capable of acting in any mechanism that could provide the fungistatic or fungicidal activity, and therefore, the present terpenes in 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic> were not efficient against these species.
