<p>The identification of the essential oil components was carried out by comparison of the mass spectrum obtained with that stored in the software library (Nist08), and by comparing the calculated arithmetic retention index (AI) according to the equation proposed by Van Den Dool and Kratz (1963) [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with arithmetic retention index reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. AI calculation was based on retention times of linear alkane standards (C8-C40, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) run under the same operating conditions as previously described.
