<p class="p">Quantitative analysis was carried out in triplicate and the amounts of volatile compounds were calculated using the internal standard method, taking into account the relative response factor (RRF) according to IOFI Working Group on Methods of Analysis [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. For this purpose, heptanal (Sigma-Aldrich; 0.0092 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was selected as the internal standard. Phellandrene, linalool, caryophylene and nerolidol (Sigma-Aldrich) were selected to represent the response factors for monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, respectively. Analyses for the RRF calculation were completed five times at four concentrations (0.0104, 0.0146, 0.0187 and 0.0229 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-19-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and the average response factors were obtained.
