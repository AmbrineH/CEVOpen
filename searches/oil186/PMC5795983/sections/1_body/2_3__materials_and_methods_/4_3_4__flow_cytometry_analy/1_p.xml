<p>For this analysis, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells were selected based on results from cytotoxic activity assays. Cells were seeded (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) in 6-well dishes and treated with essential oil for 48 h at 37 °C at the dose of CC
 <sub>50</sub> previously determined by the cytotoxic activity assay. After treatment, the cells were harvested by trypsinisation, washed with PBS and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using a FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescence was measured in a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, USA) and data analyzed in Kaluza Analysis Software (Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, USA).
