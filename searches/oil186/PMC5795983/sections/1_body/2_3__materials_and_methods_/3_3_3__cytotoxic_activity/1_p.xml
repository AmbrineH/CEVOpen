<p class="p">A sample of the essential oil was solubilized in methanol (Synth, São Paulo, Brazil) and diluted in supplemented Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a stock solution of 640 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Cell viability was tested with cell lines from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). MCF-7 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor positive; ATCC HTB-22) and MDA-MB-231 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor negative; ATCC HTB-26) breast cancer cell lines, and the MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial cells; ATCC CRL-10317) normal breast cell line, were selected for cytotoxicity assays. A solution containing 1 × 10

Readings of absorbance at 595 nm were performed using a Multiskan GO Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Assays were performed in six replicates and the results of absorbance were calculated according to the growth control. The cytotoxic concentration at which 50% of the cells are viable (CC
