<p>In this study, we report cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from the leaves of 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic>. This essential oil is a promising cytotoxic agent by its action and selectivity demonstrated here, and is a diverse source of molecules that may have an important role in drug discovery for the treatment of estrogen-receptor negative tumors, which has been a challenge in oncology. Moreover, the antifungal action of this essential oil against 
 <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>, the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, shows potential to be used in the treatment of this mycosis. Thus, relevant biological activities and high yield of the essential oil from 
 <italic>B. salicifolius</italic> means it is a source of molecules to be exploited for medicine and by the pharmaceutical industry.
