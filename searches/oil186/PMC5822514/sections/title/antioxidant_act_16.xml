 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employing the DPPH method, the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> showed antioxidant activity from 0.1 mg/mL, with 12.43% of free radical-scavenging [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1a</a>] and 25.95% by ABTS method [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1b</a>]. The highest antioxidant activities (53.1%) were obtained with 1 mg/mL by DPPH method [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1a</a>], 92.12% with the ABTS method [1 mg/mL, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1b</a>], and 98% of TAC with 0.1 mg/mL [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 1c</a>]. The antioxidant activity of essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> by DPPH method was higher than BHT and similar with ABTS method. The essential oil showed an antioxidant activity more efficient than ascorbic acid with TAC assay [
