 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radical scavenging capacity of the essential oil and major terpenes of 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> were assayed with an 2,2’-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) assay according to the protocol of Rufino 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>] with some modifications. The ABTS radical solution was prepared mixing 7.4 mmol/L ABTS and 2.6 mmol/L potassium persulfate (Meyer, México). Samples of 100 μL were subsequently mixed with 1900 μL ABTS radical solution, and the absorbance of the resulting mixtures was measured after 7 min at 737 nm with UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
