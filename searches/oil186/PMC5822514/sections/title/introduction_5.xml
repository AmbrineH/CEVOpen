 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, the efficacy of herbal medicines in inflammatory and oxidant-related diseases has been reported.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>] Oxidative stress plays a leading role in the pathogenesis of aging and degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer.[
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>] Free radicals are degraded to nonreactive forms by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses produced in the body and others supplied by the diet. Among these, essential oils of plants have been studied for their potential antioxidant capacities,[
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>
  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>] which can be attributed to the presence of terpenes, besides the phenolic compounds that contribute to the free radical scavenging activity.[
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The terpenes are the main components of the essential oils from medicinal plants, mainly from the aromatic species of the Lamiaceae family; these have been considered as natural antioxidants with high potential, which could be used as additives in food supplements to prevent the oxidative stress that contributes to the appearance of degenerative diseases.[
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>] This family is one of the larger families of plants with distinctive flowers, with about 236 genera and approximately 7200 species around the world.[
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of basil, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, oregano, and thyme possesses antioxidant properties due to its major terpenes.[
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>] Thymol and carvacrol are responsible for the antioxidant activity of essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Thymus spathulifolius</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Origanum vulgare</span> ssp. 
  <span class="italic">hirtum</span>;[
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>] essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinalis</span> (its main constituents are neral, geranial, citronellal, isomenthone, and menthone) shows free radical scavenging activity.[
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a>] In addition, isomenthone and menthone are also the terpenes of higher capacity antioxidant of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha longifolia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span>, while in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha aquatica</span>, the 1,8-cineole is the responsible of this activity.[
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>] Antioxidant capacity in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</span> is due to α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and α-terpinolene compounds;[
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>] and the β-caryophyllene in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Marrubium peregrinum</span> is the one which presents the greater antioxidant activity.[
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To this family belongs the genus 
  <span class="italic">Satureja</span> L., which includes about 200 species of aromatic plants that contain &gt;0.5% of essential oil,[
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>] its main constituents are carvacrol, thymol, phenols, and flavonoids,[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] responsible compounds of the 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> antioxidant properties of 
  <span class="italic">Satureja hortensis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Satureja spicigera</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Satureja cuneifolia</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Satureja cilicica</span>.[
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>] Species from this genus have been used in traditional medicine as analgesic, tonic, or carminative for the treatment of gut disorders.[
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In México, a species from 
  <span class="italic">Satureja</span> (
  <span class="italic">Satureja macrostema</span> “Moc. and Sessé ex Benth.” Briq.) is used as a medicinal plant in the traditional medicine and is known as nurite. It is employed in decoctions and infusions for the treatment of various diseases, including stomach pain and liver and gut diseases.[
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>] The essential oil obtained by hexane extraction from the aerial parts of this plant contains mainly terpenes as limonene, pulegone, and thymol, suggesting that some of its pharmacological effects could be attributed to the presence of these valuable constituents.[
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>] Limonene and thymol are some of the terpenes with higher antioxidant activity in plants.[
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of the high content of terpenes in the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span>, its antioxidant activity has not been analyzed. This work was conducted to the study of the antioxidant activity of essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">S. macrostema</span> obtained by hydrodistillation and evaluated individually its major terpenes to elucidate the compound(s) responsible for free radical scavenging activity.
