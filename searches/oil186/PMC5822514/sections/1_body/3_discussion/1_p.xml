<p>The chemical analysis by GC/MS of essential oil from aerial parts (stems and leaves) of 
 <italic>S. macrostema</italic> obtained from hydrodistillation indicated that the essential oil mainly contains pulegone, a monoterpene ketone, with a content of 22.08 μg/g weight fresh; which coincides with reports of other medicinal plants from Lamiaceae. Pulegone is the major terpene in 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic>,[

 <italic>M. piperita</italic>,[
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> species as 
 <italic>Satureja parvifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Satureja odora</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] However, linalool and thymol were also found at high contents with 14.39 and 12.68 μg/g weight fresh, respectively. In addition, major volatiles were accompanied by less abundant terpenes as limonene (4.79 μg/g weight fresh), caryophyllene (3.45 μg/g weight fresh), and menthone (2.68 μg/g weight fresh). These are constituents from essential oils of medicinal plants from Lamiaceae such as
