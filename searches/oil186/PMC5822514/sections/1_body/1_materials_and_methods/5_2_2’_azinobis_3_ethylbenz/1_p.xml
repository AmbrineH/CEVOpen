 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with some modifications. The ABTS radical solution was prepared mixing 7.4 mmol/L ABTS and 2.6 mmol/L potassium persulfate (Meyer, México). Samples of 100 μL were subsequently mixed with 1900 μL ABTS radical solution, and the absorbance of the resulting mixtures was measured after 7 min at 737 nm with UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
