<p class="p">200 g of washed and fresh aerial part (leaves and stems) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrostema</italic> plants were subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus, mixing together with 1000 mL of distilled water in a round flask. The operating temperature was 100°C and the extraction was done between 2 and 4 h. The essential oil was separated from the hydrolyte by liquid–liquid partitioning in separating fennel and removed with a micropipette. This was suspended in methanol at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and stored at 4°C in the dark until gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and antioxidant activity analysis.
