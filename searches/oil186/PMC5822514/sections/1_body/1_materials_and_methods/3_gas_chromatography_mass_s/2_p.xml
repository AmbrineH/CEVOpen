<p>The percentage of essential oil constituents was determined by integration of peak areas, the values shown correspond to the average value of three injections. The compounds were identified by comparison of their retention indices, relative to those of n-alkanes C8â€“C20, and by comparison with a library of mass spectra with the NIST02 mass spectral library (National Institute of Standards and Technology), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with those described by Adams.[
