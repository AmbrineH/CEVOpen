<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil and major terpene quantification were realized using GC and GC/MS data techniques reported by Torres-Martínez 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] 1 μL of the sample was injected into an Agilent Technologies (7890A) GC equipped with a mass detector (Agilent 5975C), which operated using helium as a carrying gas, with a flow of 1 mL/min, with a split injection (split 50:1) at a temperature of 250°C in HP 5MS nonpolar capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film), under the following conditions: initial temperature of 50°C, followed by a 5°C/min ramp to attain a temperature of 280°C during 1 min; another 25°C/min ramp to raise the temperature to 380°C, during up to 3 min. The runtime was 50 min. The MS operated at a flow speed of 1 mL/min, with an ionization voltage of 70 eV, at an interface temperature of 250°C, in a SCAN mode, and at a mass interval of 50–500 m/z.
