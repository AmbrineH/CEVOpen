<p>Measurement of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) radical scavenging capacity was carried out according to Karamać 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Briefly, two mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in methanol (Meyer, México) was mixed with 100 μL of different concentrations of essential oil of 
 <italic>S. macrostema</italic> and using major pure terpenes in it (limonene, linalool, pulegone, menthone, thymol, and caryophyllene; Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL). After 20 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm with ultraviolet–visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometer (Genesys 10UV, Thermo Scientific). The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
