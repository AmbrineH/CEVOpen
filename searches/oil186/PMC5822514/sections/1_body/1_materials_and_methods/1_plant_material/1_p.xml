<p>Plants of 
 <italic>S. macrostema</italic> (Moc. and Sessé ex Benth.) Briq. were obtained by micropropagation (data not shown). The seeds for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture were collected from plantations established in the experimental area of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoacán, Mexico (19°25’23’’N, 102°07’47’’W), and the species was identified by Miguel Angel Bello-González PhD (Faculty of Agrobiology, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo). Plants were grown in pots of 1.5 kg containing a mix of peat moss and perlite (1:1), under conditions of 50%–60% of relative humidity without light and temperature control, and were irrigated every 5 days. The plants were fertilized in the substrate once per month with 1 g/pot of Nutrigarden Excelso
