<p>The results related to the antioxidant capacity assays of the major terpenes from 
 <italic>S. macrostema</italic> essential oil show that thymol has the highest activity, reaching 83.38%, 98.29%, and 98.57% with 0.1 mg/mL by DPPH, ABTS, and TAC methods, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 2</xref>]. Thymol was most efficient by DPPH method than BHT and showed a similar scavenging free radical activity determined by ABTS [Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">2a</xref> and
