 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line (NCBI code No.: 115; ATCC No.: CCL-2) and the human normal healthy lymphocyte cell line (NCBI code No.: 124; ECACC No.: 91112124) were obtained from the Pasteur Institute, Tehran-Iran. The lymphocyte cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% (w/v) glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/m1 streptomycin. They were cultured in a humid atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO2.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity assay detected the reduction of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to the formazan blue product, which is a reflection of the normal mitochondrial functioning and cell viability (Lau et al., 2004). Briefly, the cells (5× 10
  <span class="sup">4</span>) were seeded in wells containing 100 μl of the RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 96-well plate. After 24 hours of adhesion, different concentrations of the essential oils were added to triplicate wells over the range of 5120 to 20 μg/m1. After 2 days, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml stock solution) was added and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 hours. The medium was discarded, and the formazan blue formed in the cells was dissolved with 100 μl of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Quantification of formazan was performed using an ELISA microplate reader (SLT, Austria) at 490 nm. The cell viability curves were calculated with regard to the control cells. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50). All tests and analyses were run in triplicate, and the mean values were recorded.
