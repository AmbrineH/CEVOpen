 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study provides, for the first time, important data on the biological behavior of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> oils. The essential oils in 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> effectively inhibit the growth of all tested food-borne pathogenic bacteria. Monoterpene compounds are predominant components of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> essential oils. Fractionation allows the separation of oxygenated and non-oxygenated monoterpenes. The high antioxidant activities of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> essential oils could be partially due to the high presence of monoterpene compounds in its chemical compositions. Natural source-derived safe antioxidants prevent oxidative deterioration of foods and protect the living cells from oxidative damage. The IC50 shows far higher cytotoxicity of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> oils toward the human tumor cell line when compared with the amount the requirement for healthy human cells. These results confirm the low adverse effects of the oils. The growing tendency of current consumers to maintain a healthy lifestyle resulted in their greater concerns about high quality, natural and safe food products. This has made application of essential oils as natural antimicrobial agents an attractive approach in the field of food preservation. This study showed very positive results indicating high potential of Semsa essential oils for applications in food products; however, more experiments, including elucidation of the mechanism of action and in vivo tests, are also required to further support the advantages and safety of 
  <span class="italic">D. kotschyi</span> essential oils.
