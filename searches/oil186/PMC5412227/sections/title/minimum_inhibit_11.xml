 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since it is an essential oil and not easily dissolved in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) nutrient medium, in order to dissolve the essential oil in the nutrient medium, first it is dissolved in the organic solvent DMSO and then added to the nutrient medium MHB located on a shaker (100 rpm) so that the oil is uniformly dissolved in all parts of the medium. Each ml of 
  <span class="italic">D.kotschyi</span> oil weights 0.68 g. 300 ml oil is dissolved in 300 μl DMSO solution and then using a nutrient solution MHB, the volume is increased to 1000 μl and spin and vortex for 5 minutes (2000 rpm) so that a stock with a concentration of 20480 μg/m1 is prepared and then by serial dilution in nutrient medium MHB the concentrations of 20 to 5120 μg/m1 oil are prepared in the wells. The final DMSO concentration was 5% (v/v), and this solution was selected as a negative control.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">96-well microtiter plates utilizing broth microdilution method was applied for the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations determination. In a typical procedure, the bacterial strains were cultured overnight at 37 °C on MHB, adjusted to a final density of 8 log CFU/mL, and used to inoculate (1-10) 96-well microtiter plates containing serial dilutions of the essential oils (5120-20 μg/m1) on MHB. A positive control containing the bacterial culture and broth without the plant oils was included in each test. The contents of each well were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 r/min for 30 seconds and then incubated at 37 C for 24 h, while 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus agalactiae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</span> were incubated for 48 h. Then, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, T8877) was used for the visual indicator of bacterial growth. The MIC of the essential oils was regarded as the lowest concentration showing no growth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples exhibiting no turbidity were sub-cultured; however, the lowest concentration from which the microorganisms did not recover was the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>
