<p class="p">Different studies have been made on the chemical composition of essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> from other regions. A comparison of the main components of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> essential oils from this research and other studies could be found in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In spite of some similarities in reported components of this study and other researches, there are significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the samples obtained different locations in Iran. These differences might be due to different climatic, seasonal and geographic conditions; harvest periods; and distillation techniques (Morteza-Semnani and Saeedi 2005).
