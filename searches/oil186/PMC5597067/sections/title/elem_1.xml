   <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00001-f001" href="#medicines-04-00001-f001">Figure 1</a>. The vacuum distillation was maintained at 65–85 °C, according to the distillate flow rate. The ultrafitrating operation was completed at room temperature, and the filtration rate was only 17.5–21 mL/h. The yields of vacuum distillation oil, ultrafiltration oil, and hydrodistillation oil, were 0.73% ± 0.12%, 0.28% ± 0.09%, and 1.07% ± 0.14%, respectively.

The GC column was a HP-5ms fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase, a film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm. The carrier gas was helium, with a column head pressure of 48.7 kPa and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injector temperature was 200 °C and interface temperature was 280 °C. The GC oven temperature program was used as follows: 40 °C initial temperature, held for 10 min; increased at 3 °C/min to 200 °C; increased 2 °C/min to 220 °C. A 1%

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The samples were also subjected to screening in order to identify their possible antioxidant activity, by using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH·) scavenging assay [

Free radical scavenging activity of the corresponding samples was dependent on the extent of bleaching of the purple-colored DPPH methanol solution. Aliquots (50 μL) of various concentrations (0.5–3.0 mg/mL) of the samples in methanol were added to 5 mL of 0.004% DPPH solution in methanol (5 mL). Following a 30-min incubation period at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm. Inhibition of DPPH· in percentage (I%) was calculated using the following formula:
