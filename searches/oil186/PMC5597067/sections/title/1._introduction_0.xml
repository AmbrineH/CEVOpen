  <span class="italic">Citrus medica</span> L. var. 
  <span class="italic">sarcodactylis</span> (Noot.) Swingle, commonly known as fingered citron in China, is an uncommon variation of 
  <span class="italic">Citrus medica</span> L., belonging to the Rutaceae family [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00001">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00001">2</a>]. It is well-known as a precious Chinese traditional medicine and is widely cultivated from the central area of China, to the southeastern coast, especially in the Jinhua district of the Zhejiang province, lying to the south of Shanghai [
  <a rid="B3-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-medicines-04-00001">3</a>]. The fruits are widely manufactured for use in various types of processed foods, such as healthcare tea, drink flavoring, succade, and traditional desserts. Also, the intact fresh fruits could be directly sold or used as decorative bonsai at international markets, extending from Asia to South America, mostly due to their unique finger-like appearance and exquisite aroma. However, recently, due to the requirement for the modernization of traditional Chinese herbs, attention has been focused on research relating to bioactive components and the development of advanced processing techniques for fingered citron. In particular, as both a medicinal and edible product, it has been acknowledged that the essential oil of fingered citron is a major component of the commercial sector, with an extensive use as a flavoring agent for beverages, ice cream [
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00001">4</a>], biscuits, cakes, healthcare food [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00001">5</a>], and household products [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00001">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-medicines-04-00001">7</a>]. Therefore, in terms of commercialization of fingered citron, it is of utmost importance that we obtain a high-quality essential oil, at the lowest cost possible, during the processing of the fruits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike other citrus fruits such as lemon and grapefruit, mature fingered citron has only a thin yellow exocarp and thick white entoderm, without juicy pulp or seeds [
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00001">2</a>]. This peculiar anatomical structure, results in a low proportion of exocarp containing essential oil. Therefore, the total yield of a complete fruit is typically in the range of 0.7%–1.2% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>), as stated in previously published work [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00001">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00001">9</a>]. Furthermore, the oil-water state is sometimes impossible to separate, depending on single-circle hydrodistillation, due to the emulsification of a much lower essential oil content into a relatively large amount of water. Therefore, a conventional isolation process for producing essential oil from these fruits usually employs hydrodistillation using condensed fluid, repeatedly returning to the evaporator-like Clevenger apparatus. However, for a practical large-scale production of essential oil, the cost of isolating the essential oil needs to be considered, and the essential oil could be combined with other procedures, such as beverage production. Much research has focused on oil separation following the cold-pressing of citrus fruits, with pulp such as the common orange [
  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00001">10</a>], but few investigations have pursued using fingered citrons, which have no pulp.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quality of essential oils produced from fingered citron is highly dependent on its chemical composition, as well as associated bioactivities [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00001">11</a>]. During the course of processing the peels of mature fruits, different isolation techniques can not only result in different oil yields, but can also have noticeable effects on chemical composition and other related oil qualities [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00001">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00001">13</a>]. Therefore, owing to potential commercial applications, there have been several investigations that have attempted to demonstrate the composition and stability of characteristic aromas, and to determine possible bioactivities, such as those which are antimicrobial or antioxidant [
  <a rid="B14-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-medicines-04-00001">14</a>,
  <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00001">15</a>]. The GC-MS analysis of oils from Japanese fingered citron showed that β-ionone, one of the aroma components with a very low odor threshold (7 ng/L), was responsible for the characteristic osmanthus-like aroma of the fruit [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00001">16</a>]. However, more recent studies have determined the characteristic aromatic components of essential oils from the Jinhua district of China, the results of which, using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), have demonstrated that α-pinene and α-bergamotene were the principal contributors to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00001">17</a>]. In addition, as a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, fingered citron has usually been employed as a stomachic carminative, asthma expectorant, and anxiolytic [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00001">1</a>,
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00001">9</a>]. Although an increasing number of oil bioactivities, including hypotensive and hypolipidemic effects, have been confirmed [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00001">5</a>], there have been no reports on the effects of isolation procedures on the chemical composition and bioactivities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This work presents two innovative isolation techniques for directly separating the essential oils from the juices of fingered citron. It is important to note that both of the methodologies proposed here do not represent conventional solid-water mixing distillation of essential oils, but a new separation method of the concentrated upper layer of fruit juice. One is a short-time vacuum distillation, and the other is ultrafiltration. The data reported in this work were obtained by comparing the chemical compositions and bioactivities of fingered citron oils using the new methods, with those of the oils obtained by conventional methods such as hydrodistillation and organic solvent extraction. The purpose of this research is to obtain a high-quality, commercially applicable fingered citron oil, that can maintain the pure distinctiveness of fingered citron. It is very likely that improving the quality of fingered citron oil, as well as reducing the processing cost, would significantly improve local agricultural production.</p>
