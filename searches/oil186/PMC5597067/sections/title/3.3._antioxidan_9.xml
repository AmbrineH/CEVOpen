 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Antioxidant Activity</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of essential oils is another biological property of great interest for potential utilization in cosmetic supplements or functional food products. The use of a DPPHÎ‡ scavenging assay is the most routinely practiced method for the assessment of anti-radical properties of different samples. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00001-f002" href="#medicines-04-00001-f002">Figure 2</a>, the antioxidant efficiency of the tested essential oils primarily relies on their concentration, and their free radical scavenging effectiveness was as follows, given in descending order and based on the increasing median inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) values: vacuum distillation oil (1.02 mg/mL) &gt; hydrodistillation oil (1.19 mg/mL) &gt; ultrafiltration oil (1.42 mg/mL).
