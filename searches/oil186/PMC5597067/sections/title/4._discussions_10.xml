 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cyclic monoterpenes (I) not containing oxygen atoms are common components in the essential oils of most citrus fruit peels. Previous work has suggested that the mechanism for the formation of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene occurs during a rearrangement reaction in which limonene rearranges to form terpinenes, which then dehydrogenates to form 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, while pinene and limonene can interconvert with each other through isomerization (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00001-f003" href="#medicines-04-00001-f003">Figure 3</a>) [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00001">22</a>]. Oils obtained using three different methods have no significant differences in their pinene (α- or β-) content. However, when only focusing on the three most abundant compounds (limonene, γ-terpinene, and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene), the oil obtained by vacuum distillation possessed a relatively low content of limonene (47.6%), a relatively high content of γ-terpinene (29.5%), and an absence of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, while the oil obtained by hydrodistillation revealed limonene (60.1%), γ-terpinene (6.1%), and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (17.6%). Notably, the oil produced from ultrafiltration had the highest limonene (64.7%) and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene content (26.1%), and the lowest γ-terpinene content (0.1%). The differences in content between these three compounds are most likely related to the considerable interconversion which occurs during the isolation process (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00001-f001" href="#medicines-04-00001-f001">Figure 1</a>). The significantly different isolation conditions, including pressure, temperature, and time, seems to have largely influenced the rates of interconversion. For example, ultrafiltration is a slow procedure with an outflow speed of only 20–30 mL/h, so it was necessary to complete this at relatively high pressures (0.15–0.18 MPa) for long periods of time (10–15 h), while vacuum distillation is almost complete within 0.5–1 h, at a pressure of 0.03–0.05 MPa and a temperature of 80–85 °C.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, the diagnostic index for good quality citrus oils largely depends on the quantities of two types of compounds; acyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons (II) and acyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (III) [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00001">23</a>]. By comparing the relative ratio (RR) in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t003" href="#medicines-04-00001-t003">Table 3</a>, of either quantity of compounds or their contents, the value of oil from vacuum distillation is of a much higher quality than the oils produced from the other two procedures. Conversely, the concentration of oxygenated terpenoids, including cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (V) and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (VII), can indicate the likelihood that oils have been exposed to the air or light for long periods during isolation or storage. These two classes of compounds can sometimes result in a few unpleasant odors, which will have negative consequences for the oil quality. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t003" href="#medicines-04-00001-t003">Table 3</a>, the relative ratios of cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids are 8.7 (ultrafiltration), 2.3 (hydrodistillation), and 3.8 (organic solvent extraction) [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00001">16</a>], respectively. Low concentrations of the cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids and the absence of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, are also characteristic of the oil isolated by vacuum distillation. Relatively quick operation and vacuum conditions minimize the time that the oils are exposed to air and considerably high temperatures, thus achieving high quality oils.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is of utmost importance that the oils obtained retain the distinctive aroma compounds of the fingered citron fruit. β-Ionone, one of the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, was thought to be the most characteristic aroma component in the peel of fingered citron [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00001">16</a>], but it was not detected in the oils from Zhejiang, China, using three different isolation methods. More recently, gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) has been used to analyze the main odorous compounds in fingered citron essential oil [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00001">17</a>]. The results demonstrated that α-pinene and α-bergamotene were the key compounds contributing to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil. In this research, the content of α-bergamotene in vacuum distilled oil was greater than that in oils obtained from ultrafiltration or hydrodistillation, while the concentrations of α-pinene in the three types of oils were very similar. These results can help to explain the intensity of the aroma of the oil produced using vacuum distillation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When analysing conventional hydrodistillation oil, either antibacterial activity or antifungal activity was extremely weak. In previous work, the oils from conventional hydrodistillation had shown weak antibacterial activity in zone-of-inhibition assays, that was partly consistent with the present results, but antifungal inhibitory concentrations were not determined [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00001">24</a>]. The antimicrobial activity of the ultrafiltration oil can be attributed to the high concentration of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene. This compound has shown antibacterial activity against 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00001">25</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00001">26</a>], as well as antifungal activity against several 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp. [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00001">27</a>] and filamentous fungi [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00001">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different antioxidant activities can be mainly ascribed to their complex compositions, which have different chemical profiles. Since an essential oil is not a pure single compound, its activities often refer to the actions of inter-components, such as synergism and antagonism, which are rarely experimentally supported, thus remaining speculative. However, they can be used to explain the observed bioactivities [
  <a rid="B14-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-medicines-04-00001">14</a>]. Isolation methods are generally believed to result in a variation of naturally occurring antioxidants in the raw materials of a plant. Intense thermal treatment or prolonged air-exposure may be responsible for the oxygenated reactions of monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes in fingered citron oils. Extensive formation of oxygenated products might have significant negative effects on their free radical scavenging effectiveness. More specifically, even when ultrafiltration is carried out at room temperature (20–25 °C), the resulting oils showed lower free radical-scavenging activity, in addition to a marked loss of monoterpene or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and an evident increase of oxygenated terpenoids.
