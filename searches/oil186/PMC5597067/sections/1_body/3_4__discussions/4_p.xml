<p>When analysing conventional hydrodistillation oil, either antibacterial activity or antifungal activity was extremely weak. In previous work, the oils from conventional hydrodistillation had shown weak antibacterial activity in zone-of-inhibition assays, that was partly consistent with the present results, but antifungal inhibitory concentrations were not determined [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. This compound has shown antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as well as antifungal activity against several 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B27-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and filamentous fungi [
