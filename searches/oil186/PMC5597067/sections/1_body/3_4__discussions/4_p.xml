<p class="p">When analysing conventional hydrodistillation oil, either antibacterial activity or antifungal activity was extremely weak. In previous work, the oils from conventional hydrodistillation had shown weak antibacterial activity in zone-of-inhibition assays, that was partly consistent with the present results, but antifungal inhibitory concentrations were not determined [
