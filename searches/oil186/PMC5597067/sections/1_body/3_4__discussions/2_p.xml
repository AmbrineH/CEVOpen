<p>Generally, the diagnostic index for good quality citrus oils largely depends on the quantities of two types of compounds; acyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons (II) and acyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (III) [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By comparing the relative ratio (RR) in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t003">Table 3</xref>, of either quantity of compounds or their contents, the value of oil from vacuum distillation is of a much higher quality than the oils produced from the other two procedures. Conversely, the concentration of oxygenated terpenoids, including cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (V) and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (VII), can indicate the likelihood that oils have been exposed to the air or light for long periods during isolation or storage. These two classes of compounds can sometimes result in a few unpleasant odors, which will have negative consequences for the oil quality. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t003">Table 3</xref>, the relative ratios of cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids are 8.7 (ultrafiltration), 2.3 (hydrodistillation), and 3.8 (organic solvent extraction) [
 <xref rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], respectively. Low concentrations of the cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids and the absence of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, are also characteristic of the oil isolated by vacuum distillation. Relatively quick operation and vacuum conditions minimize the time that the oils are exposed to air and considerably high temperatures, thus achieving high quality oils.
