<p>It is of utmost importance that the oils obtained retain the distinctive aroma compounds of the fingered citron fruit. β-Ionone, one of the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, was thought to be the most characteristic aroma component in the peel of fingered citron [
 <xref rid="B16-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but it was not detected in the oils from Zhejiang, China, using three different isolation methods. More recently, gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) has been used to analyze the main odorous compounds in fingered citron essential oil [
 <xref rid="B17-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The results demonstrated that α-pinene and α-bergamotene were the key compounds contributing to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil. In this research, the content of α-bergamotene in vacuum distilled oil was greater than that in oils obtained from ultrafiltration or hydrodistillation, while the concentrations of α-pinene in the three types of oils were very similar. These results can help to explain the intensity of the aroma of the oil produced using vacuum distillation.
