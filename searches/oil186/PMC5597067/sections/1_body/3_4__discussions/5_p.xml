<p>The different antioxidant activities can be mainly ascribed to their complex compositions, which have different chemical profiles. Since an essential oil is not a pure single compound, its activities often refer to the actions of inter-components, such as synergism and antagonism, which are rarely experimentally supported, thus remaining speculative. However, they can be used to explain the observed bioactivities [
 <xref rid="B14-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Isolation methods are generally believed to result in a variation of naturally occurring antioxidants in the raw materials of a plant. Intense thermal treatment or prolonged air-exposure may be responsible for the oxygenated reactions of monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes in fingered citron oils. Extensive formation of oxygenated products might have significant negative effects on their free radical scavenging effectiveness. More specifically, even when ultrafiltration is carried out at room temperature (20–25 °C), the resulting oils showed lower free radical-scavenging activity, in addition to a marked loss of monoterpene or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and an evident increase of oxygenated terpenoids.
