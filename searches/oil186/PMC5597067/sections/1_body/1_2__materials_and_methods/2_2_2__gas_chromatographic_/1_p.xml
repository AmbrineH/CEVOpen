<p>The essential oils of fingered citron were analyzed by GC-MS [
 <xref rid="B18-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], using an Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA, operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 mAU, and scan rate = 3.99 scans/s), and an Agilent ChemStation data system (G1701CA, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The GC column was a HP-5ms fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase, a film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm. The carrier gas was helium, with a column head pressure of 48.7 kPa and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injector temperature was 200 °C and interface temperature was 280 °C. The GC oven temperature program was used as follows: 40 °C initial temperature, held for 10 min; increased at 3 °C/min to 200 °C; increased 2 °C/min to 220 °C. A 1%
