<p>The essential oils were screened for antibacterial activity against: Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC No. 29213), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC No. 14579); Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC No. 27853), 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (ATCC No. 14756). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using the microbroth dilution technique [
 <xref rid="B20-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Dilutions of the essential oil were prepared in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB), beginning with 50 μL of 1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> solutions of essential oil in DMSO, plus 50 μL CAMHB. The extract solutions were serially diluted (1:1) in CAMHB, in 96-well plates. Organisms at a concentration of approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h; the final minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration without turbidity. Gentamycin was used as a positive antibiotic control; DMSO was used as a negative control. Antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC No. 10231) and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (ATCC No. 16888) was determined as above, using Yeast and Mold Broth (YMB) inoculated with the corresponding fungal culture, diluted to a McFarland turbidity of 1.0. Amphotericin B was the positive control [
