<p>Unlike other citrus fruits such as lemon and grapefruit, mature fingered citron has only a thin yellow exocarp and thick white entoderm, without juicy pulp or seeds [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00001" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This peculiar anatomical structure, results in a low proportion of exocarp containing essential oil. Therefore, the total yield of a complete fruit is typically in the range of 0.7%â€“1.2% (

Furthermore, the oil-water state is sometimes impossible to separate, depending on single-circle hydrodistillation, due to the emulsification of a much lower essential oil content into a relatively large amount of water. Therefore, a conventional isolation process for producing essential oil from these fruits usually employs hydrodistillation using condensed fluid, repeatedly returning to the evaporator-like Clevenger apparatus. However, for a practical large-scale production of essential oil, the cost of isolating the essential oil needs to be considered, and the essential oil could be combined with other procedures, such as beverage production. Much research has focused on oil separation following the cold-pressing of citrus fruits, with pulp such as the common orange [
