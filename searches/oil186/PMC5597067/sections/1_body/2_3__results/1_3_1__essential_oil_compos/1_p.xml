<p class="p">The essential oils obtained by the different isolation procedures are characterized by the presence of cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes, which may or may not possess oxygen atoms in their structures (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). All of oil components are divided into eight groups, including cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons (I), acyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons (II), acyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (III), aldehydes (IV), cyclic oxygenated monoterpenoids (V), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (VI), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (VII), and coumarins (VIII).
