<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of essential oils is another biological property of great interest for potential utilization in cosmetic supplements or functional food products. The use of a DPPHÎ‡ scavenging assay is the most routinely practiced method for the assessment of anti-radical properties of different samples. As shown in
