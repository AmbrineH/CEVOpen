<p>The MICs of three fingered citron oils against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00001-t002">Table 2</xref>. In particular, the ultrafiltration oil showed notable in vitro antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 156 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (MIC = 156 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 39 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (MIC = 20 μg/mL).The vacuum distillation oil was only marginally active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 625 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (MIC = 313 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 625 μg/mL), but was also strongly active against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (MIC = 156 μg/mL).
