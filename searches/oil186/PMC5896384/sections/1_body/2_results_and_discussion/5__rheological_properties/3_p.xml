<p> The viscosity of the formulated oils remained generally constant at all shear rates within the 90% confidence interval (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, this confirmed that these oils followed Newtonian behavior at speeds from 0-100 (1/s). Fresh vegetable oils, due to their long chain molecules, also show Newtonian flow behaviors.
