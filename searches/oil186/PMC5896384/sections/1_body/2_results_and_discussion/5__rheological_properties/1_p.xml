<p> Rheology and viscosity properties are easy to measure in the food industry and their results can be used to determine properties and behavior of suspensions, solutions and mixtures. Rheological properties of oils can be important in food formulation and also during processing.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, shows the obtained results from triplicate measurements for shear stress and shear rates of the blended oils at 4°C and 25°C. At both temperatures, all three blended oils showed a linear relationship between the shear stress and shear rate, which meant that these oils have a typical Newtonian behavior. Therefore, the determination viscosity and regression coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) was carried out using Newton’s law equation (Eq. 4).
