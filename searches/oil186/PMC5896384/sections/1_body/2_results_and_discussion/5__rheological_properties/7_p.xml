<p> Oils with a high level of double bonds in their fatty acid chains show lower viscosity levels because of their weak structures.

 </sup> Double bonds, due to their space requirements do not allow molecules to be stacked close to each other. Therefore, oils with high amount of unsaturated oils cannot have a rigid and fixed structure and so behave in a more fluid-like way. Thus, there are some negative correlations between the fatty acid composition of some oils and their viscosity.
