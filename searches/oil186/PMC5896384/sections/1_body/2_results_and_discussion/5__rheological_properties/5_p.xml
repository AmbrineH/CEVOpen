<p> As expected, the viscosity of the blended oils at 25째C was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than the viscosity measured at 4째C. Increasing the temperature could increase the average speed of the molecules and, because of increasing the frequency of their collisions; the viscosity decreases.

 </sup> The viscosity at 4째C was about two- to three-fold the viscosity at 25째C; this is important as amount of energy needed for pumping the oils increased considerably and the level of their heat transfer also changed at different temperatures.
