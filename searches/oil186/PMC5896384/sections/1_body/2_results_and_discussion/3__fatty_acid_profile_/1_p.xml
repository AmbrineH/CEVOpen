<p> The fatty acid composition of vegetable oils is responsible for their physical, chemical and nutritional quality. Therefore, it could be considered as one of the most important parameters for oils and fats. The achieved data for fatty acid compositions in linseed, sesame and olive oils were in agreement with the previous literature.

 </sup> According to the findings, linseed oil with its high levels of linolenic acid (55%) was a rich source of ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acids, but olive and sesame oils were relatively poor in this fatty acid (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Blending these oils lead to significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in fatty acid profile and by increasing linseed oil percent in the mixture, the ω
 <sub>3</sub> level increased considerably (
