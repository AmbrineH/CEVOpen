<p> In this study, storage period had significant (p&lt;0.05) effect on increasing PV of all samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, oil blends with a higher percent of linseed oil in them showed increased PV during storage (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, on the first day, formulated oil containing 5% linseed oil had the highest PV but had a good stability during storage, which could be related to its high olive oil content.
