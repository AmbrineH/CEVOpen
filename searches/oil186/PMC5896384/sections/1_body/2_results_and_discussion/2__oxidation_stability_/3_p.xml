<p> The Rancimat test showed 12.48-, 9.66- and 8.13-hour stabilities for oils with 5, 10 and 15% linseed oil, respectively. As expected, samples with higher content of linseed oil indicated lower oxidative stability, which was in agreement with PVs of all the oil samples. Regarding the oxidative stability of the oil blends, blends with lower linseed oil content (5%) could be used as cooking oil but other blends (with 10 and 15 % of linseed oil) could be also used as salad oils.</p>
