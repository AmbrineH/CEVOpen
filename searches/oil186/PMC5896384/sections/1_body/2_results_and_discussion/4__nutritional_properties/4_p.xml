 </sup> In the present study, PUFA: SFA ratio in linseed oil was very high (7.42) and increasing its content in mixtures lead to significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in this ratio for the formulated samples. PUFA: SFA ratios in 5, 10 and 15% linseed oil were 1.62, 1.8 and 2.41, respectively. Thus, these results indicated that these blended oils have suitable and balanced fatty acid compositions.
