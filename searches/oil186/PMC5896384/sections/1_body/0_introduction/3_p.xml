<p> PUFA are essential fatty acids and they can be divided into two groups; omega 3 and omega 6. Based on their structures, each group has important roles in the improvement of the immune system, prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

 </sup> Commonly consumed oils, such as sunflower, corn, grape seed and rice bran oils, have high levels of ω
 <sub>6</sub> fatty acids and, thus, lead to increases in the ratio of ω
 <sub>6</sub> compared to ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acids. The optimal ratio and balance of these fatty acids has an important effect on their functional properties.

 </sup> Unfortunately, there is no pure fat or oil that has a balanced amount of essential fatty acids, good oxidative stability and optimum nutritional characteristics. For example, linseed oil is rich in ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acids, which are easily oxidized, while sesame and olive oils are very stable to oxidation but contain low levels of ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acids.
