<p class="p"> Blending linseed oil with sesame and olive oils created a positive nutritional effect with improved stability in formulated oils. Oxidative stability parameters (AV and PV) showed the oil blends have good stability during storage. The Rancimat results showed that the 65:30:5 mixture could be used as a cooking oil, but 60:30:10 and 55:30:15 treatments could be used as salad oils. Furthermore, blended oils had good nutritional indexes, including AI, TI, HH, PUFA: SFA and ω

All treatments showed Newtonian behavior and increasing temperature, and the content of linseed oil in the mixtures lead to decreases in their viscosity. This study indicated that incorporation of linseed oil with sesame and olive oils can give a functional oil with a balanced ω
