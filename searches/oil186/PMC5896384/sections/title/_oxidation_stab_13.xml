 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Peroxides are formed by the oxidation of fatty acids in oils, these can have adverse effect on quality of oils and food products. Proxidant metals, such as copper and iron, and light, temperature and sensitizers can promote oxidation process. Olive oils have high stability to oxidation and are fit to consume with PV values up to 15 meq O

  </span>, but due to its high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, linseed oil oxidizes very fast.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> In this study, storage period had significant (p&lt;0.05) effect on increasing PV of all samples (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). As expected, oil blends with a higher percent of linseed oil in them showed increased PV during storage (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). However, on the first day, formulated oil containing 5% linseed oil had the highest PV but had a good stability during storage, which could be related to its high olive oil content.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The Rancimat test showed 12.48-, 9.66- and 8.13-hour stabilities for oils with 5, 10 and 15% linseed oil, respectively. As expected, samples with higher content of linseed oil indicated lower oxidative stability, which was in agreement with PVs of all the oil samples. Regarding the oxidative stability of the oil blends, blends with lower linseed oil content (5%) could be used as cooking oil but other blends (with 10 and 15 % of linseed oil) could be also used as salad oils.</p>
