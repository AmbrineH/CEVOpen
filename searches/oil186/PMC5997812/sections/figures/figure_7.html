 <p> In vitro release kinetics of C. martinii essential oil (CMEO) from chitosan encapsulated C. martinii essential oil nanoparticles (Ce-CMEO-NPs) in hydroethanolic solution at pH 7.4 and 1.5. Statistical data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA following Tukeyâ€™s post hoc multiple comparison test and columns with different letters were statistically significant within the group of pH 7.4 and 1.5 ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>)
