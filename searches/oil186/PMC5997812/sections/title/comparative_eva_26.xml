 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> in maize grains were conducted under laboratory conditions over a storage period of 28 days. The CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs have presented potent fungicidal and antimycotoxin activities in maize grains (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">8</a>
  </span>). The kinetic curves for reductions of fungal growth and level of mycotoxins (DON and ZEA) with different concentrations of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs were depicted in 
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F9" href="#F9">9</a>
  </span>. The constructed regression models were found satisfactory and presented a good determination coefficient (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of 0.9694 and 0.9896 (log CFU), 0.9864 and 0.9793 (DON), and 0.9935 and 0.9873 (ZEA) for CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs, respectively (Supplementary Table 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">1</a>). These regression models conveyed that reductions of fungal growth and mycotoxins were dependent on the concentration of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs and show a dose-dependent fashion. Though, Ce-CMEO-NPs have exhibited potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities compared to CMEO (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">8</a>
  </span>). The complete reductions of fungal growth and mycotoxins were noticed at 700 ppm of Ce-CMEO-NPs and 900 ppm of CMEO (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">8</a>
  </span>). The essential oils are volatile and susceptible to degradation and loss of bio-functional features. Whereas essential oils encapsulated in chitosan are less prone to degradation, perseverance bio-functional properties, and gradually releases the bio-active elements in a controlled way (
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Turasan et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Bakry et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Malešević, 2016</a>). Consequently, Ce-CMEO-NPs are highly resistant to degradation, perseverance bio-functional features, and slowly release active antifungal constituents compared to CMEO. Henceforth, Ce-CMEO-NPs have exhibited potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities compared to CMEO. In support of the present study, 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Khalili et al. (2015)</a> have established the greater antifungal activity of chitosan encapsulated thyme essential oil nanoparticles over thyme essential oil during safeguarding the tomato fruit against 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span>. Similarly, 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">Zhaveh et al. (2015)</a> have also proven the enhanced antifungal activity of chitosan-caffeic acid encapsulated 
  <span class="italic">Cuminum cyminum</span> essential oils nanogels related to 
  <span class="italic">C. cyminum</span> essential oils against 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span>. The findings of the present study concluded that Ce-CMEO-NPs were highly effective related to CMEO in safeguarding the stored grains from fungi and its hazardous mycotoxins.
