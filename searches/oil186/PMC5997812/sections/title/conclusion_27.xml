 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMEO was extracted by hydrodistillation technique and chemical profile was unveiled by GC-MS analysis. A total of 46 chemical constituents were identified and major compounds were geraniol, geranial, geranyl propionate, geranyl acetone, geranyl acetate, Î±-phellandrene, linalool, and thymol. The CMEO was induced the death of 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> through elevating ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, depleting ergosterol content, and detrimentally affecting the micromorphology of macroconidia. Furthermore, Ce-CMEO-NPs were successfully synthesized with the diameter of 100 nm and spherical shape. The FT-IR analysis concluded that chitosan was successfully enclosed the essential oil. The 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> essential oil release assay concluded the persistence of essential oil with a slow and controlled release. In the final aim of study, antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs against 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> were established in maize grains under laboratory conditions over a storage period of 28 days. The study determined that Ce-CMEO-NPs have potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities compared to CMEO due to perseverance of antifungal activity by the controlled release of fungicidal constituents. The Ce-CMEO-NPs could be highly applicable as mycobiocide in safeguarding the agriculture commodities from mycotoxigenic fungi.
