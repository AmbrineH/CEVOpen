 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibitory activity of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on growth and production of DON and ZEA by 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> in maize grains was studied under laboratory conditions. A quantity of 100 g pre-sterilized maize grains was inoculated with 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> spores per mL) in 250 mL of Erlenmeyer flask and exposed to different concentrations of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs (up to 1000 ppm) and thoroughly homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm in a rotary shaker and incubated at 28°C for 28 days. The maize grains inoculated with fungi and not treated with either of CMEO or Ce-CMEO-NPs was referred as control. Following the incubation period, fungal growth and mycotoxins were determined by spread plate and HPLC quantification techniques, respectively.

   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Kalagatur et al. (2018)</a>. Following incubation, maize grains (10 g) were collected from test samples and suspended in 90 mL of sterile peptone water and homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm using a rotary shaker. Subsequently, decimal dilutions were performed and spread plated on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28°C. The viability of fungi was determined in colony forming units (CFU) and expressed in log CFU/g.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HPLC quantification of DON and ZEA was done as per our previously reported methodology of 
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Kumar et al. (2016)</a> and 
   <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Mudili et al. (2014)</a> with minor modifications. Briefly, a portion of maize grains (25 g) is milled into fine powder under aseptic conditions and suspended in 250 mL solution of acetonitrile and water (60:40, v/v) and thoroughly homogenized for 2 h at 160 rpm under a rotary shaker. The suspension was filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min to obtain a clear supernatant. Meanwhile, immunoaffinity columns of DON and ZEA were prepared as per procedure of manufacturer, and about 20 mL of the obtained clear supernatant was passed through immunoaffinity columns at speed of three to four drops per second. The DON and ZEA were eluted in 1 mL of acetonitrile and used for HPLC quantification (Shimadzu, Japan). Briefly, analysis was executed in reverse-phase using C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm and 5 μm thickness) and fluorescence detector at excitation and emission wavelengths of 334 and 450 nm for ZEA, and 365 and 455 nm for DON, respectively. The solution of acetonitrile and water (50:50, v/v) was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injection sample was filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters and 25 μL was injected. The calibration curves of DON and ZEA were constructed with a different concentration and peak area, and used to deduce the quantification of mycotoxins.
