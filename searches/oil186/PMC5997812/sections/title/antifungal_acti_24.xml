 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity of CMEO on 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> was determined by the micro-well dilution method, and MIC and MFC values were observed at 421.7 ± 27.14 ppm and 618.3 ± 79.35 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, the antifungal mechanism of CMEO on 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> was assessed by determining the ROS, lipid peroxidation, ergosterol, and micro-morphology of macroconidia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ROS content in the fungal samples was determined using the DCFH-DA staining method. The hydrophobic natured non-fluorescent DCFH-DA molecule moves into the cell and hydrolyzes into DCFH molecule by intracellular esterase enzymes, and further sequential oxidation to DCF releases fluorescence molecule. The intensity of fluorescence was directly proportional to the level of ROS molecules (

  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Kumar et al., 2016</a>). In the present study, ROS levels in CMEO-treated fungi were increased in a dose-dependent manner and results were shown in 
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1A</a>
  </span>. The amount of ROS generated in CMEO-treated fungi was calculated with reference to control (100%), and it was noticed as 117.7 ± 7.24, 126.8 ± 8.40, 136.4 ± 8.53, 174.6 ± 11.65, 189.7 ± 9.36, and 229.3 ± 7.38% at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm of CMEO, respectively. In evidence, CMEO-treated fungi emitted high intensity of fluorescence compared to CMEO untreated control fungi, and fluorescence intensity was enhanced with increasing concentrations of CMEO and exhibited a dose-dependent way (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a>
  </span>). The ROS molecules (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl, and peroxide radicals) play an important role in the biological system, and enhanced level of intracellular ROS molecules destructs cellular components like DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids and even damages the integrity of cellular membrane. This process triggers oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic death of fungi by inhibition of spore germination and biomass production (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Liu et al., 2010</a>) and this could be one of the major reasons for antifungal activity of CMEO on

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the effect of CMEO on lipid peroxidation of fungi was assessed by determining the levels of MDA. The methylene –CH
  <sub>2</sub>– groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids are adversely affected by ROS, and thereby promotes peroxidation of lipids. The lipid peroxidation disturbs the integrity and function of the membrane integrity and produces the aldehyde by-product MDA, which is referred as an indicator for lipid peroxidation. The MDA reacts with DNA and form propane adduct with 2’-deoxyguanosine (M1G-dR), which extremely influence various physiological functions of cell, including cell signaling, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis (
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Vasilaki and McMillan, 2011</a>). In the present study, MDA levels in fungi were enhanced with treatment of CMEO compared to control (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>
  </span>). It was determined as 12.58 ± 1.17, 16.12 ± 2.36, 23.96 ± 3.20, 31.43 ± 5.73, 35.72 ± 2.72, 45.12 ± 3.53, and 51.59 ± 4.94 nM/mg of protein at 0 (control), 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm of CMEO, respectively. The accomplished MDA levels agreed with results of ROS analysis, and the increase in MDA levels could be due to the detrimental interaction of ROS with lipids. The study concluded that antifungal activity of CMEO could be through the detrimental effect on cellular membrane integrity by generation of ROS molecules and lipid peroxidation. In support of our study, 
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Tian et al. (2012)</a> and 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Gao et al. (2016)</a> have evidently demonstrated that essential oils and its active constituents detrimentally affect the plasma membrane and mitochondria and activate apoptotic death of fungi by elevating intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, ergosterol content was relatively less in CMEO-treated fungi compared to control and it was exhibited a dose-dependent fashion of reduction (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>
  </span>). A quantity of 5.83 μg/mg of ergosterol was noticed in control fungal sample. While the quantity of ergosterol in CMEO-treated fungal samples was determined as 5.58 ± 0.43, 4.78 ± 0.20, 2.95 ± 0.46, 1.62 ± 0.30, 0.64 ± 0.16, and 0.23 ± 0.05 μg/mg at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm, respectively. The lipid ergosterol is exclusively found in cellular membranes of fungi and protozoa, and it was crucial for maintaining the integrity and fluidity of cellular membrane similar to cholesterol of animal cells. Ergosterol is measured as one of the indicators for living fungal biomass and inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis is a major target site for most of the antifungal drugs like amphotericin B, miconazole, itraconazole, and clotrimazole. Hence, inhibition of ergosterol synthesis was one of the foremost targets to discovery of new antifungal agents (

  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Sellamani et al., 2016</a>). In the present study, CMEO has successfully decreased the ergosterol levels in fungi and this could be one of vital reasons for antifungal activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the antifungal effect of CMEO on 
  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> was confirmed by observing the micro-morphology of macroconidia by SEM at MIC and MFC values. The CMEO-treated macroconidia were exhibited some distinctive morphological features compared to control (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>
  </span>). The control macroconidia were healthy with homogenous, turgid, and smooth surface (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4A</a>
  </span>). While CMEO-treated macroconidia showed detrimental micro-morphological features such as squashed, rough surface, collapsed, dispersed, wrinkled, protuberances, craters, and vesicles (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>
  </span>). Interestingly, severe detrimental micro-morphological changes in macroconidia were perceived at MFC compared to MIC value of CMEO (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4B,C</a>
  </span>). The study concluded that antifungal activity of CMEO could be due to the detrimental impairment of micro-morphology of macroconidia, and it could be due to the upsurge of ROS and MDA levels, and exhaustion of membrane integrity and ergosterol content.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potent antifungal activity of CMEO was owed to its chemical constituents such as geraniol, geranial, linalool, thymol, limonene, α-phellandrene, ocimene, germacrene-D, and isomenthol. These aromatic compounds cause permeabilization of cellular membranes by destructing the lipids and proteins, and brings coagulation of cytoplasm, leakage of ions, breakdown of proton pump, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of ATP molecules, release of cytochrome c and these concurrent events boost the death of fungi by apoptosis (
