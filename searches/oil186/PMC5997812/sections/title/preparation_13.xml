  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Ribeiro et al. (2013)</a>. Briefly, different ppm of CMEO (up to 1000 ppm) and Tween 80 at a ratio of 2:1 (v/v) were added to 100 mL of 4% chitosan solution and homogenized continuously for 10 min at 50 rpm under a magnetic stirrer. Next, attained emulsion was incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 3 days to form Ce-CMEO-NPs. The characterizations of prepared Ce-CMEO-NPs were assessed by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, Zeta potential and size, and
