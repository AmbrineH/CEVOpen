  <span class="italic">F. graminearum</span> was determined in terms of MIC and MFC by the micro-well dilution method in 96-well microtiter plate adopting the methodology of 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] (2008)</a> with minor modifications. A volume of 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> spores per mL) was added to wells of 96-well microtiter plate and blended with different concentrations of CMEO (up to 1000 ppm) and final volume was attuned to 100 μL with CD broth. The wells devoid of CMEO and with nystatin were control and reference, respectively. The plate was incubated for 3 days at 28°C. Following, MIC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed. The incubation period was continued for 7 days at 28°C and 10 μL was spread on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28°C and MFC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed on CD agar plates.
