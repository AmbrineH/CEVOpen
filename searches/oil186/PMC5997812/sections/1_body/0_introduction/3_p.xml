<p>The status quo apprehensions the insistent incidence of 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and its toxins in agricultural commodities, and demand effective approaches from microbiologists and food technologists to overcome these problems in agriculture and food industry. However, the application of synthetic fungicides has not been acceptable because of increasing concern on multiple drug resistance, environmental safety, and deleterious health issues in humans and animals. Over the last decade, plant-originated mycobiocides, exclusively essential oils have attained a considerable attention as of its non-toxic and eco-friendly (

Particularly, nanomaterials of chitosan were found eco-friendly and safe, and their application in food is highly satisfactory by consumer, food industry, and regulatory agencies (
