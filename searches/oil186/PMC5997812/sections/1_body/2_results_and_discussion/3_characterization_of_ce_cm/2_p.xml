<p>In the present study, various concentrations of CMEO were successfully encapsulated with chitosan by the emulsification process (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro et al., 2013</xref>). The obtained Ce-CMEO-NPs were characterized by FT-IR, SEM, Zeta potential, and size analysis. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release of CMEO from Ce-CMEO-NPs was also investigated in detail. The FT-IR spectra of the (A) chitosan, (B) CMEO, and (C) Ce-CMEO-NPs were detailed in

 </bold> and revealed the successful encapsulation of essential oil with chitosan. The results depict the characteristic absorption bands of chitosan, CEMO, and Ce-CMEO-NPs. The band attendance at 3427 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> in chitosan, CMEO, and Ce-CMEO-NPs represents O-H vibration, which confirms one of the positive signs for encapsulation of chitosan with CMEO. Furthermore, peaks at 2935, 1407, 1038, and 1607 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> in CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs represent the stretching vibrations of C–H, C–N, C–O–C, and N–H, respectively (

 </bold>). The existence of amine groups on the surface of the chitosan is measured as the key to bind to the active functional groups of CMEO. Especially, unique peak at 1607 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> is due to the presence of amine group in chitosan, which is considered to be pivotal in bioconjugation and formation of Ce-CMEO-NPs (

 </bold>). The amino group complexes are having unoccupied coordination points, which act as the binding sites for functional ligands of CMEO constituent molecules like geraniol, geranial, limonene, linalool, and limonene. The bio-active molecules in CMEO are more stabilized due to chitosan conjugation and enhance the effectiveness of the antifungal activity. The morphological feature of Ce-CMEO-NPs was observed by SEM and depicted in 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
 </bold>. The microscopic images revealed that the Ce-CMEO-NPs were showing spherical surface morphology. This is because of high thermodynamic and shape stability of Ce-CMEO-NPs. The agglomerated surface morphology of the prepared Ce-CMEO-NPs is due to the electrostatic interaction of chitosan fragments, which are branched biopolymer.
