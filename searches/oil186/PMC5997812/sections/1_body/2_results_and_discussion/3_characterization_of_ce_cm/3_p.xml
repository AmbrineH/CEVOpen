<p>Furthermore, stability and size of Ce-CMEO-NPs were determined by Zeta potential and size distribution analysis. We have prepared Ce-CMEO-NPs with various loading concentrations of CMEO (ppm). The obtained Zeta potential values are ranging from 39.3 to 37.2 mV for the corresponding particle size of Ce-CMEO-NPs varying from 455 to 480 nm (

 </bold>). The obtained Zeta potential values above 35 mV confirm that the Ce-CMEO-NPs are highly stable, and the particle size of the Ce-CMEO-NPs is not greatly affected by the CMEO loading.
