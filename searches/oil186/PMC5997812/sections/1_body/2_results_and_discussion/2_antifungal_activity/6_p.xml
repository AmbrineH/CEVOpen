<p class="p">The potent antifungal activity of CMEO was owed to its chemical constituents such as geraniol, geranial, linalool, thymol, limonene, Î±-phellandrene, ocimene, germacrene-D, and isomenthol. These aromatic compounds cause permeabilization of cellular membranes by destructing the lipids and proteins, and brings coagulation of cytoplasm, leakage of ions, breakdown of proton pump, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of ATP molecules, release of cytochrome c and these concurrent events boost the death of fungi by apoptosis (
