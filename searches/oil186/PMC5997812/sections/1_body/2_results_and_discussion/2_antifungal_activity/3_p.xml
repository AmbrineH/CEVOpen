<p>Furthermore, the effect of CMEO on lipid peroxidation of fungi was assessed by determining the levels of MDA. The methylene –CH
 <sub>2</sub>– groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids are adversely affected by ROS, and thereby promotes peroxidation of lipids. The lipid peroxidation disturbs the integrity and function of the membrane integrity and produces the aldehyde by-product MDA, which is referred as an indicator for lipid peroxidation. The MDA reacts with DNA and form propane adduct with 2’-deoxyguanosine (M1G-dR), which extremely influence various physiological functions of cell, including cell signaling, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis (

It was determined as 12.58 ± 1.17, 16.12 ± 2.36, 23.96 ± 3.20, 31.43 ± 5.73, 35.72 ± 2.72, 45.12 ± 3.53, and 51.59 ± 4.94 nM/mg of protein at 0 (control), 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm of CMEO, respectively. The accomplished MDA levels agreed with results of ROS analysis, and the increase in MDA levels could be due to the detrimental interaction of ROS with lipids. The study concluded that antifungal activity of CMEO could be through the detrimental effect on cellular membrane integrity by generation of ROS molecules and lipid peroxidation. In support of our study,
