<p>On the other hand, ergosterol content was relatively less in CMEO-treated fungi compared to control and it was exhibited a dose-dependent fashion of reduction (

 </bold>). A quantity of 5.83 μg/mg of ergosterol was noticed in control fungal sample. While the quantity of ergosterol in CMEO-treated fungal samples was determined as 5.58 ± 0.43, 4.78 ± 0.20, 2.95 ± 0.46, 1.62 ± 0.30, 0.64 ± 0.16, and 0.23 ± 0.05 μg/mg at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm, respectively. The lipid ergosterol is exclusively found in cellular membranes of fungi and protozoa, and it was crucial for maintaining the integrity and fluidity of cellular membrane similar to cholesterol of animal cells. Ergosterol is measured as one of the indicators for living fungal biomass and inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis is a major target site for most of the antifungal drugs like amphotericin B, miconazole, itraconazole, and clotrimazole. Hence, inhibition of ergosterol synthesis was one of the foremost targets to discovery of new antifungal agents (
