<p class="p">The ROS content in the fungal samples was determined using the DCFH-DA staining method. The hydrophobic natured non-fluorescent DCFH-DA molecule moves into the cell and hydrolyzes into DCFH molecule by intracellular esterase enzymes, and further sequential oxidation to DCF releases fluorescence molecule. The intensity of fluorescence was directly proportional to the level of ROS molecules (

 </bold>. The amount of ROS generated in CMEO-treated fungi was calculated with reference to control (100%), and it was noticed as 117.7 ± 7.24, 126.8 ± 8.40, 136.4 ± 8.53, 174.6 ± 11.65, 189.7 ± 9.36, and 229.3 ± 7.38% at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm of CMEO, respectively. In evidence, CMEO-treated fungi emitted high intensity of fluorescence compared to CMEO untreated control fungi, and fluorescence intensity was enhanced with increasing concentrations of CMEO and exhibited a dose-dependent way (

 </bold>). The ROS molecules (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl, and peroxide radicals) play an important role in the biological system, and enhanced level of intracellular ROS molecules destructs cellular components like DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids and even damages the integrity of cellular membrane. This process triggers oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic death of fungi by inhibition of spore germination and biomass production (
