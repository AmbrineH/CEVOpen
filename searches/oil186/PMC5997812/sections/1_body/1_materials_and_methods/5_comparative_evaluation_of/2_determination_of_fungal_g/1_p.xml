<p>The fungal growth in maize grains was determined as per our earlier described procedure of 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kalagatur et al. (2018)</xref>. Following incubation, maize grains (10 g) were collected from test samples and suspended in 90 mL of sterile peptone water and homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm using a rotary shaker. Subsequently, decimal dilutions were performed and spread plated on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28Â°C. The viability of fungi was determined in colony forming units (CFU) and expressed in log CFU/g.
