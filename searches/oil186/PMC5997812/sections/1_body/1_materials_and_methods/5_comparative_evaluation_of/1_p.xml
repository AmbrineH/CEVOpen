<p>The inhibitory activity of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on growth and production of DON and ZEA by 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in maize grains was studied under laboratory conditions. A quantity of 100 g pre-sterilized maize grains was inoculated with 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores per mL) in 250 mL of Erlenmeyer flask and exposed to different concentrations of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs (up to 1000 ppm) and thoroughly homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm in a rotary shaker and incubated at 28°C for 28 days. The maize grains inoculated with fungi and not treated with either of CMEO or Ce-CMEO-NPs was referred as control. Following the incubation period, fungal growth and mycotoxins were determined by spread plate and HPLC quantification techniques, respectively.
