<p>The chemical constituent of CMEO was revealed using GC-MS (PerkinElmer Clarus 600 C, Waltham, United States) attached with DB-5MS silica fused column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness), flame-ionization detector (FID), and Turbo Mass software program. Briefly, CMEO was diluted with acetone (10 μL/mL) and 1 μL was injected in a split mode of 1:30. Helium (He) was carrier gas at a delivery rate of 1 mL/min. The mass spectra of compounds were determined at an 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range of 40–450 and ionization energy of 70 eV under vacuum. Identification of the compounds was carried out matching the mass spectra and retention indices of n-alkanes (C-9 to C-24) with NIST05.LIB/Wiley 8th Edition and literature of 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams (2007)</xref>, respectively. The quantification of compounds was attained from GC peak areas with devoid of FID response correction factors.
