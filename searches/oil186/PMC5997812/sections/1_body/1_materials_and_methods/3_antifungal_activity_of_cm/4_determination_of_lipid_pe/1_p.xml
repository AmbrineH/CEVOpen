<p>The effect of CMEO on lipid peroxidation of fungi was done as per methodology of 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. (2016)</xref> with minor modifications. Different concentrations of CMEO (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) along with 10 μl of fungal spore suspension were added to 100 mL of CD broth in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 7 days at 28°C, and fungal sample without CMEO was considered as a control. Next, fungal mycelia were separated from broth by sieving through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and used for estimation of lipid peroxidation. The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) present in the fungal sample was determined as an indicator of the level of lipid peroxidation. The quantification of MDA was done using spectrometric-dependent lipid-peroxidation assay kit as per instructions from the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich).
