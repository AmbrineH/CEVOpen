 </sup> Some of the most considerable aspects of the functions of plant EOs are the pathogen growth inhibition, delaying food spoilage and the improvement of organoleptic quality. Using natural products as antibacterial compounds can reduce health hazards and economic losses that have been produced by foodborne microorganisms.
