<p>According to the disk diffusion agar assay and micro-dilution method, it can be concluded that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> had the highest sensitivity to 
 <italic>M. officinalis </italic>and
 <italic> D. moldavica</italic> EOs. Several studies have shown that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the most sensitive bacteria against essential oils.

 </sup> However, there have been few studies regarding antibacterial effects of 
 <italic>M. officinalis </italic>and 
 <italic>D. moldavica </italic>EOs.

 </sup> In a study carried out on several gram positive and gram negative bacteria, 
 <italic>E.</italic>
 <italic>coli </italic>and the multi-resistant strain of 
 <italic>Shigella sonei </italic>have shown the highest sensitivity to the antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>M. officinalis </italic>EO. In another study,
 <italic> M. officinalis </italic>EO revealed strong antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enterica.</italic>

 </sup> This variation can be due to the differences in major and/or minor components of the EOs. Various factors can affect EOs chemical composition such as climate, seasonal and geographic conditions.
