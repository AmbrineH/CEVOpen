<p> Nowadays consumers prefer to use EOs and plant extracts instead of chemical preservatives in order to prevent microbial growth and oil oxidation.

 </sup> Using DPPH and ABST assays for evaluating antioxidant activity of the EOs in the present study revealed that both EOs were weaker than ascorbic acid and BHT. Although, BCBT indicated a higher activity of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. moldavica </italic>EO than ascorbic acid. These results were in agreement with those reported in former studies.

 </sup> There is a direct correlation between the free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of the essential oils and the concentration. Also, a linear trend has been observed between polyphenolic concentration and radical scavenging activity of different plants.

 </sup> The antioxidant potency of both EOs may be due to the presence of different bioactive EOs compounds which are identified by GC-MS analysis such as flavonoids, geraniol, thymol, geranial, citronellal and citral.
