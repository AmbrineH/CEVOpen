<p class="p">The chemical composition of the EO extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">D. moldavica</italic> harvested in Urmia, Iran, was dominated by geranial, neral, geraniol and geranyl acetate, respectively. These chemical compositions were similar to the chemical composition of the oils from Egypt

 </sup> The results also showed that
