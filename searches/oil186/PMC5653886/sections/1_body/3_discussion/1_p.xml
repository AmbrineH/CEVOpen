<p>The chemical composition of the EO extracted from 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> harvested in Urmia, Iran, was dominated by geranial, neral, geraniol and geranyl acetate, respectively. These chemical compositions were similar to the chemical composition of the oils from Egypt

 </sup> The results also showed that 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> EO was characterized by the presence of four dominating components: Citronellal, Thymol, Citral and β-caryophyllene, respectively. In a study in which EOs obtained from aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> grown in Turkey were analyzed by GC-MS, citronellal (36.62 to 43.78%), citral (10.10 to 17.43%), thymol (0.40 to 11.94%), and β-caryophyllene (5.91 to 7.27%) were recorded as the major components,
