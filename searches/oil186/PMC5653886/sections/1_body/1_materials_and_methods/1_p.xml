 <bold>Plant material and EOs preparation. </bold>Aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants were collected (about 10 kg for each plant) at blossoming stage in the summer 2013 in Urmia, Urmia, Iran and were confirmed by the Herbarium Department of Jahad Agriculture and Natural Resources Center of West Azerbaijan, Iran. The extraction of the EOs were performed using the hydro-distillation method.

 </sup> Briefly, 100 g of the dried parts of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> plants were separately grounded and placed into water (900 mL) in distillation flasks. Each flask was coupled to a Clevenger type apparatus and heated at 100 ˚C for three hr and finally, the upper liquid (i.e. EO) was isolated from the Clevenger apparatus. This procedure was repeated several times to obtain sufficient EOs for further experiments. The obtained EOs were dehydrated over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered by 0.22 μm filters and stored at 4˚C. The yield of EOs were calculated by weighting the obtained EOs each time and then reported as percentage of EOs per 100 g of plants.
