 <bold>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. </bold>The GC/MS analysis of EOs were performed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 (Hewlett Packard Corporation, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 mm film thickness). The Helium flow rate was one mL per min. The column temperature was initially 50 ˚C and then gradually increased to 120 ˚C at 2 ˚C per min rate, held for 3 min, and finally increased to 300 ˚C. The MS procedure was operated through ionization energy of 70 eV. Thereafter, the compounds were identified by comparing their retention indices with those of authentic samples and the mass spectral data available in the library (Wiley-VCH 2001 data software, Weinheim, Germany).
