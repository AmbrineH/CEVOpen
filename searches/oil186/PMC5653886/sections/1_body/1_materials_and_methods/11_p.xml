<p class="p">Radical scavenging activity of the EOs against ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> was measured according to the previously described procedure.

 </sup> The ABTS solution (7.0 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and potassium persulphate solution (2.45 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) in distilled water were separately prepared and reacted together to produce ABTS radicals. The mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 16 hr. The ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> solution was diluted with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm. Aliquots of 200 Î¼L of various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 10 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) of the EOs in methanol and the reference antioxidants (ascorbic acid and BHT) were added to 2 mL of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> solution and mixed vigorously. After an incubation period of 6 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm and the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> scavenging effect was calculated formulas follows:
