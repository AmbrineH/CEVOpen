 <bold>Agar disk diffusion assay. </bold>Sterile paper disks (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20 μL of two concentrations (10 and 15 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) of 
 <italic>M. officinalis </italic>and 
 <italic>D. moldavica </italic>EOs and then placed on the surface of the nutrient agar plates inoculated with 0.1 mL of the bacterial cultures (1.5 × 10
 <sup>6 </sup>CFU mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) under aseptic condition. The plates were then incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 hr and the diameters of inhibition zones were measured using a caliper. Vancomycin and ampicillin antibiotic disks were used as control positives.
