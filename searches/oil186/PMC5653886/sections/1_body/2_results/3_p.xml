<p>The MIC and MBC values of the EOs against tested bacterial strains are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. According to the results, both EOs had the lowest MIC and MBC values (0.12 and 0.25 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The highest MIC and MBC values 
 <italic>of D. moldavica</italic> EO were observed against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S.typhimorium</italic> with the same values (MIC: 2.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, MBC: 4.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>). 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>was the most resistant bacteria to 
 <italic>M. officinalis </italic>EO with similar MIC and MBC values (2.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>).
