 <bold>Antibacterial activity. </bold>The results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> EOs against tested food borne bacteria strains were assessed by agar disk diffusion and broth micro-well dilution assays, (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The examined gram negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and S. 
 <italic>typhimurium</italic>) were more resistant to the antibacterial activity of the EOs than gram positive bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>). Among the tested bacterial strains by disc diffusion assay, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed the lowest and the highest sensitivity to the tested concentrations of the EOs, respectively.
