  <span class="bold">Plant material and EOs preparation. </span>Aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica</span> plants were collected (about 10 kg for each plant) at blossoming stage in the summer 2013 in Urmia, Urmia, Iran and were confirmed by the Herbarium Department of Jahad Agriculture and Natural Resources Center of West Azerbaijan, Iran. The extraction of the EOs were performed using the hydro-distillation method.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>
  </span> Briefly, 100 g of the dried parts of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica</span> plants were separately grounded and placed into water (900 mL) in distillation flasks. Each flask was coupled to a Clevenger type apparatus and heated at 100 ˚C for three hr and finally, the upper liquid (i.e. EO) was isolated from the Clevenger apparatus. This procedure was repeated several times to obtain sufficient EOs for further experiments. The obtained EOs were dehydrated over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered by 0.22 μm filters and stored at 4˚C. The yield of EOs were calculated by weighting the obtained EOs each time and then reported as percentage of EOs per 100 g of plants.

  <span class="bold">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. </span>The GC/MS analysis of EOs were performed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 (Hewlett Packard Corporation, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 mm film thickness). The Helium flow rate was one mL per min. The column temperature was initially 50 ˚C and then gradually increased to 120 ˚C at 2 ˚C per min rate, held for 3 min, and finally increased to 300 ˚C. The MS procedure was operated through ionization energy of 70 eV. Thereafter, the compounds were identified by comparing their retention indices with those of authentic samples and the mass spectral data available in the library (Wiley-VCH 2001 data software, Weinheim, Germany).

  <span class="bold">Evaluation of antibacterial activity. </span>Antibacterial activity of the EOs was investigated against four important food-borne bacteria including 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> (PTCC 1533), 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes </span>(PTCC 1298), 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus </span>(PTCC 1015) and 
  <span class="italic">S. typhimurium </span>(PTCC 1730). The bacterial strains were obtained from a microbial collection of Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran. Bacterial suspensions were prepared to culture the lyophilized bacteria in 9 mL of Brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis
  <span class="italic">, </span>USA) and incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 hr.

  <span class="bold">Agar disk diffusion assay. </span>Sterile paper disks (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20 μL of two concentrations (10 and 15 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) of 
  <span class="italic">M. officinalis </span>and 
  <span class="italic">D. moldavica </span>EOs and then placed on the surface of the nutrient agar plates inoculated with 0.1 mL of the bacterial cultures (1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">6 </span>CFU mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) under aseptic condition. The plates were then incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 hr and the diameters of inhibition zones were measured using a caliper. Vancomycin and ampicillin antibiotic disks were used as control positives.

  <span class="bold">Micro-well dilution assay. </span>Micro-well dilution assay was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the EOs against the tested bacterial strains (
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">S. typhimurium</span>). Bacterial suspensions were prepared while being in log phase, conformed to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity and serially diluted (1:10) to achieve the desired concentration (1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">6 </span>CFU mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). The EOs were dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, then the solutions were prepared at the concentration of 40 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span> as a stock solution, and then the serial two-fold dilutions were made in a concentration range from 0.62 to 40 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>in nutrient broth. Briefly, 160 μL of the nutrient broth, 20 μL of the inoculums and 20 μL of the EOs were added into each well.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>
  </span> Subsequently, the wells without any bacteria and the wells without any EOs were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively. The microplates were mixed gently and incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 hr. The final volume in each well was 200 µL, the final concentrations of EOs were in a range between 0.062 to 4.000 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span> and the final bacterial suspensions in the wells were approximately 1.5×10
  <span class="sup">5</span> CFU mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. The lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth was regarded as MIC values of the EOs. The MBC values were determined by inoculating 10 μL of none-turbid wells on BHI agar, while the lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth on the agar was 
  <span class="italic">regarded</span> as MBC values of the EOs.

  <span class="bold">Determination of antioxidant activity. </span>The possible antioxidant activity of the EOs was assessed by three basically different systems: DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA) assay, β-carotene bleaching test (BCBT) and ABTS assay.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DPPH assay was performed by adding 2 mL of methanolic DPPH solution (24 µg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) to 50 μL of various concentrations of the EOs (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) in methanol. The absorbance of prepared solutions and the blank, containing the same chemicals without any antioxidant, were recorded at 517 nm (Pharmacia LKB Novaspec, Uppsala, Sweden), after an incubation period of 60 min at room temperature in a dark place. Moreover, the 
  <span class="italic">capacity</span> of the EOs to scavenge DPPH radicals was calculated as follows:

  </span> A solution of 0.5 mg β-carotene (type I synthetic; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in 1 mL chloroform was prepared in a flask. Then 25 µL linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 400 mg Tween 40 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added into the flask. The chloroform was removed completely using a rotary evaporator (Model 4003; Heidolph Laborata, Schwabach, Germany) at 40 ˚C and then 100 mL of distilled water was added and shaken vigorously. Aliquots 2.5 mL of this emulsion were transferred into a series of test tubes containing 350 μL of various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) of the EOs. The same procedure was repeated with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid as reference antioxidants along with a blank. The absorbance of each tube was measured at 470 nm immediately at zero time and also after a two-hour period while the tubes were kept in a water bath at 50˚C. The capacity of the EOs to protect against oxidation of β-carotene was determined as follows:

  <span class="sup">-1</span>) of the EOs in methanol and the reference antioxidants (ascorbic acid and BHT) were added to 2 mL of ABTS
