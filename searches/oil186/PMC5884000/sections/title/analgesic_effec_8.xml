 <p id="par0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we noted before, there is a connection between sinusitis and pain in ear, teeth, jaw, throat, neck and so on. Therefore, the analgesic effects of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil can suppress some clinical symptoms in patients suffering from sinusitis.

  </a>. The dose dependent analgesic response of 50-400 mg/kg 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil (p.o) was confirmed in hot plate test, tail-pinch test, acetic acid induced writhing test and early phase of formalin test, while the systemic administration of thymoquinone showed antinociceptive effects in early and late phase of formalin test. The antinociceptive effects 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil and thymoquinone in early phase of formalin test was blocked by naloxone. Also, the antinociceptive effects of thymoquinone in early phase of formalin test was suppressed by naloxone, naloxonazine, while naltrindole had no effects on nociceptive response of thymoquinone. Thymoquinone and 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, therefore, the antinociceptive effects of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil and thymoquinone is via indirect activation of k-opoid and supra-spinal μ1 receptor subtypes

  </a>. The analgesic effects of 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed fixed oil confirm the scientific reason for traditional uses of it in headache and its novel potential in treatment of pain related to sinusitis.
