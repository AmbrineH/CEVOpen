  <p>The results of investigations on 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil showed its therapeutic potential in treatment of sinusitis by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihistaminic, immune-modulator, antimicrobial and analgesic effects. The use of 
   <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil can inhibit the inflammation of sinuses and respiratory airways, microbial infections and finally help the patients suffering from clinical symptoms of sinusitis such as coryza, nasal congestion, headache, neck pain, earache and toothache. Clinical studies are required to evaluate its efficacy in patients with sinusitis in future.
