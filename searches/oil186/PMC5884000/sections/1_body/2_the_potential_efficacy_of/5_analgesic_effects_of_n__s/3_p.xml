 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil (p.o) was confirmed in hot plate test, tail-pinch test, acetic acid induced writhing test and early phase of formalin test, while the systemic administration of thymoquinone showed antinociceptive effects in early and late phase of formalin test. The antinociceptive effects 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil and thymoquinone in early phase of formalin test was blocked by naloxone. Also, the antinociceptive effects of thymoquinone in early phase of formalin test was suppressed by naloxone, naloxonazine, while naltrindole had no effects on nociceptive response of thymoquinone. Thymoquinone and 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, therefore, the antinociceptive effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed fixed oil and thymoquinone is via indirect activation of k-opoid and supra-spinal μ1 receptor subtypes
