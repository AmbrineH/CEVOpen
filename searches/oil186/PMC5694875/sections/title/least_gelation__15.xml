 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Least gelation concentration and bulk density</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gelation occurs when proteins form a three‐dimensional network that is resistant to flow under pressure and least gelation concentration (LGC) is used as an indication of the gelation capacity of food protein (Boye et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0014">2010</a>). The LGC of defatted raw, boiled, and toasted conophor flours are 18.50%, 16.68%, and 12.82%, respectively, while for the protein isolates they were 18.15%, 16.28% and 14.90% for the raw, boiled, and toasted samples, respectively. There was no significant difference between the LGC of the raw and boiled samples of the defatted flour and protein isolates. The toasted samples had the lowest LGC for the defatted flour and the protein isolate. The present values showed conophor protein isolates as very poor gelling agent compared to 10% for soybean flour and safflower (Padilla, Alvarez, &amp; Alfaro, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0046">1996</a>; Ulloa et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0054">2011</a>) and 13.5% for cashewnut protein isolates (Ogunwolu, Henshaw, Mock, Santros, &amp; Awonorin, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0042">2009</a>), but better gelling than the 22% for hemp protein isolate (Malomo et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0036">2014</a>) because, the lower the LGC the better the gelling ability. The gelation properties are dependent on the nature of the protein and other non‐protein components of the sample (Omowaye‐Taiwo et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0043">2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bulk density (BD) of the defatted flours ranged from 0.36% to 0.58 g/ml (Table 
  <a rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3508-tbl-0004">4</a>) with the lowest and highest BD in raw and toasted conophor nut flours, respectively. These values are higher than earlier report for ginger bread plum and peanut meal (Amza, Amadou, Kamara, Zhu, &amp; Zhou, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0007">2011</a>). The BD was however improved in the protein isolates with values of 0.62, 0.65 and 0.67 g/ml for the raw, boiled, and toasted samples, respectively. These values are higher than 0.31 g/ml reported for cashew nut (Ogunwolu et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0042">2009</a>) and 0.27 g/ml for safflower (Ulloa et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0054">2011</a>). The BD is an indication of the porosity of a product that influences package design and could be used in determining the type of packaging material required for the product. Higher bulk densities are usually desirable in the food industries for the packaging advantages they offer (Fagbemi, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0024">1999</a>).
