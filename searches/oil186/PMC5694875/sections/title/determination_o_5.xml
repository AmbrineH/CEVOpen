 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proximate composition of the defatted conophor nut flour and the protein isolate was determined according to the standard procedures of Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 
  <a rid="fsn3508-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3508-bib-0008">1990</a>). The micro Kjeldahl nitrogen method was used in the determination of the crude protein content. A conversion factor of 6.25 was used to convert the nitrogen content to protein. The carbohydrate content was determined by difference (100 − [moisture + total ash + crude fat + crude fiber + protein]).
