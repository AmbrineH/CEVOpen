<p class="p">The bulk density was determined essentially as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Foaming capacity (FC) and foaming stability (FS) were carried out as described by Sze‐Tao and Sathe (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The sample (0.5 g) was dispersed in 50 ml of distilled water in a 100 ml graduated cylinder and the solutions homogenized at a speed of 1,600 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min. The volume was recorded before and after whipping. FC was expressed as the volume (%) increase due to whipping. This was then stored for 1 hr and the foam‐volume changes in the graduated cylinder were recorded as FS. Both were calculated in percentages as shown below:
