<p>The least gelation concentration (LGC) was determined according to the method described by Abbey and Ibeh (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). The sample was weighed and mixed with 5 ml of distilled water in a test tube to obtain 2%–20% (w/v) concentrations. The test tube was heated for 1 hr in a boiling water bath followed by rapid cooling under running tap water and further cooled for 2 hr in a refrigerator at 4°C. The LGC was regarded as the least concentration at which the sample from the inverted tube did not fall or slip.
