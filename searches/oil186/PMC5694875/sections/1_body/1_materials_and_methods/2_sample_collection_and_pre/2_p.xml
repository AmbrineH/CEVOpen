<p>Matured, fresh conophor nuts were obtained from a market near the Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria. The nuts were washed to remove dirt and divided into three parts. A part was boiled at 100°C for 30 min and another portion was toasted at 120°C for 45 min, while the third part was used in the raw form. All the nuts were shelled separately and comminuted using mortar and pestle to obtain coarse flour, which were then further ground in a mill (Retsch, Germany) and kept at 4°C for further analyses.</p>
