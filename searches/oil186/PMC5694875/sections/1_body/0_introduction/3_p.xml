<p>Conophor nut (
 <italic>Tetracarpidium conophorum</italic>), commonly called African walnut, is one of the greatly underutilized oilseeds belonging to the family 
 <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic>. The monoecious and high‐climbing plant produce seeds which become dark brown with hard testa when mature. Its economic importance lies in the edibility of its oil‐rich seeds which are consumed in Sub‐Saharan Africa (Enujiugha, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The nut is rich in minerals and high‐quality proteins (Odoemelam, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Edem, Dosunmu, &amp; Bassey, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). This makes it a potential plant protein that can supplement the monotonous starchy staples being consumed by many in developing countries with little or no alternatives.
