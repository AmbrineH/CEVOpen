<p class="p">The bitter after‐taste of raw conophor nut upon reaction with water has greatly limited its use in food product development. Till date, neither is there any final product application reported for the oil‐rich seed nor any use as protein supplement. Processing through the application of heat has been reported to reduce antinutritional factors and toxic contents in nuts and legumes resulting in more effective use of the seeds (Devappa &amp; Swamylingappa,

 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Toasting, aside from reducing antinutrients, improves the taste and nutrient quality of food products and lowers the moisture contents, thus increasing the shelf life. The amino acid composition and functional properties of cashew nut were reported to have improved due to processing (Fagbemi,
