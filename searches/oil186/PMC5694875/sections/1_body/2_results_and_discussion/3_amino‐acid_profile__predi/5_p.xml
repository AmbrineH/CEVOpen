<p>The predicted BV for conophor nut isolates 57.83%, 73.15%, and 76.97% for the raw, boiled, and toasted samples, and they compared favorably with those reported for common legumes especially soybean curd (Pedroche et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). The increase in BV of the samples due to boiling and toasting is an indication of improved digestibility potential and effective utilization of the processed nuts over the raw seeds. The predicted protein efficiency ratio ranged from 2.39 to 2.60 and are higher than 2.22–2.34 reported for lupin protein isolates (El‐Adawy, Rahma, El‐Bedawey, &amp; Gafar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), but compares well with the values reported for beach pea and conophor nut protein isolates (Chavan et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Gbadamosi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2012b</xref>). Hence, conophor nut protein may be a good dietary vegetable protein supplement.
