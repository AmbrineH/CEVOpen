<p>The amino acid score of the conophor nut protein isolates from defatted raw, cooked, and toasted flour are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>. The isolates are very rich in all the essential amino acids. The scores for cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contents of conophor nut protein isolates were particularly higher than the other amino acids. Processing by boiling or toasting however resulted in a decrease in the sulfur‐containing amino acid (methionine and cysteine) residues in the protein isolates (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>). Earlier studies have also reported reduction in methionine and cysteine composition of leguminous seeds after heat processing (Chau, Cheung, &amp; Wong, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Mubarak, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The chemical scores showed that the first limiting amino acids in both the boiled and toasted nuts was methionine (36.25%) while the second limiting amino acid was lysine with 59.52% and 51.43% for the boiled and toasted samples, respectively, when compared to the egg protein reference. Methionine has been reported as a limiting amino acid in the Chinese leguminous plant Dolichos lablab after processing by cooking (Chau et al.,
