<p>The effect of processing on the amino acid composition of the protein isolates is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>. The concentration of valine, leucine, and threonine were particularly higher than other essential amino acids and comparable with the reference protein. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and arginine were the highest among the non‐essential amino acids. Similar observation on other plant proteins have been earlier reported (Fagbemi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Ajibola, Malomo, Fagbemi, &amp; Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). There were increases of up to 18.85%, 33.5%, and 37.5% in the glycine, tryptophan, and histidine, respectively, for isolates of the processed samples. This may be due to chemical reactions as a result of the processing method employed. There were reductions in the other amino acids of conophor proteins ranging from 0.3% to 15.84% in the toasted seed protein with lysine reducing by 15.84% due to heat processing in the toasted sample. High temperature treatments have been reported to reduce lysine and its bioavailability due to formation of Maillard reaction in hazelnut (Özdemir et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Fagbemi (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) has also reported decreases in most of the amino acids of cashewnut when processed by drying, fermentation, and germination.
