<p>The proportion of the essential amino acid ranged from 40.57% to 41.55%; they were higher than the 36% considered for an ideal protein (FAO/WHO, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), but slightly lower than the egg reference of 51.2% (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). The values are higher than the 19% obtained for hull free defatted melon “egusi” flour (
 <italic>Colocynths citrullus</italic> L.) which is a commonly consumed oil‐seed in Sub‐Saharan Africa for its protein content (Akobundu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>), hence, conophor nut protein can be regarded as good quality protein. The Arg/Lys ratios obtained in this work are higher than the 2.31, 1.40, &lt;1, 0.44 and &lt;3 reported for hemp, soybean, kidney bean, casein, and rice protein isolates, respectively (Tang, Ten, Wang, &amp; Yang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Mundi &amp; Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). High ratio of Arg/Lys in the diet produces beneficial hypocholesterolemic effects in improving the cardiovascular health (Malomo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and also helps in hypertension regulation (Vallabha, Tapal, Sukhdeo, Govindaraju, &amp; Tiku, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, the present results showed that the conophor nut protein isolates might have positive effects on the cardiovascular system.
