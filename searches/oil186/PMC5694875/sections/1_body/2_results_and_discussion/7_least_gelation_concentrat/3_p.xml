<p>The bulk density (BD) of the defatted flours ranged from 0.36% to 0.58 g/ml (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>) with the lowest and highest BD in raw and toasted conophor nut flours, respectively. These values are higher than earlier report for ginger bread plum and peanut meal (Amza, Amadou, Kamara, Zhu, &amp; Zhou, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The BD was however improved in the protein isolates with values of 0.62, 0.65 and 0.67 g/ml for the raw, boiled, and toasted samples, respectively. These values are higher than 0.31 g/ml reported for cashew nut (Ogunwolu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and 0.27 g/ml for safflower (Ulloa et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The BD is an indication of the porosity of a product that influences package design and could be used in determining the type of packaging material required for the product. Higher bulk densities are usually desirable in the food industries for the packaging advantages they offer (Fagbemi,
