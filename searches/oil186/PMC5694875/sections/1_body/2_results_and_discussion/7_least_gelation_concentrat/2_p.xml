<p>Gelation occurs when proteins form a three‐dimensional network that is resistant to flow under pressure and least gelation concentration (LGC) is used as an indication of the gelation capacity of food protein (Boye et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The LGC of defatted raw, boiled, and toasted conophor flours are 18.50%, 16.68%, and 12.82%, respectively, while for the protein isolates they were 18.15%, 16.28% and 14.90% for the raw, boiled, and toasted samples, respectively. There was no significant difference between the LGC of the raw and boiled samples of the defatted flour and protein isolates. The toasted samples had the lowest LGC for the defatted flour and the protein isolate. The present values showed conophor protein isolates as very poor gelling agent compared to 10% for soybean flour and safflower (Padilla, Alvarez, &amp; Alfaro, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Ulloa et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and 13.5% for cashewnut protein isolates (Ogunwolu, Henshaw, Mock, Santros, &amp; Awonorin, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), but better gelling than the 22% for hemp protein isolate (Malomo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) because, the lower the LGC the better the gelling ability. The gelation properties are dependent on the nature of the protein and other non‐protein components of the sample (Omowaye‐Taiwo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
