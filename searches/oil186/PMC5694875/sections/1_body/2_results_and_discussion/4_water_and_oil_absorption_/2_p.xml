<p class="p">In defatted conophor nuts, WAC was lowest (1.18 g/g) and highest (1.36 g/g) in the raw and toasted flours, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). The increase in the WAC of the toasted conophor nut flour may be due to partial denaturation of proteins during the toasting process which could result in improvement of WAC. During toasting, major proteins can dissociate into subunits with more water binding sites than the native oligomeric proteins; combined with gelatinization of carbohydrates which leads to swelling thus resulting in overall increase in WAC (Akubor, Isolokwu, Ugbane, &amp; Onimawo, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The values obtained for the WAC of the raw, boiled and toasted conophor nut protein isolates are 8.96, 7.34, and 7.54 g/g, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). These values were significantly (

This may be due to the ability of the protein isolates to dissociate and unfold to expose the additional binding sites. The value obtained in this study for WAC of conophor nut protein isolates are higher than 4.2 g/g from

 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), 3.50 g/g from

 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) and 5.5–6.7 g/g from Bambara groundnut (Adebowale, Schwarzenbolz, &amp; Henle, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Thus, the conophor nut protein isolates may find use as functional ingredient in soups, gravies and baked products.
