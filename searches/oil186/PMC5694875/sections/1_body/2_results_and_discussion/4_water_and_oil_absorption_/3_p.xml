<p class="p">The OAC of the raw, boiled, and toasted conophor nut protein isolates are 6.11, 6.21, 6.24 g/g, respectively while the defatted conophor nut flours had OAC of 1.00, 1.07, 1.08 g/g, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). The higher protein contents of the isolates compared to those of defatted flours (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) could have aided the protein‐protein interactions that contributed to the high OAC of the isolates. It may also be due to the exposure of more hydrophobic amino acids. The values obtained for OAC of the defatted flour samples in this study were lower than 2.00 g/g reported for defatted niger seed flour (Bhagya &amp; Sastry, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The OAC values obtained for conophor nut protein isolates are higher than 5.2 g/g from hemp and 5.32 g/g from soybean (Tang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), 2.2–7.2 g/g for Bambara groundnut (Adebowale et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), 1.12 g/g from mungbean (Akaerue &amp; Onwuka, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and 4.6 g/g from 
 <italic class="italic">Canavalia ensiformis</italic> (Chel‐Guerrero et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) protein isolates. The values, however, compare well with the 5.5–6.3 g/g reported for Indian black gram protein isolate (Wani et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Although, the values obtained were lower than 13.7 g/g reported for hemp protein isolate (Malomo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), the conophor protein isolate is still laden with potential to be applied as ingredient in pie‐filling, meat extenders and meat substitutes for sausages, where the protein could bridge the fat and water contents preventing the loss of both.
