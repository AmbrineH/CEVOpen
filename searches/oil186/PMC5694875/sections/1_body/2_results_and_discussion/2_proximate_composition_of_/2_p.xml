<p class="p">The protein content of the defatted conophor nut flours ranged from 58.86 to 59.02 g/100 g (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). There was no significant difference in the crude protein content of the defatted conophor nut flours irrespective of the processing techniques. The protein content of the isolates ranged from 86.86 to 87.74 g/100 g, about 1.5‐fold increase when compared to the defatted flour (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar increases in the protein contents of various isolates have been reported with various methods of extraction such as alkali solubilization, isoelectric‐ and micellization‐ precipitation (Wang, Tang, Yang, &amp; Gao, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Teh, Bekhit, Carne, &amp; Birch, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Malomo, He, &amp; Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The values recorded for the protein content of the isolates in this study is higher than the 80% reported by Gbadamosi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>). This may be due to the methods of extraction and crude protein determination. The values, however, compared well with protein isolate from peanut that has been heat processed (Kain, Chen, Sonda, &amp; Abu‐Kpawoh, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and Indian black gram that was subjected to alkali solubilization and isoelectric precipitation (Wani, Sogi, &amp; Gill, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The major determinants of the level of protein in isolates obtainable from legumes are the nature of the plant material and the method of extraction (Malomo &amp; Aluko, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The total ash, crude fiber, and crude fat of the defatted flours were significantly higher than those of the isolates irrespective of the processing technique (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). All the data are in agreement with previous reports on the composition of the isolates of mungbean, lentil, chickpea, pea, and winged bean (Li, Shu, Yan, &amp; Shen, 
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Karaca, Low, &amp; Nickerson,
