 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lipid profile was significantly altered in animals fed with CDD [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">Table 3</a>]. TC, LDL-C, and TAG were increased and HDL-C was decreased due to NAFLD induced by CDD (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001). Treatment with AE and AO could reverse the alterations in lipid profile of rats in a dose-dependent manner. All doses of tested materials were significantly effective toward the reduction of TC, LDL-C, and TAG (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Highest doses of AE (200 mg/kg/day) and AO (0.5 ml/kg/day) showed the best lipid-lowering activity [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">Table 3</a>, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001]. The same effect was observed regarding HDL-C level. All doses of the extract and essential oil could significantly improve serum HDL-C level compared with vehicle-treated group (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). It is worthy to mention that 200 mg/kg/day of the extract could modify lipid profile parameters (except for TC) to the level of normal diet-treated group [
