 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Histological evaluations were performed using H and E staining method [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>]. Normal diet rats showed normal liver histology. In vehicle-treated group, severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling were observed which confirmed the induction of NAFLD. Treatment with 200 mg/kg/day of AE and 0.5 ml/kg/day of AO as well as simvastatin could remarkably decrease macrovesicular steatohepatitis in tissue sections of animals. Other doses of AE and AO showed the positive effect to a lesser extent.

   <p>Histological changes in rats with choline-deficient diet - induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: (a) Normal group (sham): Liver sinusoid and hepatocytes are normal. (b) Vehicle-treated group: Severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling are observable. (c) Positive control: Some sinusoids are swelled but cellular damage is repaired in comparison to vehicle-treated animals. (d)
