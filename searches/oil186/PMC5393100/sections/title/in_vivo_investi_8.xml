 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Male Wistar rats, aged 8–9 weeks and weighted 250–300 g, were used for this study. The animals were individually kept under standard vivarium condition (temperature of 25 ± 1°C and relative humidity of 45%–55%, 12 h light, and 12 h dark cycle) with free access to food and water for 1 week to become adapted to the animal laboratory condition. The experiment was approved by the animal ethics guidelines of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. NAFLD was induced with a CDD composed of lard (TD 98262) containing 6.5% kcal from protein, 46.7% kcal from carbohydrate, and 46.8% kcal from fat.[
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>] Rats were randomly divided into ten groups with six animals in each group.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment was performed in two phases. In the first phase (90 days), all experimental groups received CDD for the induction of NAFLD, except one group which received normal pellet diet (sham). At the end of this phase, blood samples, collected from the jugular vein, were analyzed for the confirmation of NAFLD induction.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second phase, lasted 30 days, sham group continued treatment with normal diet while CDD-treated animals received the following treatments: CDD along with vehicle (as negative control), simvastatin (10 mg/kg, as positive control), 25 mg/kg anise fruit extract (AE), 50 mg/kg AE, 100 mg/kg AE, 200 mg/kg AE, 0.125 ml/kg anise fruit essential oil (AO), 0.25 ml/kg AO, and 0.5 ml/kg AO. The suggested doses for AO were calculated based on a primary study for the determination of LD50. Animal weight gain was periodically measured. At the end of the second phase, all rats were sacrificed, blood samples were collected in heparinized test tubes, and the sera were obtained after centrifuge (3000 rpm) for 20 min.[
