 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NAFLD is one of the most common liver disorders with an increasing prevalence in developed countries due to unhealthy high-fat and high-carbohydrate diets.[
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>] Treatment approaches for the management of NAFLD are lifestyle modification, antioxidants, oral hypoglycemic agents, antihyperlipidemics, and surgical interventions in severe cases, which enforce high costs to patients as well as health-care system.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] Thus, scientists are seeking new ways with higher efficacy and lower cost as well as better patient's compliance to treat NAFLD.

  <span class="italic">P. anisum</span> has a long history of medicinal use in traditional and folkloric medicine of Iran.[
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>] The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of AE and AO in animal model of NAFLD induced by CDD. CDD causes less production of very LDL-C which results in TAG accumulation in liver tissue and provides a suitable model for the assessment of drugs in NAFLD.[
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] In our study, both AE and AO showed positive effects toward the reduction of weight gain compared with vehicle-treated group. The effect was in a dose-dependent manner so that 200 mg/kg/day of AE and 0.5 ml/kg/day of AO were the most effective treatments. All treatment groups represented reduced serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and TAG and increased HDL-C level. As one of the treatment approaches for NAFLD are antihyperlipidemic agents, it could be concluded that AE and AO can protect fat accumulation in liver tissue through modulation of lipid profile. Administration of anise fruit to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol, and TAG. Protein oxidation in serum and LPO in erythrocytes and plasma was also decreased. A significant rise in serum β-carotene, Vitamin A, and Vitamin C levels was also reported.[
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a>] β-carotene was associated with histological amelioration as well as decrease in hepatic enzymes and improvement of lipid profile in rats with NAFLD.[
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>] Cao 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. demonstrated lower risk for developing NAFLD among Chinese adults with higher serum carotenoids.[
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>] Retinoic acid, an active metabolite of Vitamin D, was showed to be lower in subjects with NAFLD compared to healthy controls.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A growing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress has a key role in several chronic conditions, including metabolic disorders.[
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>] Considering antioxidant therapy as one of the current treatments for NAFLD, it could be concluded that free radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. In the present study, measurement of serum levels of oxidative damage biomarkers including FRAP, LPO, TTM, and MPO demonstrated that anise fruit extract as well as essential oil could improve antioxidant defense mechanisms. As a result, anise fruit is not only useful due to its ability to modify lipid profile but also represents observable 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> antioxidant activity, thus has a dual action against the disease progression.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Histopathological investigations also confirmed less vacuolar degeneration and macrovesicular steatohepatitis in the tissue sections of animals treated with high doses of AE and AO. Hepatic enzymes including AST and ALT were increased in animals fed with CDD. Treatment with AE and AO as well as gold standard drug, simvastatin, significantly reversed this increase in comparison to vehicle-treated group. Jamshidzadeh 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. demonstrated that different extracts and essential oil of anise fruits have hepatoprotective activity both 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. Anise fruit decreased CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats as well as hepatoma cell line.[

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main chemical compounds of essential oil were trans-anethole (89.24%), γ-himachalene (2.89%), and methyl chavicol (2.72%). Samojlik 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. showed the major constituents of anise essential oil were trans-anethole (87.96%) followed by γ-himachalene (3.17%), cis-isoeugenol (2.21%), and linalool (1.78%).[
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>] In another study on chemical composition of essential oil, anethole accounted for 88.1% of identified constituents, followed by pseudo-iso-eugenyl-2-methyl butyrate (4.15%), and γ-himachalene (4.15%).[
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">31</a>] Trans-anethole showed hepatoprotective activities in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice with reduction of serum ALT, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 6 levels. Increased in nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), release of high-mobility group box-1 into the extracellular milieu, and the interactions between IRF-1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 after ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated by trans-anethole. Moreover, trans-anethole suppressed increases in toll-like receptor-4.[
