  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine male and female specimens were collected. Leaves and flowers were pooled to provide representative homogeneous samples of the population, separated into three replicates and stored under refrigeration (−22 °C) until extraction. Essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation for 3.5 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The crude oil was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a glass flask at −22 °C until GC-MS analysis and biological activities. The oil yields were calculated based on the oil and fresh plant material weights as mean ± standard deviation of the triplicates [

Chemical analysis of the essential oils was performed on an Agilent 6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), interfaced with a 5973 Series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm) (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatography conditions were as follows; oven temperature program: 40 °C for 1 min with subsequent temperature increase of 3 °C/min up to 240 °C, keeping it at this temperature for 10 min.; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature of 250 °C; electron ionization: 70 eV. The component abundances were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the triplicates. The essential oil components were identified by comparing the retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of
