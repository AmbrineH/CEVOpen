 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine male and female specimens were collected. Leaves and flowers were pooled to provide representative homogeneous samples of the population, separated into three replicates and stored under refrigeration (−22 °C) until extraction. Essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation for 3.5 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The crude oil was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a glass flask at −22 °C until GC-MS analysis and biological activities. The oil yields were calculated based on the oil and fresh plant material weights as mean ± standard deviation of the triplicates [
