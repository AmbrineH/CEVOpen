  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> presented clear inhibition zones corresponding to antifungal activity in the limit of detection against 
  <span class="italic">Cladosporium cladosporioides</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. sphaerospermum</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f002" href="#medicines-04-00055-f002">Figure 2</a>). Female flowers presented the strongest activity for both fungi from 200 μg until 25 μg of essential oil tested, but the other oils presented weaker inhibition, up to 50 μg against 
  <span class="italic">C. sphaerospermum</span> and to 25 μg against 
  <span class="italic">C. cladosporioides</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After TLC elution of the most active oils, two inhibition bands, at retention factors (R
  <sub>f</sub>’s) of 0.67 and 0.12, were observed in all samples (
