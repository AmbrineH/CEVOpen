 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil yields for male and female 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> flowers were 0.24 ± 0.01 and 0.38 ± 0.01%, respectively. The yield of leaf essential oils, both male and female, presented a yield of 0.33 ± 0.01% (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifty compounds were identified from all essential oils analyzed, comprising 96–98% of the total components. The major compounds for all 
  <span class="italic">H. brasiliense</span> essential oils were sabinene, curzerene, and carotol. Leaf essential oils presented mostly monoterpenes (53% ♂ and 55% ♀), followed by sesquiterpenes (39% ♂ and 41% ♀), and phenylpropanoids (2% ♀ and 5% ♂). Flower essential oils presented monoterpenes (54% ♀ and 45% ♂), sesquiterpenes (40% ♂ and 50% ♀), and phenylpropanoids (1% ♂ and 2% ♀). The leaf main constituents were sabinene (16%), β-pinene (5%), 1,8-cineole (3–7%), methyl eugenol (2–5%), curzerene (17–18%), and carotol (6%), while flowers presented sabinene (8–10%), α-phellandrene (1–8%), 1,8-cineole (2–7%), germacrene D (4–6%), curzerene (11%), and carotol (9%) as major compounds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal Component Analysis (PCA) data from 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00055-t001" href="#medicines-04-00055-t001">Table 1</a> generated a plot, which condensed scores and loadings of the first two components, PC1 and PC2, which explain 61% and 34% of total variance (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f001" href="#medicines-04-00055-f001">Figure 1</a>). Leaves presented higher amounts of sabinene and curzerene than flowers, while flowers presented higher amounts of carotol, as discriminated by PCA (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00055-f001" href="#medicines-04-00055-f001">Figure 1</a>). Furthermore, PCA analysis showed that female flowers and leaves presented higher amounts of 1,8-cineole than the male counterparts (
