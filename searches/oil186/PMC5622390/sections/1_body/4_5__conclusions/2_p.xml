<p>This was the first report of antifungal activity of curzerene, explaining partially the activity of 
 <italic>H. brasiliense</italic> essential oils by bioautography. Moreover, the complex mixture of α-terpineol, α-eudesmol, and ferula lactone I may have acted synergistically to the antifungal activity observed. Bioautography assay helped to detect antifungal fractions in a complex matrix of essential oils and guided to the isolation of target-directed constituents. Further studies are necessary to isolate higher amounts of pure curzerene, in order to test its limit of detection.
