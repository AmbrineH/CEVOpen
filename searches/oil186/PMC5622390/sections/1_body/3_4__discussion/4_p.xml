 <italic>Hedyosmum</italic> spp essential oils are known to contain several phenylpropanoids [

 <italic>H. scabrum</italic> leaves, which contained 55.8% of estragole and 6.6% of anethole [

 <italic>H. brasiliense</italic> specimens from different geographic origins have shown methyl chavicol, eugenol acetate, methyl eugenol, and estragole [
