Methanol (10 μL) was used as the negative control and as the positive controls, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) at concentrations between 130–4.1 μg/mL. The microplate was incubated in the dark at 45 °C and subsequently the absorbance was read at 450 nm (multi-well scanner BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA), immediately after adding the reactive solution and every 30 min for 2 h. The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the AA% = 100 − {[(Abs
