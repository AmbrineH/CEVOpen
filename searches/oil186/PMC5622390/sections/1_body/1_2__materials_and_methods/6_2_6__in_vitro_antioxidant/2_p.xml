<p>The antioxidant activity was also evaluated by the β-carotene bleaching test, which is based on spectrophotometric measurements of the β-carotene oxidation induced by the lipoperoxidation products from linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B27-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to determine the concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The essential oil (10 μL) solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 10,400–325 μg/mL was added in a 96-well microplate, together with 250 μL of a reactive solution composed by β-carotene and linoleic acid in water saturated with O
 <sub>2</sub>. Methanol (10 μL) was used as the negative control and as the positive controls, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) at concentrations between 130–4.1 μg/mL. The microplate was incubated in the dark at 45 °C and subsequently the absorbance was read at 450 nm (multi-well scanner BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA), immediately after adding the reactive solution and every 30 min for 2 h. The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the AA% = 100 − {[(Abs 
 <sub>final</sub> − Abs 
 <sub>initial</sub>) × 100]/Abs 
 <sub>control</sub>}. All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean ± standard deviation.
