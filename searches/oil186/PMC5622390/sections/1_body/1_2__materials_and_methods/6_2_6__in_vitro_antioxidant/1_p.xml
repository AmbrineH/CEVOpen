<p>The antioxidant activity was performed by the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging method [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00055" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], adapted for microplates. 178 μL of the essential oils solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 4480–560 μg/mL were added to a 96-well microplate and 72 μL of DPPH (0.3 mmol/L) solubilized in methanol were added. Blank reading was performed with the test sample prior to the DPPH radical incubation. As a negative control, 178 μL of methanol was used. As positive controls, quercetin from 20 to 0.625 μg/mL and 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract (Herbarium Laboratório Botânico S.A., Paraná, Brazil) from 40 to 1.25 μg/mL were used. The microplate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 518 nm using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA). The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the formula AA% = 100 − {[(Abs 
 <sub>sample</sub> − Abs 
 <sub>blank</sub>) × 100]/Abs 
 <sub>control</sub>}. All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean ± standard deviation. The amount of essential oil required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>).
