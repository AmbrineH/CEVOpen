  <bold class="bold">Background</bold>: 
  <italic class="italic">Hedyosmum brasiliense</italic> Mart. ex Miq. (Chloranthaceae) is a dioecious shrub popularly used in Brazil to treat foot fungi and rheumatism. This work investigated the chemical composition, antifungal, and antioxidant activities of flowers and leaves of 
  <italic class="italic">H. brasiliense</italic> essential oils; 
  <bold class="bold">Methods</bold>: 
  <italic class="italic">H. brasiliense</italic> male and female flowers and leaves were collected at Ilha do Cardoso (São Paulo) and the essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS and their similarity compared by Principal Component Analysis. Antifungal activity was performed by bioautography and antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging and β-carotene/linoleic acid system; 
  <bold class="bold">Results</bold>: The major compounds for all oils were sabinene, curzerene, and carotol, but some differences in their chemical composition were discriminated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis. Bioautography showed two antifungal bands at Rf’s 0.67 and 0.12 in all samples, the first one was identified as curzerene. The oils presented stronger antioxidant potential in β-carotene/linoleic acid bioassay, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>’s from 80 to 180 μg/mL, than in DPPH assay, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>’s from 2516.18 to 3783.49 μg/mL; 
  <bold class="bold">Conclusions</bold>: These results suggested that curzerene might be responsible for the antifungal activity of 
  <italic class="italic">H. brasiliense</italic> essential oils. Besides, these essential oils exhibited potential to prevent lipoperoxidation, but they have a weak radical scavenger activity.
