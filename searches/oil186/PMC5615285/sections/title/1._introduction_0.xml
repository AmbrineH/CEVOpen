 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fennel (Arpabodiyon, local Tajik name), 
  <span class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</span> Miller, an important member of the Apiaceae, is widely used for flavouring foods and beverages due to its pleasant spicy aroma [
  <a rid="B1-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-foods-06-00073">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-foods-06-00073">2</a>]. In traditional medicine, the plant and its essential oil have been extensively used as carminative, digestive, galactogogue and diuretic and to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders [
  <a rid="B1-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-foods-06-00073">1</a>]. It is also used as a constituent in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products [
  <a rid="B3-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-foods-06-00073">3</a>]. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span>, in particular anethole, exhibits antispasmodic, carminative, anti-inflammatory, estrogenic and anti-microbial activities [
  <a rid="B4-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-foods-06-00073">4</a>]. In vitro, fennel oil possesses antioxidant [
  <a rid="B5-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-foods-06-00073">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-foods-06-00073">6</a>], antimicrobial [
  <a rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-06-00073">7</a>], insecticidal [
  <a rid="B8-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-foods-06-00073">8</a>], antithrombotic [
  <a rid="B9-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-foods-06-00073">9</a>] and hepatoprotective activities [
  <a rid="B2-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-foods-06-00073">2</a>]. Furthermore, the essential oil of fennel exhibits in vitro anticancer activity [
  <a rid="B10-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-foods-06-00073">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-06-00073">11</a>,
  <a rid="B12-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-foods-06-00073">12</a>]. The in vitro cytotoxic, genotoxic, and apoptotic activities of estragole were suspected to induce hepatic tumors in susceptible strains of mice [
  <a rid="B10-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-foods-06-00073">10</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anethole is toxic in high concentrations [
  <a rid="B4-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-foods-06-00073">4</a>]. Because of their lipophilic properties, the secondary metabolites of essential oils are able to penetrate cytoplasmic membranes by free diffusion. This process can affect membrane fluidity and permeability, transport, ion equilibrium and membrane potential [
  <a rid="B13-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-06-00073">13</a>], leading to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis [
  <a rid="B11-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-06-00073">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of fennel is rich in secondary metabolites, which carry reactive substituents (among them carbonyl groups) in their ring structures or side chains. Aldehydes are generally long-lived and electrophilic compounds, they can react with molecular targets which carry free amino groups, such as of amino acid residues in proteins or of nucleotides in DNA to form Schiffâ€™s bases [
  <a rid="B14-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-06-00073">14</a>]. Aldehyde-containing essential oils often exhibit cytotoxicity [

  <a rid="B16-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-foods-06-00073">16</a>] by reacting with cellular nucleophiles, including proteins and nucleic acids [
  <a rid="B13-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-06-00073">13</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> from different geographical locations has been extensively studied [
  <a rid="B6-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-foods-06-00073">6</a>,
  <a rid="B18-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-foods-06-00073">18</a>,

  <a rid="B20-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-06-00073">20</a>]. According to these studies, the major components of fennel oil are 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, estragole, fenchone, and limonene depending on the chemotype [
  <a rid="B21-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-foods-06-00073">21</a>,

  <a rid="B23-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-06-00073">23</a>]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of fennel growing in Tajikistan (Central Asia) and to explore cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines. The biological activity and chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> oil from Tajikistan have not been previously reported.
