 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity of the oil was tested against HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7, CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cancer cell lines (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t003" href="#foods-06-00073-t003">Table 3</a>). IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were 207 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for HeLa, 75 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for Caco-2, 59 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for MCF-7, 32 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for CCRF-CEM, and 165 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for CEM/ADR5000 cell lines. As compared to the positive control doxorubicin, the essential oil exhibits low cytotoxicity. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antitumor antibiotic is a hydrophilic drug, and shows broad spectrum anticancer activity [
  <a rid="B53-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-foods-06-00073">53</a>]. The cytotoxicity of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> oil is most likely due to the lipophilic properties of essential oil and alkylating properties of the major components 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-anisaldehyde. Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 overexpress the ABC transporter p-gp which can actively pump out any lipophilic compound that has entered the cell by free diffusion [
  <a rid="B54-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-foods-06-00073">54</a>]). Thus, both cell lines are rather insensitive towards lipophilic cytotoxic agents. In contrast, the parent cell line CCRF-CEM should be sensitive. We also suspect that some components of the essential oil are may be substrates for p-gp, as IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were higher in CEM/ADR5000 cells.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the mechanism of action of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> essential oil, we have investigated its hemolytic effect. The result of hemolytic activity indicates that the oil is able to lyse the cell membrane albeit with a rather high IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 1100 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t003" href="#foods-06-00073-t003">Table 3</a>). Moreover, in order to investigate the effect of essential oil on the cell morphology, the images of untreated and treated CCRF cells with essential oil were captured by fluorescence microscope. The images are illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00073-f002" href="#foods-06-00073-f002">Figure 2</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtained images indicate that the essential oil can change the morphology of cells. Results of both hemolysis and microscopic investigation indicate that essential oil also affects the integrity of cell membranes. This is in agreement with many of the reported data [
  <a rid="B55-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-foods-06-00073">55</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, the main component of the essential oil, was examined for its cytotoxicity in RC-37 cells. Its IC
  <sub>50</sub> value was 100 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span> [
  <a rid="B56-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-foods-06-00073">56</a>]. The incubation of hepatocytes with anethole caused a cell death accompanied by losses of cellular ATP and adenine nucleotide pools [
  <a rid="B57-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-foods-06-00073">57</a>]. Anethole shows apoptotic activity, as it can damage DNA [
  <a rid="B58-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-foods-06-00073">58</a>]. Thus anethole could be responsible for the overall cytotoxicity of the essential oil in our study.
