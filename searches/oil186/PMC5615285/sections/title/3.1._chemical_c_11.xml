 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">F. vulgare</span> was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (GLC-MS). Thirty components were identified representing 97.7% of total oil composition (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t001" href="#foods-06-00073-t001">Table 1</a>). Oxygenated terpenoids were the dominant compounds of the essential oil of

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major components were 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole (

  <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-anisaldehyde, α-ethyl-
  <span class="italic">p</span>-methoxybenzyl alcohol) are both ethers, having methoxy functional groups (
