<p>The concentration of 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was the parameter used to compare the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity. A lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> (for DPPH and ABTS) and higher FRAP values indicate higher antioxidant activity. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the antioxidant activity were 15.6 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (DPPH) and 10.9 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (ABTS). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the known antioxidant substance—caffeic acid—were 0.0017 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for DPPH and 0.0011 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for ABTS, respectively. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were equivalent to 193.5 µM Fe(II)/mg for oil and 2380 µM Fe(II)/mg for caffeic acid. In agreement with our results, it was reported that the an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> essential oil was 15.3 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], fennel essential oil reacts with free radicals as a primary antioxidant and, therefore, it may limit free-radical damage occurring in the human body. In our previous paper, we reported the antioxidant activity of pure essential oil components, including the main component of the essential oil of fennel (
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole). It shows weak antioxidant activity. We assume that the phenolic substances (carvacrol (2.1%) and thymol (1.0%)) are responsible for the observed antioxidant activity. These data are in agreement with previously reported data [
