<p>The cytotoxicity of the oil was tested against HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7, CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cancer cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00073-t003">Table 3</xref>). IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 207 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> for HeLa, 75 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> for Caco-2, 59 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> for MCF-7, 32 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> for CCRF-CEM, and 165 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> for CEM/ADR5000 cell lines. As compared to the positive control doxorubicin, the essential oil exhibits low cytotoxicity. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antitumor antibiotic is a hydrophilic drug, and shows broad spectrum anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> oil is most likely due to the lipophilic properties of essential oil and alkylating properties of the major components 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole and 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde. Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 overexpress the ABC transporter p-gp which can actively pump out any lipophilic compound that has entered the cell by free diffusion [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). Thus, both cell lines are rather insensitive towards lipophilic cytotoxic agents. In contrast, the parent cell line CCRF-CEM should be sensitive. We also suspect that some components of the essential oil are may be substrates for p-gp, as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were higher in CEM/ADR5000 cells.
