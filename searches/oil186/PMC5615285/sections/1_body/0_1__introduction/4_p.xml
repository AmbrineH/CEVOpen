<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> from different geographical locations has been extensively studied [

 <xref rid="B20-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to these studies, the major components of fennel oil are 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole, estragole, fenchone, and limonene depending on the chemotype [

 <xref rid="B23-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of fennel growing in Tajikistan (Central Asia) and to explore cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines. The biological activity and chemical composition of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> oil from Tajikistan have not been previously reported.
