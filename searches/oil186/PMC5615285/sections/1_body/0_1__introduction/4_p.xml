The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of fennel growing in Tajikistan (Central Asia) and to explore cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines. The biological activity and chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic> oil from Tajikistan have not been previously reported.
