<p>The essential oil of fennel is rich in secondary metabolites, which carry reactive substituents (among them carbonyl groups) in their ring structures or side chains. Aldehydes are generally long-lived and electrophilic compounds, they can react with molecular targets which carry free amino groups, such as of amino acid residues in proteins or of nucleotides in DNA to form Schiffâ€™s bases [
