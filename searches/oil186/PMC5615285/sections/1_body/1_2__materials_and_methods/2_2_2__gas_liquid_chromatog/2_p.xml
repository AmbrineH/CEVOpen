<p>Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (Kovats RI), and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-06-00073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and stored on the MS library (NIST 11 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), WILEY 10 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, USA), FFNSC version 1.2 (Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan)). The percentages of each component are reported as raw percentages based on total ion current without standardization (set 100%).
