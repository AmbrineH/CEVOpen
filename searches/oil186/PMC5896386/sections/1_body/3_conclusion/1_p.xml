<p> The present study demonstrates that the volatile oil of 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> is rich in monoterpenes with two major components dihydrotagetone and spathulenol. The oil tested shows significant quantitative and qualitative variations when compared with previous reports from Iran and abroad. The differences could be possibly due to genetic variation and environmental factors. This research also revealed that the aerial parts of this aromatic plant are various sources of oily components, especially the essential ones, as well as of good natural sources of unsaturated fatty acids (such as linoleic acid). On the other hand, it was found that the native 
 <italic>Tagetes</italic> oil is a non negligible source of phenolic compounds. Therefore, in addition to traditional uses this medicinal Plant can also be grown and utilized in Pharmaceutical and food industries.
