<p class="p"> We analyzed for the first time the polyphenols from 
 <italic class="italic">T.minuta</italic> in Iran. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the standard chromatogram values of 9 individual phenolic substances in the aerial parts of the plant, have been carried out by HPLC-UV. It is noteworthy that the separation of all examined compounds was carried out in 50 min. Nine phenolic compounds were analyzed and eight compounds were determined: 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, caffeic acid, syringic, vanillic acid, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid and rutin (flavonoid glycosides). By examining the HPLC profiles we observe that sinapic acid (5.86±0.1 mg/g) and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid (0.79±0.07 mg/g) are predominant in volatile oil and methanolic extract, respectively. Also gallic acid is not in the samples. However, the pattern of polyphenols indicated that the plant contains sinapic acid derivatives rather than hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Our results was supported by several studies in the literature reported that leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">T.minuta</italic> exhibits high levels of hydroxycinnamic acid and quercetin derivatives (32±2 and 10±1 mg/g dw, respectively).

 </sup> In fact, phenolic acids have gained considerable attention because of their potential protective role against oxidative damage diseases.
