 </sup>Especially, EO of 
 <italic>T.minuta</italic> (DPPH=66.23±0.92%, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=29.31±0.8 µg/ml) has more antioxidant potential than its methanolic extracts (DPPH=36.21±1.44%, IC
 <sub>50</sub>=48.67±0.8 µg/ml) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). This antioxidant activity is in line with those of previous studies with I
 <sub>C50</sub> between 35-344 μg/ml.

 </sup> Thus, the study suggests that these fractions (The methanol extract and the volatile oil) are good sources of antioxidant compounds. However, the extraction techniques and time of extraction can highly affect the results of DPPH assay.
