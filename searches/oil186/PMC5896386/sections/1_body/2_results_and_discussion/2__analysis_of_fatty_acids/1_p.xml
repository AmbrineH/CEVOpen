<p> In this study, the fatty acid composition of the 
 <italic>T.minuta</italic> were obtained by hexane extraction and analyzed using a GC–FID for the first time from Iran. The fatty acid profiles of the vegetable oil tested are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. A total of 12 fatty acids were detected and quantified. The amount of fatty acid contents of the extracted oil decreased in the order of: saturated fatty acids (SFA) &gt; polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) &gt; monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) ranging from 89.35%, 7.63% and 3.02%, respectively. Palmitic acid (16:0) was the most abundant fatty acid in all the samples. In addition to palmitic acid (30.74 ± 0.4%), other abundant fatty acids extracted from the vegetable oil were capric acid (24.15±0.5%), luric acid (16.58±0.7%), myristic acid (11.02±0.4%) and linoleic acid (5.75±0.5%) respectively. The remaining fatty acids were minor in concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Of course, in the evaluation linoleic acid (5.75%) and linolenic acid (1.86%) showed considerable amounts. However, comparing between the fatty acid profiles obtained from current study with fatty acids previous reported on this plant some differences were observed.

 </sup> For example, Ahmad et al. reported that the major constituents of the seed oil were linoleic (51.95%), palmitic (21.64%) and oleic (16.23%) acids.

 </sup> The differences seem to be associated with genetic factors as well as environmental conditions. However, these findings proved that the plant sources of beneficial fatty acids such as palmitic, louric and linoleic acids. Scientific research has shown that linolenic acid is related to a lower risk of heart patients.
