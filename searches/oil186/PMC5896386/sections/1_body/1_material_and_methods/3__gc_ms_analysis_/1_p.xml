<p> The analysis of volatile organic compounds isolated from 
 <italic>T.minuta</italic> was performed using a complete HP/Agilent 6890/5973 GC-MS system with a FID detector (Palo Alto, USA). The GC column specified for the methods was a capillary HP-5MS column (5% phenylmethylsiloxane, 30 m X 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm). The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and helium carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1 ml/min. The samples pass through the interface heated to 200 °C into the mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV, which is scanned from 30-300 amu. The electron multiplier voltage was increased to near 3000 V, and the injection volume was 1 µl. GC oven temperature ranged from 70º to 240 °C at l0 °C /min. Qualitative identification for separated constituents was achieved using MS data libraries (Wiley7n.1 and NIST 2008), by comparison of their retention time (RT) obtained on HP-5MS column and then verified by (RI, HP-5MS) with those published in the literature.
