<p> Quantification of flavonoids was based on a procedure described by Shin et al. consisting of a spectrophotometric test at 510 nm.

 </sup> Methanolic solution of extracts and EOs (20 Âµl) were mixed with 1 ml of distilled water and 0.075 ml of a 5% Sodium nitrite solution. After 5 min, 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride solution was added. It was left at room temperature for 6 min and 0.5 ml of sodium hydroxide (1 mol/l) was added. Then the absorbance of each mixture was measured immediately at 510 nm with a double beam UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The calibration curve was plotted by preparing quercetin solutions in methanol. (The calibration equation for quercetin: y = 0.0779 x - 0.0136, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9979).
