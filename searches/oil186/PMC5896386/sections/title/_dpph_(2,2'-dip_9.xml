 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The free-radical scavenging activity was measured by the decrease in absorbance of methanolic solution of DPPH.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">26</a>
  </span> Briefly, 10 µl of the samples were added to 2 ml of methanolic DPPH (0.0023 mol/l) solution, and allowed to react at room temperature. After 30 min the absorbance values were measured at 520 nm and converted into the percentage antioxidant activity using the following formula:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> % inhibition of DPPH radical = 100 – 100 (AS ÷ A0)</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> where A0 is absorbance of the blank and AS is absorbance of the sample at 520 nm. Also the IC
  <sub>50</sub> of the plant was obtained by plotting the percent DPPH remaining at the steady state (60 min) of the reaction against the corresponding antioxidant level. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> is the concentration of antioxidant to quench 50% DPPH under the experimental conditions.
