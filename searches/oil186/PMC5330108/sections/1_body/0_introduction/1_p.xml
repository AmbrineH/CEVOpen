 <italic class="italic">Fusarium acuminatum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium Sambucinum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium poae</italic> are predominant species widespread in the soil and on plants, throughout the cold and cool regions of the world. They invade cereal crops and are responsible for the production toxic metabolites such as type A trichothecenes: T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, T-2 tetraol, T-2 triol, scirpentriol (STO), and diacetoxyscirpenol which may contaminate animal and human food.[

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin found to be contaminants in wheat, maize, barley, oats, rice, beans, and soybeans as well as in some cereal-based products and have played a role in plant diseases. These toxins are an important agricultural problem due to their detrimental effects on both human and animal health.[

 <italic class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</italic> growth in agricultural products is essential to reduce food-borne illness. Several low-molecular organic acids antifungal chemical have been used to control the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</italic> during grain storage. These chemical fungicides show serious health issues in humans and animals due to their toxicity by the migration of chemical residue into food chain and they also produce resistance in fungi.[
