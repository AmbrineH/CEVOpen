<p class="p">Cell membrane encoding lipids is a major component of the cell. It performs many important functions including increasing the stability of the membrane, reducing the permeability of water-soluble materials, and adjusting the liquidity of the membrane.[
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] The decrease in membrane stability and increased in permeability of water-soluble materials suggest the decrease in lipid content.[
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] The previous studies regarding volatile compounds have been reported to disrupt the lipid structures of the cells.[
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] A significant decrease in lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> cells in fumigated and nonfumigated cells with 1 ÂµL/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic> essential oil (
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> essential oil (

 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] In the present study, the addition of MPE significantly decreased the lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</italic>. These results suggest that MPE is capable of acting on the cell membrane structure and disrupt the cell membrane integrity.
