 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In GC MS analysis, 22 metabolites were identified such as menthol, l menthone, pulegone, piperitone, caryophyllene, menthol acetate, etc. The antifungal activity against targeted pathogen, with MIC and MFC 500 μg/mL and 1000 μg/mL, respectively. The MPE altered the morphology of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichoides</span> hyphae with the loss of cytoplasm content and contorted the mycelia. The increasing concentration of MPE showed increase in membrane permeability of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichoides</span> as evidenced by the release of extracellular constituents and pH with the disruption of cell membrane indicating decrease in lipid content of 
  <span class="italic">F. sporotrichoides</span>.
