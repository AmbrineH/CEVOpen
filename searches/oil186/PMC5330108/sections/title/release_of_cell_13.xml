 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The release of cellular constituents into the supernatant was measured following Paul 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">42</a>] method. The 2 days old mycelia from PDB were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min, washed 3 times, and resuspended in 100 mL phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.0). The resulting suspension was treated with MPE with MIC and MFC for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Then, 2 mL of sample was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min, and 1 mL of supernatant was used to measure the cellular constituents in spectrophotometer at 260 nm.
