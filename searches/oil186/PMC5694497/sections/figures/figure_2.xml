  <p class="p">Heat map of the volatile compounds characterized from essential oil extracts via GC-MS FID of 17 
   <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species. Heat map was generated using Euclidean Distance and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean cluster algorithm. Compounds representing at least 2% of the GC-FID signal were included (for a listing of compounds, see
