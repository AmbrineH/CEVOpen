 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metabolomic profiles from organisms in the Plantae and other kingdoms have been used to distinguish samples from different species and ecotypes, as well as aid in their classification (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Dettmer et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Allwood et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Aliferis et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Jing et al., 2015</a>). In the case of plants, much attention has been given to one of the largest group of metabolites they produce, the terpenoids. In a study similar to ours which explored the chemodiversity of 
  <span class="italic">Selaginella</span> in the context of evolution, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Weng and Noel (2013)</a> suggest that monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases are derived from conserved diterpene synthases, based off of phylogenetic analyses of plant terpene synthases done by 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bohlmann et al. (1998)</a>. Thus, it appears that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are frequently used as chemical markers for distinguishing between genera. For example, in the 
  <span class="italic">Lantana</span> (Verbenaceae) genus, β-caryophyllene was the major compound suggested as a chemical marker (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Sena Filho et al., 2010</a>), while in 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span>, both cyclic (
  <span class="italic">R</span>-(+)-limonene and α-terpinene) and bicyclic monoterpenes (
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene and sabinene) were dominant in fruit essential oils and therefore proposed as markers for those species/varieties (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Jing et al., 2015</a>). Worldwide, the volatile metabolomics composition of 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species has been poorly investigated, likely due to their accessibility and phenotype, namely, their size and bad odor. From a total of 250 species, only about 35 are reported in the literature with in-depth chemical characterizations. Many of them are difficult to identify due to endemism, e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Vitex rufences</span> A. Juss, 
  <span class="italic">Vitex capitata</span> Vahl, 
  <span class="italic">Vitex gardneriana</span> Schauer, which are found only in areas in the northeast of Brazil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main goal of this study was to develop a metabolomics approach for evaluating the volatile composition of 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species, using four species we collected (
  <span class="italic">Vitex capitata</span> Vahl, 
  <span class="italic">Vitex megapotamica</span> (Spreng.) Moldenke, 
  <span class="italic">Vitex gardneriana</span> Schauer and 
  <span class="italic">Vitex rufescens</span> A. Juss) in addition to 13 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species published in the literature. First, the chemical composition of the volatile fraction of essential oils from leaves of these species was characterized via GC-MS/FID. Subsequently, cluster analyses of the chemical composition of the 17 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species were performed. Next, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) was used to evaluate the genetic variation between our four 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> species, followed by cluster analyses. Lastly, bioactivity of our four essential oil extracts was evaluated using toxicity assays against 
  <span class="italic">Aceria guerreronis</span> Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae), a major pest found in coconut plantations worldwide (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Návia et al., 2013</a>). From this study, we aimed to chemosystematically characterize the 
  <span class="italic">Vitex</span> genus, in addition to expand our understanding of it in an evolutionary context.
