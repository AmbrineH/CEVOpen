<p class="p">By combining the volatile profiles and ISSR molecular markers using bioinformatic tools, we were successful in clustering the 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species in order to identify markers for chemosystematic classification. In this work, 
 <italic class="italic">V. gardneriana</italic> was isolated from the other species, expanding our understanding of the chemodiversity of this genus. In addition, the volatile components extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">V. gardneriana</italic> showed potential for controlling 
 <italic class="italic">A. guerreronis</italic>, as it was highly toxic to this coconut pest.
