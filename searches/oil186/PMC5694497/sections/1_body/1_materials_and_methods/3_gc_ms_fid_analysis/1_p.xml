<p>Essential oil characterization was performed using methods described previously (

 <sup>®</sup>-5MS Restek fused silica capillary column (5%-diphenyl–95%-dimethyl polysiloxane) of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, at a constant helium (99.999% purity) flow rate of 1.2 mL⋅min
 <sup>-1</sup>. An injection volume of 0.5 μL was employed, with a split ratio of 1:10. The oven temperature program started at 60°C, was held for 3 min, then increased at a rate of 5°C/min to 300°C, and was finally held for 9 min. The MS and FID data were simultaneously acquired by employing a detector splitting system, with a split flow ratio of 5:1 (MS:FID). A 0.4 m × 0.15 mm i.d. restrictor tube (capillary column) was used to connect the splitter to the MS detector, while a 0.6 m × 0.22 mm i.d. restrictor tube was used to connect the splitter to the FID detector. The MS data were acquired in full scan mode (
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 40-550) at a scan rate of 0.3 scan/s using an electron ionization potential of 70 eV. The injector temperature was set to 280°C and the ion source temperature to 200°C. The FID temperature was 300°C, and the gas supplies for the FID were hydrogen, air, and helium at flow rates of 30, 300, and 30 mL⋅min
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Quantification of each constituent was estimated by FID peak-area normalization (%). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas relative to the total peak area of all peaks and were arranged in order of GC elution. The retention index was obtained by co-injecting the oil sample with a C7–C30 linear hydrocarbon mixture; identification was made based on comparison of retention indices and fragmentation patterns with published values (
