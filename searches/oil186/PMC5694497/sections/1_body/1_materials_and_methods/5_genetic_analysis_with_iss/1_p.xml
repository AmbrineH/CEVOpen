<p>The four 
 <italic>Vitex</italic> species we collected (
 <italic>Vitex capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana</italic> and 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic>) were analyzed by repeat sequence primers via Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR). The DNA was extracted from young, fresh leaves as previously described (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Doyle, 1991</xref>). Fourteen primers were used to screen for polymorphisms (
