<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil distilled from leaves of 
 <italic>V. capitata, V. gardneriana</italic> and 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic>. Of the chemical constituents detected, 88.7, 94.5, 80.5, and 90.2% were sesquiterpenes, and 2.3, 0.3, 17.1, and 8.6% were monoterpenes for 
 <italic>V. capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana</italic> and 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic>, respectively. Similar chemical compositions were found in the essential oil extracts from 
 <italic>V. capitata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. megapotamica</italic>, where α-copaene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, γ-elemene, α-humulene, gamma-muurolene, viridiflorene and γ-cadinene were the major components (

 </bold> and 
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>
 </bold>). Characterization of 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic> revealed that the most abundant compounds were 6,9–guaiadiene (19.3%), caryophyllene oxide (18.6%), 
 <sc>L</sc>-calamenene (13.9%) and α-cadinol (3.8%). In the case of 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic>, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (21%), ledol (15.7%) and germacrene D (9.3%) were the main constituents detected.
