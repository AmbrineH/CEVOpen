<p>Biological activity of some of the prominent compounds we saw in the 
 <italic>Vitex</italic> species studied here has been defined previously: 6,9-guaiadiene, prominent in 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic>, was also found in essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Bracteosa ruilopezia</italic> (Standl.) Cuatrec and 
 <italic>Baccharis salicifolia</italic> (Ruiz &amp; Pav.) Pers. (Asteraceae)-both oils demonstrated antibacterial activity (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Carrizo et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been suggested that caryophyllene oxide is toxic; this was evaluated using a direct spray test for females and eggs of the predatory mite 
 <italic>Neoseiulus californicus</italic> (McGregor) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Momen et al., 2014</xref>). Further, α-cadinol and caryophyllene oxide were the main volatile compounds found in essential oil extracted from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Teucrium polium</italic> L. – Lamiaceae. The essential oil showed fumigant and repellency effects against the cowpea weevil 
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> F. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Khani and Heydarian, 2014</xref>). α-Cadinol also showed excellent inhibitory action against the termite 
 <italic>Coptotermes formosanus</italic> Shiraki (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) (
