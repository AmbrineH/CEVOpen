<p>Chemotaxonomy, or chemical variation in a group of compounds, is one of the tools used to define intra- and inter-specific variability in plants (

 <italic>Vitex</italic> species we studied, plus 13 others from the literature, to develop a system for classification of plant specimens derived from this genus. The content of sesquiterpenes with seven and nine members in their ring system in the four 
 <italic>Vitex</italic> species described in this study was remarkable. Recently, genes responsible for sesquiterpene cyclization were evaluated in fungi, which involved scaffolds generated by terpene synthases and cyclases (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Quin et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicates that sesquiterpene synthase is likely highly expressed in this genus and hypothesize that this enzyme plays an important role in its chemosystematics. Enzyme mechanisms of sesquiterpene biosynthesis are well known: 5-
 <italic>epi</italic>-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) found in 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. (tobacco) was the first cloned and sequenced sesquiterpene synthase from 
 <italic>Angiospermae</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maillea et al., 2006</xref>), and could serve as a useful model for understanding how these compounds are built in the plant.
