 <italic class="italic">V. gardneriana</italic> was isolated from the other three species. This may be related to genotypic differences for this species, as it is found in a different biome (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sena Filho et al., 2008</xref>) which may influence the expression of genes used for synthesis of chemical compounds. The use of two data tools (chemical and genetic diversity) more thoroughly supports systematic characterization of the species studied (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rahalia et al., 2016</xref>), and validates our chemical marker proposal for the 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> genus, namely, using the sesquiterpene skeleton with seven member rings as a biomarker candidate.
