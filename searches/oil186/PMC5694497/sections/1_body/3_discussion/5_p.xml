<p>In the toxicity bioassays, the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic> was highly toxic to 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic>, indicating its potential for use in controlling this major coconut pest. On the other hand, it was not possible to estimate the LC
 <sub>50</sub> from 
 <italic>V. capitata, V. megapotamica</italic> and 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic> essential oils. This differential toxicity may be explained by the diversity and amount of sesquiterpenes found only in 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic>, such as 6,9-guaiadine (19%), 
 <sc>L</sc>-calamenene (13.9%), and caryophyllene oxide (18.6%). However, these compounds should be further evaluated concerning the toxicity to 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic> using more modern toxicology bioassays. Further, predatory mites, especially those belonging to the family Phytoseiidae, are natural enemies of 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic> worldwide (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">NÃ¡via et al., 2013</xref>). These beneficial mites are naturally found foraging on coconut plants and help to control 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic>. Therefore, future research should also assess the acaricidal activity of 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic> essential oil to predatory mites aiming at determining its selectivity toward non-target organisms, including pollinators and seed dispersers.
