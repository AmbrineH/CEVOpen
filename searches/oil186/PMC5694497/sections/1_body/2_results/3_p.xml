<p>In the biotoxicity assays, the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic> was highly toxic to 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.8577 mg/mL; CI 0.67-1.15; 
 <italic>x
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 3.17, df = 2, P = 0.20). In contrast, it was not possible to estimate the LC
 <sub>50</sub> from 
 <italic>V. capitata, V. megapotamica</italic> and 
 <italic>V. rufescens</italic> essential oils, as increasing concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.3 mg/mL) of these oils did not kill adults of 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic> over a period of 24 h. As a way of toxicity comparison, the acaricide abamectin, sprayed at its label rate, inflicted 100% mortality to 
 <italic>A. guerreronis</italic>.
