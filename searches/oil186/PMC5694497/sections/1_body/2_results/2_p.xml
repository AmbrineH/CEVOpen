<p>The 14 ISSR primers generated a total of 90 fragments, 100% of which were polymorphic. The primer with the highest number of fragments was 857 (eleven), while the lowest were 845 and 888 (two). The values of PIC and MI are parameters that allow for estimation of the power of discrimination of the molecular marker by a primer; in our results, the primers 842 and 818 were the most informative (

 <italic>V. capitata</italic> for primer 823. Genotypes were clustered by UPGMA using the Jaccard coefficient (JC), estimated from the binary data (

 </bold>). The similarity mean was 0.21 JC (0.08 â€“ 0.45 JC). We observed a clear separation of two groups, with 
 <italic>V. gardneriana</italic> being the most isolated of the four species. In our study, ISSR fingerprints clearly distinguished all of the tested species, with cluster results similar to those performed for the chemical compounds (
