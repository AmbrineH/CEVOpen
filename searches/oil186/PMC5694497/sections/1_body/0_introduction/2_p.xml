<p class="p">The main goal of this study was to develop a metabolomics approach for evaluating the volatile composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species, using four species we collected (
 <italic class="italic">Vitex capitata</italic> Vahl, 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex megapotamica</italic> (Spreng.) Moldenke, 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex gardneriana</italic> Schauer and 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex rufescens</italic> A. Juss) in addition to 13 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species published in the literature. First, the chemical composition of the volatile fraction of essential oils from leaves of these species was characterized via GC-MS/FID. Subsequently, cluster analyses of the chemical composition of the 17 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species were performed. Next, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) was used to evaluate the genetic variation between our four 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species, followed by cluster analyses. Lastly, bioactivity of our four essential oil extracts was evaluated using toxicity assays against 
 <italic class="italic">Aceria guerreronis</italic> Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae), a major pest found in coconut plantations worldwide (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">NÃ¡via et al., 2013</xref>). From this study, we aimed to chemosystematically characterize the 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> genus, in addition to expand our understanding of it in an evolutionary context.
