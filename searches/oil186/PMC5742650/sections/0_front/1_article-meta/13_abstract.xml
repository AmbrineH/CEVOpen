  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>Hydro-distillation (HD) method is a traditional technique which is used in most industrial companies. Microwave-assisted Hydro-distillation (MAHD) is an advanced HD technique utilizing a microwave oven in the extraction process.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Methods:</title>
  <p>In this research, MAHD of essential oils from the aerial parts (leaves) of rosemary (
   <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis L.</italic>) was studied and the results were compared with those of the conventional HD in terms of extraction time, extraction efficiency, chemical composition, quality of the essential oils and cost of the operation.

 <sec>
  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>Microwave hydro-distillation was superior in terms of saving energy and extraction time (30 
   <italic>min</italic>, compared to 90 
   <italic>min</italic> in HD). Chromatography was used for quantity analysis of the essential oils composition. Quality of essential oil improved in MAHD method due to an increase of 17% in oxygenated compounds.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>Consequently, microwave hydro-distillation can be used as a substitute of traditional hydro-distillation.</p>
