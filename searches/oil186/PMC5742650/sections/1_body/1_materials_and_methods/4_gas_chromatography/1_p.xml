<p>The essential oils obtained at different conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography. The capillary column used for the analysis was HP-5MS (30 
 <italic>m</italic>×0.25 
 <italic>mm</italic>×0.25 
 <italic>μm</italic>) with a 5% phenyl methyl siloxane stationary phase. The GC analysis was performed with the following conditions: flow rate, 0.4 
 <italic>ml/min</italic>; FID temperature, 275°
 <italic>C</italic>; make-up gas type, He with a make-up flow rate of 45 
 <italic>ml/min</italic>. Identification of the components of the essential oils were done by comparing data with those of literature

 </sup> which is based on comparison of retention times of compounds with those of available standards and with library matching of their spectra. Most of the components except those in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref> were identified based on the information reported by Adams

  <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup> . The identification of individual components is not always possible using MS data alone; the use of chromatographic information, such as retention index, facilitates more reliable peak assignment of components in complex mixtures
