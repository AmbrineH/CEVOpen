 <italic class="italic">MHz</italic> multimode microwave with a maximum delivered power of 900 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic>. In a typical MAHD procedure performed at atmospheric pressure, 100 
 <italic class="italic">gr</italic> of rosemary were heated for 30 
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> with addition of 300 
 <italic class="italic">ml</italic> water. This period was sufficient to extract all the essential oils from the sample. Each extraction was performed at least three times.
