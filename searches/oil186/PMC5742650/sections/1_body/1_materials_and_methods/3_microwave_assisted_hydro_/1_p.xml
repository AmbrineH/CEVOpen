<p>Microwave hydro-distillation has been performed using the Tecnokit Chen (Italy, Tek-2611) microwave oven (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). It is a 2450 
 <italic>MHz</italic> multimode microwave with a maximum delivered power of 900 
 <italic>W</italic>. In a typical MAHD procedure performed at atmospheric pressure, 100 
 <italic>gr</italic> of rosemary were heated for 30 
 <italic>min</italic> with addition of 300 
 <italic>ml</italic> water. This period was sufficient to extract all the essential oils from the sample. Each extraction was performed at least three times.
