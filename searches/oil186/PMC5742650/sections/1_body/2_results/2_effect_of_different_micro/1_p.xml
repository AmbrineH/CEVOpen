<p class="p">An appropriate microwave irradiation power is important to ensure that essential oil is extracted quickly. However, the power should not be too high otherwise loss of volatile compounds would result

 </sup> . Different microwave irradiation power, 180, 360 and 540 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> (20, 40 and 60% of maximum oven power respectively), were examined for MAHD essential oils extraction. Then, the total extraction time in relation with the microwave irradiation power was studied. Higher and lower power of microwave due to high intensity of heating to the mixture and possibility of degradation of thermolabile components and low speed of essential oil extraction was left out, respectively. So the microwave power of 360 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> for 100 
 <italic class="italic">gr</italic> of plant material was chosen as the best power density. The total amount of extracted essential oil in this case was about 1.5
