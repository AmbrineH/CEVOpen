<p>The energy requirements to perform the extraction, based on maximum power consumption of electro mantle for HD and microwave oven for MAHD considering the total period of a full recovery, were 1500 
 <italic>W</italic> for HD and 180 
 <italic>W</italic> for MAHD. This indicates a substantial saving in the extraction cost when using MAHD instead of HD.
