<p class="p">A similar extraction yield was achieved at significantly shorter extraction time when using MAHD instead of HD. In addition, MAHD method offers important advantages over traditional alternatives, namely shorter extraction times, substantial savings of energy and a reduced environmental hazard (less CO

The GC results showed that the amount of oxygenated compounds and monoterpene hydrocarbons increased and decreased, respectively by MAHD method. Also, increasing 50% microwave input power increased and decreased the concentration of oxygenated compounds and monoterpene hydrocarbons. This result leads to the fact that the quality of essential oil was increased by MAHD. So, MAHD can be considered as a green technology. MAHD is a good alternative for the extraction of essential oils from rosemary since it provides essential oils of similar quality compared to conventional HD while reducing the time and cost of the process drastically.
