<p class="p">Traditional methods used for extraction of essential oil were Hydro-distillation (HD) or steam distillation. However, the loss of some components and the degradation of some unsaturated compounds by thermal effects

However, the high cost of producing specific products has limited its use. In certain cases, the extractive power of supercritical CO
