 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microwave hydro-distillation has been performed using the Tecnokit Chen (Italy, Tek-2611) microwave oven (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). It is a 2450 
  <span class="italic">MHz</span> multimode microwave with a maximum delivered power of 900 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. In a typical MAHD procedure performed at atmospheric pressure, 100 
  <span class="italic">gr</span> of rosemary were heated for 30 
  <span class="italic">min</span> with addition of 300 
  <span class="italic">ml</span> water. This period was sufficient to extract all the essential oils from the sample. Each extraction was performed at least three times.
