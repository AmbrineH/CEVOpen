 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All essential oils extracted from the aerial parts of rosemary by both extraction methods produced a clear, yellow liquid essential oil. Efficiency was expressed in terms of the volume of the oil collected in 
  <span class="italic">ml/gm</span> of dry plant material. Efficiency of essential oil extraction versus time of extraction for both methods is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">figure 2</a>. Extraction with MAHD started at much earlier time than that with HD (10 
  <span class="italic">min vs</span>. 30 
  <span class="italic">min</span>, respectively). This is due to the more efficient heat flow involved in microwaves. Microwave can heat the entire sample almost simultaneously and at a higher rate 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>
  </span> . Extraction of essential oils was achieved within 30 
  <span class="italic">min</span> of operation with MAHD. In comparison, HD requires a time period of at least 90 
  <span class="italic">min</span> to be completed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both HD and MAHD, the extraction starts at the boiling point of water (100Â°
  <span class="italic">C</span>, at atmospheric pressure). The essential oil extracted by MAHD and HD was about 1.5 
  <span class="italic">cc</span> and 1.3 
  <span class="italic">cc</span>, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results confirm results from the literature, which indicate that the use of microwaves allows extractions to be accelerated
