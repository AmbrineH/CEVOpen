 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main components of the rosemary essential oil were obtained a-Pinene, Camphene, 1,8-Cineole, Linalool, Camphor and Borneol. It was also found that the essential oil mainly composed of oxygenated compounds 51.35–59.74% while monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpenes constituted 38.86–47.43% and 0.36–0.6% of it, respectively. The main component of oxygenated compounds and monoterpene hydrocarbons detected were Borneol (10.39–15.38 
  <span class="italic">mg/ml</span>) and a-Pinene (17.95–24.24 
  <span class="italic">mg/ml</span>) in the case of MAHD.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in the tables, the concentration of oxygenated and sesquiterpenes compounds increased in MAHD method. Beside the concentration of monoterpene hydrocarbons decreased in comparison to HD. Ferhat

   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>
  </span> showed that the content of oxygenated compounds in the oil obtained by Microwave Distillation (MD) was higher than in the oil obtained by HD. But Wang 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>
  </span> reported that the content of oxygenated compounds of the oil obtained by MD was lower than that by HD for 
  <span class="italic">Cuminum cyminum L</span>., and 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim</span>. Therefore, the possible reason for this contradictory fact is that the content of oxygenated compounds of the oil was dependent on the species instead of the extraction method. During the procedure of MD, microwave irradiation highly accelerated the extraction process without causing considerable changes in the essential oil composition, although the percentages of some components depended on the technique applied.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concentration of oxygenated compounds and monoterpene hydrocarbons increased by 17% and decreased by 17.7% with the increasing of 50% of microwave power comparing to HD method. Besides, the concentrations of these compounds decreased by 5.8% and increased by 8.3% in the presence of salt in MAHD method, respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of aroma, flavor and therapeutic properties, oxygenated compounds can be used as measurements of essential oil quality. Monoterpene hydrocarbons are less valuable than oxygenated compounds in terms of their contribution to the fragrance of the essential oil 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>
  </span>. So, the higher amount of oxygenated compounds in MAHD indicates the higher quality of essential oil.
