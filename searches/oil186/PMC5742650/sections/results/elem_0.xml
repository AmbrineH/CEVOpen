  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All essential oils extracted from the aerial parts of rosemary by both extraction methods produced a clear, yellow liquid essential oil. Efficiency was expressed in terms of the volume of the oil collected in 
   <span class="italic">ml/gm</span> of dry plant material. Efficiency of essential oil extraction versus time of extraction for both methods is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">figure 2</a>. Extraction with MAHD started at much earlier time than that with HD (10 
   <span class="italic">min vs</span>. 30 
   <span class="italic">min</span>, respectively). This is due to the more efficient heat flow involved in microwaves. Microwave can heat the entire sample almost simultaneously and at a higher rate 
   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>
   </span> . Extraction of essential oils was achieved within 30 
   <span class="italic">min</span> of operation with MAHD. In comparison, HD requires a time period of at least 90 
   <span class="italic">min</span> to be completed.

   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>
   </span> . Different microwave irradiation power, 180, 360 and 540 
   <span class="italic">W</span> (20, 40 and 60% of maximum oven power respectively), were examined for MAHD essential oils extraction. Then, the total extraction time in relation with the microwave irradiation power was studied. Higher and lower power of microwave due to high intensity of heating to the mixture and possibility of degradation of thermolabile components and low speed of essential oil extraction was left out, respectively. So the microwave power of 360 
   <span class="italic">W</span> for 100 
   <span class="italic">gr</span> of plant material was chosen as the best power density. The total amount of extracted essential oil in this case was about 1.5

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next experiment, 30 
   <span class="italic">g</span> salt (NaCl) was solved into 300 
   <span class="italic">ml</span> water and added to rosemary. NaCl salt increases the boiling point of water. So salt was added to the mixture to check that it will extract higher amounts of essential oil or not. Addition of salt led to a faster extraction operation but the extraction efficiency didn’t improve as expected. Salt accelerates transfer phenomenon but may cause thermal and hydrolysis reactions and can degrade thermolabile components of essential oil. So this option was left out.

   <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim</span>. Therefore, the possible reason for this contradictory fact is that the content of oxygenated compounds of the oil was dependent on the species instead of the extraction method. During the procedure of MD, microwave irradiation highly accelerated the extraction process without causing considerable changes in the essential oil composition, although the percentages of some components depended on the technique applied.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concentration of oxygenated compounds and monoterpene hydrocarbons increased by 17% and decreased by 17.7% with the increasing of 50% of microwave power comparing to HD method. Besides, the concentrations of these compounds decreased by 5.8% and increased by 8.3% in the presence of salt in MAHD method, respectively.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of aroma, flavor and therapeutic properties, oxygenated compounds can be used as measurements of essential oil quality. Monoterpene hydrocarbons are less valuable than oxygenated compounds in terms of their contribution to the fragrance of the essential oil 
   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cost, cleanliness and safety considerations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduced cost of extraction is clearly advantageous for microwave method in terms of time and energy. The time needed for the complete extraction of rosemary essential oil was found as 30 
   <span class="italic">min</span> for MAHD and 90 
   <span class="italic">min</span> for HD. The extraction time was reduced by about 67% by using microwave. The reason for the reduction in the processing time is the heat generated by microwave heating which results in high pressure gradient inside the product. Microwaves interact selectively with the free water molecules present in the gland and vascular systems which leads to localized heating 
   <span class="sup">
    <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>
   </span> . As a result of internal superheating, a dramatic expansion and consequently rupture of cell walls occurs allowing the extraction of essential oil.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The energy requirements to perform the extraction, based on maximum power consumption of electro mantle for HD and microwave oven for MAHD considering the total period of a full recovery, were 1500 
   <span class="italic">W</span> for HD and 180 
   <span class="italic">W</span> for MAHD. This indicates a substantial saving in the extraction cost when using MAHD instead of HD.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calculated quantity of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is higher in the case of HD (1200 
   <span class="italic">g</span> CO 
   <sub> 2 </sub>) than for MAHD (144 
   <span class="italic">g</span> CO 
   <sub> 2 </sub>). These calculations were made according to the literature: to obtain 1
