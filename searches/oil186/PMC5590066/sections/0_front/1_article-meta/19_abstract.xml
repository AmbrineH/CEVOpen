  <bold>Background:</bold> This study aimed to examine the composition of essential oil (EO) of 
  <italic>A. millefolium</italic> aerial parts wild plant grown in France and evaluate its antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. 
  <bold>Methods:</bold> GC-MS was used to identify the chemical composition of EO. Antioxidant activity (AA) of EO was evaluated by Oxipres method. Antimicrobial activity of EO was evaluated by Agar-well diffusion and a broth microdilution assay. 
  <bold>Results:</bold> Forty-three volatile compounds were identified. Major compounds were camphor (12.8%), germacrene-D (12%), (E)-nerolidol (7.3%), sabinene (6.7%), (E)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol (4.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4%). EO shows strong AA against Sunflower oil oxidation. Additionally, an inhibitory effect against microbial organisms (bacteria and fungi) was found. 
  <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The EO composition of 
  <italic>A. millefolium</italic> chemotype located in France was studied. The EO of the 
  <italic>A. millefolium</italic> wild plant grown in France is quite an effective antioxidant in sunflower oil oxidation; it also possesses inhibitory effects against famous bacteria and fungi.
