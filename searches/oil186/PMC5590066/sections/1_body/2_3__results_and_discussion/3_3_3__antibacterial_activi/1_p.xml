<p>Antibacterial effect of EO was evaluated in vitro against nine pathogenic bacteria species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t003">Table 3</xref>). Gram-positive bacteria were more delicate to the EO than Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was the most susceptible bacteria to 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil at the applied concentrations (5 and 10 µg/mL). The smallest inhibition zones were obtained in 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. agona</italic> cultures while 
 <italic>St. epidermidis, S. enteritidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were resistant against all concentrations of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil. MIC for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>St. aureus</italic> were 100 and 120 µg/mL, respectively; while the MIC for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was 310 µg/mL. Among the Gram-negative tested bacteria, a remarkable antibacterial effect was observed only for 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. agona</italic> with their respective MIC values 2000 and 1000 µg/mL. The effect of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil from Turkey [
 <xref rid="B3-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was also tested against 
 <italic>St. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>; it was found that the MIC was 72 mg/mL, which is remarkably higher than the MIC of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil measured in our study. As was shown, the composition of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oils from various locations may be rather different. The properties and the content of individual constituents may have an important power on the antibacterial effect of oil against different bacteria species. For instance, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, which were abundant in 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil studied in this work, are well-known natural chemicals with antibacterial potentials [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The EO also studied in our work also contained 12% of germacrene-D and 7.3% of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol, which were absent in the Turkish oil. The antibacterial activities of germacrene-D and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol were previously reported as well [
