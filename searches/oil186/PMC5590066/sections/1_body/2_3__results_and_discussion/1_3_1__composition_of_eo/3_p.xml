<p>It may be observed that the main components of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> analyzed in our study to some extent were comparable to those previously reported [

 <xref rid="B12-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the content of such components as hexane-2,3-dione, hex-3-en-1-ol, methyl hexanoate, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-
 <italic>p</italic>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, (

 <italic>p</italic>-menthan-2-one, thymol acetate, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-methyl isoeugenol, β-cedrene epoxide, and patchouli alcohol in the oil of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> analyzed in our study was considerably higher than in the previously studied yarrow oils. Camphor (up to 20%), α and β-thujones (up to 26.8%), 1,8-cineole (up to 20.3%), artemisia ketone (up to 10.1%), and chamazulene (up to 0.8%) were reported in 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil from France [
 <xref rid="B12-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but the content of these compounds in our study was rather different; it contained 12.8% camphor, 4.5% (
 <italic>E</italic>)-
 <italic>p</italic>-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, 4.7% terpinen-4-ol, 4.0% 1,8-cineole, and 1.8% borneol, whereas artemisia ketone, thujones, and chamazulene were not detected.
