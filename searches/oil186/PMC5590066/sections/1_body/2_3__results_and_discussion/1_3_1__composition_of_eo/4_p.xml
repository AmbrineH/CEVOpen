<p>A completely different 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> chemotype was reported in the Saguenay region around Quebec in Canada where the β-thujone was the main compound (13.8%) [
 <xref rid="B6-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The sesquiterpene alcohols spathulenol, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-nerolidol, α-bisabolol, and (
 <italic>E,E</italic>)-farnesol were dominant constituents in the 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil from Iran [
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These results confirm that the chemical polymorphism is a characteristic feature of yarrow. The variations in the chemical profile of the 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> oil as a consequence of ontogenesis and organic differentiation were recently noted [
 <xref rid="B19-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The influence of ecological factors (climate, altitude, association, nutrients, etc.) seems to be an important factor; in addition to the like chemotype, variations in EO chemical composition could exist.
