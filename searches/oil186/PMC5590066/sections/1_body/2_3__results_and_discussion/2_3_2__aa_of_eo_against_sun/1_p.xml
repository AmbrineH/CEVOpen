<p class="p">Plant oils containing sensitive to oxidative degradation unsaturated fatty acids have been widely used as substrates for testing AA. The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> EO to protect the sunflower oil was evaluated by comparing with synthetic antioxidant BHT in Oxipres apparatus. The effect of additives was expressed as a protection factor (PF) indicating the increase in sunflower oil stability (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The addition of 0.2% of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> EO increased the stability of sunflower oil about 1.5 t (the IP of sunflower oil without additives was 2.9 h). 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil prolonged the IP of sunflower oil oxidation depending on the concentration; the highest concentration of additive (0.2%) was more effective than BHT applied at 0.02% (

 <italic class="italic">Calamintha grandiflora</italic> applied at 0.2% demonstrated PF of 1.63 [

 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> EO stabilized the oxidation of sunflower oil. This stability of oil rose with the added amounts of EO.
