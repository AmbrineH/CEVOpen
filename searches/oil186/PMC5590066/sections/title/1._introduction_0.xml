 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global interest in food preservation has been recently greatly increased due to high economic costs of deterioration and poisoning of food products through lipid oxidation as well as food pathogens. Currently, there is a growing interest in prolonging shelf-life and the safety of food using natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds. This aspect assumes particular relevance due to an increased resistance of some bacterial and fungi strains to the most common antibiotics and antimicrobial synthetic agents [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00030">1</a>]. Essential oils or some of their components have been largely used in perfumes, in sanitary products, in dentistry, in agriculture, as food preservers and additives, and as naturals remedies [

  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO are rather scarce. Considering remarkable chemical polymorphism, which is characteristic of many essential oil-bearing plants, it is of interest to determine the chemical composition and biological activities of plant varieties growing in different regions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant, the antibacterial, and the antifungal activities of EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> aerial parts of French origin. Additionally, this study aims to inspect the chemical profile of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> EO grown in France and to compare this profile to previous studies where the EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> was obtained from other countries.
