 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span>, growing wild in the Midi-Pyrenees region, possesses quite a unique chemical composition as compared with the oil composition of the same species reported in previously published studies. Î±-Pinene, sabinene, camphor, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-chrysanthenyl acetate, cyclocitral isomers, and germacrene D were the main components indicating an individual chemotype of the studied plant sample. The EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> was quite an effective antioxidant preserving oxidation of sunflower oil; it also possessed inhibitory effects against tested bacteria and fungi. The EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> growing wild in the Toulouse region show a varied interval of activities against plant fungi. In our study, it has become clear that the EO of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> possesses an important ability to intensely inhibit the development of 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> with other plant fungi tested in this work. These results provide preliminary support for the potential uses of 
  <span class="italic">A. millefolium</span> essential oil for the prolongation of shelf-life and the safety of food preparations possessing specific odor properties, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.
