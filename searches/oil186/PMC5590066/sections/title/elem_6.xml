  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antibacterial assay was carried using agar well diffusion. The bacteria were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C on the slant agar (Oxoid, CM325). Adjustment of washed cell bacteria was carried out according to McFarland No. 0.5 standard [
   <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00030">17</a>]. Into 90 mm diameter Petri plates, 10 mL of each bacteria culture were pipetted. To fill the wells (6 mm in diameter), agar was pressed with 10 µL of ethanolic solutions contained 5 µg/mL of EO. Ethanol was used to dissolve the oil for negative controls preparation. Susceptibility test disc Ceftazidime/Clavulanic Acid, CAZ-CLA, 30/10 µg (BBL, CAZ/CLA, 231753) was used as a positive control. Incubation time of plates was 24 h at 37 °C. Antibacterial effect was assessed by the diameter of clear zones developed around wells. Results are the mean (±SEM) from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates.

All tests were made in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB; BBL) (Microbiology Systems, Inc., Cockeysville, MD, USA) supplemented with Tween 80 detergent (Fisher, Illkirch, France) to achieve a final concentration of 0.5% (

   <span class="italic">v</span>). The culture of bacteria was made overnight at 37 °C in Mueller Hinton Agar, MHA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). To obtain a final density of 5 × 10
   <span class="sup">5</span> cfu/mL, tests were hanging in MHB. To obtain a final concentration values reaching from 0-1000 µg/mL of EO in MHB, dilutions were prepared in a 96-well microplates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Growth control was (MHB + Tween 80) and sterility control was (MHB + Tween 80 + sample). The microplates were smoldered at 37 °C during 24 h. A microplate reader (Multiskan Ascent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was used to the bacterial growth determination. The reading absorbance was 620 nm. The MICs represent the concentrations of EO causing at least 50% growth inhibition of the bacterial strains. Results are the mean (±SEM) from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
