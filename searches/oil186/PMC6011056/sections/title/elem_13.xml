  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oils showed their chemical constituents and the percentage composition of the essential oils. According to the data presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, the EOCz contained 31 compounds, among which (E)-cinnamaldehyde, cinnamoyl (E)-acetate, and eugenol were found in the highest percentages (68.7, 71.2, and 6.33%, respectively). In the EOCc, 18 substances were detected, with the major component being (E)-cinnamaldehyde, corresponding to 90.22% of the total components. The chromatograms are in Figures

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study carried out in Iran using
   <span class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</span> stalks extracted by hydrodistillation revealed the presence of 17 compounds in the extracted essential oil. The major groups of compounds were monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. Cinnamaldehyde (80.42%), 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-copaene (2.73%) and trans-calamenene (2.16%) were the primary chemical constituents of the oil. Other components analysed in the oil were present at amounts below 2% [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study to evaluate the chemical composition of the essential oil of
   <span class="italic"> C. cassia</span> bark obtained from the lower part of the stems at eight growth stages, most of the identified compounds observed belonged to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon and oxygenated sesquiterpene fractions at all stages.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The factors that determine the yield and composition of the essential oils are numerous. In some cases, it is difficult to isolate these factors from each other as they are interrelated and influence each other. These parameters include seasonal variations, the organ of the plant used, and the maturity of the plant, as well as its geographic origin and genetics [

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde inhibited the growth of all bacteria assayed in this study in planktonic form, the antimicrobial activity data for which are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOCz, EOCc, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde exhibited bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> S. epidermidis</span>. The MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the EOCz showing a bacteriostatic effect at 0.50 mg/ml, while EOCc and (E)-cinnamaldehyde had the same effect at 0.25 mg/ml. At the concentrations assayed in this study, no MIC or MBC for oxacillin could be determined, since growth was not detected at any concentration tested. The similarity between the data can be explained by the amount of (E)-cinnamaldehyde present in the EOCc (90.22%) (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The MIC value for the oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde against
   <span class="italic"> S. pyogenes</span> and
   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> was 0.50 mg/ml, and no bactericidal effect of these natural products was observed for these bacteria. In contrast, for
   <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>, only EOCc did not exhibit a bactericidal effect, and the MIC varied from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the MBC was 2.00 mg/ml for both for EOCZ and (E)-cinnamaldehyde.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by [
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">39</a>], it was shown that the essential oil of

   <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli,</span> and
   <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect in which the MICs of (E)-cinnamaldehyde and

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study by [

   <span class="italic">μ</span>l/m and MBC value of 0.5 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l/ml for both bacteria, similar to the data obtained in this study. In addition, scanning electron microscopy showed morphological changes, which were confirmed by the increase of nucleic acid and protein levels in the cell suspension, indicating that the cell membrane was damaged. Thus, according to the authors, cinnamaldehyde plays a role in disrupting the bacterial cell membrane.

In this case, it may be suggested that other components of the essential oils also participate synergistically in the antibiofilm action. A similar behavior is observed on biofilms of
