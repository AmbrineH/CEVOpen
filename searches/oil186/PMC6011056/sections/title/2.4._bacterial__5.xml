 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bacteria used in this study were included
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> ATCC6538,
  <span class="italic"> S. epidermidis</span> ATCC12228,
  <span class="italic"> S. pyogenes</span> ATCC19615,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </span>ATCC15442, and
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> ATCC11303. The strains were maintained in BHI (Brain Heart Infusion-Difco®) + glycerol (20%) at -80°C. To perform the experiments, a 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l aliquot was inoculated onto TSA medium (
  <span class="italic">Trypticase Soy Agar</span>-Difco®) and grown in a greenhouse at 37°C for 24 h. After this initial growth, a 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l inoculum was subcultured into 10 ml of TSB (
  <span class="italic">Trypticase Soy Broth</span>- Difco®) and grown for 18 h under the same conditions described above. In the antimicrobial activity assays, the cultures were washed with Mili-Rios water and their concentrations were adjusted to 10
  <span class="sup">7</span>-10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/ml using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader®) at 620 nm.
