<p class="p">The substances used in the tests were included the essential oils from the trunk bark of
 <italic class="italic"> C. cassia</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, cinnamaldehyde, and oxacillin as a positive control. Calculations for the preparation of the solutions containing the oils and cinnamaldehyde were performed on the basis of the density of the substances and, to facilitate solubilization, 2% Tween 20 was used. All solutions were prepared at an initial concentration of 4 mg/ml and, after being diluted in broth, the resulting concentrations ranged from 2 to 0.01 mg/ml for all substances.
