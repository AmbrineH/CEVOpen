<p>After the incubation period, the culture medium was removed and the plates were subjected to three washes with distilled water. Next, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of a 0.9% saline solution was aliquoted into the wells, and the plate was incubated in a sonic bath (LK-D32 Ultrasonic Bath) operating at 50 kHz for 10 min. The liquid from the wells for each concentration teste was pooled to bring the volume to 1 ml, after which a 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l aliquot was withdrawn and subjected to serial dilution in 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>l volumes of 0.85% saline solution (10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup>). In a Petri dish containing TSA, three 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l aliquots were cultured for each concentration. These plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, after which the resulting colonies were counted [
