<p>The plates were assembled in a process similar to the MIC test, and after 24 h the antibiofilm activity was assessed through the methods mentioned and described below. After 24 h incubation, the plates were washed with sterile water (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/well) to remove the loosely adhered and air-dried cells. The adhered cells of the biofilm were fixed in the plate wells by addition of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of methanol for 15 min. Afterwards, the methanol was removed and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of a 1% violet crystal solution was added for 15 min. Subsequently, the plates were washed and air dried again, after which 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of ethanol (96%) was added to each well which were left shaking for 5 min and then read on a microplate reader at 595 nm [
