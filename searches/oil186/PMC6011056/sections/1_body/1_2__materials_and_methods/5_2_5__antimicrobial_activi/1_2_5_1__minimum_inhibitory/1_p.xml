<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the
 <italic class="italic"> Cinnamomum</italic> stem essential oils against the five bacterial strains in their planktonic forms was tested by the microdilution method in polystyrene plates. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by the microdilution technique in 96-well polystyrene plates. For the assembly of the plates, 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of the essential oil solutions was serially diluted in culture medium, with the final concentrations varying from 2.00 to 0.01 mg/ml. Next, 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of culture medium containing the microorganisms was added at the adjusted concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml as described above. The negative control consisted of growing the microorganisms in TSB culture medium with 2% Tween 20. The MIC was considered the lowest concentration of the substances at which no growth of the microorganisms was detected [
