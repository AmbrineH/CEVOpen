 <italic> Cinnamomum </italic>species also exhibited antibiofilm activity; the essential oil of the trunk bark of
 <italic> C. burmannii</italic> was used to inhibit planktonic cell growth and the development of
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms. These results showed that, at a concentration of 0.12% (v/v), the oil was able to inhibit planktonic cell growth of both bacteria by 50%. Fifty percent inhibition of biofilm formation was observed at a concentration of 0.03%, while at a concentration of 0.12% (v/v), biofilms formed by both bacteria were destabilized [
