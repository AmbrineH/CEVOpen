<p>According to the results presented (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>), the comparison between the concentrations of the substances that reduce
 <italic> S. pyogenes</italic> biofilms shows that the (E)-cinnamaldehyde concentration was approximately eight times higher than that of EOCc and four times higher than that of EOCz. In this case, it may be suggested that other components of the essential oils also participate synergistically in the antibiofilm action. A similar behavior is observed on biofilms of
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, against
 <italic> Staphylococcus</italic>, the concentration of the essential oils remains constant when compared to (E)-cinnamaldehyde or is twice as high as that of
 <italic> S. epidermidis</italic> biofilm.
