<p>Commercially obtained
 <italic> C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil was able to inhibit the biomass and number of viable
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm cells at concentrations from 0.12 to 1.92 mg/ml. At 1.92 mg/ml, no biomass was observed and the viable cell reduction was significantly different from that of the negative control [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One study showed that 41.7% of biofilms of
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> and 33.3% of
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> biofilms were sensitive to
