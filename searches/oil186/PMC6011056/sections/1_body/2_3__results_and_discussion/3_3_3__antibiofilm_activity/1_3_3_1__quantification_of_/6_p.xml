<p>One study demonstrated that trans-cinnamaldehyde inhibited
 <italic> E. coli</italic> biofilm formation in urinary catheter fragments. Biofilm prevention was tested using catheter fragments inoculated with
 <italic> E. coli</italic> and treated with trans-cinnamaldehyde (0, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5%) for 0, 1, 3, and 5 days. All of the concentrations assayed prevented
 <italic> E. coli</italic> biofilm formation in urinary catheter fragments [
