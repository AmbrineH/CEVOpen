<p>The EOCz, EOCc, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde exhibited bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic> S. epidermidis</italic>. The MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the EOCz showing a bacteriostatic effect at 0.50 mg/ml, while EOCc and (E)-cinnamaldehyde had the same effect at 0.25 mg/ml. At the concentrations assayed in this study, no MIC or MBC for oxacillin could be determined, since growth was not detected at any concentration tested. The similarity between the data can be explained by the amount of (E)-cinnamaldehyde present in the EOCc (90.22%) (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The MIC value for the oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde against
 <italic> S. pyogenes</italic> and
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> was 0.50 mg/ml, and no bactericidal effect of these natural products was observed for these bacteria. In contrast, for
 <italic> E. coli</italic>, only EOCc did not exhibit a bactericidal effect, and the MIC varied from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/ml, and the MBC was 2.00 mg/ml for both for EOCZ and (E)-cinnamaldehyde.
