<p class="p">In a study by [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], (E)-cinnamaldehyde was tested against ten Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and three fungal species. The results demonstrated an inhibitory effect, according to the classification established by [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 12.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus, E. coli,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>, bacteria which were used in the present study; the specific values for these concentrations were 1.56 and 12.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml, respectively. In the present study, the MIC values for (E)-cinnamaldehyde against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus, E. coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> were 0.25 and 0.50 mg/ml, respectively, corresponding to approximately, 0.24 and 0.48 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml. Thus, the observed inhibitory effect obtained in this study was up to approximately twice as high as those observed by [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>].
