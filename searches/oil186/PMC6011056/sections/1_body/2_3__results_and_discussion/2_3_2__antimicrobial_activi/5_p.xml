<p>A study by [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of cinnamaldehyde against
 <italic> E. coli</italic> and
 <italic> S. aureus</italic>. In this study, cinnamaldehyde presented MIC values of 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/m and MBC value of 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for both bacteria, similar to the data obtained in this study. In addition, scanning electron microscopy showed morphological changes, which were confirmed by the increase of nucleic acid and protein levels in the cell suspension, indicating that the cell membrane was damaged. Thus, according to the authors, cinnamaldehyde plays a role in disrupting the bacterial cell membrane.
