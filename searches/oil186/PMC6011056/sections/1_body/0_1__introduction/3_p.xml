<p>Biofilms protect microorganisms from external aggression and predator attacks [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and some populations of biofilm-associated bacteria are resistant to antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, the increased resistance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics is problematic for the use of antimicrobial drugs [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], driving the search for alternative medicinal plants that can be used to treat diseases [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In particular, it is necessary to identify new drugs that can serve as an alternative treatment of infections caused by microorganisms that are resistant to traditional therapies. One approach is the study of local medicinal plants with possible antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties.
