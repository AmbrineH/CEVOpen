<p>Biofilms are organized groups of microorganisms that live inside an extracellular polymer matrix that is self-sustaining and can adhere to various surfaces [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], biotic and abiotic [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Biofilms are often observed floating or submerged in liquids [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and can be composed of homogeneous or heterogeneous communities of bacteria within a polymer matrix, which is primarily composed OF polysaccharides as well as other biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Analyses of the polymer matrix have revealed that biofilms are hydrogels that exhibit viscoelastic behavior, allowing them to resist mechanical stresses [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
