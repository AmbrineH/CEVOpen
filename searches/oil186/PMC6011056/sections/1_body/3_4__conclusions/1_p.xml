<p>Essential oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in planktonic form. In addition, they inhibit the formation of biofilms, which are directly related to infections. The most susceptible biofilms were
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> and
 <italic> E. coli</italic> microorganisms. Bioactivity may be associated with the presence of high content of (E)-cinnamaldehyde in the composition of essential oils. Therefore, these essential oils and their major component may be considered as possible sources for the development of new antimicrobial agents and may be used in synergy with currently available synthetic antibiotics or antimicrobials. In addition, the (E)-cinnamaldehyde molecule is promising as a prototype for derivatives with antibacterial properties and extended antibiotics.
