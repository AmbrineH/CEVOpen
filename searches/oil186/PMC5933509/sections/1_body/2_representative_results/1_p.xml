<p class="p">Bulk hydrogels extruded from a double barrel syringe into a silicone mold conform to the dimensions of the mold and become free-standing upon mold removal; gelation typically occurs seconds to minutes following co-extrusion depending on polymer precursors used. Typical characterization via swelling (measured gravimetrically using a cell culture insert to easily remove the hydrogel from the swelling solution), thermoresponsivity (measured using the same technique but cycling the incubation temperature above and below the phase transition temperature), degradation (measured using the same technique but over longer time periods), and shear or compressive modulus (measured using 2 mm thick and 7 mm diameter molded samples) demonstrates the tunability of the hydrogel responses depending on the chemistry of the precursor polymer (specifically, for POEGMA, the ratio of short to long chain OEGMA monomers used to prepare the hydrogel), the mole fraction of functional groups on the precursor polymers, and the concentration of those precursor polymers (
