 <bold class="bold">: Properties of degradable gel microparticles from reactive microfluidics. </bold>(A) Effect of paraffin oil flow rate on (purified) gel microparticle size in water; (B) Thermoresponsivity of purified gel microparticles in water following a single thermal cycle above and below the volume phase transition temperature; (C) Visual assessment (photos) and gel permeation chromatography traces (graph) confirming degradation of gel microparticles back to their precursor polymer components (here, in 1 M HCl to facilitate accelerated degradation on the time scale of imaging); scale bar = 100 Âµm.
