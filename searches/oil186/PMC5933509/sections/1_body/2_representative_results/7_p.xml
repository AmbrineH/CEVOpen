 <bold>: Properties of degradable nanogels from reactive self-assembly.</bold> (A) Particle size distributions of nanogels prepared with different aldehyde:hydrazide polymer mass ratios from dynamic light scattering (inset: transmission electron micrograph confirming the spherical nature of the nanogels); (B) Thermosensitivity of self-assembled particles as a function of the mass ratio between aldehyde:hydrazide polymer used to prepare the nanogels (from dynamic light scattering), with error bars representing the standard deviation of n=4 replicates; (C) Visual confirmation of the lack of nanogel aggregation both pre and post-lyophilization; (D) Visual confirmation of the acid-catalyzed degradation of nanogels (here in 1 M HCl for consistency with other studies above); (E) Gel permeation chromatograph traces of nanogel degradation products indicating their similarity to the hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized precursor polymers.
