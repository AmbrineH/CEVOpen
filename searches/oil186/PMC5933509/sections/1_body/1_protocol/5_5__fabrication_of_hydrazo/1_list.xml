  <p>Dissolve stock solutions of PNIPAM-Hzd (1 w/v%) and PNIPAM-Ald (1 w/v%) in deionized water. Prepare PNIPAM-Hzd and PNIPAM-Ald as described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, respectively.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Heat a 5 mL aliquot of the PNIPAM-Hzd stock solution to 70ËšC using an oil bath under magnetic stirring (350 RPM) inside a 20 mL glass scintillation vial. NOTE: The solution should become opaque (i.e. the temperature exceeds the lower critical solution temperature of PNIPAM-Hzd), but no visible precipitate should be formed.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Add a 0.25 mL aliquot of PNIPAM-Ald (5-20 wt% of the mass of PNIPAM-Hzd present in the seed solution) drop-wise into the heated PNIPAM-Hzd solution over a period of 5-10 s.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Continue mixing the solution in the scintillation vials for an additional 15 minutes, after which remove the sample from the oil bath and allow the product to cool to room temperature overnight.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Dialyze the resulting nanogels over 6x6 hour cycles (using a 3500 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane) against deionized water to remove any non-crosslinked polymer. If desired, lyophilize for storage.</p>
