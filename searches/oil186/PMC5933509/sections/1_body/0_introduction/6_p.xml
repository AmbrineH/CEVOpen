<p>To create degradable gel particles on the micron-scale, a reactive microfluidics method is described in which precursor polymer solutions are simultaneously mixed and emulsified using a soft lithography-templated microfluidic chip design, enabling the formation of mixed reactive polymer droplets that subsequently gel
