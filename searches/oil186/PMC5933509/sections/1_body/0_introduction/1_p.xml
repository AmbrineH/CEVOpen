<p>Smart materials have attracted significant attention due to their potential for reversible "on-demand" responses to external and/or environmental signals. Temperature-responsive materials have attracted particular interest due to their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, resulting in temperature-driven precipitation at temperatures T&gt;LCST
 <xref rid="B0" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In the context of thermoresponsive hydrogels, this lower critical solution temperature behavior is manifested by reversible swelling/de-swelling events that result in temperature-tunable bulk sizes (larger at T&lt;LCST)
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, pore sizes (larger at T&lt;LCST)
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, and interfacial properties (more hydrophilic at T&lt;LCST)
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Such transitions have been widely applied in drug delivery (for external or environmentally-triggerable drug release

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The most commonly investigated thermoresponsive hydrogels are based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, although significant (and increasing) work has also been conducted on poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA)
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and poly(vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL)
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. POEGMA has attracted particular recent interest given its anticipated improved biocompatibility
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>and its facile-to-tune LCST behavior, in which linearly-predictable mixtures of monomers with different numbers of ethylene oxide repeat units in their side chains can alter the LCST from ~20 °C to &gt;90 °C

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. However, each of these polymers is prepared by free radical polymerization and thus contains a carbon-carbon backbone, significantly limiting the potential utility and translatability of such polymers in the context of biomedical applications in which degradation (or at least the capacity for clearance through renal filtration) is typically a requirement.
