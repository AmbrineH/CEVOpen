 <bold class="bold">: Schematic of bulk hydrogel formation.</bold> Hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized polymer solutions (in water or aqueous buffer) are loaded into separate barrels of a double barrel syringe and then co-extruded through a static mixer into a cylindrical silicone mold. Rapid 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> gelation upon mixing forms a hydrazone crosslinked hydrogel, which is free standing (once the mold is removed) within seconds to minutes depending on concentration and functional group density of the precursor polymers.
