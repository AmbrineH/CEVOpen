 <bold class="bold">: Schematic of nanogel formation via thermally-driven reactive self-assembly.</bold> An aqueous solution containing the (thermoresponsive) hydrazide-functionalized polymer is heated above its lower critical solution temperature to create a stable uncrosslinked nanoaggregate. Following, an aldehyde-functionalized polymer is added to crosslink the nanoaggregate via hydrazone bond formation and thus stabilize the nanogel particle upon cooling below the LCST.
