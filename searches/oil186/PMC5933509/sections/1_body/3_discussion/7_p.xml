<p>Finally, removal of the templating oil is essential to ensure that the resulting particles maintain the smart properties anticipated based on the composition of the pre-polymers added and enable use of these particles in a biomedical context. The pentane washing procedure described was highly effective in this regard for general gel microparticle production. However, the application of this technique in a direct biomedical context (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, on-chip cell encapsulation) would require re-evaluation of this protocol. We have also explored the use of olive oil, suggested to be a more inert oil in the context of contacting cells
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, as the dispersant. While particle formation was possible, the gel microparticle populations were significantly more polydisperse than could be achieved with mineral oil, at least with the current chip design. Thus, while the chip appears to be adaptable to both synthetic polymer and natural polymer gel microparticle formation
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, a modified design may be required to exploit this technique more broadly across all possible material combinations.
