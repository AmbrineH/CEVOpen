<p>Note that nanogels produced using this method could be lyophilized and redispersed without any change in colloidal stability, often not possible for self-assembled structures and in our view attributable to our crosslinking stabilization method. We also anticipate that only the seed polymer needs to be thermoresponsive for this method to work; use of cross-linking polymers that are either non-responsive or responsive to other stimuli may further broaden the ultimate applicability of this technique. Finally, since the mixing of the two reactive precursor polymers is in this case passive as opposed to active, gelation time is much less important in terms of process control relative to the other fabrication strategies described. However, even in this technique, keeping the total crosslinking time &lt;30 min is desirable to minimize the risk of particle aggregation.</p>
