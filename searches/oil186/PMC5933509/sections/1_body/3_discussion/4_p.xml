 <bold>Microscale hydrogels via reactive microfluidics</bold> The key step associated with the microfluidics approach for gel microparticle fabrication is the priming of the microfluidics chip with the two reactive polymers. If the polymers are delivered with different pressures or at different rates into the chip, the differential pressure can drive the backflow of one precursor polymer solution into the reservoir (or at least toward the reservoir) of the other precursor polymer. This results in gelation upstream from particle formation, effectively blocking flow and thus requiring chip disposal. The torturous path imprinted between each reservoir and the mixing point creates a significant resistance to backflow; however, even a trained operator will occasionally gel a chip before a stable flow regime is achieved. Based on our experience, between 1-2 min is typically required to stabilize the flows following the initiation of droplet formation (over which time relatively polydisperse gel microparticles are produced); if no problems are observed within the first 5-10 minutes of operation, it is likely that several hours of continuous monodisperse particle production can be achieved. The use of precursor polymers with relatively well-matched viscosities as well as non-instantaneous gelation times (at least &gt;15 s preferable) greatly assists in avoiding such problems and promoting the formation of stable flows.
