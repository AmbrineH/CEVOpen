 <bold>Nanoscale hydrogels via reactive self-assembly</bold> Nanogels have been formed using a very wide range of processing conditions, including different concentrations of seed polymer (0.5-2 wt%), different ratios of crosslinking:seed polymer (0.05-0.2), different temperatures (40-80 Â°C), different mixing speeds (200-800 rpm), and different heating times following the addition of the crosslinker polymer (2-60 min)
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In terms of concentrations, the trends observed are generally as would be predicted, as higher concentrations of seed polymer lead to larger nanogels and higher ratios of crosslinker:seed polymer lead to nanogels with higher crosslink densities and thus lower thermoresponsivities. It should be emphasized that increasing the seed polymer concentration too high ultimately leads to bulk aggregation as opposed to nanoaggregation, consistent with what is observed in the conventional free radical precipitation process for forming thermoresponsive nanogels
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Shorter heating times were also found to be favorable for forming smaller and more monodisperse particles. We hypothesize that holding the nanoaggregate at longer times at a temperature above the LCST one or both of the precursor polymers increases the probability of aggregation upon nanogel collision, with the increased hydrophobicity of the hydrazone bond relative to either the precursor aldehyde or hydrazide functional groups making this aggregation more likely as the degree of crosslinking achieved is increased. Ultimately, shorter heating times are favorable from a process perspective, as a monodisperse nanogel population can be formed in as little as 2 min after crosslinker polymer addition; 10 min was found to be the longest time that could consistently produce monodisperse nanogels while also allowing for the production of more highly crosslinked nanogels. Interestingly, the method is remarkably insensitive to mixing, with nearly identical particle sizes and particle size distributions resulting from mixing at different speeds or even scaling the process to larger volumes. While initially surprised by this result, it likely speaks to the primary role of thermodynamics in regulating nanogel production.
