<p>Note that the use of PEO (or another high molecular weight and easily electrospun polymer) is essential in this protocol to promote nanofiber formation, as the short and highly branched POEGMA oligomers cannot alone reach an adequate degree of entanglement to induce electrospinning; instead, electrospray results at all process conditions tested for POEGMA-only formulations (although this may also have applications for making degradable gel particles using this same chemistry). A minimum PEO concentration of 1 wt% (1 MDa molecular weight) is required to maintain a fully nanofibrous morphology. Note that the PEO can be removed from the fibers following a simple soaking procedure (deionized water, 24 h) without disrupting the integrity of the nanofibrous network; in this way, PEO acts more as a transient electrospinning aid than an essential component of the final nanofibrous product. Note also that various types of collectors, including simple aluminum foil (to create thin layer hydrogels that can delaminate from the collector upon soaking) as well as a rotating aluminum disk (to create thicker scaffolds) can be used in conjunction with this same technique, provided the other process variables controlling the rate of gelation, the rate of electrospinning, and the rate of water evaporation during electrospinning remain unaltered.</p>
