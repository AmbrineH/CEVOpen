<p>We would also note that the first hydrogel cast does not always have the same properties as subsequent hydrogels cast, an observation attributed to slight differences in the rate at which the contents of the two barrels actually reach the static mixer. As a result, we typically prime the double barrel syringe by extruding a small (&lt;0.3 mL) fraction of gel prior to initiating the casting process to minimize such variability. Finally, while not typically problematic when using oligomeric synthetic pre-polymers, the viscosity of one or more precursor polymer solutions can pose a challenge in the context of this technique, both in terms of facilitating flow using simple thumb depression as well as promoting effective mixing within the static mixer. However, somewhat surprisingly, even precursor polymer solutions with sharply different viscosities still form relatively homogeneous hydrogels using the static mixer attachments described in the parts list (

If required, the use of a syringe pump (instead of the thumb) to drive flow and/or the use of a larger gauge needle at the outlet can help overcome issues associated with extrudability in these systems.
