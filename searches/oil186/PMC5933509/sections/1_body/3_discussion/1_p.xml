<p class="p">We have successfully applied all these fabrication techniques to multiple polymer systems using only slight variations of the methods described in detail above for PNIPAM and POEGMA; however, users of these protocols must be cognizant of the potential issues that can arise when other polymers are substituted into these processes. In particular, increasing the viscosity of the precursor polymers can negatively impact both the processibility (especially in the microfluidic method) as well as the efficiency of mixing of the two precursor polymers. In addition, the gelation time of the polymers must be controlled at a rate dependent on the morphology targeted in order to avoid premature gelation that serves to inhibit flow or prevent interdiffusion of the reactive pre-polymers, essential to form the desired homogeneous gel structures. The specific limitations of each strategy, as well as approaches we have used to adapt these approaches to address such limitations at each fabrication length scale, are described below.</p>
