<p class="p">Note that various flow rates ranging from 0.01-0.1 mL/h in the aqueous phase and 1.1-5.5 mL/h in the oil phase have been tested using this chip design, leading to the fabrication of particles on the size range of ~25-100 Âµm according to the shear applied at the flow-focusing junction; faster flow rates equate to higher shear and thus smaller particles formed

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>. Varying the oil flow rate while keeping the total aqueous flow rate low (~0.03 mL/h, as cited in the protocol) was found to be most efficient to control gel microparticle size without compromising either monodispersity or the lifetime of the device, both of which were observed to significantly decrease at the higher end of the cited total aqueous flow rates. Larger oil flow rates (&gt;5.5 mL/h) to create smaller particles are possible, but increased the risk of chip delamination (a common limitation encountered with plasma-bonded PDMS microfluidic chips). Bonding the chips using another method may enable faster flow rates and thus smaller gel microparticle production, a strategy we are currently exploring. Decreasing the size of the nozzle may also help to reduce the size of the microparticles that could be produced, albeit at a heightened risk of premature gelation prior to particle formation. Slower flow rates tended to lead to flow instabilities and thus higher polydispersities and an increased risk of chip gelation; this limitation could be overcome by using a multichannel microfluidic flow control system that has higher stability and higher resolution than the standard syringe pumps used in this protocol.
