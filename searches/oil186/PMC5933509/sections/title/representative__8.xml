 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bulk hydrogels extruded from a double barrel syringe into a silicone mold conform to the dimensions of the mold and become free-standing upon mold removal; gelation typically occurs seconds to minutes following co-extrusion depending on polymer precursors used. Typical characterization via swelling (measured gravimetrically using a cell culture insert to easily remove the hydrogel from the swelling solution), thermoresponsivity (measured using the same technique but cycling the incubation temperature above and below the phase transition temperature), degradation (measured using the same technique but over longer time periods), and shear or compressive modulus (measured using 2 mm thick and 7 mm diameter molded samples) demonstrates the tunability of the hydrogel responses depending on the chemistry of the precursor polymer (specifically, for POEGMA, the ratio of short to long chain OEGMA monomers used to prepare the hydrogel), the mole fraction of functional groups on the precursor polymers, and the concentration of those precursor polymers (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microfluidics leads to the formation of well-defined gel microparticles on the size scale of 25-100 µm, with the size controllable based on the flow rates of the oil and/or the combined aqueous polymer phases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6A</a>)
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">31</a>. Hot stage optical microscopy confirms that the gel microparticles maintain the thermoresponsive nature of the bulk hydrogels, showing reversible temperature-dependent swelling-deswelling with only a slight hysteresis on cycle 1 (attributable to irreversible hydrogen bond formation between neighboring amide groups in the collapsed state
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">34</a>) consistent with that observed in bulk PNIPAM hydrogels (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a>)
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">32</a>. Furthermore, the gel microparticles degrade back to their oligomeric precursors over time, enabling renal clearance (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Self-assembly driven by the nanoaggregation of a hydrazide-functionalized PNIPAM polymer in a heated solution followed by crosslinking with an aldehyde-functionalized PNIPAM polymer results in highly monodisperse nanogels (polydispersity &lt;0.1) on the size range of 180-300 nm, depending on the process conditions used (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7</a>
  <span class="bold">A</span>)
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">28</a>. The nanogels retain the typical thermoresponsive behavior of conventional free-radical crosslinked PNIPAM nanogels, with lower degrees of thermal deswelling observed as more cross-linking polymer was added (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7</a>
  <span class="bold">B</span>). The nanogels can be lyophilized and redispersed without a change in particle size (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7</a>
  <span class="bold">C</span>) and degrade over time via hydrolysis to re-form the oligomeric precursor polymers used to formulate the nanogels (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7</a>
  <span class="bold">D</span>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reactive electrospinning creates a nanofibrous hydrogel structure (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8</a>
  <span class="bold">A</span>), with nanofiber diameters on the order of ~300 nm achievable without visible electrosprayed particles present
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">33</a>. Soaking the POEGMA-based nanofibers in water results in rapid hydration (roughly two orders of magnitude faster than achieved with a bulk gel of the same composition, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8</a>
  <span class="bold">B</span>) but maintains the nanofibrous morphology over 8-10 weeks prior to hydrolytic degradation at physiological conditions; faster degradation is observed in acid-catalyzed environments, as expected due to the potential for acid-catalyzed hydrazone bond degradation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8</a>
  <span class="bold">C</span>). The nanofibrous structures are also mechanically robust in both the dry and swollen states over multiple cycles, enabling easy handling and repetitive straining (
