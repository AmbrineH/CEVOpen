<p class="p">The refractive index is usually used as a criterion for oil purity. This parameter will increase with higher chain length (however the relation is not a linear one) and the nonsaturation level. Different oils and fats have their own and particular refractive indices, so this feature is used to identify and determine the purity of oils and fats (Bakhshabadi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The refractive index is useful in controlling the progress of reactions such as hydrogenation and catalytic isomerization of oils. Also, it is used to recognize the oil oxidation too, and the temperature and saturation are some factors that influence the refractive index (Malek,

 <xref rid="fsn3535-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, applying various pretreatments didn't have any significant influence on the refractive index of black cumin oil (

 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) stated that based on the variety, the refractive index of black cumin oil is ranged from 1.4697 to 1.4730, which conformed with our results. Bakhshabadi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) attributed no changes in refractive index of oils obtained from microwave process to the similarity of fatty acid compositions in the nontreated and treated samples. Also, Gorji et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) through studying the physicochemical properties of orange seed oil extracted by various methods, indicated that modern extraction technologies in comparison with common and usual methods, do not change physical properties of oils such as refractive index.
