<p class="p">It was found that different pretreatments in oil extraction from black cumin led to an increase in oil density (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). When the microwave and PEF were used, the oil density was increased 1.51% and 0.96%, respectively in comparison with samples that didn't have any pretreatments. Likely, this increase can be attributed to the more decomposition of seed cell walls and increase in resulted particles within the oil. Anjum, Anwar, Jamil, and Iqbal (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported that microwave leads to a higher oil density that was inconsistent with the findings of Uquiche et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Kittiphoom et al. (2015). Theoretically, density is not an important property but economically it is very important. Although the oil shipments are sold on the basis of their weight but they are measured on the basis of their volume and also their relationship is defined by density. This parameter is not similar for all the oils and it is dependent on the composition of fatty acids, the trace and low compounds that exist in oil, and also the temperature (Hamm, Hamilton, &amp; Calliauw,
