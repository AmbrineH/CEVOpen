<p>Our analysis of variance indicated that the influence of pretreatment type on the color index of oils extracted from black cumin seeds was completely significant (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01). Comparing the means of data obtained from samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) revealed that the color index ranged between 82.1–155.34. As it is clear, the use of PEF and microwave pretreatments caused an increase in the color index of black cumin oil and the maximum color index was obtained for microwave pretreatment. The increase in color index can be attributed to the fracture of plant tissues during treatment and therefore more extraction of the pigments. In this regard, Lee, Oh, Chang, and Kim (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) studied the influence of different temperatures of parching the safflower seeds on its oil color. They stated that formation of color in oil was under the influence of parching temperatures in such a manner that when the temperature is increased, the oil color would change from light yellow to dark brown. Also, Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) reported a distinct color increase in the rice bran oil at higher parching temperatures. Megahad (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) attributed the increase in color in peanut oil as the result of treating the seeds with microwave to the nonenzymatic browning reactions and destruction of phospholipids during the parching process; so an increase in the brown components can be occurred together with elevation of other components as a result of decomposition of phospholipids. Guderjan, Elez‐Martínez, and Knorr (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) observed similar results at the time of using PEF.
