<p class="p">A Gas Chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) device and Adam's method (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>) with some modifications have been used to analyze and determine various chemical components which exist in the black cumin seed oil. For this reason, 1 ml of oil was mixed with dry sodium sulfate anhydrous and hexane. The obtained mixture analyzed with the use of the GC/MS device equipped with a (HP‐SMS, Calabria, Italy) and capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 μm diameter and 0.25 μm thickness of internal layer). The helium carrier gas flow was 0.8 ml per minute and the fission rate of the samples was 1–10. The column temperature program was set up from 60 to 260°C with a speed of 4°/min. The mass spectra were prepared at 70 electron volt and the range of these spectra were 35–350 m/z. Determination of oil components was performed as a result of comparing their mass spectrum with spectrum bank and comparing their retention coefficient with the reference values. The retention coefficients were prepared with the use of the retention times of normal alkanes that were injected with the same device and under chromatographic conditions. The relative values of components were computed on the basis of the total peak level by the device software.
