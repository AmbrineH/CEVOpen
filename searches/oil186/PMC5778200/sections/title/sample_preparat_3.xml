 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black cumin seeds (with 40.4% oil) were cleaned and kept in plastic bags resistant to air and moisture penetration by the time of the experiments. Two pretreatments of microwave with the power of 540 W for 180 s and PEF with 3.25 kV/cm electric field intensity and pulses equals to 30 were applied on seeds. It should be mentioned that to use of Molecular Weight (MW), the samples were located on the particular container of microwave in a row. The microwave power was set on 2,450 MH. In terms of PEF, the samples were put in chamber and distilled water was added on the samples as well. The applied power in chamber was 30 pulse with the width of 20 μs. Finally the samples were filtered and dried in 50°C. Then, the oil of seeds was extracted by a screw press with 34 rpm rotation.</p>
