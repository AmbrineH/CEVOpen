 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black cumin seeds were provided from a local market in Gonbad‐e‐Kavoos (Golestan, Iran). Chemicals including ethanol, acetonitrile, phenolphthalein, sodium thiosulfate, chloroform, and hexane were purchased from Merck company (Germany). The equipments applied in the present research are as the following: laboratory sieve, laboratory oven (Memmert, Buchenbach, Germany), digital scale (Gec Avery, Smethwick, UK), microwave (LG, Seoul, South Korea), PEF device (made by Research Institute of Food Science and Technology, Mashhad, Iran), spectrophotometer (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK), kjeldahl (Auto Analyser 130 Tecator CO, Warrington, UK), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (S‐360, Oxford., England), refractometer (Abbe, Kobe, Jepan), Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Agilent, San Francisco, USA), Rancimat (Metrohm, Herisau, Swiss) and laboratory screw press (Kern Kraft, Karlsruhe, Germany).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black cumin seeds (with 40.4% oil) were cleaned and kept in plastic bags resistant to air and moisture penetration by the time of the experiments. Two pretreatments of microwave with the power of 540 W for 180 s and PEF with 3.25 kV/cm electric field intensity and pulses equals to 30 were applied on seeds. It should be mentioned that to use of Molecular Weight (MW), the samples were located on the particular container of microwave in a row. The microwave power was set on 2,450 MH. In terms of PEF, the samples were put in chamber and distilled water was added on the samples as well. The applied power in chamber was 30 pulse with the width of 20 μs. Finally the samples were filtered and dried in 50°C. Then, the oil of seeds was extracted by a screw press with 34 rpm rotation.</p>

For this reason, 1 ml of oil was mixed with dry sodium sulfate anhydrous and hexane. The obtained mixture analyzed with the use of the GC/MS device equipped with a (HP‐SMS, Calabria, Italy) and capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 μm diameter and 0.25 μm thickness of internal layer). The helium carrier gas flow was 0.8 ml per minute and the fission rate of the samples was 1–10. The column temperature program was set up from 60 to 260°C with a speed of 4°/min. The mass spectra were prepared at 70 electron volt and the range of these spectra were 35–350 m/z. Determination of oil components was performed as a result of comparing their mass spectrum with spectrum bank and comparing their retention coefficient with the reference values. The retention coefficients were prepared with the use of the retention times of normal alkanes that were injected with the same device and under chromatographic conditions. The relative values of components were computed on the basis of the total peak level by the device software.
