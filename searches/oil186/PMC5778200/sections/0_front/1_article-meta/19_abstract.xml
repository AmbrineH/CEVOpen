 <p class="p">Application of novel technologies such as microwave and pulsed electric fields (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PEF</span>) might increase the speed and efficiency of oil extraction. In the present research, 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PEF</span> (3.25 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">kV</span>/cm electric field intensity and 30 pulse number) and microwave (540 W for 180 s) pretreatments were used to study the process of oil extraction from black cumin (
  <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic>) seeds. After applying the selected pretreatments, the oil of seeds was extracted with the use of a screw press and the extraction efficiency, refractive index, oil density, color index, oxidative stability, and chemical components of oil and protein of meal were evaluated. The achieved results expressed that 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PEF</span> and microwave pretreatments increased the oil extraction efficiency and its oxidative stability. Different pretreatments didn't have any significant influence on the refractive index of black cumin seed oil (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>&gt;.05). When microwave and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PEF</span> were used, the oil density showed an enhancement as the following: 1.51% and 0.96%, respectively in comparison with the samples with no pretreatments. Evaluation of the extracted oils, using 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC</span>/
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MS</span> analysis indicated that thymoquinone was the dominant phenolic component in the black cumin oil. Finally, the 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SEM</span> analysis revealed that microwave and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PEF</span> can be useful in the extraction of oil from black cumin seeds since these treatments damaged cell walls and facilitated the oil extraction process.
