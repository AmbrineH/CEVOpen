 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L. is a perennial herb of the Asteraceae family. This plant grows widely in Europe and Asia. Introduced into North America in the 18th century, it is well adapted to northern climates [

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> has been used as an anthelmintic, tonic, emmenagogue, antihypertensive, carminative, antispasmodic, antidiabetic, diuretic, and an anti-inflammatory compound [

 <xref rid="B3-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most alcohol extracts of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> are reported to have biological effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. Indeed, studies on rats and mice [

 <xref rid="B5-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have found 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> extracts to have anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids present in the plant could be, in part, responsible for these biological effects [

 <xref rid="B6-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Shinella et al. demonstrated that parthenolide was the main in vivo anti-inflammatory substance in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> [

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> showed antioxidant activity, probably due to the presence of phenolic compounds [
