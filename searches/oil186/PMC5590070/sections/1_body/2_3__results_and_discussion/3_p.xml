<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> demonstrated antioxidant activity by significantly inhibiting the oxidation of DCFH induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide with an IC

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</xref>). Using in vitro methods including DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, Shaparov et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also reported a moderate level of antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil. Unfortunately, the chemical composition of the oil was not analyzed and the compounds responsible for the activity were not identified. The antioxidant activity of essential oils is often attributed to terpenoids such as carvacrol, thymol, and eugenol [
 <xref rid="B33-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, our results for 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil showed two compounds, α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide, to be particularly effective having a respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.4 and 6.2 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. A moderate level of antioxidant activity for α-pinene, based on a DPPH assay, had been previously reported by Dai et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the antioxidant activity of caryophyllene oxide has been reported.
