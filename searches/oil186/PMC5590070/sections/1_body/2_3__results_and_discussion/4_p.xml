<p>Numerous 
 <italic>Tanacetum</italic> species produce essential oils that are known to have antibacterial activity including 
 <italic>T. balsamita</italic>, 
 <italic>T. polycephalum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. parthenium</italic>, 
 <italic>T. longifolium</italic>, and

 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> from Roumania [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Slovakia [
 <xref rid="B38-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] were also reported against gram-positive bacterial strains using the disc diffusion method. Moreover, 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil from Tajikistan was found to be weakly effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and MRSA [
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study, we used a new antibiotic assay developed to test hydrophobic compounds as described in the Material and Methods section [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results, presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002">Table 2</xref>, show that 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil was effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 59 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 241 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. We also tested the antibacterial activity of the main constituents of 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Camphor was active against both bacterial strains having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 22 to 26 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, caryophyllene oxide and γ-terpinene were also active against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> having a respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10.4 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 50 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The antibacterial activity of camphor, caryophyllene oxide, and γ-terpinene has been previously reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B40-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] although the results are sometimes contradictory. For example, Kotan et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found camphor to be ineffective as an antibacterial compound. Our use of a new method that is better suited to hydrophobic matrices and compounds [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] may explain the differences in the study outcomes.
