 <xref rid="B27-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] reported that α-humulene reduced rat paw edema that had been induced by carrageenan. It also inhibited COX-2 and iNOS expression. Moreover, the authors concluded that α-humulene might represent an important compound for the management and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases [
