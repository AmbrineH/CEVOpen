<p class="p">We assessed the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgare</italic> essential oil and its main compounds against human lung carcinoma A-549, colon adenocarcinoma DLD-1, human keratinocytes 
 <italic class="italic">HaCaT</italic>, and healthy WS1 cell lines. 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgare</italic> essential oil was slightly cytotoxic against A-549 and WS1 with an IC

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00034-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Essential oil was also slightly cytotoxic against human keratinocytes 
 <italic class="italic">HaCaT</italic> with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 199 µg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Interestingly, DLD-1 (colon adenocarcinoma) was more sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgare</italic> essential oil than other cell lines, having an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 105 µg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgare</italic> essential oil against cancer cell lines. The major constituents of camphor, borneol, and 1,8-cineole, were all inactive with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 200 µg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. However, some minor compounds in the oil, including α-pinene, α-humulene, α-terpinene, β-caryophyllene, β-pinene, γ-terpinene, camphene, caryophyllene oxide, and limonene possessed a moderate cytotoxicity against all cell lines, including the tested cancer cell lines, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranging from 28 to 112 µg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The cytotoxicity of these compounds against various cancer cell lines has also been previously reported [
