<p class="p">All chromatographic analyses were run on an Agilent 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a non-polar DB-5 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a polar SolGel-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as well as two FID detectors (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The oils were injected in an undiluted (0.1 µL injection volume, split 1:235) and undried state. The temperature program was 40 °C for 2 min, 2 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> up to 210 °C, and then 210 °C for 13 min. Samples were also injected on an Agilent 7890A GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5975C InertXL EI/CI mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5MS column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the same temperature program as above and a split of 1:1000. Compounds were identified from their retention indexes as calculated from even-numbered C8 to C36 alkane standards and/or from MS databases NIST08, HPCH 2205 and custom libraries built from pure compounds (Laboratoire LASEVE, UQAC, QC, Canada). Quantification was derived from the FID detector response on the DB-5 column without any correction factor. All standards were co-injected to validate the identification.
