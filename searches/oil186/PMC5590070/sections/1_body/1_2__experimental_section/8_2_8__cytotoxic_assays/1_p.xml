<p>We plated in 96-well microplates—each containing a 100 µL culture medium—exponentially growing cells of human skin fibroblasts WS1, human 
 <italic>HaCaT</italic> keratinocytes, human lung carcinoma A-549, and human colon adenocarcinoma DLD-1 at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well (Costar, Corning Inc., Lowell, MA, USA). The cells were allowed to adhere for 16 h before treatment. We then treated cells with 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> essential oil or dissolved compounds in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was 0.5% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) to avoid solvent toxicity. After 48 h, we assessed the cytotoxicity using the resazurin reduction test [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fluorescence was measured on an automated Fluoroskan Ascent FL
 <sup>TM</sup> plate reader (Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>).
