  <span class="bold">Background:</span>
  <span class="italic">Tanacetum vulgare </span>L. (Asteraceae) is a perennial herb that has been used to treat multiple ailments. Regional variability of the chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oils is well-known. Despite these regional chemotypes, most relevant studies did not analyze the complete chemical composition of the 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare </span>essential oil and its constituents in relation to their biological activities. Here, we assess the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare </span>collected from northern Quebec (Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean), Canada. 
  <span class="bold">Methods: </span>Essential oil was extracted from plants by steam distillation and analyzed using GC-FID. Biological activities of essential oil and its main constituents were evaluated in vitro. 
  <span class="bold">Results: </span>We identified the major compounds as camphor, borneol, and 1,8-cineole. The oil possesses anti-inflammatory activity inhibiting NO production. It also inhibits intracellular DCFH oxidation induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide. Anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil appears driven mainly by α-humulene while antioxidant activity is provided by α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide. Essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">T vulgare </span>was active against both 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> with camphor and caryophyllene oxide responsible for antibacterial activity. Finally, 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil was slightly cytotoxic against the human healthy cell line WS1 while α-humulene and caryophyllene oxide were moderately cytotoxic against A-549, DLD-1, and WS1. 
  <span class="bold">Conclusion: </span>We report, for the first time, links between the specific compounds found in 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities. 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil possesses interesting biological properties.
