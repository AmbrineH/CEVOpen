 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We plated in 96-well microplates—each containing a 100 µL culture medium—exponentially growing cells of human skin fibroblasts WS1, human 
  <span class="italic">HaCaT</span> keratinocytes, human lung carcinoma A-549, and human colon adenocarcinoma DLD-1 at a density of 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> cells per well (Costar, Corning Inc., Lowell, MA, USA). The cells were allowed to adhere for 16 h before treatment. We then treated cells with 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil or dissolved compounds in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was 0.5% (
  <span class="italic">v/v</span>) to avoid solvent toxicity. After 48 h, we assessed the cytotoxicity using the resazurin reduction test [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00034">26</a>]. Fluorescence was measured on an automated Fluoroskan Ascent FL
  <span class="sup">TM</span> plate reader (Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC
  <sub>50</sub>).
