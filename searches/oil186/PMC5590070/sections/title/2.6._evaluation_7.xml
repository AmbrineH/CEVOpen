 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DCFH-DA assay as described by Girard-Lalancette et al. [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00034">24</a>]. To assess antioxidant activity, we incubated the human skin fibroblasts WS1 for 1 h with a growing concentration of essential oil or dissolved compounds in DMSO. We then added 100 µL of 200 µM tert-butylhydroperoxide and immediately measured fluorescence as well as again after 90 min later. Measurements were performed on an automated plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Antioxidant activity was expressed as the concentration of extract inhibiting 50% (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) of DCFH oxidation.
