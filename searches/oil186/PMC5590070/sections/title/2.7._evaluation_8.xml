 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested the antibacterial activities of 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> essential oil and compounds against gram-negative 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC bacteria 25922) and gram-positive 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC bacteria 25923) using the antibacterial hydrophobic assay as described by Côté et al. [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00034" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00034">25</a>]. This new method was developed and used in this work as classical methods including disc diffusion and microdilution assays are sometimes inefficient for testing a matrix or compounds of a hydrophobic nature. Briefly, after microorganisms passed 16–18 h at 37 °C in a nutrient broth base (Difco), we transferred 20 µL methanol containing growing concentrations of essential oil and compounds (3.1 to 200 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) onto nutrient agar of 96-well plates. We then added bacterial strains having a concentration of 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> colony forming units (CFU) per mL of nutrient broth. Bacterial suspension without treatment was used as negative control and bacterial suspension plus solvent was tested in parallel to demonstrate the absence of solvent toxicity. The blank consisted of culture medium only and was subtracted from all subsequent measurements of every other well. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to foster bacterial growth. We then added 100 µL of resazurin sodium salt solution having a concentration of 50 µg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Sigma R-2127, St-Louis, MO, USA) to each well. Fluorescence was read on an automated Fluoroskan Ascent FL
  <span class="sup">TM</span> plate reader (Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) after two hours for 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and three hours for 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> was determined as the lowest concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of bacterial growth.
