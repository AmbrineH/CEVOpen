  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aerial portions of 
   <span class="italic">T. vulgare</span> were collected in July 2014 in Chicoutimi, Quebec, QC, Canada. Voucher specimen no. QFA0610840 has been filed at the Louis-Marie herbarium of Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada. Essential oil was obtained from freshly harvested aerial parts by industrial steam distillation over a 3-h period (Groupe BoréaRessources, Ferland-Boileau, QC, Canada). The essential oil extraction yields depended on the total amount of the raw material. The extracted essential oil was then stored in the dark at a temperature of 4 °C.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All chromatographic analyses were run on an Agilent 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a non-polar DB-5 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a polar SolGel-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as well as two FID detectors (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The oils were injected in an undiluted (0.1 µL injection volume, split 1:235) and undried state. The temperature program was 40 °C for 2 min, 2 °C·min
   <span class="sup">−1</span> up to 210 °C, and then 210 °C for 13 min. Samples were also injected on an Agilent 7890A GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5975C InertXL EI/CI mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5MS column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the same temperature program as above and a split of 1:1000. Compounds were identified from their retention indexes as calculated from even-numbered C8 to C36 alkane standards and/or from MS databases NIST08, HPCH 2205 and custom libraries built from pure compounds (Laboratoire LASEVE, UQAC, QC, Canada). Quantification was derived from the FID detector response on the DB-5 column without any correction factor. All standards were co-injected to validate the identification.

Measurements were performed on an automated plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystems, Milford, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Antioxidant activity was expressed as the concentration of extract inhibiting 50% (IC

This new method was developed and used in this work as classical methods including disc diffusion and microdilution assays are sometimes inefficient for testing a matrix or compounds of a hydrophobic nature. Briefly, after microorganisms passed 16–18 h at 37 °C in a nutrient broth base (Difco), we transferred 20 µL methanol containing growing concentrations of essential oil and compounds (3.1 to 200 µg·mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) onto nutrient agar of 96-well plates. We then added bacterial strains having a concentration of 5 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> colony forming units (CFU) per mL of nutrient broth. Bacterial suspension without treatment was used as negative control and bacterial suspension plus solvent was tested in parallel to demonstrate the absence of solvent toxicity. The blank consisted of culture medium only and was subtracted from all subsequent measurements of every other well. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to foster bacterial growth. We then added 100 µL of resazurin sodium salt solution having a concentration of 50 µg·mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Sigma R-2127, St-Louis, MO, USA) to each well. Fluorescence was read on an automated Fluoroskan Ascent FL
