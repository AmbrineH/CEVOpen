 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The components identified in ZEO (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>) in this study was similar to previous works. According to Saedi Dezaki et al. (2007),
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>
  </span> the major components of ZEO were thymol (41.81%), carvacrol (28.85%), and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (5.63-13.16%). In the study of Saei-Dehkordi, et al. (2010),
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>
  </span> a variation of the major components, thymol (27.5-64.87%), carvacrol (2.7-22.39), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (8.36%) and linalool (0-7.92%) of ZEO were observed, due to the collection of plant material from five main phytogeographic grown towns in Iran. Factors such as growth phase and geographic origin of plant, method of plant drying and processing affect EO content and chemical compositions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> In our study, the antibacterial properties of ZEO was not different to the results reported from other studies, apart from some detected variable bacterial susceptibilities that may cause the differences in the chemical composition of ZEOs and the bacterial strains used by others. The hydrophobic property of most EOs could increase their permeability and accumulation in the bacterial cell membranes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Silver ions and silver-based compounds are widely known as highly toxic to 16 major species of bacteria due to their multiple mechanisms of action. Zarei et al. (2014) reported the MIC values of SNP against 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span>,
  <span class="italic"> S.</span> Typhimurium, 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> O157:H7 and 
  <span class="italic">Vibrio parahaemolyticus</span> in the range of 3.12- 6.25 µg mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span> according to microdilution method in Tryptic soy broth.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>
  </span> The small size and high ratio of surface to volume in SNPs, allow them to more effectively contact with microorganisms and induce their antimicrobial activities.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>
  </span> It has been shown that antibacterial efficacy of SNP varies between different prepared SNPs. Given the fact that factors such as the type of bacteria, the media of inoculation, type and the size of nanoparticle and the method of preparation must be considered when comparing the antibacterial activity of different nanoparticles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The additive or partial synergy effect is a type of interaction in which the combined effect is equal to the sum of the effects of the individual agents. As shown previously,
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>
  </span> SNP interaction with EO is a bacteria-dependent phenomenon. The synergistic properties of SNP with ZEO on 
  <span class="italic">Staph. epidermidis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> (FICI= 0.5-1) has been demonstrated, but no synergistic effects were found against Methicillin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</span> (FICI value of 3 and 1.25, respectively).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The MBC: MIC ratio ≥ 8 is considered as an indicator of bacteriostatic activity.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">23</a>
  </span> In the current study, MIC/MBC of both SNP and ZEO were 1:1, suggesting a bactericidal effect on 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm. Typhimurium</span>. It was demonstrated that oregano EO reveals a synergistic activity with common antibiotics such as gentamicin against some potential pathogens,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Measuring the loss of 260-nm absorbing material from the bacteria is an indicator of cell leakage which could be used to understand the mechanism of action of antimicrobial compounds. The presence of materials with an absorbance at 260 nm in the supernatant of bacterial solution indicates a loss of nucleic acids from the cell. Based on the results of this study (Figures 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">2</a>), the higher values determined by the measurements at 260 nm are an indication for the leakage of bacterial contents which subsequently confirms the physical damages of bacterial cell walls by ZEO.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span> However, the reductions in the efficacy of SNP may be best explained by bacterial blocking caused by higher concentrations of SNP, which could reduce the contact surface of nanoparticles with bacteria and its antibacterial efficacy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> SNP can cause agglomeration after adding to the nutritious media such as LB and as shown previously,
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>
  </span> treatment of 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> with a combination of EO and SNP, induced a reduction in cell density, exopolysaccharide, morphology changes, and cell destruction. However, membrane permeability created by EO might allow the small molecules of SNP to enter the cell.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Researchers are aware of the importance of biofilms in causing diseases and drug resistance, therefore finding a safe and effective method for biofilm removal is of great importance. Natural agents are considered as a safe way to remove biofilms. Although the research on SNP interaction with biofilm is still in its early phases, we currently know that removal of biofilm by SNP could occur in three steps: transportation to the vicinity of the biofilm, attachment, and penetration within the biofilm.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">27</a>
  </span> It has been shown that eradication of biofilms by SNP is not a concentration-dependent process, rather it occurs in a time-dependent manner.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">28</a>
  </span> The main compounds of ZEO are thymol, a monoterpene phenolic derivative, and its phenol isomer, carvacrol. Both of them contribute to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of Lamiaceae family.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span> Additionally, hydrophobic characteristics of these ingredients allow the penetration of ZEO into outer exopolysaccharide and inner layers of biofilms.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">29</a>
  </span> In our study, by decreasing the OIC concentration from 1/2OIC to 1/4OIC (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>), the biofilm removal properties were significantly decreased (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05) from 64 % to 43.33 % for 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>) whereas OIC concentration, removed 76% of biofilm mass. For 
  <span class="italic">Salm.</span> Typhimurium (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>) the values were 96.46%, 81.50% and 68 % for OIC, 1/2OIC and 1/4OIC concentrations, respectively. It means that combined use of SNP and ZEO boosted biofilm removal potential of both antibacterial compounds against different pathogens. According to Gurunathan et al. (2014), the combined use of NPs and antibiotic such as ampicillin exhibit antibiofilm activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by 55 and 70%, whereas combining those NPs with vancomycin revealed a 75 and 55% reduction of biofilm of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>
  </span> It is worth mentioning that, differences in the method used to evaluate biofilm removal activity and differences in the sensitivity of different bacteria, the age of biofilm and type of surface which biofilm developed could cause different results in the biofilm removal percentage in previous studies.
