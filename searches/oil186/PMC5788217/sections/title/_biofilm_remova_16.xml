  <span class="italic">Salm.</span> Typhimurium (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>b), higher removal of 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> biofilms were achieved at 15 min exposure time for SNP-ZEO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>a). Results demonstrated that biofilm of 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> is more sensitive to SNP - ZEO than 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium. SNP at MIC, 2MIC, and 4MIC concentrations resulted in 93, 87 and 71.33% and 82, 79 and 58% removal of 
  <span class="italic">Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm. Typhimurium</span> cells, respectively. For
  <span class="italic"> Staph. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salm</span>. Typhimurium, 90.6%, and 89% bacteria were eliminated at a concentration of MIC for ZEO. Concerning the hydrophobicity property of ZEO, it can be observed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>, a reduction in the biofilm removal with increasing ZEO concentration supporting the use of surfactants could help in the disruption of such shortcoming.
