 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The MICs and MBC of ZEO and SNP against both bacteria were determined in LB using broth microdilution assay in 96-wells polystyrene flat-bottomed microtitre plates based on CLSI guidelines.

  </span> Two-fold serial dilutions of ZEO were prepared in 0.1% peptone water containing 0.15% agar (to make a stable emulsion of EO in peptone water), whereas dilutions of SNP were made in 0.1% peptone water. The wells of a microplates with U-bottom were poured by 160 μL of LB and 20 μL of the bacterial suspension with OD
  <sub>600</sub> = 0.1 to reach a suspension with 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/ mL in each well. Then, 20 μL either ZEO or SNP concentrations were added into the desired wells to achieve final concentrations of 312 to 5000 μg/ mL for ZEO and 62.5 to 2000 μg/mL for SNP. For every experiment, three controls, including LB alone, LB with bacteria and LB containing treatment agents without bacteria were used. The plate was mixed on a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by using 0.01% (w/v) resazurin sodium salt solution as explained previously. To determine MBCs, 10 µL from each well was inoculated into LB agar at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The MBC was determined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agents that produces 99.99% inhibition in the initial population of microorganism. MBC: MIC ratio, which describes the relationship between the minimum 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> bactericidal concentration and the MIC of antimicrobial agents, were also investigated.
