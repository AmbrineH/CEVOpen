<p> As shown by 260 nm absorbing material measurements, SNP displayed an antimicrobial activity after a long time of exposure (at least after 1 h) compared with ZEO. In comparison with 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium had higher resistance to SNP. Additionally, no significant reduction (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed in the microbial counts of 1/2OIC and 1/4OIC with SNP treated samples.
