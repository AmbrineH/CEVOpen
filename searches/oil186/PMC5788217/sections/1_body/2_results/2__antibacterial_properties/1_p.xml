<p> The inhibitory effects of ZEO and SNP alone and in combination against 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium were investigated using microtiter plate assay. For 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic>, the MIC values of ZEO and SNP were 1250 and 25 μg/mL and for 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium the values were 2500 and 25 μg/mL, respectively. In all cases, MBC values were similar to MICs. The ZEO was found to be more effective on gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria whereas SNP displayed similar antibacterial activity on both bacteria. The MICs for SNP - ZEO combination were 0.78 and 12.5 μg/ mL against 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium, respectively. ZEO-SNP combination inhibited 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium at 625 μg/ mL. Based on the FICI scale (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), the combination displayed a synergistic action on 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> (FICI=0.81) and 
 <italic>Salm</italic>. Typhimurium (FICI= 0.75).
