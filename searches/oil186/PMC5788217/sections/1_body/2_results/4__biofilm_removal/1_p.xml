<p class="p"> As compared with 
 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b), higher removal of 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> biofilms were achieved at 15 min exposure time for SNP-ZEO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). Results demonstrated that biofilm of 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> is more sensitive to SNP - ZEO than 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium. SNP at MIC, 2MIC, and 4MIC concentrations resulted in 93, 87 and 71.33% and 82, 79 and 58% removal of 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salm. Typhimurium</italic> cells, respectively. For
 <italic class="italic"> Staph. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium, 90.6%, and 89% bacteria were eliminated at a concentration of MIC for ZEO. Concerning the hydrophobicity property of ZEO, it can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, a reduction in the biofilm removal with increasing ZEO concentration supporting the use of surfactants could help in the disruption of such shortcoming.
