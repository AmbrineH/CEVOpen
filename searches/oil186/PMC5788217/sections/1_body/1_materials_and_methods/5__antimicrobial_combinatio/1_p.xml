<p> Broth checkerboard micro-assay was carried out to evaluate the antagonistic, indifferent, additive and synergistic interactions of ZEO and SNP using the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index method.

 </sup> Eight different concentrations, 5 concentrations lower than MIC, two concentrations higher than MIC and one concentration as same as MIC of ZEO and SNP were used to design an 8 × 8 checkerboards of combinations. The microplates were prepared by dispensing 160 μL of LB and 20 μL of the logarithmic suspension of bacteria and 10 μL of different concentration of both antimicrobial agents into each well. Then, plates were kept in a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by resazurin reduction. MICs of the individual antimicrobials and all of the combinations were used to calculate Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of ZEO and SNP and FIC index using the following formula:
