<p> Sanitizing effects of ZEO and SNP combination were investigated by determining the growth of the microorganism in LB broth supplemented with different concentration of antimicrobials (1/4OIC, 1/2OIC, and OIC) to obtain optimal concentration for both compounds according to the method explained before with some modifications.

 </sup> Bacterial cultures (1×10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/ mL) (0.5 mL) were added to tubes containing 4.5 mL of antimicrobial agents in combination and then, tubes were incubated at 23± 2 °C for 15 min and bacterial growth was monitored by sampling (1mL) and counting the viable cells. After sampling, 1 mL aliquot were dispersed in a 9 mL neutralizing solution containing an equal volume of sodium thiosulphate 5% w/v and Tween-20 and remained for 10 min, to neutralize the subsequent activity of agents and then serial dilutions were prepared.
