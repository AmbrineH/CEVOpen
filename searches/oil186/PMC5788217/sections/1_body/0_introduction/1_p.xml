<p> Nanotechnology, the science of study and use of structures at nanoscale, is a promising tool for producing novel materials with biomedical applications. Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) has been extensively investigated in various scientific disciplines. Silver in the form of silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine has been widely used to cure bacterial infections associated with burns. SNPs are considered as a potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral and antiprotozoal compound and it is also reported to have anti-inflammatory activities.

 </sup> Synthesis and use of SNPs as a new generation of antimicrobial agents would be a fascinating and economical tool to solve drug resistance. Microorganisms display different responses to nanoparticles which is related to differences in the bacterial structure and the composition of the cell wall.
