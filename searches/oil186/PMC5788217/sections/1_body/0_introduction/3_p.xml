<p> The practical advantage of antimicrobial combinations has been comprehended for over 50 years. Combinations of two antimicrobial agents with a different mechanism of action, may enhance antimicrobial activity especially where resistance to a single agent develops by bacteria. Also, due to synergy or additive interaction, the combination of drugs allows utilizing lower antimicrobial concentration, reducing the harmful side effects and increasing treatment efficacy.

 </sup> Tackling public health issues occur by the growing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, proposes new antimicrobial formulation based on the combination of older antimicrobials with a rich source of new agents, such as natural products.

 </sup>Â Simultaneous use of EOs and other antimicrobial compounds with great disinfectant properties has a high priority since using EOs in high concentrations make some unpleasant organoleptic changes in food and also on food contact surface when used as a sanitizing compound. Owing to the possible synergistic properties, combined use of EO with SNPs as a sanitizing mixture for food plant sanitation has been proposed.
