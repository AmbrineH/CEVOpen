<p class="p"> Researchers are aware of the importance of biofilms in causing diseases and drug resistance, therefore finding a safe and effective method for biofilm removal is of great importance. Natural agents are considered as a safe way to remove biofilms. Although the research on SNP interaction with biofilm is still in its early phases, we currently know that removal of biofilm by SNP could occur in three steps: transportation to the vicinity of the biofilm, attachment, and penetration within the biofilm.

 </sup> It has been shown that eradication of biofilms by SNP is not a concentration-dependent process, rather it occurs in a time-dependent manner.

 </sup> The main compounds of ZEO are thymol, a monoterpene phenolic derivative, and its phenol isomer, carvacrol. Both of them contribute to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of Lamiaceae family.

 </sup> Additionally, hydrophobic characteristics of these ingredients allow the penetration of ZEO into outer exopolysaccharide and inner layers of biofilms.

 </sup> In our study, by decreasing the OIC concentration from 1/2OIC to 1/4OIC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), the biofilm removal properties were significantly decreased (

 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) whereas OIC concentration, removed 76% of biofilm mass. For 
 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) the values were 96.46%, 81.50% and 68 % for OIC, 1/2OIC and 1/4OIC concentrations, respectively. It means that combined use of SNP and ZEO boosted biofilm removal potential of both antibacterial compounds against different pathogens. According to Gurunathan et al. (2014), the combined use of NPs and antibiotic such as ampicillin exhibit antibiofilm activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by 55 and 70%, whereas combining those NPs with vancomycin revealed a 75 and 55% reduction of biofilm of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

 </sup> It is worth mentioning that, differences in the method used to evaluate biofilm removal activity and differences in the sensitivity of different bacteria, the age of biofilm and type of surface which biofilm developed could cause different results in the biofilm removal percentage in previous studies.
