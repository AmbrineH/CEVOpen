 </sup> In the current study, MIC/MBC of both SNP and ZEO were 1:1, suggesting a bactericidal effect on 
 <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salm. Typhimurium</italic>. It was demonstrated that oregano EO reveals a synergistic activity with common antibiotics such as gentamicin against some potential pathogens,
