<p> The components identified in ZEO (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) in this study was similar to previous works. According to Saedi Dezaki et al. (2007),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup> the major components of ZEO were thymol (41.81%), carvacrol (28.85%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (5.63-13.16%). In the study of Saei-Dehkordi, et al. (2010),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 </sup> a variation of the major components, thymol (27.5-64.87%), carvacrol (2.7-22.39), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (8.36%) and linalool (0-7.92%) of ZEO were observed, due to the collection of plant material from five main phytogeographic grown towns in Iran. Factors such as growth phase and geographic origin of plant, method of plant drying and processing affect EO content and chemical compositions.
