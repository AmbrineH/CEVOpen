 </sup> a variation of the major components, thymol (27.5-64.87%), carvacrol (2.7-22.39), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (8.36%) and linalool (0-7.92%) of ZEO were observed, due to the collection of plant material from five main phytogeographic grown towns in Iran. Factors such as growth phase and geographic origin of plant, method of plant drying and processing affect EO content and chemical compositions.
