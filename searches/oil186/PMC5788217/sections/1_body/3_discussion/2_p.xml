<p> In our study, the antibacterial properties of ZEO was not different to the results reported from other studies, apart from some detected variable bacterial susceptibilities that may cause the differences in the chemical composition of ZEOs and the bacterial strains used by others. The hydrophobic property of most EOs could increase their permeability and accumulation in the bacterial cell membranes.
