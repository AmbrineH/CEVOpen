<p> Measuring the loss of 260-nm absorbing material from the bacteria is an indicator of cell leakage which could be used to understand the mechanism of action of antimicrobial compounds. The presence of materials with an absorbance at 260 nm in the supernatant of bacterial solution indicates a loss of nucleic acids from the cell. Based on the results of this study (Figures 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the higher values determined by the measurements at 260 nm are an indication for the leakage of bacterial contents which subsequently confirms the physical damages of bacterial cell walls by ZEO.

 </sup> However, the reductions in the efficacy of SNP may be best explained by bacterial blocking caused by higher concentrations of SNP, which could reduce the contact surface of nanoparticles with bacteria and its antibacterial efficacy.
