 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The processes of cell differentiation and somatic embryogenesis are highly dependent on the genetic and chemical composition of plants. Measurement of chemical parameters can be used as a marker to assess somatic embryogenesis [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. Studies suggest that antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and ascorbate peroxidase play an important role in the growth and differentiation of plant cells and tissues and their high activities are associated with cell differentiation process [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. The results of the present study showed that the contents of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase and the percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential in Golestan landrace were significantly higher compared to North Khorasan landrace. Since somatic embryogenesis is heavily dependent on the genotype, one of the factors which are effective in somatic embryogenesis differences among the studied cumin landraces may be significant differences in their chemical compositions [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>, 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">59</a>, 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">60</a>]. Studies have shown that ascorbate peroxidase is required to maintain size and shape of cells during embryogenesis. It also plays an important role in the formation of lignin and protects embryo cell walls [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">61</a>]. Researchers have also stated that variations in the content of antioxidant enzymes correlate with the regeneration of plants [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">32</a>]. It is worth noting that catalase and ascorbate peroxidase have been used as markers to study the developmental stages of somatic embryos and their highest activity level was observed in torpedo stage of the somatic embryogenesis [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. In the present study, Golestan landrace, in addition to antioxidant enzymes, had much more proline and protein. These compositions may be considered as other genetic properties of this landrace which lead to increased somatic embryogenesis in it. It should be mentioned that increased somatic embryogenesis through proteins and amino acids is due to the fact that the compositions easily supply the source of nitrogen for the cell growth [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">35</a>]. Proline plays an important role in somatic embryogenesis and stress conditions in plants [
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">62</a>]. For example, studies have shown that the proline-rich protein is required in the cell wall of
  <span class="italic"> Arabidopsis</span> for correctly placing cell plate during cytokinesis process for embryos development. The carrot cell wall protein has been secreted into the growth medium and regulates somatic embryogenesis development [
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">63</a>]. Researchers observed that protein content of cells in preembryogenesis calluses was higher than that in embryogenic calluses. In fact, as the callus enters somatic embryogenesis stage, its protein level decreases, which indicates protein consumption for somatic embryogenesis development. Studies have shown that cells use their protein content to initiate embryogenesis, so it can be said that the cellular protein content is among genetic properties that lead to increased somatic embryogenesis [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">34</a>]. As somatic embryogenesis initiates and develops, an increase in protein consumption has also been reported in other studies [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. The cultured cells are naturally able to synthesize all their necessary amino acids; however, embryogenesis and regeneration levels in cumin can be increased by adding proline and other amino acids to the culture medium, and this ability can be applied in gene transfer programs [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">35</a>, 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">59</a>]. Results of the essential oil analysis showed that phytochemical profiles of the two landraces of Golestan and North Khorasan have significant differences with each other, which is another confirmation of the existence of genetic differences between them. For example, the number of terpenic hydrocarbons was higher in essential oil of Golestan landrace than that in North Khorasan landrace (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). Researchers have reported that the genetic characteristics are regarded as terpenic hydrocarbons, which could have a positive effect on somatic embryogenesis in plants [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. The results of this study suggest that one of the main factors affecting the occurrence of somatic embryogenesis in Golestan landrace is the phytochemical properties, especially the high terpenic hydrocarbons content. It should be noted that North Khorasan landrace has higher alcoholic and phenolic compositions and these compositions along with other factors may lead to decreased somatic embryogenesis in it. How phenolic compositions affect the induction and development of somatic embryo is not clear yet, but these compositions may be involved in the metabolism of endogenous hormones such as auxin [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Phenolic compositions prevent the growth and development of somatic embryogenesis from going beyond the globular stages. Embryos formed in the presence of phenolic compositions lack sufficient amounts of sucrose to carry out the metabolic activity and thus stop in the globular stage. It should be noted that the inhibitory effect of phenolic compositions due to their high concentration in cells leads to protein deposition, enzyme deactivation, or membrane damage [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">64</a>]. However, in some studies, it has been reported that phenols usually have a reinforcing effect on somatic embryogenesis, but it is possible that phenols interaction with alcohols and other phytochemical compositions of essential oil inhibits their reinforcing effect on embryogenesis. Results of the present study showed that essential oil percentage of North Khorasan was higher than Golestan landrace; however, the difference was not significant. Also, it should be noted that cuminaldehyde content, the most primarily essential oil composition of cumin, was significantly higher in North Khorasan landrace than in Golestan landrace. A high percentage of essential oil and more cuminaldehyde content in North Khorasan landrace may be regarded as two of the factors affecting the lack of its somatic embryogenesis. As no study has been reported on the effect of cuminaldehyde on somatic embryogenesis in cumin, the final decision on this issue requires further studies. Results of the present study showed that variation in the genetic and chemical structure of cumin landraces is among the important factors determining somatic embryogenesis process and can be used as a marker for assessment of occurrence of this process.
