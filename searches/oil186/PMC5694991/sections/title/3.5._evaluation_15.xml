 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Somaclonal variation is a common process in plants cell and tissue culture and was firstly introduced by Larkin and Scowcroft [
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">28</a>]. This process has led to changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes and is of genetic and epigenetic nature [
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">28</a>, 
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">29</a>]. Ten primers were initially used, 7 of which generated informative and reproducible bands (6–10 bands per primer), ranging from approximately 200 to more than 1000 bp in size. The 7 primers generated a total of 52 scorable bands, with an average of 7.4 per primer, which were polymorphic across all the analyzed in vitro regenerated plantlets originating from cotyledons of the mother plant (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). In the present study, RAPD markers suggested polymorphism bands between regenerated plants of Golestan landrace and seed plants (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). It may be said that the variation is associated with the heterozygous nature of the cumin landrace and its pollination system. Some studies suggest somatic variations in plants regenerated from tissue culture and some others suggest genetic stability [
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>–
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Bakhtiar et al. [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>], in their study on the genetic diversity of
  <span class="italic"> Thymus</span> regenerated seedlings and seedlings from mother plant, found that RAPD marker suggests the presence of polymorphism bands among them.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They believed that the observed variation may be related to
  <span class="italic"> Thyme</span> pollination system. They also stated that the optimized protocol for
  <span class="italic"> Thyme</span> regeneration is a useful tool to protect germplasm and it does not seem that interferences have been made in the genetic uniformity of the regenerated plants [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Analysis of
  <span class="italic"> Arabidopsis</span> regenerated using RAPD and RFLP markers indicated the lack of diversity in the DNA profile of regenerated plants [
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>]. Evaluation of somatic variation frequency is valuable for any regeneration system, but the variation has been studied in few regenerated plants [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">43</a>]. Although molecular markers have been used as a molecular tool to evaluate somaclonal variation, with regard to the fact that morphological and cytogenetic diversity cannot be detected at DNA level, there is a little doubt about their effectiveness [
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">29</a>]. In regenerated plants, changes in DNA methylation levels are considered as another source of somaclonal variation. It is believed that the occurrence of somaclonal variation resulting from DNA methylation, especially when auxin is consumed, is more than somatic variation due to changes in the DNA sequence [
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">69</a>, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">70</a>]. It is also well known that increasing numbers of subcultures increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation [
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">70</a>]. Genetic uniformity of produced plants through tissue culture depends on several factors; the most important ones are the propagation method and genotype [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">51</a>, 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. As compared to classical methods of vegetative propagation, the regenerated plants from calluses, depending on the species, origin, and culture age, may show varying amounts of structural or physiological disorders. Although these disorders seem inappropriate at first, since a limited number of the above-mentioned plants have desirable characteristics missing in the main plants, breeders will use this genetic variation in breeding programs [
