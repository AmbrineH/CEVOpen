<p>It is worth noting that, in the first embryogenesis experiment conducted on cumin, the role of cytokinin hormones for the occurrence of this process has been emphasized [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to the results of the present study, although induced calli with embryogenic potential have been observed in other media containing hormone combination of auxin and cytokinin (0.5 mg/L 2,4-D + 0.1 mg/L Kin) or auxin alone (0.5 mg/L 2,4-D), the rate of regeneration in these was significantly lower than that in the medium containing cytokinin (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). It would be worth noting that induced calli with embryogenic potential were also observed in some treatment combinations containing 2,4-D in the present study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This process can be attributed to the key role of auxin in the induction of somatic embryogenesis which can directly or indirectly regulate embryogenesis process through affecting the internal metabolism of other phytohormones [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It should be mentioned that, in the presence of 2,4-D, embryos were not able to pass through the globular stage to heart-shaped stage and then complete embryogenesis. The inhibitory effect of 2,4-D hormone was also reported in other plants belonging to Apiaceae family including carrot and celery [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is worth noting that percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential and the rate of regeneration have decreased in treatment combinations containing higher auxin concentration compared to treatment combinations containing lower auxin concentration (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Higher concentration of auxin hormones in the culture medium resulted in the biosynthesis of hydrocarbons such as ethylene, which results in cells and plant organs getting old. In fact, auxin acts as an effective inducer of somatic embryogenesis whose reduction and omission from the culture medium resulted in developing somatic embryogenesis [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, researchers have recommended prevention from continued exposure to high levels of auxin during the somatic embryogenesis process [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some researchers also believe that sometimes auxin in the culture medium is decomposed through photooxidation and leads to undesirable effects on the effectiveness of somatic embryogenesis through the production of unwanted compositions [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It should be noted that plants in Apiaceae family such as cumin contain high levels of secondary metabolites and endogenous growth regulators, particularly auxin and cytokinins. Therefore, it is possible that high levels of endogenous regulators in the plant have caused the external use of them to be unnecessary [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Valizadeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] have mentioned the occurrence of regeneration in some kinetin-free treatments as reasons for this claim. The researchers believe that the most important factor involved in differences between embryogenic and nonembryogenic cultures is their difference in terms of the level of endogenous hormones because these regulate explants differentiation processes in the media [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In general, factors such as plant genetic properties, type of explants, the explant growth phase, and cells position in plant cultured tissue are effective for their somatic embryogenic ability.
