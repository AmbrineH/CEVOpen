<p>The results suggested that, in terms of protein contents, there was no significant difference between the two landraces of Golestan and North Khorasan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The protein content of cells is regarded as one of the most important factors of cell growth [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Proteins play important physiological roles such as structural and enzymatic roles on the level of cells and it is not possible for cells to continue growing in the long run without these materials. Any factors that inhibit protein synthesis lead to cell growth failure [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results showed that Golestan landrace had higher proline content than North Khorasan landrace (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). In terms of chemical structure, the essential oils are not homogeneous and have different compositions. Dubey et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported significant differences between the Indian landraces of cumin in terms of the amount of essential oil. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3"> Table 3</xref> represents GC-MS profile of essential oil of two studied cumin landraces. The results showed that the identified compounds in their essential oil may be classified into five organic groups including terpenic hydrocarbons, alcohols and phenols, aldehydes, epoxides, and other compositions (
