 <italic class="italic"> Arabidopsis</italic> regenerated using RAPD and RFLP markers indicated the lack of diversity in the DNA profile of regenerated plants [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Evaluation of somatic variation frequency is valuable for any regeneration system, but the variation has been studied in few regenerated plants [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Although molecular markers have been used as a molecular tool to evaluate somaclonal variation, with regard to the fact that morphological and cytogenetic diversity cannot be detected at DNA level, there is a little doubt about their effectiveness [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In regenerated plants, changes in DNA methylation levels are considered as another source of somaclonal variation. It is believed that the occurrence of somaclonal variation resulting from DNA methylation, especially when auxin is consumed, is more than somatic variation due to changes in the DNA sequence [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. It is also well known that increasing numbers of subcultures increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Genetic uniformity of produced plants through tissue culture depends on several factors; the most important ones are the propagation method and genotype [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. As compared to classical methods of vegetative propagation, the regenerated plants from calluses, depending on the species, origin, and culture age, may show varying amounts of structural or physiological disorders. Although these disorders seem inappropriate at first, since a limited number of the above-mentioned plants have desirable characteristics missing in the main plants, breeders will use this genetic variation in breeding programs [
