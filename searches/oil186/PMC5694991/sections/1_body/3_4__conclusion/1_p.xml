<p>Results of this study identified effective factors in somatic embryogenic ability such as plant genetic properties, type of explant, and type and concentration of PGRs and the cotyledon of Golestan landrace in MS + 0.1â€‰mg/L Kin medium was the best treatment. The results also suggested that different developmental stages of somatic embryos were simultaneously observed on a callus with embryogenic potential. This observation suggests that development of somatic embryos is a highly unsynchronized process in cumin. The high content of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, and terpenic hydrocarbons and low contents of alcoholic and phenolic compositions had a positive effect on somatic embryogenesis. Therefore, measurement of these characters may be useful as a marker to predict somatic embryogenesis in cumin. Results suggested that although the cultured cells are naturally able to synthesize all their necessary chemical parameters, modulation of them through manipulation of culture medium may be an effective method to improve somatic embryogenesis in cumin and it can be applied in gene transformation. Band patterns of RAPD markers in regenerated plants were different from those of the seed plants. It may be related to somaclonal variations or impure nature and pollination system of cumin. It should be noted that plant breeders can apply the observed variation of regenerated plants from tissue culture in breeding programs.</p>
