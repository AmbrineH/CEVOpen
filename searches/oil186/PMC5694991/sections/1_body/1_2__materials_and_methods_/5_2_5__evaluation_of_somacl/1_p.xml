<p>Somaclonal variation is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by plant tissue culture. It is particularly common in plants regenerated from callus [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Typical somaclonal variations are the change in chromosome number, chromosome structure, and DNA sequence [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this experiment, genetic homogeneity of the regenerated plantlet as compared to mother plants was examined by RAPD markers. Total genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of the in vitro regenerated cumin and mother plant following the CTAB procedure according to Murray and Thompson [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with minor modifications. Quality and quantity of extracted genomic DNA were checked on 1% agarose gel and spectrophotometer and the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/
 <italic>μ</italic>l. Ten RAPD primers (OPU6, OPU12, OPS17, OPJ18, OPJ19, OPJ21, OPC13, OPC8, OPQ6, and OPF5) were used for DNA amplification [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PCR amplification was performed in a 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l reaction volume containing 9.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l double-distilled water, 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l PCR amplification kit (10x), 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l primer (10 p mol), and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>l DNA (50 ng/
 <italic>μ</italic>l). The amplification program included initial 5 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 30 sec at 35°C, and 2 min at 72°C, with a final extension at 72°C for 8 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized on a UV light transilluminator.
