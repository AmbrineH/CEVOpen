Since the distribution of the recorded data related to measured characters including the percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential and the percentage of plant regeneration was not normal and no transformation was able to induce normality, the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann–Whitney nonparametric tests were used and median grouping was made [
