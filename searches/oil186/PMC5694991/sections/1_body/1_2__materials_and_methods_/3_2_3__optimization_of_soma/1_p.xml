<p class="p">In second set of experiment, the cumin seeds were surface-sterilized following the procedure previously described [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. To obtain plantlets, the sterilized seeds were cultured in the half-strength MS medium and stored in the growth chamber [

One month after seed culturing, when grown plantlets were about 5 cm in height, about 0.5 cm of each explant including hypocotyl and cotyledon was prepared. The prepared explants were cultured in MS medium containing 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar and supplemented with 7 different concentrations of PGRs (2,4-D and Kin) (

The cultured explants were incubated in the growth chamber at 24°C ± 2°C, 75% relative humidity, and dark condition during the first month of culture. After this step, the formed calli were subcultured into fresh mediums containing the previous combination of PGRs and then were stored in the growth chamber at 24°C ± 2°C and 75% relative humidity under 16/8 h photoperiod with 50

Seven weeks after culture, calli images were taken by a camera under the same situations and then perimeter and area of calli were calculated by Digimizer, an image analysis software (version 4.3.1, MedCalc Software, Belgium). In the eighth week, the symptoms of somatic embryogenesis in some of the studied mediums were observed without transferring the calli to the PGRs-free medium; then different stages of the somatic embryogenesis were recorded using a microscope.
