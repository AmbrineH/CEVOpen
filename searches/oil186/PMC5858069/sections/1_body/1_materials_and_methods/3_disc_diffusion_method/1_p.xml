<p>Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was done using the well-plate method. Standard strain 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (ATCC51299) was used for this purpose. After culturing 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in blood agar medium, 0.5 McFarland microbial suspension in saline was prepared. For this purpose, 0.5 mL of 1.175% barium chloride solution was added to 99.5 mL of 1% sulfuric acid. Next, bacterial suspension was streak cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar using a cotton swab. Wells were created in the plate using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and 50 μL of each essential oil was inoculated into the wells. After 15 min, the plates were incubated at 35°C–37°C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was measured by a ruler and reported in millimeters. Gentamycin was used as control in disc diffusion method.
