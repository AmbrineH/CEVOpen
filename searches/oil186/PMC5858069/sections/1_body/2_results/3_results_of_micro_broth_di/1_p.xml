<p>The MIC of PF, ZT, DM, FG, and CHX for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was 2.275, 0.2625, 1.0125, 1.1625 μg/mL, and 1/512, respectively. The MBC of PF, ZT, DM, FG, and CHX for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was resistant (0), 0.525, resistant (0), 1.1625 μg/mL, and 1/128, respectively. The results of MIC showed that ZT had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested essential oils. However, all the four essential oils had lower antibacterial activity than CHX because the essential oils were insoluble in water, so the solution was nonuniform, and PF and DM just inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and not to kill the bacteria.
