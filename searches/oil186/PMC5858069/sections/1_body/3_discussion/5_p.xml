<p class="p">Evaluation of essential oils of plants in our study instead of aqueous or alcoholic extracts evaluated in previous studies was due to the fact that effective compounds (which have antimicrobial activity) have higher concentrations in essential oils than in extracts. Furthermore, it appears that heat negatively affects the antimicrobial efficacy of effective substances in extracts and decreases their antimicrobial properties. Thus, the use of essential oils of plants instead of their extract was a strength of this study.[
