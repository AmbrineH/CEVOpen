 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] Compounds such as alpha-terminal, terpinen-4-ol, and linalool (which have a low concentration in the formulation of essential oils and extracts) have high antimicrobial activity if used in their pure form.[
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] Several studies have reported optimal antibacterial activity of terpinen-4-ol,[
