<p>The MIC and MBC of ZT showed that the antimicrobial activity of ZT against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was greater than that of other plants evaluated in this study. Chitsa 
 <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> essential oil against several bacterial strains and reported that it prevented the growth and proliferation of all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria evaluated in their study. It had the greatest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (with MIC of 25 Î¼g/mL), which was in agreement with our results.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Other studies indicated that 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> extract inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, which was in line with our findings.[

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Behravan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> extract had no effect on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Another study reported significant inhibitory effect of ZT on 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> Gram-positive bacteria. Its effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> oral pathogen was in accordance with our results.[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Ghasemi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the antimicrobial effects of FG and reported significant antibacterial activity of this medicinal plant against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Haghighati 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that DM extract had no antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, or 
 <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, which was in contrast to the findings of the current study, and DM just inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and not to kill the bacteria. This difference may be attributed to different bacterial strains evaluated in the two studies.[
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Abdolbaki 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that DM essential oil had similar antimicrobial effects (MIC = 0.07 mg/mL) 
 <italic>on S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> Gram-positive and 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Gram-negative bacteria, which highlighted the dose-dependent effect of this essential oil. In their study, the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone for 
 <italic>S. aureus, S. marcescens, M. luteus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> due to exposure to DM essential oil in 0.8 mg/disc was 3.8, 3.8, 3.4, and 2.8 mm, which were all smaller than the value obtained in our study for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (1.2 mm).
