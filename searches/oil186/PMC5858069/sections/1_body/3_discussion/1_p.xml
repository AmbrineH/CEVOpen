<p>Different and meaningful antimicrobial activity was found for many of the tested herbal extracts. Despite the available studies on the antibacterial activity of PF, ZT, DM, and FG, their effects on oral and dental pathogens have not been extensively evaluated. This study assessed the antibacterial effects of essential oils of the aforementioned four medicinal plants on 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> using micro-broth dilution and disc diffusion methods. As reported in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, all the four essential oils had antibacterial effects on 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and ZT had the greatest antibacterial activity. Assessment of the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone using disc diffusion method showed higher antibacterial activity of PF and ZT than that of CHX. The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> for PF had a small difference with that of ZT. Similarly, Ozturk and Ercisli indicated that 
 <italic>Z clinopodioides</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. persica</italic> extracts inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms.[

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Since all these species belong to the same family of plants, their findings were in agreement with ours. Another study showed that 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> extract prevented the growth of 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> Gram-negative bacteria. They also found that 
 <italic>Z. clinopodioides</italic> had no significant antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which was different from our study. This difference may be due to differences in plant species and bacterial strains used. Durmaz 
 <italic>et al</italic>. in 2006 and Massumi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 evaluated the antibacterial activity of PF fruit essential oil against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and S. aureus</italic> and reported results similar to those of the current study. The antimicrobial effects of PF on other oral pathogens also confirmed our findings.[
