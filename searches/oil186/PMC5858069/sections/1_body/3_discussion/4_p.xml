<p>This study is believed to be the first to specifically assess the effects of essential oils of PF, ZT, FG, and DM on 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. However, sodium hypochlorite is the standard, most commonly used root canal irrigating solution, and one limitation of this study was that sodium hypochlorite and its MIC and MBC were not evaluated in this study. However, we instead evaluated CHX as the gold standard antimicrobial mouth rinse to somehow compensate for this limitation.
