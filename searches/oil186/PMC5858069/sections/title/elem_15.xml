 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scientific rationale for the study was to find a nonchemical product for the disinfection since, to the best of authors' knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the antibacterial activity of the afore-mentioned four medicinal plants against oral and dental pathogens.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal findings - These herbal essences (Ziziphora) were quite beneficial in prohibiting the selected bacteria 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span>. The antibacterial effects of Ziziphora are similar to the most commercially available mouth rinse (CHX), while CHX has got some side effects such as stating and supra calculus formation, Ziziphora product may have no adverse effects.
