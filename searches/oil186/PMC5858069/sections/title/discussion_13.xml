 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different and meaningful antimicrobial activity was found for many of the tested herbal extracts. Despite the available studies on the antibacterial activity of PF, ZT, DM, and FG, their effects on oral and dental pathogens have not been extensively evaluated. This study assessed the antibacterial effects of essential oils of the aforementioned four medicinal plants on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> using micro-broth dilution and disc diffusion methods. As reported in Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>, all the four essential oils had antibacterial effects on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span>, and ZT had the greatest antibacterial activity. Assessment of the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone using disc diffusion method showed higher antibacterial activity of PF and ZT than that of CHX. The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> for PF had a small difference with that of ZT. Similarly, Ozturk and Ercisli indicated that 
  <span class="italic">Z clinopodioides</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Z. persica</span> extracts inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms.[
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a>] Since all these species belong to the same family of plants, their findings were in agreement with ours. Another study showed that 
  <span class="italic">Z. clinopodioides</span> extract prevented the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> Gram-negative bacteria. They also found that 
  <span class="italic">Z. clinopodioides</span> had no significant antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span>, which was different from our study. This difference may be due to differences in plant species and bacterial strains used. Durmaz 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. in 2006 and Massumi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. in 2007 evaluated the antibacterial activity of PF fruit essential oil against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and S. aureus</span> and reported results similar to those of the current study. The antimicrobial effects of PF on other oral pathogens also confirmed our findings.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIC and MBC of ZT showed that the antimicrobial activity of ZT against 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> was greater than that of other plants evaluated in this study. Chitsa 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. evaluated the antibacterial activity of 
  <span class="italic">Z. clinopodioides</span> essential oil against several bacterial strains and reported that it prevented the growth and proliferation of all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria evaluated in their study. It had the greatest antibacterial activity against 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> (with MIC of 25 Î¼g/mL), which was in agreement with our results.[
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>] Other studies indicated that 
  <span class="italic">Z. clinopodioides</span> extract inhibited the growth of 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. epidermidis</span>, which was in line with our findings.[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] Behravan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. showed that 
  <span class="italic">Z. clinopodioides</span> extract had no effect on 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>. Another study reported significant inhibitory effect of ZT on 
  <span class="italic">B. cereus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> Gram-positive bacteria. Its effect on 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> oral pathogen was in accordance with our results.[
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>] Ghasemi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. evaluated the antimicrobial effects of FG and reported significant antibacterial activity of this medicinal plant against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>.[
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>] Haghighati 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. found that DM extract had no antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">S. mutans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, or 
  <span class="italic">Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</span>, which was in contrast to the findings of the current study, and DM just inhibited the growth of 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> and not to kill the bacteria. This difference may be attributed to different bacterial strains evaluated in the two studies.[
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>] Abdolbaki 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. demonstrated that DM essential oil had similar antimicrobial effects (MIC = 0.07 mg/mL) 
  <span class="italic">on S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. luteus</span> Gram-positive and 
  <span class="italic">Serratia marcescens</span> Gram-negative bacteria, which highlighted the dose-dependent effect of this essential oil. In their study, the mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone for 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus, S. marcescens, M. luteus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">B. cereus</span> due to exposure to DM essential oil in 0.8 mg/disc was 3.8, 3.8, 3.4, and 2.8 mm, which were all smaller than the value obtained in our study for 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> (1.2 mm).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenolic compounds (thymol) and the terpenoids present in plant essential oils have a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">23</a>
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>] Compounds such as alpha-terminal, terpinen-4-ol, and linalool (which have a low concentration in the formulation of essential oils and extracts) have high antimicrobial activity if used in their pure form.[
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>] Several studies have reported optimal antibacterial activity of terpinen-4-ol,[
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a>
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>] 1, 8-cineol,[
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>] and alpha-terpineol.[
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>] Strong inhibitory effects of linalool on 12 bacteria have been documented.[
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>] In addition, the antiseptic and antibacterial activities of DM have been confirmed and are attributed to the presence of citral, geranial, and neural in its composition.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is believed to be the first to specifically assess the effects of essential oils of PF, ZT, FG, and DM on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span>. However, sodium hypochlorite is the standard, most commonly used root canal irrigating solution, and one limitation of this study was that sodium hypochlorite and its MIC and MBC were not evaluated in this study. However, we instead evaluated CHX as the gold standard antimicrobial mouth rinse to somehow compensate for this limitation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of essential oils of plants in our study instead of aqueous or alcoholic extracts evaluated in previous studies was due to the fact that effective compounds (which have antimicrobial activity) have higher concentrations in essential oils than in extracts. Furthermore, it appears that heat negatively affects the antimicrobial efficacy of effective substances in extracts and decreases their antimicrobial properties. Thus, the use of essential oils of plants instead of their extract was a strength of this study.[
