 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study assessed the antibacterial effect of PF, ZT, DM, and FG on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> using broth micro dilution and disc diffusion methods. Tables 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a> show the antimicrobial activity of the four essential oils against 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span>. As observed, all the four essential oils had antibacterial effects on 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> in millimeter (based on the results of disc diffusion test) for PF, ZT, DM, FG, CHX %0.02, and Gentamycin was found to be 23, 25, 12, 18, 21, and 8 mm, respectively. The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zones in the well plate method for ZT showed that it had greater antimicrobial activity against 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> than others. Furthermore, ZT and PF had higher antimicrobial activity than CHX.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of micro-broth dilution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIC of PF, ZT, DM, FG, and CHX for 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> was 2.275, 0.2625, 1.0125, 1.1625 μg/mL, and 1/512, respectively. The MBC of PF, ZT, DM, FG, and CHX for 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> was resistant (0), 0.525, resistant (0), 1.1625 μg/mL, and 1/128, respectively. The results of MIC showed that ZT had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested essential oils. However, all the four essential oils had lower antibacterial activity than CHX because the essential oils were insoluble in water, so the solution was nonuniform, and PF and DM just inhibited the growth of 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> and not to kill the bacteria.
