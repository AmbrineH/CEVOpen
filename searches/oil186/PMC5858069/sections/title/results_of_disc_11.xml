 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> in millimeter (based on the results of disc diffusion test) for PF, ZT, DM, FG, CHX %0.02, and Gentamycin was found to be 23, 25, 12, 18, 21, and 8 mm, respectively. The mean diameter of the growth inhibition zones in the well plate method for ZT showed that it had greater antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> than others. Furthermore, ZT and PF had higher antimicrobial activity than CHX.
