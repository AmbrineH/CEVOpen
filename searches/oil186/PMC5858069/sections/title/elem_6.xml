 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> study the plants were collected from Zanjan City, Iran, identified in the herbarium of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and dried in shade. Essential oils were extracted using the Clevenger apparatus via the distillation method. Analysis of the essential oil was carried out using gas chromatography/mass chromatography.

   <span class="italic">S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</span> strains were obtained and microbiologically approved. Microorganisms were stored in brain–heart infusion broth containing 15% glycerol (v/v) at −80°C. Before the experiment, microbial suspension was transferred to nutrient broth and incubated overnight at 37°C. The turbidity of the inoculum suspension was adjusted at 0.5 McFarland standard concentration to achieve 1.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> colony-forming units/ml. Double-seriated dilution in 0.1% (w/v) suspension of peptan in distilled water in nutrient agar was used to ensure the viability of microorganisms.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disc diffusion method</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was done using the well-plate method. Standard strain 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> (ATCC51299) was used for this purpose. After culturing 
   <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> in blood agar medium, 0.5 McFarland microbial suspension in saline was prepared. For this purpose, 0.5 mL of 1.175% barium chloride solution was added to 99.5 mL of 1% sulfuric acid. Next, bacterial suspension was streak cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar using a cotton swab. Wells were created in the plate using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and 50 μL of each essential oil was inoculated into the wells. After 15 min, the plates were incubated at 35°C–37°C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was measured by a ruler and reported in millimeters. Gentamycin was used as control in disc diffusion method.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oils, micro-broth dilution method was used; 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the essential oils. In addition, 100 μL of fresh culture medium was added to nine wells of each row. These materials were added to the first well to reach a final concentration of 1:200 (v/v) (1 μL of essential oil + 10 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide + 89 μL of the culture medium). Next, 100 μL of the first well was removed and added to the second well and mixed by pipetting up and down ten times. The same was repeated for the next wells and 100 μL of the 7
   <span class="sup">th</span> well was discarded (not added to the 8
   <span class="sup">th</span> well). The 8
   <span class="sup">th</span> well served as the positive control (contained bacteria without essential oils) and the 9
   <span class="sup">th</span> well served as the negative control (without essential oils or bacteria to control for sterility). Next, 100 μL of microbial suspension was added to the 8
   <span class="sup">th</span> well and 100 μL of sterile culture medium was added to the 9
   <span class="sup">th</span> well. Serial dilutions of essential oils (1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, 1:3200, 1:6400, and 1:12800 v/v) were prepared as follows; 100 μL of 0.5 McFarland standard concentration of the microbial suspension was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 18–24 h. Minimum concentration of essential oil with no turbidity was considered as the MIC. For MBCs with this culture (subculture) of transparent tubes (no growth), MIC test was performed and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as the concentration that kills 99.9% or more of the initial inoculation is considered.
