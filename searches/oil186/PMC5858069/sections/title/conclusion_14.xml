 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study indicated significant antibacterial effects of the essential oils of PF, ZT, FG, and DM on E. faecalis. The greatest antimicrobial activity belonged to ZT. PF and DM just inhibited the growth of 
  <span class="italic">E. faecalis</span> and not to kill the bacteria. Considering the optimal biocompatibility and insignificant side effects of these medicinal plants as well as the increased resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, the current study suggests extraction of effective compounds present in the composition of these medicinal plants to further assess their antibacterial activity in the clinical setting.
