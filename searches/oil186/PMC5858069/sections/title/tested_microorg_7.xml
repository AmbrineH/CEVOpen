  <span class="italic">S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</span> strains were obtained and microbiologically approved. Microorganisms were stored in brain–heart infusion broth containing 15% glycerol (v/v) at −80°C. Before the experiment, microbial suspension was transferred to nutrient broth and incubated overnight at 37°C. The turbidity of the inoculum suspension was adjusted at 0.5 McFarland standard concentration to achieve 1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> colony-forming units/ml. Double-seriated dilution in 0.1% (w/v) suspension of peptan in distilled water in nutrient agar was used to ensure the viability of microorganisms.
