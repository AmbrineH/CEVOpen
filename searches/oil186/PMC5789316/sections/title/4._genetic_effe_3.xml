 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evaluation of tocopherol concentration in the oil of different almond cultivars and genotypes showed high variability of the different tocopherol homologues, with a great effect of the environment [
  <a rid="B28-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-antioxidants-07-00006">28</a>]. However, it has been reported that the cultivars “Atocha”, “Desmayo Rojo”, “Desmayo Largueta” from Spain, and “Ferraduel” from France showed stable and similar year to year values for α-tocopherol; whereas “Atocha”, “Ferraduel”, and “Fournat de Brézenaud”, and “Yaltinskij” from Ukraine were also stable for γ-tocopherol content in almond kernels produced under contrasting climatic conditions, with drought and heat conditions in Morocco, and irrigated and cold conditions in Spain [
  <a rid="B36-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-antioxidants-07-00006">36</a>]. These results confirmed that the stability of each tocopherol homologue depends on the specific characteristics of the genotype [

  <a rid="B35-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-antioxidants-07-00006">35</a>]. The estimation of the heritability of the different tocopherols isomers were estimated for the first time in almond [
  <a rid="B35-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-antioxidants-07-00006">35</a>], reporting that the content of γ-tocopherol showed high heritability estimates, with h
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 60.0%, whereas α-tocopherol showed lower heritability (h
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 20.5%). These results confirm that the tocopherol content in almond oil kernel is under polygenic control, as previously suggested [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin E in plants was biochemically elucidated several years ago, and all enzymes in this pathway were localized to the inner chloroplast envelope [

  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC6803, all biosynthetic genes in tocopherol biosynthesis have been identified and cloned to date [

  <a rid="B70-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-antioxidants-07-00006">70</a>]. A mutation in the gene VTE5 (PCT) of 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> lead to the discovery of its function, since it is encoding a protein with phytol kinase activity, directly involved in the biosynthetic pathway of tocopherol [
  <a rid="B70-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-antioxidants-07-00006">70</a>,
  <a rid="B71-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-antioxidants-07-00006">71</a>]. Tocopherol QTL analysis found that up to 65% of the markers were co-located in certain genomic regions of maize, including the candidate genes PDS1 (
  <span class="italic">p</span>-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase; HPPD) and VTE4 (γ-tocopherol methyltransferase; γ-TMT), thus showing that a single QTL may affect more than one tocopherol homologue [
  <a rid="B71-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-antioxidants-07-00006">71</a>]. After exploring mutant inbred lines in sunflower, three loci (
  <span class="italic">m = Tph</span>1, 
  <span class="italic">g = Tph</span>2, and 
  <span class="italic">d</span>) were shown to disrupt synthesis in α-tocopherol production; additionally, the loci losing function in these mutations enhanced synthesis of other tocopherols [
  <a rid="B72-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-antioxidants-07-00006">72</a>]. In almond no studies have been conducted to elucidate the pathway biosynthesis of tocopherol isomers and the genes involved in this process, but, recently, five different QTLs believed to control the tocopherol concentration in the almond kernel oil have been identified [
  <a rid="B73-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73-antioxidants-07-00006">73</a>]. More studies are required to understand the biosynthetic pathway of these biochemicals components to elucidate the gene involved in these pathways. This information will be of great interest for the breeders to improve tocopherol content in the future, since the almond kernel is used more and more in different industrial processes using high temperatures in their application [
