<p class="p">The edible part of the almond nut is the kernel, considered an important food crop with a high nutritional and medicinal value. The oldest and most extensive medical system that first recorded the health uses for almonds derives from ancient Greeks and then the Persians, and later in traditional Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine [

 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Almond consumption has almost doubled in the last 20 years [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], a fact that highlights how this consumption has evolved from a convenient snack food and component of a high number of confectioneries, to an important food which is increasingly recognized as essential for maintaining and increasing human health. Recent nutritional and medical studies have associated the regular consumption of almonds with a wide range of health benefits, including protection from cancer [

Almond kernels may be consumed in many different ways, blanched or unblanched, raw or combined, and/or mixed with other nuts. They can also be transformed to produce marzipan, nougat, almond milk, and almond flour, incorporated in many pastries and ice creams. Almonds may also be combined in other products and gastronomic specialties [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The high nutritive value of almond kernels is mainly due to their high lipid content. This lipid fraction, even constituting an important source of calories, does not contribute to cholesterol formation because of their high level of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly mono-unsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Although almond kernels are high in energy, humans compensate their effect with their high satiety value [
 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The absorption of energy from almond kernels is rather inefficient, having been suggested that their chronic consumption may raise resting energy expenditure [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Acute and longer-term almond ingestion may help in regulating body weight [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], modulating fluctuations of blood glucose [
