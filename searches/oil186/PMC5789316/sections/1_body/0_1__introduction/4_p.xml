<p>Early reviews on the composition of the almond nuts [

 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] did not include tocopherols as an important component of almond kernels. More recently tocopherols were already included in several reviews [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but most of them were primarily descriptive without attempts to assess quality, particularly as it relates not only to industrial requirements, but also to breeding goals and approaches. Extensive variability in the chemical composition has been demonstrated among cultivars; additionally the importance of differences in geographical origins, as well as climatic and growing conditions have also been demonstrated. Despite this extensive information, little is known concerning the genetic control and inheritance of biochemical components of almond quality. For all these reasons, this review summarizes the current knowledge of the almond kernel tocopherol composition and factors affecting its variability.
