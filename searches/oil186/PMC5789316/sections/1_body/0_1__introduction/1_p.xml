<p>Almond is the most important tree nut crop in terms of commercial production [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An adaptation to harsh climates combined with an ability to develop a deep and extensive root system has allowed almond to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Almond is well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and dry, hot summers. This adaptation has led to early bloom and rapid early shoot growth because of the low chilling requirements of almond. Almond also shows high tolerance to summer drought and heat. Almond has traditionally been the earliest temperate fruit tree crop to bloom, which limited growing to areas relatively free from spring frosts before the release of late-blooming cultivars by different breeding programs, since frosts at bloom or early fruit development can reduce, and even completely nullify, the crop. Since almond is naturally self-incompatible, it often requires cross-pollination, which further acts to promote genetic variability and adaptability to diverse environments [
