<p>Almond kernel quality must be high in order to fulfill not only the industry requirements, but also to be attractive for the consumers [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Until recently only the kernel physical traits were considered when trying to establish almond quality [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but the kernel chemical composition appears to be essential when establishing the best raw material for the different industrial applications and the high diversity of almond confectioneries [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In view of the high lipid fraction in the almond kernel, the quality of the almond oil is considered as the most important feature in the evaluation of almond quality. Different parameters related to the lipid fraction have been suggested for quality evaluation of the almond kernels, such as the amount of oil content in the kernel (fat percentage over the kernel dry weight), the percentage of oleic acid of the total fatty acids, the ratio of the percentages of oleic/linoleic acids (O/L), and, especially, the tocopherol concentration in the almond oil [
