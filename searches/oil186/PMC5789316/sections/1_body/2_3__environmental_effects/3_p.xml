<p>Higher tocopherol concentrations were found in almond kernels harvested in years with higher temperatures suggesting that this environmental factor could affect tocopherol synthesis during kernel development [

A study on the effect of two contrasting environments, with drought and heat conditions in Morocco, and irrigated and cold conditions in Spain, concluded that the tocopherol content, mainly of α-tocopherol, increased under the warmer climate conditions of Morocco [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. More recently, higher α-tocopherol concentrations (~646 µg/g in average) were found when the almond kernel development mostly coincided with spring and summer months with warmer mean temperature in a study in arid Northwestern Argentina [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similar results were reported for α-tocopherol in some almond genotypes grown under hot and dry conditions in Afghanistan [

 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Thus, the temperature could be considered an important parameter playing a great role in tocopherol accumulation in different species, including almond.
