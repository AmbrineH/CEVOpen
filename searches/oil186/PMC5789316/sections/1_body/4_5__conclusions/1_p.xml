<p class="p">The present information on the different effects on tocopherol content in almond is scarce. Only descriptive results have been published, not allowing a critical comparison among them, since some results are given as tocopherol content in the almond kernel and others in the kernel oil, not always stating the oil concentration of the almond kernel. Although genetic and environmental effects affecting tocopherol content in almond have been described, no interaction between them has ever been established. The present scenario of climatic change and of the shift of almond growing to warmer regions [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] may have a positive effect on the tocopherol content in almond kernels due to the effect of higher temperatures increasing this content. Consequently, the right cultivar and the most appropriate growing conditions may be selected in order to have almond crops not only allowing a better effective kernel storage, but also holding the most beneficial effects for human nutrition and health with their consumption. The objective of selecting for high tocopherol content in a breeding progeny is easily attainable because of its high heritability, whenever the adequate parents are chosen. As a consequence, these components could be considered as selection criteria in almond breeding programs as already suggested [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. At present the possibilities of selecting cultivars, growing regions, and orchard practices offer an optimistic outlook for increasing tocopherol content in almond.
