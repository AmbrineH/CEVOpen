<p class="p">The evaluation of tocopherol concentration in the oil of different almond cultivars and genotypes showed high variability of the different tocopherol homologues, with a great effect of the environment [

However, it has been reported that the cultivars “Atocha”, “Desmayo Rojo”, “Desmayo Largueta” from Spain, and “Ferraduel” from France showed stable and similar year to year values for α-tocopherol; whereas “Atocha”, “Ferraduel”, and “Fournat de Brézenaud”, and “Yaltinskij” from Ukraine were also stable for γ-tocopherol content in almond kernels produced under contrasting climatic conditions, with drought and heat conditions in Morocco, and irrigated and cold conditions in Spain [
