<p>The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin E in plants was biochemically elucidated several years ago, and all enzymes in this pathway were localized to the inner chloroplast envelope [

 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Today, the availability of complete genome sequences, in particular from 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and 
 <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803, all biosynthetic genes in tocopherol biosynthesis have been identified and cloned to date [

 <xref rid="B70-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. A mutation in the gene VTE5 (PCT) of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lead to the discovery of its function, since it is encoding a protein with phytol kinase activity, directly involved in the biosynthetic pathway of tocopherol [

 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Tocopherol QTL analysis found that up to 65% of the markers were co-located in certain genomic regions of maize, including the candidate genes PDS1 (
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase; HPPD) and VTE4 (γ-tocopherol methyltransferase; γ-TMT), thus showing that a single QTL may affect more than one tocopherol homologue [
 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. After exploring mutant inbred lines in sunflower, three loci (
 <italic>m = Tph</italic>1, 
 <italic>g = Tph</italic>2, and 
 <italic>d</italic>) were shown to disrupt synthesis in α-tocopherol production; additionally, the loci losing function in these mutations enhanced synthesis of other tocopherols [

In almond no studies have been conducted to elucidate the pathway biosynthesis of tocopherol isomers and the genes involved in this process, but, recently, five different QTLs believed to control the tocopherol concentration in the almond kernel oil have been identified [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-07-00006" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. More studies are required to understand the biosynthetic pathway of these biochemicals components to elucidate the gene involved in these pathways. This information will be of great interest for the breeders to improve tocopherol content in the future, since the almond kernel is used more and more in different industrial processes using high temperatures in their application [
