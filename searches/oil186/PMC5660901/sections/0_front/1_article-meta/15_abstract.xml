  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Essential oil is consisting of complex component. It is divided into major and minor component. Therefore, this study aims to examine the distribution of major and minor components on Kaffir lime oil by using fractional distillation. Fractional distillation and distributional analysis of components within fractions have been performed on kaffir lime oil (
   <italic>Citrus hystrix DC</italic>.).

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Fractional distillation was performed by using PiloDist 104-VTU, column length of 2 m (number of plate 120), the system pressure was set on 5 and 10 mBar, while the reflux ratio varied on 10/10, 20/10 and 60/10, and the chemical composition analysis was done by using GC-MS. Chemical composition of the distillated lime oil consisted of mix-twigs and leaves that composed of 20 compounds, with five main components β-citronellal (46.40%), L-linalool (13.11%), β-citronellol (11.03%), citronelyl acetate (6.76%) and sabinen (5.91%).</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The optimum conditions for fractional distillation were obtained at 5 mBar pressure with reflux ratio of 10/10. Components of β -citronellal and L-linalool were distributed in the fraction-1 to fraction 9, hydrocarbon monoterpenes components were distributed only on the fraction-1 to fraction 4, while the oxygenated monoterpenes components dominated the fraction-5 to fraction-9.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The highest level of β-citronellal was 84.86% (fraction-7), L-linalool 20.13% (fraction-5), sabinen 19.83% (fraction-1), and the component level of 4-terpeneol, β-citronellol and sitronelyl acetate respectively 7.16%; 12.27%; 5.22% (fraction-9).</p>
