 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The optimum conditions for fractional distillation were obtained at 5 mBar pressure with reflux ratio of 10/10. Components of Î² -citronellal and L-linalool were distributed in the fraction-1 to fraction 9, hydrocarbon monoterpenes components were distributed only on the fraction-1 to fraction 4, while the oxygenated monoterpenes components dominated the fraction-5 to fraction-9.</p>
