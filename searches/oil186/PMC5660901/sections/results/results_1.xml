  <span class="italic">The chemical composition of kaffir lime oil</span>: analysis results on kaffir lime oil from the data obtained by GC-MS total ionic chromatogram (TIC) is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f0001" href="#f0001">Figure 1</a>. It appears that kaffir lime oil is composed of at least 20 compounds, with five main components, as follows: β-citronellal (46.40%), L-linalool (13.11%), β-citronellol (11.03%), citronelyl acetate (6.76%) and sabinene (5.91%). Some components with only &gt; 1% compund are: β-pinene (1.24%), β-micrene (1.27%), tran-β-ocimene (1.56%), (-)-isopulegol (1.57%), 4-terpeneol (1.52%), cis-Linalol oxide (1.86%), trans-β-caryopilene (1.48%) and nerolidol (1.11%), and the other minor compounds.

  <span class="italic">Profile of kaffir lime oil in fractination distillation process</span>: Kaffir lime oil was composed of oxygenated monoterpene and hydrocarbon monoterpene components that only had a small difference in its boiling point. When the kaffir lime oil was heated, the temperature increased gradually from fraction 1 to fraction-9 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f0002" href="#f0002">Figure 2</a>). The increased fluid temperatures were aligned with the total ionic chromatogram profile. The first fraction (F1) composed of components with a lower molecular mass (boiling point), while the subsequent fractions, such as the F-5 or F-8 was composed of components with a higher boiling point (

  <span class="italic">Optimization of reflux ratio and pressures in the fractional distillation of lime oil</span>: Optimum level of the lime oil main components was generated by the fractional distillation. PiloDist VTU-104 was used as the distillation apparatus, with 120 stages and reflux ratio variation in the reduction of the pressure strength. As the result of the reflux ratio variation, the products partly restored to pass the gray round bottom of the fractionation column, while the other products were collected as distillate. Reflux ratio adjustment on certain fraction was assumed to have capability to produce a significantly increased major component. Early fractions might produce sabinen components at the level of 19.83% (increased by 3 times), β-pinene, β-micren and trans-β-ocimen component, which originally very low in kaffir lime oil, could reach the level of 6.99%, 7.69 % and 7.0% (increased by 5-fold) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research, the determination of optimum pressure for each treatment of fractional distillation system by using PiloDist 104 VTU 120 stages was based on the distribution pattern of the two components level, ß-citronellal and L-linalool. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f0005" href="#f0005">Figure 5</a> showed a graph for the fractional distillation process. Application of optimum conditions in the fractional distillation process, i.e. reflux ratio 20/10 and 5 mbar pressure, was performed to separate the distribution pattern of the two major components, as shown in
