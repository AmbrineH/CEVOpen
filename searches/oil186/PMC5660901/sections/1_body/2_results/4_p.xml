<p class="p">In this research, the determination of optimum pressure for each treatment of fractional distillation system by using PiloDist 104 VTU 120 stages was based on the distribution pattern of the two components level, ÃŸ-citronellal and L-linalool. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> showed a graph for the fractional distillation process. Application of optimum conditions in the fractional distillation process, i.e. reflux ratio 20/10 and 5 mbar pressure, was performed to separate the distribution pattern of the two major components, as shown in
