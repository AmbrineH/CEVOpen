 <italic class="italic">Optimization of reflux ratio and pressures in the fractional distillation of lime oil</italic>: Optimum level of the lime oil main components was generated by the fractional distillation. PiloDist VTU-104 was used as the distillation apparatus, with 120 stages and reflux ratio variation in the reduction of the pressure strength. As the result of the reflux ratio variation, the products partly restored to pass the gray round bottom of the fractionation column, while the other products were collected as distillate. Reflux ratio adjustment on certain fraction was assumed to have capability to produce a significantly increased major component. Early fractions might produce sabinen components at the level of 19.83% (increased by 3 times), β-pinene, β-micren and trans-β-ocimen component, which originally very low in kaffir lime oil, could reach the level of 6.99%, 7.69 % and 7.0% (increased by 5-fold) (
