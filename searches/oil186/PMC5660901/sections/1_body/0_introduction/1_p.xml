<p>Essential oil is a complex composition that consists of tens to hundreds of compounds. Major components that can be identified in the essential oil include oxygenated monoterpenes, hydrocarbons monoterpene, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, carbonylic compounds, phenols, fatty acids and esters [

 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In general, the composition of essential oil is known as secondary metabolites and classified as terpenoids and polipropenoid [

Currently, it has been proven that there are two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes, that is the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) route and allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) route, which produces the two compound groups in plants [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These two biosynthetic routes are known as mevalonate pathway to the terpenoids, while phenylpropanoids derived from shikimate pathway [

 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Researchers argue that there is association between the terpenoid formation with enzyme types and enzymatic reaction mechanisms in biosynthetic processes that involves a variety of reactions, such as hydride shift or methyl group, hydration, protonation, cyclization and isomerization. Genetic modification of metabolic pathways provides some promising results to increase the volatile production, therefore, bacteria, yeast and plants are genetically modified for the production of volatile terpenoids derived from shikimic acid. There are several different explanations about the volatile metabolites production by transgenic microorganisms and genetically modified crops [
