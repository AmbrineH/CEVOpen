 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil is a complex composition that consists of tens to hundreds of compounds. Major components that can be identified in the essential oil include oxygenated monoterpenes, hydrocarbons monoterpene, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, carbonylic compounds, phenols, fatty acids and esters [
  <a rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0001">1</a>]. The chemical composition of essential oil is influenced by several factors, including the level and type of plant species, area, season, temperature, humidity, and other abiotic factors [
  <a rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0003">3</a>]. In general, the composition of essential oil is known as secondary metabolites and classified as terpenoids and polipropenoid [
  <a rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0004">4</a>]. Currently, it has been proven that there are two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes, that is the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) route and allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) route, which produces the two compound groups in plants [
  <a rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0005">5</a>]. These two biosynthetic routes are known as mevalonate pathway to the terpenoids, while phenylpropanoids derived from shikimate pathway [
  <a rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0007">7</a>]. Researchers argue that there is association between the terpenoid formation with enzyme types and enzymatic reaction mechanisms in biosynthetic processes that involves a variety of reactions, such as hydride shift or methyl group, hydration, protonation, cyclization and isomerization. Genetic modification of metabolic pathways provides some promising results to increase the volatile production, therefore, bacteria, yeast and plants are genetically modified for the production of volatile terpenoids derived from shikimic acid. There are several different explanations about the volatile metabolites production by transgenic microorganisms and genetically modified crops [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Researchers conclude that this type of approach can be successfully used to generate the level of terpenoids. However, modification of several groups of these compounds is quite difficult because the terpenoids reservoir precursor may not be sufficient for large production of the desired compound [

  <a rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0010">10</a>]. Behrendorff examined the culture media to identify the genes and the production of limonene by using 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, and use this information to develop a media in limonene biosynthesis process [
  <a rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0010">10</a>]. Terpenoid biosynthesis reaction produces a complex chemical composition of essential oil, both seen from the type of functional group and a carbon skeleton, so almost all kinds of isomer can be found in every type of essential oil. Monoterpenes is the main component of essential oil, whether it is in the form of monoterpenes with open or cyclic carbonic chain. Most of these monoterpenes just have a little difference in the molecular mass and often found as the same isomers. The presence of terpene isomers that have the same structure, physical properties, boiling point, and polarity pushed researchers to develop a method to improve the performance capabilities of GC tool for a quick analysis [
  <a rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0011">11</a>]. Citronellal, geraniol and nerol are the functional isomers of monoterpenoid, while citral is the lemonal from a mixture of terpenoid isomers that is known as the double bond isomers. Citronellal is responsible for the distinctive aroma of lemon, while the geraniol and nerol is the main monoterpenoid alcohol component of rose oil and, palmarosa oil. Isomer is known as geranial or citral A, while the Z-isomer is known as neral or citral B [
  <a rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0012">12</a>]. Z and E configuration difference is caused by the small differences in polarity that affect the strength of interaction between molecules. A number of essential oil components are enantiomers to each other and these compounds only differ in their interaction with polarized light. Enantiomers have identical physical properties, such as boiling point, melting point and spectroscopic spectrum, but it may have different aroma and different taste that can affect the oil quality and also its bioactivity. Results from the enantiomers composition analysis on linalool to 42 types of essential oils by using FSC chiral column with a modified Î³-Cyclodextrine (Lipodex E) showed that there are more (-) linalool than (+) limonene, but both are an active antimicrobial, antifungal and antimalarial [
  <a rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit0013">13</a>]. The purpose of this study is to examine the distribution of major and minor components on each kaffir lime oil fraction by using fractional distillation, that is performed under reduced pressure and adjusted reflux ratio.
