 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modeling Spatial Distribution of Argania Spinosa under a Changing Climate</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan trees (
  <span class="italic">Argania spinosa</span>) provide many functions and ecosystem services and are an important source of income for local people. The main source of income results from fruit production from which a highly valuable oil is extracted. Current production of oil exceeds 4000 T/year. Most of the Argan populations are located in regions characterized by water scarcity and vulnerability to desertification and that will strongly be impacted by climate change. As a result, the impact on the future Argan distribution in response to climate change should be assessed. Such understanding is valuable for prioritizing short and long-term management efforts, and is very useful for supporting decisions in order to ensure a sustainable production of Argan oil.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the relation between bioclimatic variables and changes in Argan distribution, species distribution models (SDM) were used. A Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt) algorithm was chosen to link species locations with environmental characteristics in order to predict species occurrence likelihood and to assess the contribution of each environmental variable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The output from this study is a continuous probability map showing the current and predicted areas suitable for Argan trees in Morocco under different climate change scenarios. The relative contribution of each covariate to the model showed that the coldest quarter and wettest month, in addition to temperature seasonality, contribute significantly to explain the spatial distribution of Argan trees.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a predefined threshold, the area suitable for Argan trees distribution seems to be highly dependent on climate change with a considerable decrease in extent. Some new areas may become suitable for Argan trees in the north of the current area. However, these gains are projected to be small, since larger regions located in the southern part of the country will become less suitable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The conclusions from this analysis may contribute to improve management strategies in order to conserve the valuable ecosystem and to improve the production of Argan oil. We suggest conservation actions in the impacted areas and tree planting in regions that may become highly suitable in the future.</p>
