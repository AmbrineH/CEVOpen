 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fine-Tuning of Argan Oil Concentrations for a Better Liquid Storage of Boujaâd Ram Semen</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan seed oil (ARO) is harvest from 
  <span class="italic">Argania spinosa (L.)</span> known as an endemic tree to Morocco and known worldwide for its oil. This oil is extremely rich in unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) as well as in phenolic acids (vanillic acid, ferulic acid and syringic acid. With caracteristics). The two last components could give to this oil a beneficial role in liquid storage of ram semen. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate effects of different concentration of argan oil (ARO) on spermatologic parameters, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation during ram semen liquid storage. Also, effects of extenders and temperature on the same parameters were assessed. Semen samples were collected from Boujaâd rams, extended with Tris egg yolk or skim milk extenders without (control) or supplemented with different concentrations of ARO (1, 2, 5 and 10% 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) at a final concentration of 0.8 × 10
  <span class="sup">9</span> sperm/mL and stored at 5 °C or 15 °C. The sperm quality assessments were performed at different intervals during storage (0, 8, 24 and 48 h). Sperm progressive motility started to decrease after 8 h of storage in all temperatures—extenders combinations and dropped steadily during the 8–48 h interval. However, sperm viability, progressive motility and membrane integrity were markedly higher in ARO groups (especially in 1% in Tris and 5% in skim milk) until 24 h and 48 h storage at both temperatures compared to controls. The argan oil also decreased the level of spontaneous and induced malondialdehyde (MDA) and the sperm DNA fragmentation until 48 h of storage. In conclusion, argan oil is able to maintain a better quality of ram semen during liquid storage. Moreover, depending on the extender and storage temperature the usage of precise concentrations of argan oil may last storage period. Future studies should aim at determining the exact component of argan oil which is responsible of all improvements recorded in this study.
