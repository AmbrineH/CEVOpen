 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan Oil and Clove Essential Oil Improves Biochemical and Histological Change by Reducing Oxidative Stress Induced by Hydrogen Peroxide in Wistar Rats</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defenses of the organism, There is a very strong relation between the increase in oxidative stress and the appearance of diseases like cancer and diabetes .This study aims to evaluate the protective effect of argan oil and clove (
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span>) essential oil on oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>) in wistar rats, for these reasons the antioxidant content of argan oil and clove essential oil was studied. Rats were randomly divided into six groups (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), three groups were kept as control and received (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water or clove essential oil prepared in argan oil with the concentration of (100 mg/kg b.w), or argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w), the other three groups received daily by gavage 1% of hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>) (10 mL/kg b.w) and (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water or clove essential oil prepared in argan oil with the concentration of (100 mg/kg b.w), or argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w). At the end of the study Biochemical parameters and histological studies were performed. Results indicated that the group which is treated with argan oil supplemented with clove essential oil is the most protected group against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide.
