 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a long time, the plant kingdom has provided man with the essential resources for his food, his hygiene and health. Propolis is a natural product derived from plant resins and collected by honeybees (workers) to be used as glue and as draught-extruder for bee hives. It is currently used as an ingredient of biopharmaceuticals, candies and as aconstituent of cosmetics, or as a popular alternative medicine for self-treatment of various diseases.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this work was to determine the antioxydant activity and the nefroprotective effect of ethanolic extract of propolis following treatment with ultravist. To do so, 30 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 rats: group I received orally distilled water at a dose of 1 mL/100 g body weight. This group served as a control. Group II received orally 250 mg/Kg /bodyweight of EEP. Group III received intravenous injection of a single dose of D1 ultravist the 8th day (2 mL/Kg/ bodyweight). Group IV received intravenous injection of a single dose D2 ultravist the 8th day (4 mL/Kg/ bodyweight). Group V was pre-treated with EEP (250 mg/kg PO) 7 days prior to exposure to ultravist (2 mg/kg of bodyweight) and 3 days after. Group VI was pre-treated with EEP (250 mg/kg) 7 days prior to exposure to ultravist (4 mg/kg body weight) and 3 days after.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that pretreatment with ethanolic extract of propolis leads to a recovery of the basal levels of the key enzymes of the liver function. This result suggests that EEP pretreatment prevents the nephrotoxic effect induced by ultravist. Hence it is proposed to adopt a preventive strategy in the hospital setting.</p>
