 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the phytochemical characterization and antibacterial activity of 
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinalis</span> essential oil against bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phytochemical characterization of essential oil was evaluated using gaschromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometeranalysis. Antibacterial activity of the oil was tested against four bacterial strainsresponsible for nosocomial infections: 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter koseri</span> using disc diffusion method.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirty three components were identified representing 89.30% of the total oilcomposition. The yield of essential oil was 0.4% and the predominant components were citronellal (14.40%), isogeraniol (6.40%), geraniol acetate (10.20%), nerol acetate (5.10%), caryophyllene (8.10%) and b-caryophyllene oxide (11.00%).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antibacterial activity of the oil showed the higher activity against all bacterial strains tested. The essential oil extracted from lemon balm can be used to clean theenvironment of reanimation polyvalent and anaesthesia service.</p>
