  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does Argan Dietary Uptake Reverses Memory Impairment Processes in Wistar Rats?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argania spinosa (Argan) and Baillonella toxisperma (Moabi) belong to the class of Sapotaceae. The entire tree is used in African traditional medicine, especially in the Moroccan and Cameroonian pharmacopeia. The fruits seeds of these trees are consumed as food or used as cosmetic products. Their oils are rich in Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), this component plays essential roles in brain functions, including brain plasticity and memory processes. In this context, the purpose of this work was to study the effect of PUFA supplementation on short and long term memory processes. The Acute oral toxicity studies were carried out according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline No. AOT-425 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate toxicity and to determine the minimum lethal dose of the used oils. A total of 20 adult male rats, weighed (170 ± 6) g, were randomly divided into three groups: (1) T: control groups, (2) Moa 750: groups received Moabi oil at 750 mg/kg, (3) Arg 750: groups received Argan oil at 750 mg/kg. The animals were kept under treatment for 1 month. An object recognition task was used to evaluate the short and long term memory. The Time spent exploring each object was recorded. Intact memory for the familiar object was demonstrated if the rat exhibited a “preference” for the novel object in the choice phase. A preference was indicated if the rat spent more time than chance with the novel object. The results showed that, at a dose level of 2000 mg/kg, neither mortality nor any clinical signs of toxicity were observed. The Moa750 was associated with a significant alteration in short and long term memory tested in memory tasks compared to the control rat, in contrast the administration of Argan oil into rats improved their memory impairment.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan Oil and Clove Essential Oil Improves Biochemical and Histological Change by Reducing Oxidative Stress Induced by Hydrogen Peroxide in Wistar Rats</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defenses of the organism, There is a very strong relation between the increase in oxidative stress and the appearance of diseases like cancer and diabetes .This study aims to evaluate the protective effect of argan oil and clove (
   <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span>) essential oil on oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>) in wistar rats, for these reasons the antioxidant content of argan oil and clove essential oil was studied. Rats were randomly divided into six groups (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), three groups were kept as control and received (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water or clove essential oil prepared in argan oil with the concentration of (100 mg/kg b.w), or argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w), the other three groups received daily by gavage 1% of hydrogen peroxide (H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>) (10 mL/kg b.w) and (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water or clove essential oil prepared in argan oil with the concentration of (100 mg/kg b.w), or argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w). At the end of the study Biochemical parameters and histological studies were performed. Results indicated that the group which is treated with argan oil supplemented with clove essential oil is the most protected group against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The silicon application is considered as an alternative approach to alleviate salinity stress and to improve yield and quality in plants. Thus, an experiment was conducted with Black cumin (
   <span class="italic">Nigella sativa</span> L.) cultivar seeding in pots, under semi-controlled greenhouse conditions in order to determine the silicon effect on total phenols, leaf proline, relative water content (RWC), and dry matter accumulation. The experimental design was an aleatoire complete block (ACB) with three repetitions. Three salinity levels of water irrigation (0, 50 and 100 Mm) were applied. The Results of one way ANOVA test showed a significant increase of leaf proline content, Na+ concentration and a significant decrease of dry matter and RWC in salt conditions, whereas, the application of silicon increased the total phenols content as well as the biometric plants parameters in the same salt conditions. As a conclusion, application of silicon reduced the adverse effect of salinity of black cumin and gives more quality of the product.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nanoparticle-Based Assay for the Detection of Virgin Argan Oil Adulteration and Its Rapid Quality Evaluation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan oil is produced from the fruits of the argan (Argania spinosa), a species of tree endemic to south-western Morocco and protected by UNESCO. The resulting oil is slightly darker than olive oil and has a reddish tinge. It is well known for its cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutritional virtues. Of particular impor- tance are its rich aroma and nutty flavour, which make this oil an exotic ingredient around the world. Recently, it was shown that the geographical origin of the argan fruit and the extraction method used to produce the oil have a considerable influence on its physicochemical composition and characteristics. A new method, based on the formation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and spectrophotometric analysis, is proposed to determine total phenolic acids in virgin argan oil samples. These compounds have reducibility due to the presence of the phenol group in their molecular structure, and a redox reaction occurs in the presence of HAuCl4. The formation of AuNPs as a result of the redox reaction leading to colour changes can be visually observed, resulting in strong light signals that show absorption at 555 nm. As ferulic acid represents more than 95% of the total phenolic acid content of virgin argan oil, this compound was used as an adulteration marker to carry out the screening of samples for the evaluation of the authenticity of virgin argan oils. The analytical features of this screening method also allowed a low precision quantization of the quality of the product. Then, a reference HPLC-DAD/FD method was used to confirm the potential adulterated samples, as well as to provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the most representative phenolic compounds in the samples. The overall screening-confirmation strategy was validated by analysing pure virgin argan oil samples and argan oil samples adulterated with other commercial vege- table oils, demonstrating the reliability of the results. This approach is characterised by its simplicity, low cost, rapid information and responded to practical laboratories needs.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fine-Tuning of Argan Oil Concentrations for a Better Liquid Storage of Boujaâd Ram Semen</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan seed oil (ARO) is harvest from 
   <span class="italic">Argania spinosa (L.)</span> known as an endemic tree to Morocco and known worldwide for its oil. This oil is extremely rich in unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) as well as in phenolic acids (vanillic acid, ferulic acid and syringic acid. With caracteristics). The two last components could give to this oil a beneficial role in liquid storage of ram semen. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate effects of different concentration of argan oil (ARO) on spermatologic parameters, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation during ram semen liquid storage. Also, effects of extenders and temperature on the same parameters were assessed. Semen samples were collected from Boujaâd rams, extended with Tris egg yolk or skim milk extenders without (control) or supplemented with different concentrations of ARO (1, 2, 5 and 10%

   <span class="sup">9</span> sperm/mL and stored at 5 °C or 15 °C. The sperm quality assessments were performed at different intervals during storage (0, 8, 24 and 48 h). Sperm progressive motility started to decrease after 8 h of storage in all temperatures—extenders combinations and dropped steadily during the 8–48 h interval. However, sperm viability, progressive motility and membrane integrity were markedly higher in ARO groups (especially in 1% in Tris and 5% in skim milk) until 24 h and 48 h storage at both temperatures compared to controls. The argan oil also decreased the level of spontaneous and induced malondialdehyde (MDA) and the sperm DNA fragmentation until 48 h of storage. In conclusion, argan oil is able to maintain a better quality of ram semen during liquid storage. Moreover, depending on the extender and storage temperature the usage of precise concentrations of argan oil may last storage period. Future studies should aim at determining the exact component of argan oil which is responsible of all improvements recorded in this study.
