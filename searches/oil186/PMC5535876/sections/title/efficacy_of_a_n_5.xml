 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy of a New Pharmaceutical Formulation of Melatonin in Preventing Aging Skin Damage</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, has been detected in multiple extrapineal organ tissues at much higher concentrations than in the pineal gland. It is a potent free radical scavenger with anti-oxidant properties, which increases the expression and activity of endogenous antioxidant. This special class of antioxidant generates a series of metabolites that are also free radical scavengers when scavenging free radicals. Capable of crossing cell membranes and of easily reaching all cell compartments, it is taken up by mitochondria and can maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in different experimental models. Melatonin has also important anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, we have developed a pharmaceutical preparation of melatonin plus other molecules for the treatment and prevention of skin aging. The success of this preparation is that the composition facilitates their transdermal adsorption, reaching both molecules all skinâ€™s layers. Moreover, the combination of both molecules increases their take up by the mitochondria in all skin cells. The advantage of our product is that not only reverse the mitochondrial damage produced during cellular aging but also in many pathologies coursing with mitochondrial impairment.</p>
