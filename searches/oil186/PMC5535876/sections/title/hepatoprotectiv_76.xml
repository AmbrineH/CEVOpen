 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural substances are becoming increasingly important in therapeutics, propolis constitutes a real chemical plant from which the maximum profit must be taken for the well-being of the population. Has wide range of biological activities which include antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer properties and hepatorenale protective effect.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study we were interested in elucidating the hepatoprotective effect of the ethanol extract of propolis following treatment with ultravist contrast agent. 20 rats were used in this experiment, Towards the end of the surgical stage, the rats receive via the jugular vein an infusion with a physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), with a constant flow rate of 25 uL/min/100 g BW. Administrations were performed in all groups as follows : group I received the same perfusion (physiological saline) from start to end of experiment ; group II received during the experimental period (E) the solution of ultravist with a dose of 2 mL/1000 g BW ; group III received during the period (E) extracted from propolis solubilized in physiological water at the dose of 250 mg/10 mL of physiological water ; group IV received EE (250 mg/10 mL) for one hour followed by ULT at the dose of 2 mL/1 Kg PC during the experimental phase (E).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Intravenous infusion of rats during the experimental phase by ultravist at a dose of 2 mL/kg BW resulted in a net and significant increase in ALAT, ASAT, LDH and PAL at the plasma level (65.55 ± 3.75 (u/L), 70.33 ± 5.10 (u/L), 698.23 ± 11.09 (u/L), 360.67 ± 11.12 (u/L) respectively, whereas the group of rats pretreated with EEP subsequently perfused by ultravist at the Same dose, almost restored the normal plasma levels of these key enzymes of liver function.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the bolus injected EEP has a remarkable hepatoprotective effect, in addition the extract of this product attenuates the toxicity induced by the contrast products, including ultravist.</p>
