 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Protective Effect of Argan Virgin Oil on Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Induced Toxicity and Oxidative Stress in Wistar Rats</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are used in widespread applications, such as, drug additives, cosmetics, paints, paper, inks, sun-screens, electronics and food. The main factor in the toxicity of nanoparticles is its size which is very small and which makes it capable of inducing damage even at the level of the DNA. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of argan virgin oil on titanium dioxide nanoparticles toxicity.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rats were randomly divided into four groups (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5), tree groups are controls the first one received (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water , the second exposed to (TiO2NPs) (200 mg/kg b.w) by gavage and the third received (10 mL/kg b.w) of argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w), whereas the last group is the group which is treated by the co-administration of argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w) and (TiO2NPs) (200 mg/kg b.w) for 3 weeks. Serum protein, albumin levels and transaminases (AST, ALT), ALP activities were determined, Lipid profile, urea, Creatinine, and histological changes was investigated. The obtained results indicate that the majority of the analyzed parameters were protected against the toxicity of (TiO2NPs) in the group treated with argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our findings show that the consumption of virgin argan oil has a protective effect against the toxicity induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles.</p>
