 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary Phytochemical Screening and Evaluation of Hypolipidemic Activity of the Aerial Part of Aqueous Extract of Tamarix Articulata Vahl</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objective of this study was to evaluate the hypolipidemic activity of aqueous extract of 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> in normal and streptozotocin-induced rats. Phytochemical screening as well as polyphenol and flavonoid contents in aqueous extract of T. articulate were evaluated. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plasma concentrations of Total cholesterol, Triglycerides and High-Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) were measured in STZ-diabetic and normal rats previously treated by aqueous extract of 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> (5 mg/kg of body weight). Total phenolic content of the aqueous extract was determined by Folin Ciocalteu method. Concerning flavonoids content, the colorimetric AlCl3 method was used. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A single oral administration in diabetic rats showed a significant increase in the HDL-cholesterol after 6 hours of treatment with 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> (5 mg/kg). The results demonstrated also that the aqueous extract of 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> produced a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol on repeated oral administration in streptozotocin diabetic rats (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, plasma HDL-cholesterol levels were increased significantly after 7 days of treatment with 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> aqueous extract were 102.5 mg EAG/g of extract and 54.83 mg EQ/g of extract, respectively. According to preliminary phytochemical screening of aerial part of 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> several classes of chemicals have been found such as polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, cyanidins (flavones, catecols), mucilage, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids and carbohydrates. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that 
  <span class="italic">T. articulata</span> aqueous extract exhibits hypolipidemic potential.
