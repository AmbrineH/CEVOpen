<p>In this work we attempt to establish a quantitative structure-activity relationship for antioxidant activity by studying a series of flavonoid compounds. We accordingly propose a quantitative model, and we try to interpret the activity of the compounds and predict the antioxidant activities of the phenolic compounds present in argan oil such us alpha tochoferol, gamma tochoferol and delta tochoferole relying on the multivariate statistical analyses. Also we attempt to validate the antioxidant activity of these compounds by docking study against cyclooxygenase-2 target (4COX) to predict and compare the conformations of ligands and orientations of binding properties of compounds. </p>
