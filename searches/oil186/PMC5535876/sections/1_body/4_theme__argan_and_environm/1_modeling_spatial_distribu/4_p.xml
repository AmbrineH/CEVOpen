<p>The output from this study is a continuous probability map showing the current and predicted areas suitable for Argan trees in Morocco under different climate change scenarios. The relative contribution of each covariate to the model showed that the coldest quarter and wettest month, in addition to temperature seasonality, contribute significantly to explain the spatial distribution of Argan trees.</p>
