<p class="p">We have tested here the effects of the addition of polyphenols extracted from argan oils from different uses (edible oil, cosmetic oil and beauty oil), to whole blood cultures where an inflammatory response was triggered by means of chemical inductors. Two types of patients were assayed: healthy patients and diabetics, as the later group has been described to develop subclinical inflammatory reactions. Three key markers were analysed in plasma samples after culture by using Western blotting approaches: presence of iNOS and IL-1Î², and finally the plasma SDS-PAGE profiles relatives to protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine, as a marker of inflammation and NO production. </p>
