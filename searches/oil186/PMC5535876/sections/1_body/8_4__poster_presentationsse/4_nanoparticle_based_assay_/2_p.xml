<p>Argan oil is produced from the fruits of the argan (Argania spinosa), a species of tree endemic to south-western Morocco and protected by UNESCO. The resulting oil is slightly darker than olive oil and has a reddish tinge. It is well known for its cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutritional virtues. Of particular impor- tance are its rich aroma and nutty flavour, which make this oil an exotic ingredient around the world. Recently, it was shown that the geographical origin of the argan fruit and the extraction method used to produce the oil have a considerable influence on its physicochemical composition and characteristics. A new method, based on the formation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and spectrophotometric analysis, is proposed to determine total phenolic acids in virgin argan oil samples. These compounds have reducibility due to the presence of the phenol group in their molecular structure, and a redox reaction occurs in the presence of HAuCl4. The formation of AuNPs as a result of the redox reaction leading to colour changes can be visually observed, resulting in strong light signals that show absorption at 555 nm. As ferulic acid represents more than 95% of the total phenolic acid content of virgin argan oil, this compound was used as an adulteration marker to carry out the screening of samples for the evaluation of the authenticity of virgin argan oils. The analytical features of this screening method also allowed a low precision quantization of the quality of the product. Then, a reference HPLC-DAD/FD method was used to confirm the potential adulterated samples, as well as to provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the most representative phenolic compounds in the samples. The overall screening-confirmation strategy was validated by analysing pure virgin argan oil samples and argan oil samples adulterated with other commercial vege- table oils, demonstrating the reliability of the results. This approach is characterised by its simplicity, low cost, rapid information and responded to practical laboratories needs.</p>
