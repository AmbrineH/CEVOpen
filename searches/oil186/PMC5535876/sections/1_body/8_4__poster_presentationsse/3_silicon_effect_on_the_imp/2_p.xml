<p class="p">The silicon application is considered as an alternative approach to alleviate salinity stress and to improve yield and quality in plants. Thus, an experiment was conducted with Black cumin (
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> L.) cultivar seeding in pots, under semi-controlled greenhouse conditions in order to determine the silicon effect on total phenols, leaf proline, relative water content (RWC), and dry matter accumulation. The experimental design was an aleatoire complete block (ACB) with three repetitions. Three salinity levels of water irrigation (0, 50 and 100 Mm) were applied. The Results of one way ANOVA test showed a significant increase of leaf proline content, Na+ concentration and a significant decrease of dry matter and RWC in salt conditions, whereas, the application of silicon increased the total phenols content as well as the biometric plants parameters in the same salt conditions. As a conclusion, application of silicon reduced the adverse effect of salinity of black cumin and gives more quality of the product.
