<p>Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, has been detected in multiple extrapineal organ tissues at much higher concentrations than in the pineal gland. It is a potent free radical scavenger with anti-oxidant properties, which increases the expression and activity of endogenous antioxidant. This special class of antioxidant generates a series of metabolites that are also free radical scavengers when scavenging free radicals. Capable of crossing cell membranes and of easily reaching all cell compartments, it is taken up by mitochondria and can maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in different experimental models. Melatonin has also important anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
