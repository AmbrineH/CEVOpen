<p>Recently, we have developed a pharmaceutical preparation of melatonin plus other molecules for the treatment and prevention of skin aging. The success of this preparation is that the composition facilitates their transdermal adsorption, reaching both molecules all skinâ€™s layers. Moreover, the combination of both molecules increases their take up by the mitochondria in all skin cells. The advantage of our product is that not only reverse the mitochondrial damage produced during cellular aging but also in many pathologies coursing with mitochondrial impairment.</p>
