<p class="p">Our recent preclinical cancer data indicate that active argan oil composition displayed cytotoxic activity, when optimally formulated in a pharmaceutical nanoemulsion (NE) platform. Enhanced inhibitory effect on the proliferation of model cancer cell lines was achieved via the incorporation of active TPGS in the emulsification of argan oil NE, suggesting a cooperative role of tocopherols along with other core active oil compounds, contributing to augmented inhibition of cancer growth.</p>
