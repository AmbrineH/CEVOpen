<p>The unique quality of poly-unsaturated fatty acids contained in argan oil (Argania spinosa), in addition to the abundance of active compounds (e.g., sterols, carotenoids, xanthophyls, and potent antioxidants) in the un-saponifiable fraction indicate marked potential nutritional benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. As poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have demonstrated synergism with both radio- and chemo-therapy, in solid and haematological tumors, tocopherols and saponins derived from A. spinosa exerted evident anti-proliferative effect, both in vitro and in vivo. Within past few years, the succinate ester form of α-tocopherol, 
 <sc>d</sc>-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), a common surfactant in various nanocarriers, has received notable attention for its pro-apoptotic activity against cancer, not normal, cells.
