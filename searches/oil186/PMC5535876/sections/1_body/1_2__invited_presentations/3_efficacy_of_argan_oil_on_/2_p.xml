<p class="p">Argan Oil is produced from kernel fruit of argan tree that is endemic in Morocco. The oil is used in traditional cuisine and also in traditional medicine to treat some skin and joint pain issues. 99% of argan oil composition is made of triglycerides (45% of oleic acid and 34% of linoleic acid), whereas the remaining 1% contains very active biological compounds such as Vitamine E, Caroteno√Øds, Sterols and Polyphenols. The above composition of argan oil is behind the many health benefits that are described in the literature, mainly on the cardiovascular system, pain-associated osteoarthritis and other metabolic parameters. In the present work, we report data on the improvement of clinical and metabolic parameters in patients upon argan oil consumption. </p>
