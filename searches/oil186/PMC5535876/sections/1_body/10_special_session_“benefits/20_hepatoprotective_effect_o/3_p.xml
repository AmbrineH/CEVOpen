<p class="p">In the present study we were interested in elucidating the hepatoprotective effect of the ethanol extract of propolis following treatment with ultravist contrast agent. 20 rats were used in this experiment, Towards the end of the surgical stage, the rats receive via the jugular vein an infusion with a physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), with a constant flow rate of 25 uL/min/100 g BW. Administrations were performed in all groups as follows : group I received the same perfusion (physiological saline) from start to end of experiment ; group II received during the experimental period (E) the solution of ultravist with a dose of 2 mL/1000 g BW ; group III received during the period (E) extracted from propolis solubilized in physiological water at the dose of 250 mg/10 mL of physiological water ; group IV received EE (250 mg/10 mL) for one hour followed by ULT at the dose of 2 mL/1 Kg PC during the experimental phase (E).</p>
