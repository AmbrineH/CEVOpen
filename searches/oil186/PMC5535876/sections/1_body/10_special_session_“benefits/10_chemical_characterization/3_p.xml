<p>The present study was firstly undertaken to determine the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation and to evaluate its antimicrobial effect. The chemical composition was analyzed by a GC/MS system and a total of constituents were identified representing about 86.80% of total oil. The antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> essential oil against microbial strains was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition, and MIC values. The studied essential oil exhibited an inhibition against the majority of tested bacteria and was found to be more active against Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) than Gram-negative ones (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella Typhi</italic>).
