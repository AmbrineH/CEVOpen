<p>A single oral administration in diabetic rats showed a significant increase in the HDL-cholesterol after 6 hours of treatment with 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> (5 mg/kg). The results demonstrated also that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> produced a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol on repeated oral administration in streptozotocin diabetic rats (

 <italic>T. articulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> aqueous extract were 102.5 mg EAG/g of extract and 54.83 mg EQ/g of extract, respectively. According to preliminary phytochemical screening of aerial part of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> several classes of chemicals have been found such as polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, cyanidins (flavones, catecols), mucilage, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids and carbohydrates.
