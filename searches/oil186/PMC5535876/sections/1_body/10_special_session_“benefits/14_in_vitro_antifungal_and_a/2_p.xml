<p>In vitro antifungal and antioxidant activities of essential oil, methanol and ether extracts and anticorrosive activity of essential oil of 
 <italic>Pulicaria mauritanica</italic> (Asteraceae) harvested in the oasis of Tata of south-East of Morocco were investigated. Essential oil was extracted using hydrodistillation method; methanol and ether extracts were obtained using soxhlet apparatus. Essential oil showed a strong inhibition of 
 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> mycelium growth (100% at 700 ppm); ether extract gave 46.212 ± 1.543% of inhibition at 30,000 ppm, while methanol extract exhibited no activity against 
 <italic>P. digitatum</italic>. Methanol extract showed a strong reduction of DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.027 ± 0.004 mg/mL), while essential oil and ether extract exhibited median reduction of DPPH, IC
 <sub>50</sub> are successively 0.080 ± 0.005 mg/mL and 0.123 ± 0.0006 mg/mL. Phytochemical investigation of studied organic extracts showed that polyphenolic compounds constitute the major compounds of it. Linear correlation between total polyphenols and total flavonoids contents and antioxidant capacity was obtained; the correlation was positive
