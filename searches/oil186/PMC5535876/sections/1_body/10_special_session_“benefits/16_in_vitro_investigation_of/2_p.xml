<p class="p">The aim of the present study is to examine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of three thyme varieties grown in southeastern Morocco. The antioxidant activity was performed using ABTS assay. In vitro anti-inflammatory assay was also studied through the evaluation of membrane stabilization effect, inhibition of protein denaturation and inhibition of protease activity. The result showed that all varieties possess three important antioxidant activities: 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus Atlanticus</italic> (IC 
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 16.59 ± 0.32 μg/mL), 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus Zygis</italic> (IC 
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 15.65 ± 0.74 μg/mL), 
 <italic class="italic">and Thymus Satureioides</italic> (IC 
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 15, 48 ± 0.35 μg/mL). Concerning the anti-inflammatory activity and based on the results of the in vitro assays used in this study, the highest anti-inflammatory effect was depicted in 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus atlanticus</italic> followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus zygis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus satureioides.</italic> The findings of this survey may partly explain the use of those plants in the Moroccan traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
