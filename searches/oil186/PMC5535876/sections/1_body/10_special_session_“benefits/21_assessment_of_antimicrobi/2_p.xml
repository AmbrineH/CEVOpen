<p class="p">The objective of this study is to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Pulicaria mauritanica</italic> essential oil (EO) against three referenced pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923) and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) and a yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> using the paper disc diffusion and the macro-dillution in liquid medium methods. The results obtained by the first method indicate that this EO showed a strong antimicrobial activity against three strains tested, which 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was found to be the most sensitive while 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> is the most resistant. Furthermore, the results of the second technique reveal that the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of this EO are on the order of 0.3 and 0.6 mg.mℓ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Moreover, the results of the report CMB/CMI show that the EO has a bactericidal effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and a bacteriostatic and fungistatic effect on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, respectively.
