<p>Furthermore, preliminary phytochemical screening, quantification of phenolic and flavonoid contents as well as histopathological examination of pancreas and liver were carried out. The results showed that AEAPMS exhibited a significant glucose and lipid (Total cholesterol and triglycerides) lowering activity in both normal and diabetic rats. However, no significant effect was observed on serum lipoproteins (HDL and LDL). Moreover, AEAPMS seems to act positively on histopathological tissues of liver and pancreas. The phytochemical analysis of AEAPMS showed that the main phytochemical constituents of 
 <italic>Mentha suaveolens</italic> are alkaloids, polyphenols, flavonoids, cyanidins, tannins, glucosides, saponins, quinones, anthraquinones, mucilage, sterols, sesquiterpenes, reducing sugars, carbohydrates and terpenoids. On another hand, a potential in vitro antioxidant of AEAPMS has been shown.
