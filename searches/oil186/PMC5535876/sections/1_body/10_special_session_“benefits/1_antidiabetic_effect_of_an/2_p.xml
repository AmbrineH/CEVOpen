<p class="p">In this study the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Anabasis aretioides</italic> (A. aretioides) aerial part aqueous extract (A.P.A.E) at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight on blood glucose levels and plasma lipid profile was investigated in normal and streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. A preliminary screening for various bioactive constituents was realized and the antioxidant potential of the aqueous extract was also demonstrated. The histopathological changes in liver and pancreas have been evaluated both in normal and STZ diabetic rats. The ability of A. aretioides aqueous extract to improve glucose tolerance in normal rats was also determined. Furthermore, the relative organs weight (R.O.W) of liver, kidney, pancreas and brown adipose tissue were given.
