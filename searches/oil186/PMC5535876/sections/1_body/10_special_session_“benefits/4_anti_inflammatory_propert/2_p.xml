<p class="p">Date fruit (
 <italic class="italic">Phoenix dactylifera</italic>) is traditionally used in Morocco to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, but this has not yet been studied at the scientific level. In this study, phenolic profile and anti-inflammatory activity of six date fruit varieties were assessed. The results showed that Gallic, Ferulic, Caffeic acids and Rutin were the most dominant among analysed polyphenolic compounds. Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity Bousrdoun possessed the highest nitric oxide scavenging ability (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 531.34 μg/mL) and induced the highest protein denaturation inhibition (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 408.64 μg/mL) as well as the highest membrane stabilizing effect (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 483.61 μg/mL). 
 <italic class="italic">Jihl</italic> exhibited the highest reduction of ear edema (74%) and the highest inhibition of paw oedema at 4th hour after carrageenan injection was found in 
 <italic class="italic">Jihl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bousrdoun</italic> with an average of paw swilling (40.35%). In conclusion, these results support the use of date fruit and its main compounds for their anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant activity. The difference observed between analysed date fruit verities regarding their anti-inflammatory activiy may be due in part to the variations in the phenolic profile and total phenols and flavonoids content.
