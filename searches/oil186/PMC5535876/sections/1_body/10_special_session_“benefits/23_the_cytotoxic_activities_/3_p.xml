<p class="p">The accelerated solvent extract technique was used to obtain the total extract of the plants; then the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxic assay was used to evaluate their anti-tumoral activities. the antioxidant potency was evaluated employing various established in vitro systems such as the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. This activity was correlated with the phenolic content and the concentration of flavonoids in the plants using spectrophotometric methods.</p>
