<p class="p">This study was designed to assess the phytochemical screening of leaves of Pulicaria inuloides (Poiret) DC. harvested in a marginalized oasis of south-East of Morocco and to evaluate their potential antioxydante activity properties using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylehydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging. The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of terpenes, catechic tannins, anthraquinones, free quinons, in methanol and petroleum ether extracts of leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. inuloides</italic>, alkaloids and saponins are present only in methanol extract. Methanol and petroleum extracts of leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. inuloides</italic> were subjected to a quantitative determination of total polyphenols and total flavonoids content. Methanol extract showed a high content of total polyphenols and total flavonoids content (32.75 ± 0.0066 mg GAE/g dried extract and 11.025 ± 0.003 mg QE/g dried extract respectively). Quantification of aglycones revealed an important content in leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. inuloides</italic> (0.210 ± 0.023 mg QE/ g dried plant material). Test of antioxidant activity revealed an important scavenging effect of methanol extract compared to petroleum ether extract (IC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.14 ± 0.026 mg/mL respectively).
