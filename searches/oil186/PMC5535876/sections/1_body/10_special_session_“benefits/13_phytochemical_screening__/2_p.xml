<p>This study was designed to assess the phytochemical screening of leaves and seeds of 
 <italic>Vitex agnus castus</italic> harvested in a marginalized oasis of south-East of Morocco and to evaluate their potential antioxydante activity properties using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylehydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging. The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, terpenes and catechic tannins in the different samples, anthraquinones in seeds and saponins in leaves. Methanol 80% extract of seeds and leaves of 
 <italic>Vitex agnus castus</italic> was obtained and subjected to a quantitative determination of total polyphenols and total flavonoids content. Leaves and seeds showed a high content of total polyphenols; Total flavonoids content was high in leaves Quantification of aglycones in the two parts of 
 <italic>Vitex agnus castus</italic> revealed and important amount of aglycones in leaves. The thin layer chromatography of methanol 80% extracts revealed a wide variety of flavonoids and the presence of kaempferol in the seeds of
