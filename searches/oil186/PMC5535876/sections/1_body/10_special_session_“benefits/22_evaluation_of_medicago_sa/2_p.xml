<p>Alfalfa (
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>), is a perennial flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. This plant has been used as a common ingredient in south-west Moroccan (Tinghir) and South Indian cuisine. Alfalfa is rich in many essential vitamins and minerals, including A, D, E, K, and even the full family of B vitamins; biotin, calcium, folic acid, iron, magnesium, potassium â€¦, as well as being very high in protein. This herb is believed to have a direct connection to lowering cholesterol. It is very good at detoxifying and better purifying the blood. It has also beneficial healing properties against bad breath, sore or achy joints, imbalanced skin conditions, and it even increases immune system functionality. This herb acts as an alternative to over the counter pain medicines for headaches or migraines. As a result, consuming alfalfa on a routine basis has an abundance of positive health results. Medicago sativa constitutes the first forage crop in Mediterranean area In Morocco, this crop occupies over 22% of the total area devoted to forage crops. It strongly contributes to socio-economic development of local families. However, water and soil salinity recorded in many world regions is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity and constitutes an important constraint to alfalfa. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the salinity tolerance of Midecago sativa inoculated with Rhizobial strain RhOL1 and/or arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (autochtonous mycorhizal).
