<p class="p">The aim of this work was to determine the antioxydant activity and the nefroprotective effect of ethanolic extract of propolis following treatment with ultravist. To do so, 30 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 rats: group I received orally distilled water at a dose of 1 mL/100 g body weight. This group served as a control. Group II received orally 250 mg/Kg /bodyweight of EEP. Group III received intravenous injection of a single dose of D1 ultravist the 8th day (2 mL/Kg/ bodyweight). Group IV received intravenous injection of a single dose D2 ultravist the 8th day (4 mL/Kg/ bodyweight). Group V was pre-treated with EEP (250 mg/kg PO) 7 days prior to exposure to ultravist (2 mg/kg of bodyweight) and 3 days after. Group VI was pre-treated with EEP (250 mg/kg) 7 days prior to exposure to ultravist (4 mg/kg body weight) and 3 days after.</p>
