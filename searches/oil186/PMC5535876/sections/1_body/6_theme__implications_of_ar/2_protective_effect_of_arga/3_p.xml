<p>Rats were randomly divided into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), tree groups are controls the first one received (10 mL/kg b.w) of distilled water , the second exposed to (TiO2NPs) (200 mg/kg b.w) by gavage and the third received (10 mL/kg b.w) of argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w), whereas the last group is the group which is treated by the co-administration of argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w) and (TiO2NPs) (200 mg/kg b.w) for 3 weeks. Serum protein, albumin levels and transaminases (AST, ALT), ALP activities were determined, Lipid profile, urea, Creatinine, and histological changes was investigated. The obtained results indicate that the majority of the analyzed parameters were protected against the toxicity of (TiO2NPs) in the group treated with argan oil (10 mL/kg b.w).
