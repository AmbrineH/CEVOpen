<p>Dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are used in widespread applications, such as, drug additives, cosmetics, paints, paper, inks, sun-screens, electronics and food. The main factor in the toxicity of nanoparticles is its size which is very small and which makes it capable of inducing damage even at the level of the DNA. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of argan virgin oil on titanium dioxide nanoparticles toxicity.</p>
