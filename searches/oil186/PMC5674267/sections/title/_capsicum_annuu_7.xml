  <span class="italic">Capsicum annuum</span> L. belongs to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Capsicum</span> of family Solanaceae [
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">85</a>], and is native to southern North America and northern South America [
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86</a>]. Its fruit characteristics have been widely used for taxonomy [
  <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">87</a>] and have range greatly in type, colour, shape, taste and biochemical constituents [
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">88</a>]. Capsicum contains many chemicals, including water, fixed (fatty) oils, steam-volatile oil, carotenoids, capsaicinoids, resin, protein, fibre and mineral elements. Red peppers contain 280 μg/gm total carotenoids. Capsanthin accounts for 60% of the total carotenoids. They also contain 11% β-carotene and 20% capsorubin. Capsanthin is acylated with C12–18 saturated fatty acids [
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">89</a>,
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">90</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenolic glycosides of 
  <span class="italic">C. annum</span> L. were evaluated for their radioprotective effects, and oxidative damage induced by X-radiation was studied on human lymphocytes. Although these compounds showed less antiradical properties they had higher radioprotective ability, and no cytotoxicity was observed. Therefore, it was advocated that superoxide radical scavenging could be the favored method to screen compounds for their possible radioprotective ability [
