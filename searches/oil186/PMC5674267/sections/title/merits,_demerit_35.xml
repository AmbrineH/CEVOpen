 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to their abundance, low cost and safety, aromatic plants hold significant promise and provide unique advantage for use as radioprotectors. These plants have varied antioxidant capacities which directly correlates with their chemical constituents thus have variable radioprotective properties [
  <a rid="B239" ref-type="bibr" href="#B239">239</a>]. It has been reported that carotenoids can protect against radiation but a high dose of single carotenoid entity induces lethal effects [
  <a rid="B240" ref-type="bibr" href="#B240">240</a>]. Therefore, quality control studies must be focused on proper elucidation of definite effects of the drug used with factors such as age, sex and species accounted for while performing preclinical assessment studies [
  <a rid="B241" ref-type="bibr" href="#B241">241</a>]. The use of plant-derived medication has limitations because only limited systematic studies are available for each plant product. Therefore, research must be directed toward acquiring knowledge about the safe use of plant-based drugs prior to their possible use [
  <a rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122">122</a>]. However, studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties including toxicity must be carried out [
  <a rid="B242" ref-type="bibr" href="#B242">242</a>]. Most of the studies reported are conducted on animal models or cell cultures and therefore, it is not easy to extend their validity in clinical settings â€“ this poses a major hindrance [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. It has been observed that crude extract is better than the isolated fractions; this may be due to the combined effects of so many different constituents that are responsible for its activity. The compound/extract must work in practice and not just be limited to laboratory. Plant material utilized as a specific compound or group of compounds should be well standardized, characterized and processed.
