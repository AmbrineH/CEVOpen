  <a rid="B244" ref-type="bibr" href="#B244">244</a>]. Mentha extracts have antioxidant properties due to the presence of eugenol, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and α-tocopherol. Caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, eriocitrin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside were identified as primary radical scavengers. It also contains phenolic acids, flavonoids and s-carvone [
