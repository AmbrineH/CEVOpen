  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plant 
   <span class="italic">Ageratum</span> belongs to the family Asteraceae, which consists of about 30 species. The name is derived from the Greek word ‘a geras’ and konyz, referring to long life and similarity with 
   <span class="italic">Inula helenium</span>. It is an aromatic herb, erect, annual and growing up to 1 m in height, commonly found in Africa, Asia, America and Australia. Few species of 
   <span class="italic">Ageratum</span> have been pharmacologically evaluated. The weed is best known for its healing activity and has been used for treating burn, wound, skin diseases and various infections among others, since ancient times [
   <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</span> contains various chemical constituents [
   <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48–55</a>]. It is rich in polyoxygenated flavonoids. The triterpenes are friedelin, and the major sterols are sterols-β-sitosterol and stigmasterol. Lycopsamine and echinatine are two isomeric pyrrolizidine alkaloids isolated from 
   <span class="italic">A. conyzoides</span>. The oil content varies from 0.11–0.58% for leaves and from 0.03–0.18% for the roots. The major components of the essential oil are 7-methoxy-2,2-dimethylchromene (prescocene I), 6,7-dimethoxy derivative, ageratochromene (precocene II) and ageratochromene dimmer.

   <a rid="B229" ref-type="bibr" href="#B229">229</a>]. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antinoceceptive properties have also been reported [

   <a rid="B231" ref-type="bibr" href="#B231">231</a>]. Gingerol-related compounds such as gingerol, shagaols, gengediols, zingerone, dehydrozingerone, gingerinone and diarylheptanoids accord antioxidant capacity to the ginger rhizome. Geranial, camphene, p-cineole, α-terpineole, zingiberene and petandeconoic acid were the major components of the essential oil. However, eugenol was major components in ethanol oleoresin, and in methanol, CCl4 and isooctane oleoresin the zingerone was major component [

   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Antioxidant status and antioxidant enzymes were studied in rats with pretreatment of ginger extract and whole-body irradiated with γ-radiation. Hematological parameters were found to have significant recovery with respect to radiation-induced damage [
   <a rid="B174" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174">174</a>]. Essential oil of ginger was also evaluated for its radioprotective effects in mice, yielding a dose reduction factor of 1.4. Ginger oil was found to be effective in restoring antioxidant status and reducing the cytogenetic damage in terms of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei frequency and DNA damage in mice [
