<p>Thus, the detrimental effects of radiation-induced alterations in biologic systems via reactive oxygen species generation play a crucial role in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in the body. Therefore, any disparity in homeostasis results in oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which can be trounced by additional provision of naturally occurring, plant based antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref>]. It has been shown that the oxidation process could be halted by antioxidants by adopting various strategies such as scavenging, chelating or transferring hydrogen atoms [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42–44</xref>]. It has been speculated that the radioprotectors must have radical-scavenging properties along with antioxidant function; however, all antioxidants do not provide radioprotection [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Radioprotectors minimize or reduce the radiation-induced damage to normal tissues and need to be present before or at the time of radiation exposure for its protective efficacy [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In recent years, investigations have demonstrated the importance and usefulness of aromatic plants for their radioprotective effects and ability to be employed for modification of oxidative insult due to radiation. Therefore, the present review focused on medicinally important aromatic plants with special reference to radioprotective activity (
