 <italic>Piper longum</italic> belongs to family Piperaceae, and is commonly known as Pipali in India. It is traditionally used as a medicine in Asia and the Pacific Islands for treating diseases such as gonorrhea, menstrual pain, tuberculosis, arthritis and is also used for analgesic, diuretic and muscle relaxant purposes [
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Chemical studies have shown that the genus 
 <italic>Piper</italic> has many components including unsaturated amides, flavonoids, lignans, aristolactams, long and short chain esters, terpenes, steroids, propenylphenols and alkaloids. The essential oils of ten Piperaceae species have shown that the most frequently identified compounds were sesquiterpenes. However, the nonoxygenated monoterpenes (Z) p-ocimene, a-pinene and b-pinene were prevalent as well. A biosynthetic approach showed that the most common sesquiterpenes identified, E-caryophyllene and germacrene D, have the E,E-farnesyl-PP as fundamental precursor and only two were originated from E,Z-farnesyl-PP reactions (a-copaene and d-cadinene) [

 <italic>P. longum</italic> were studied in mice. Extract treatment prevented the radiation-induced depletion of white blood cells in mice. Extract treatment was also effective in declining the radiation-induced increased levels of glutathione pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and lipid peroxidation thus offering protection to mice against radiation induced damage [
