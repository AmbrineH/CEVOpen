 <italic class="italic">C. annum</italic> L. were evaluated for their radioprotective effects, and oxidative damage induced by X-radiation was studied on human lymphocytes. Although these compounds showed less antiradical properties they had higher radioprotective ability, and no cytotoxicity was observed. Therefore, it was advocated that superoxide radical scavenging could be the favored method to screen compounds for their possible radioprotective ability [
