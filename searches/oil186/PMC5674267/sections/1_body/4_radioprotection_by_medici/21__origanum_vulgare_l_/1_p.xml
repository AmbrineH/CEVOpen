Radioprotection by Oregano extract was studied in terms of internal irradiation – as well as external irradiation-induced genotoxicity in human lymphocytes and mouse bone marrow. The oregano extract treatment resulted in significant reduction of micronuclei frequencies in human lymphocytes and mouse bone marrow. Radical scavenging activity of oregano extract was studied by DPPH assay, which shown that it was effective in scavenging of DPPH-free radical in dose-dependent manner. Therefore, free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism for radioprotection [
