<p id="Par40">Each pig was considered as the experimental unit. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Data for physical and chemical parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, and fatty acid profile of IMF were analyzed by one-way ANOVA where the diet was the main effect. The data on drip loss and TBARS parameters during storage time in Exp. 2 were assessed by a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with dietary treatment, time, and their interaction as effects. The attributes of eating quality (flavor, juiciness, tenderness, and overall acceptance) were analyzed using an ANOVA procedure, which contained the fixed effect of nutritional treatment and the effect of animal nested within nutritional treatment as a random effect, with the intention to correct the animal individual differences within treatment. The means were calculated using the least square method and presented with the standard error of the mean (SEM). When a significant
