<p id="Par26">Synthetic and natural antioxidants have been used to delay the lipid oxidation in pork [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Herbal feed additives and organic acid have been suggested as desirable alternatives to benefit growth performance of the pigs by improving the gut health. Oregano essential oil (OEO) contains the natural and volatile aromatic compounds that exert different biological actions, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Carvacrol and thymol, the two main phenolic derivatives that constitute about 81.9 and 3.5% of OEO, are principally responsible for the activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, other minor constituents such as γ-terpinene and ρ-cymene, two monoterpene hydrocarbons that constitute about 4.49 and 3.07% of OEO, respectively, also contribute to the activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our previous studies, we found that OEO can improve growth performance [
