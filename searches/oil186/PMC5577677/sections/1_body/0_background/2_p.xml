 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. The tissue-specific increase of expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase could be one reason for higher de novo synthesis of fatty acids in muscle of pigs fed reduced protein diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. However, unsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to oxidation than saturated fatty acids (SFA) and particularly vulnerable to peroxidative attack [
