 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A reduced protein diet promoted pork with higher IMF percentage which was more monounsaturated and less polyunsaturated even when balanced with essential amino acids [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The tissue-specific increase of expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase could be one reason for higher de novo synthesis of fatty acids in muscle of pigs fed reduced protein diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, unsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to oxidation than saturated fatty acids (SFA) and particularly vulnerable to peroxidative attack [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, the lipid oxidation in muscle is a major deterioration of nutritional and sensory properties of meat and meat products [
