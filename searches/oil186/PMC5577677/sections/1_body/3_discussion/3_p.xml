<p id="Par50">Lipid peroxidation is a natural phenomenon that has a significant effect on meat quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This study is the first to demonstrate that dietary supplementation with a combination of OEO and BA in growing-finishing pigs can beneficially increase T-SOD, GPx, and T-AOC activities in muscle which indicate an improved antioxidative capacity. These findings were in accordance with our previous studies reporting the positive effect of OEO on the activities of antioxidant enzymes in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Concerning the possible effects of the BA, the dietary inclusion of 0.5% BA increased GSH-Px activities in the liver of piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. High antioxidative enzymes may protect the lipid from oxidative damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The protection against lipid oxidation in the LPOB group was also confirmed by lower TBARS concentration and drip loss in the LPOB group during refrigerated storage at 4 °C. The protective effect of OEO, when used as a dietary supplement, on meat lipid oxidation has already been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In contrast, Simitzis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] did not find any effect on stored pig meat when different concentrations of oregano essential oils (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mL/kg feed) were added to the diet. Furthermore, the key to minimizing drip loss was to protect the integrity of cell membranes from freeze injury, which increases their permeability and results in leakage of sarcoplasmic fluid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Dietary supplementation with OEO and BA may preserve the fluidity of the membranes, which could otherwise be adversely affected by oxidative changes in the phospholipids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These results agree with previously published reports, in which to the drip loss appeared to in pigs fed with diets supplemented with OEO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, results indicated that the LPOB diet improved the antioxidative status in LT muscle, extending the shelf life of meat.
