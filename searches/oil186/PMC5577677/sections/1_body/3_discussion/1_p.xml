In the present study, the results of Exp. 1 indicated that pigs can feed low protein diet reducing dietary protein concentration by one to three percentage units without affecting meat quality of pigs. However, numerically, the values of IMF increased 11.8% in the LPD group compared with the NPD group, indeed, the results of Exp. 2 demonstrated that the IMF level in LT muscle of pigs was increased by LPD compared with NPD. In some cases, the effect has been explained by the different slaughter age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] and slaughter weight [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] between the two trials, which were greater in Exp. 2 than in Exp. 1. Normal growth conditions, fat deposition of pigs occurs mainly in the late stages of fattening [

Sensory profile results showed that the muscle steaks with the higher IMF content, from regime LPD, had the higher scores for tenderness which agree with the findings of other researchers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] who reported that feeding protein-deficient diets improved the tenderness. There is no previously published research concerning the effects of the administration of a combination of OEO and BA on IMF content in muscles.
