<p id="Par51">In this study, growing-finishing pigs fed with a reduced-protein, amino acid-supplemented diet showed a higher content of intramuscular fat in the 
 <italic>longissimus thoracis</italic> muscle and a changed fatty acid composition towards a higher percentage of oleic acid and a lower percentage of linoleic acid in 
 <italic>longissimus thoracis</italic> muscle. Low protein diets supplemented with the combination of oregano essential oil and benzoic acid may be an effective means to increase the growing-finishing pigs antioxidant status, to prevent lipid oxidation and, thus, to delay meat shelf-life. However, the long term supplementation blends of oregano essential oil and benzoic acid to low protein diet will reduce the content of intramuscular fat in LT muscle, which have a poor sensory characteristic.
