 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 800 mg of frozen muscle sample was weighed and homogenized on ice in 8 ml of 0.9% saline and then centrifuged at 2300×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, which contained soluble enzymes and mitochondrial material, was used to measure enzyme activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level in triplicate at appropriate dilutions. The activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in muscle were assayed using colorimetric methods with a spectrophotometer (Biomate 5, Thermo Electron Corporation, Rochester, NY, USA). The assays were conducted with commercial kits purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total protein content of the supernatant was also determined by a commercial kit from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).</p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stability of the LT samples were assessed by TBARS method at 1, 4, and 8 days of storage in a refrigerator at 4 °C. The analyses of TBARS were also conducted using commercial kits purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Determinations were carried out in triplicate. The content of TBARS, as an index of MDA, was expressed as nanomoles per milligram protein of muscle tissue.</p>
