 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lipids from LT muscle samples were extracted in chloroform-methanol according to Folch et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and determined with a CP-3800 Gas ChromatographÂ [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. The fatty acids were identified by comparing the retention times of the peaks with those of known standards (Sigam Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). The response factors for the fatty acids were calculated using the same standard mixtures plus an internal standard [
