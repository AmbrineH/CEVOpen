Pigs were placed in metabolism cages that were equipped with a feeder and a nipple drinker, fully slatted floors, and a screen floor. The pigs were randomly allotted to one of three diets based on BW in a randomized complete block design with seven replicate pigs per diet. The diets based on corn, distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and soybean meal. Each diet supplemented with 150 mg aureomycin per kg feed as antibiotic growth promoter. A normal protein diet (NPD) with 170 and 156 g CP/kg with one percentage unit below the nutrient requirements of the National Research Council [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] for the growing and finishing period, respectively. A medium CP level diet (MPD) with 10 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the growing and finishing period, and a low level diet (LPD) with 20 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the two phases. All diets were fortified with Lys, Met, Thr and Trp to meet the requirements of growing-finishing pigs [

Pigs were penned individually. The pig pens were kept in an environmentally controlled building with a temperature between 15 and 25 °C. All pigs were provided with ad libitum access to feed and water via semi-automatic individual feeders and nipple drinkers. Pigs in group I and group II were fed with the same NPD and LPD in Exp. 1, respectively, and group III received the same LPD supplemented with 250 mg of OEO and 1000 mg BA per kg of feed to substitute for aureomycin (LPOB). The OEO was provided by Meritech Bioengineering Company (Guangzhou, China). The components of OEO are shown in Additional file

Marbling were scored using the National Pork Producer Council standards (marbling from 1 = devoid to 10 = abundant) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Measurements of pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem were performed on LT muscles using a pH meter (pH-STAR, SFK-Technology, Denmark). Meat color (MC) at 45 min and 24 h in Exp. 1 were measured for 3 times per sample on the cut surface using the OPTO-STAR meat color determinator (Matthäus). Color measurements (L*, a*, b*) in Exp. 2 were performed at 45 min postmortem from a mean of four random readings made with a chromameter (CR-300, Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan), previously calibrated against a white tile according to the manufacturer’s manual. Drip loss and Cooking loss were determined by the method described by Honikel [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. For drip loss determination, fresh meat samples (approximate 40 g) were held in a plastic box on a grid parallel to the fibre direction. The weight loss percentages after 1 (Exp. 1), 2, 4, and 8 days of storage at 4 °C were calculated. For cooking loss determination, a fresh slice from each sample was weighed (approximate 145 g), placed in a plastic bag, and cooked to an internal temperature of 70 °C in a 75 °C water bath. The internal temperature was monitored during cooking with a handheld temperature probe. The cooked samples were cooled for 30 min, blotted dry, and weighed. Cooking loss was expressed as the weight change percentage at the end of cooking. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was determined in samples cooled at 4 °C for 24 h. Six cylindrical cores (10 mm × 10 mm) were removed from each sample parallel to the fiber direction, then, were sheared with a WBSF device attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 1011, Instron instrument, USA) with a 50-kg tension using a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min.

Three attributes (flavor, juiciness, and tenderness) were evaluated with a ten-point descriptive linear continuous scale (1–10) with larger scores indicating a more favorable rating. Overall acceptance was rated on a nine-point hedonic scale (1–9) ranging from dislike extremely to like extremely. Each sample assessment involved three samples that represented the nutritional treatments (NPD, LPD, and LPOB).
