 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 21 healthy crossbred barrows (Landrace × Large White, 50 days old) with initial BW of 16.31 ± 1.26 kg were used in a 95-d trial. Pigs were placed in metabolism cages that were equipped with a feeder and a nipple drinker, fully slatted floors, and a screen floor. The pigs were randomly allotted to one of three diets based on BW in a randomized complete block design with seven replicate pigs per diet. The diets based on corn, distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and soybean meal. Each diet supplemented with 150 mg aureomycin per kg feed as antibiotic growth promoter. A normal protein diet (NPD) with 170 and 156 g CP/kg with one percentage unit below the nutrient requirements of the National Research Council [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] for the growing and finishing period, respectively. A medium CP level diet (MPD) with 10 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the growing and finishing period, and a low level diet (LPD) with 20 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the two phases. All diets were fortified with Lys, Met, Thr and Trp to meet the requirements of growing-finishing pigs [

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On day 95, five barrows per treatments were slaughtered at a live weight of 98.95 ± 4.07 kg. Pigs were electrically stunned, exsanguinated, dehaired, and split down the midline according to standard commercial procedures. Then, fresh LT samples anterior to the 13th rib from the left side carcass were collected and used for the physical analysis.</p>
