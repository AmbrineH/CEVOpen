  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil obtained by maceration exhibited highest acid (7.33 ± 0.00 mg KOH/g), anisidine (34.5 ± 1.84) and thiobarbituric acid (7.50 ± 0.30 μmol MDA/Kg) values compared to that obtained by pressing method (9.13 ± 0.64 and 6.72 ± 0.34 μmol MDA/Kg) respectively. 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oil obtained by pressing method showed highest peroxide value (6.22 ± 1.31 meq O
  <sub>2</sub>/kg). Oil chemical analysis revealed long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-3 family: linolenic acid (C18:3); eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) and ω-6 family; arachidonic acid (C20:4). In addition, 
  <span class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</span> oil obtained by pressing and maceration methods showed Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) values ranging from 32 to 64 mg/ml. 
  <span class="italic">H. odoe</span> oil obtained by pressing method revealed MIC values ranging between 8 and 64 mg/ml.
