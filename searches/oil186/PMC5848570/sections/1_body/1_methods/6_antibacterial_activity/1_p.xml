<p id="Par19">The oil’s antibacterial activity was evaluated by broth microdilution method in a 96-wells microtitre plates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Bacterial suspensions of about 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml (Mc Farland turbidity standard no. 0.5) was prepared from an overnight culture. The inoculum was obtained following 100 times dilution (1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml). The oil stock solution was prepared in 5% tween 20. A series of two fold dilutions were performed to obtain final concentration range of 0.5 to 64 mg/ml in a total volume of 100 μl/well. Each well was further diluted with 100 ml inoculum. Plates were further incubated at 35 °C for 18 h. Growth was monitored using 
 <italic>P-</italic> iodotetrazolium chloride (INT; 0.2 mg/ml)) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Viable bacteria change the yellow dye of iodonitrotetrazolium to a pink colour. The lowest concentration of oil, at which no visible colour change was noted was considered as MIC. Ciprofloxacin was used as positive control at concentrations ranging from 0.0625 to128 μg/ml.
