<p id="Par22">The quality index of oils extracted from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The acid value of the oil extracted from 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> by cooking-pressing method was higher than 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil obtained by the same method. Oils extracted from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> by cooking-pressing method had higher iodine values compared to 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration. 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic>’s oil, obtained by cooking-pressing method presented the highest peroxide value. 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil, extracted by maceration increases by approximately four times the anisidine value compared to that obtained by cooking-pressing method. The anisidine value of the oil extracted from 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> by cooking-pressing method was lower than that of 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> obtained by the same method.
