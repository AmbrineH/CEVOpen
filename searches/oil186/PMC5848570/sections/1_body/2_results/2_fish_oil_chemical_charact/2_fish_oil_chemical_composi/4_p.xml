<p id="Par26">The three oils contain long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-3 family (linolenic acid (C18:3); eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6)) and the ω-6 family (arachidonic acid (C20:4), linoleic acid (C18:2). Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were most represented. The eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids content in 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil obtained by cooking-pressing method decreased by more than half to that obtained from the same fish by maceration. Oils extracted from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> had higher proportion of these two fatty acids compared to that derived from 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic>. Lignoceric acid was absent in 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration. Arachidonic acid (C20:4) was absent in 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration. In general, oil extracted from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> by cooking-pressing method contained high levels of ω-3 fatty acids compared to that obtained from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> by maceration. The oil extracted from 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> contained high of ω-3 fatty acids. Similar observations were made with ω-6 fatty acids. The sum of ω-3 fatty acids contained in these three oils was greater than those of ω-6 fatty acids.
