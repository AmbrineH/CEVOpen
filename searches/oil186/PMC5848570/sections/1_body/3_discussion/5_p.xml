<p id="Par32">The anisidine value reflects the secondary oxidation products, specifically 2-alkenals and 2.4-dienals unlike thiobarbituric acid value which allows highlighting the malondialdehydes which characterise the last steps of fatty acid oxidation. 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration presented an oxidation rate which is approximately four times higher than that of oils extracted by the cooking pressing method. Moreover, the oil extracted from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> by maceration exhibited the highest thiobarbituric acid value compared to the oils extracted by cooking-pressing method, reflecting last step of this oil’s oxidation. However, thiobarbituric acid values obtained with oils extracted from the two fishes regardless of the method fell within the standard range since values were below 10 μmol MDA/Kg fish [
