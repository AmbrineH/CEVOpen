 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> oils, extracted by cooking-pressing method had higher iodine values compared to 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration. This could be due to the fact that unsatured bonds present in 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> oils obtained by cooking-pressing method were not affected during extraction. Therefore, the cooking-pressing method could be the best method of oil extraction of these two fishes.
