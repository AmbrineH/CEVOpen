<p id="Par28" class="p">The extraction yields of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oils were 6.52% and 5.8% respectively, for the cooking-pressing methods and maceration. The extraction yield of 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> was 4.31% by cooking-pressing method. According to Linder et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], fishes with oil content less than 5% are lean fishes, those containing 5 to 10% are semi fatty fishes and beyond 10% are considered fat. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> with a yield of 5.8% - 6.52% is a semi fatty fish unlike 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> which is a lean fish (yield of 4.31%).
