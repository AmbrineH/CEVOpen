<p id="Par29">The acid value is a measure of the amount of free acids present in a given amount of fat. 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration method had the highest amount of free acids compared to that of the cooking-pressing method. This increase might be related to the extraction process. However, the acid values of 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> oils extracted by cooking-pressing method remain in the standard (less than 3 mg KOH/g of oil) [

 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration. The oil’s iodine value reflects its susceptibility to oxidation. A decrease is generally attributed to the destruction of double bonds, polymerization or split [
