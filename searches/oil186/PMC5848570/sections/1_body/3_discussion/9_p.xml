<p id="Par36" class="p">The major compounds identified in 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> oils were saturated fatty acids with palmitic acid being the most represented. They were followed by monounsaturated fatty acids predominantly oleic acid and followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids mostly linolelaidic acid. This repartition is quite different to that reported with the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Sardinella longiceps</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sardinella fimbriata.</italic> Indeed, results revealed with both fishes oil composition showed that the major compounds identified were unsaturated fatty acids with a predominance of C20:5 (EPA) and C 22:6 (DHA) [

 <italic class="italic">Eusphyra blochii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Carcharhinus bleekeri</italic> marine fish oil where dienoic and trienoic fatty acids were found in trace amount. The findings are nevertheless similar to those reported with these marine fishes, where palmitic acid was one of the major saturated fatty acid found, oleic and palmitoleic fatty acids were the major constituents of monounsaturated fatty acids [
