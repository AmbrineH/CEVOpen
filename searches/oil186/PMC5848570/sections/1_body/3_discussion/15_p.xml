 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and

 <italic>H. odoe</italic> oils, thereby indicating that these oils are potent antibacterial agents which could serve either as dietary supplements to fight against food infections caused by these bacteria or cooked in these forms to combine nutritive and curative properties of the fishes.
