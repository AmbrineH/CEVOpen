<p id="Par33">From the various oil indexes, it appears that 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by maceration was the most affected. Oils from 
 <italic>C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. odoe</italic> obtained by cooking-pressing method showed quality indexes within the standards, meaning that they were of good quality. Nevertheless, alternative extraction methods need to be carried out in order to preserve these oils.
