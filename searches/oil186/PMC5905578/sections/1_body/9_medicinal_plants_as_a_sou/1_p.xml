<p>Medicinal plants are a renewable source of compounds, providing an almost unlimited source of new and complex chemical structures [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Only some of these compounds were investigated or produced as synthetic drugs, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol and digoxin [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Examples of the discovery of new molecules from isolated compounds are irinotecan and topotecan (anticancer molecules), derived from an isolated compound from
