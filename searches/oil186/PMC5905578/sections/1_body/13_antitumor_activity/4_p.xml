<p class="p">Carnosic acid and carnosol are diterpenes that represent about 5% of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> dried leaves weight, and these compounds have greater antitumor relevance (35 in 49 studies use these compounds). There has been a large increase in the number of studies regarding the antitumor activity of carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmarinic acid, ursolic acid over the past 5Â years (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Breast cancers, melanoma, colon cancer, liver carcinoma and leukemia have been the most studied. In fact, there has been several
