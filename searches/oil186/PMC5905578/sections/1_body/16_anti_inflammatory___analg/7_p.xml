<p class="p">At preclinical stages, the essential oil of rosemary has been used topically for muscular and rheumatic pains, evaluated using carrageenan-induced pleurisy and carrageenan-induced paw edema tests in rats. These studies suggested that the essential oil could remarkably decrease the induced edema in 1–4 h and significantly reduce the volume of pleural exudate, being both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive [

Particularly, the acetyl derivative can reduce the induced paw edema as well as the paw licks, suggesting a potential application of this compound as anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive agent [

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. reported the efficacy of ‘Meta050’ (a combination of reduced iso-alpha-acids from hops, rosemary extract and oleanolic acid), in patients with rheumatic disease. Patients with pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia were given 440 mg of ‘Meta050’, which doubled after 4 weeks in the majority of patients. This work reports a significant decrease in pain in arthritis subjects by 40–50%, but not for fibromyalgia subject scores [
