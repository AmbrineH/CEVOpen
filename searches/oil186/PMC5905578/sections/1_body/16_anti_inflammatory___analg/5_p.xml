 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic studies were based on the evaluation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.), COX-1/COX-2, iNOS and evaluation of nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 macrophages cells [

Also, studies concerning the antiatherosclerotic effects of rosemary have been developed, through the migration and matrix metalloproteinase activation of vascular smooth muscle cells. These studies reported that carnosic acid has an ability to suppress matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression through downregulation of NF-κB and therefore decrease the smooth muscle cells migration [
