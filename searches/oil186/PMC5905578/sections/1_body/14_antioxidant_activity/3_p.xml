<p>Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were reviewed regarding the antioxidant activity of the main isolated compounds from rosemary, namely, carnosol, carnosic acid, rosmanol, rosmarinic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. Using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method, these bioactive compounds and the essential oil were validated for their antioxidant activity [

Also, using the thiobarbituric acid, superoxide anion and lipid free radicals scavenging activity assays and Rancimat methods (determination of oxidative stability of fat), the bioactive compounds carnosol, rosmanol and epirosmanol have been reported to inhibit lipid peroxidation through the lipid free radical scavenging mechanism [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89–90</xref>]. These studies have shown the antioxidant potential of rosemary phytochemicals, whose properties are closely related to other biological activities, such as cytoprotective and anticancer, primarily due to their ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species.
