<p>From this review, it can be concluded that 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> has a promising future especially in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, such as cancers, infectious diseases and CNS disorders. Interestingly, using the database from ClinicalTrials.gov with the same keywords under study, we found two clinical trials for rosmarinic acid and oleanolic acid, three studies for ursolic acid and none for carnosic acid or carnosol. These studies concern the topics of osteoarthritis of the knee, nasal polyps, GI tract, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome X, sarcopenia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, it is imperative to improve clinical studies of this medicinal plant, and learn from the traditional health practitioners that bear the knowledge of many generations of trial and error. The worldwide interest in the use of rosemary has been growing with its beneficial effects being rediscovered for the possible development of new drugs. Therefore, the need for new therapeutic agents with specific targets and less adverse side effects, supports the need to extend both the clinical and preclinical studies on 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> plants.
