 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The entire extract can be standardized and clinically tested for a particular clinical condition. This feature differentiates phytotherapy from conventional pharmacotherapy [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chemically speaking, natural compounds can lead to the active substances, not only allowing the planning and design of new drugs, but can also lead to the development of biomimetic synthesis (used as precursors) [
