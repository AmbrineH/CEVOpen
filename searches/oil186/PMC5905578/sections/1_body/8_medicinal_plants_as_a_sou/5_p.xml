<p class="p">In 1805, morphine became the first pure pharmacologically active compound to be isolated from a plant, although it was only in 1923 that its structure was elucidated [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], numerous alkaloids were isolated, such as atropine (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], due to the ineffectiveness of conventional medicine, namely: the cytotoxicity and side effects; the discomfort in the treatment of chronic diseases, in comparison with the use of phytopharmaceuticals; the abuse and misuse of synthetic drugs; the unavailable pharmacological treatments in a large percentage of the world population; and more importantly, the high costs involved in conventional medicine [
