 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PBM has been employed throughout history and is nowadays the foundation of traditional medicine. Plants can be used as therapeutic resources in the form of herbal infusion, pharmaceutical preparations such as extracts, tablets or capsules by extracting and purifying active compounds [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. Primitive communities in China, India and many other countries learned from experience [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>] to distinguish the useful plants with beneficial effects, from those which were toxic or inactive, and to identify which combinations of plants were best for each illness [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional medicine can be broadly classified into four basic systems: the Ayurvedic medicine (meaning ‘science of life’), which originated in India more than 5000 years ago; Chinese medicine, which is a part of traditional oriental medicine; African medicine; and Western medicine, originally from Greece and Rome, then spreading to Europe and to North and South America [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. Ayurvedic medicine continues to be one of the oldest traditional medicine systems currently practiced in India, Sri Lanka and other countries, with over 1000 plants described in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. There are several ancient records on the use of plants such as the 
  <span class="italic">Ebers Papyrus</span> (1550 BC) and 
  <span class="italic">De Materia Medica</span>, written by Dioscorides (77 AD). This last one describes over 600 medicinal plants, but during the Middle Ages, there was very little progress in the development of PBM [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medicinal plants have an important role on pharmacological research and drug development, not only when the bioactive compounds are directly used as therapeutic agents, but also when they are used as raw material for drug synthesis or as a base model for new lead compounds [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. However, validating this resource at the same level of conventional pharmaceutical products requires a great deal of basic and applied research [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A phytopharmaceutical preparation, or a PBM is any drug obtained exclusively from plants, in both raw and pharmaceutical formulation [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. In many countries, PBMs are not regulated or controlled leading to poor quality control, consequently decreasing the acceptance and confidence in these products by the medical community [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6–7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1805, morphine became the first pure pharmacologically active compound to be isolated from a plant, although it was only in 1923 that its structure was elucidated [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. Still in the 19th century, the first organic synthesis of urea, by Friedrich Wohler in 1828 [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>], initiated the era of synthetic compounds. Even though synthetic drug development became the mainstay of conventional medicine [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>], numerous alkaloids were isolated, such as atropine (
  <span class="italic">Atropa belladonna</span>), cocaine (
  <span class="italic">Erythroxylum coca</span>), ephedrine (species 
  <span class="italic">Ephedra</span>), codeine (
  <span class="italic">Papaver somniferum</span>), pilocarpine (
  <span class="italic">Pilocarpus jaborandi</span> Holmes) and physostigmine (
  <span class="italic">Physostigma venenosum</span>), that are still widely used in drug prescription [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. However, the interest in PBM for drug development was only restored in the early 1980s [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>], due to the ineffectiveness of conventional medicine, namely: the cytotoxicity and side effects; the discomfort in the treatment of chronic diseases, in comparison with the use of phytopharmaceuticals; the abuse and misuse of synthetic drugs; the unavailable pharmacological treatments in a large percentage of the world population; and more importantly, the high costs involved in conventional medicine [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11–13</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1997, the world market on medicinal products, not subject to medical prescription was 10 billion dollars, with an annual growth of 6.5% [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. In 2001 and 2002, about a quarter of the top-selling drugs in the world were from natural products or their derivatives [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. In 2003, the growth exceeded expectations, achieving sales of over 65 billion dollars, with 9 billion in Europe, with Germany as the European leader [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. In fact, the use of the rosemary leaf has been approved by the German Commission for dyspepsia, high blood pressure and rheumatism at doses of 4–6 g/day, while the essential oil has been approved at doses of 0.1–1 ml [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. In 2009, the total market value for PBM was about 83 billion dollars [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In accordance with the principles of phytotherapy, a plant contains a number of pharmacologically active compounds which must be seen as a single unit [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. The entire extract can be standardized and clinically tested for a particular clinical condition. This feature differentiates phytotherapy from conventional pharmacotherapy [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Chemically speaking, natural compounds can lead to the active substances, not only allowing the planning and design of new drugs, but can also lead to the development of biomimetic synthesis (used as precursors) [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the industrial revolution and the development of organic chemistry have resulted in a preference for synthetic products, the WHO reports that in most of the developing countries about 80% of citizens still depend on the traditional medicine as main source of healthcare [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Nonetheless 25% of all prescribed drugs worldwide are derived from plants [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17–18</a>,
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26–27</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presumably the production of phytotherapy drugs will require genetically uniform plants monocultures, grown in fully controlled conditions ensuring consistency and biochemical optimization of safety and efficacy of these products [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. It is necessary to develop innovative technologies for isolation, purification and structural characterization for improved discovery and development of new PBMs [
