<p>ESIT12 is a micronized product composed of propolis extract from a raw sample to produce a highly pure propolis free of wax and other possible contaminants supported by sucrose and silicon dioxide. The other four extracts were produced from the same propolis sample of ESIT12 but in different solvents, hydroalcoholic (80% ethanol/20% water), glycolic (98% propylene glycol), and glyceric solutions, and seed oil. As evident from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t001">Table 1</xref>, besides their different preparation and solvents, all these extracts show a quite similar polyphenol composition, as well as a comparable percentage. ESIT12 is indeed richer in phenolic acids (caffeic, coumaric, ferulic, and isoferulic) than liquid preparations, ~10% vs. 0.5% (

 <italic>O</italic>-acetate, pinobanksin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-butyrate, and various other pinobanksin derivatives such as the main bioflavonoid species. Overall, flavones and flavonols range from ~20% up to ~36% in the glyceric extract, while flavanones and diidroflavonols are between ~28% and ~41% (
