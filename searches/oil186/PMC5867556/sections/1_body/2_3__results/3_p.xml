<p class="p">Besides their quite similar composition, the total polyphenols content, phenolic acids and bioflavonoids, was different for the various preparations (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00041-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This is probably due to the capacity of different solvents to solubilize more species than others when using the same starting raw propolis for all preparations and a quite similar extractive process (not shown, an owner process of B Natural). In fact, the well-known high capacity of hydroalcoholic solution, generally 80% ethanol and 20% water, to solubilize a great percentage of polyphenols [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] was also confirmed in this study. Moreover, we also measured a high capacity of the glycolic solvent to solubilize a very high % of polyphenols with a quite similar composition when other solvents are used. This may be of some importance for finished products produced by using glycolic preparations of propolis. However, the antioxidant activity expressed as Âµg trolox equivalent/mg polyphenol was found to be quite similar for the various preparations, showing that all samples are able to exert antioxidant capacity and that this activity is strictly related to the polyphenols content for propolis products with a quite similar composition (
