<p class="p">The high-performance liquid chromatography equipment was from Jasco (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (pump mod. PU-1580, UV detector UV-1570, Rheodyne injector equipped with a 20 µL loop, software Jasco-Borwin rel. 1.5). The phenolic acids and flavonoids from propolis were separated using a 250 × 4.6-mm stainless-steel column Discovery-C18 4 µm 80 Ä (from Sigma-Aldrich). The eluents were (A) 0.5% acetic acid and (B) acetonitrile. Separations were performed at room temperature by solvent gradient elution from 0 min at 50% A/50% B to 60 min at 100% B at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. A UV detector set at 260 nm was also used on-line with HPLC equipment.</p>
