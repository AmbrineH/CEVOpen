<p>In this paper, we evaluated this aspect by dissolving a unique propolis extract in various solvents obtaining different finished products such as hydroalcoholic, glycolic, glyceric solutions, and oil, as well as a product in the form of powder. The molecular composition of the different preparations was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV-electrospray ionization mass (HPLC-UV-ESI-MS) and the antioxidant activity determined by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) anti-oxidant assay [

This is more important by considering that the finished products in various forms often require propolis dissolved in specific solvents and supporting matrixes. Finally, up to now, very few data are available on propolis composition in glyceric and glycolic extracts and no information has ever been published on propolis in oil.
