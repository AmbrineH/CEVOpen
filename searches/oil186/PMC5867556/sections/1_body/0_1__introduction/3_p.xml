<p>Propolis, which is barely soluble in water, cannot be used as a raw material and it must be purified by extraction with solvents to remove the inert material and preserve the polyphenolic fraction. These last compounds, flavonoids and phenolic acids, are considered to contribute more to the healing effects than the other propolis constituents [

In fact, in commercial and supplemental health care products, propolis is added in the form of extracts which are obtained by soaking crushed propolis in organic solvent or water. Moreover, in the last few years, different studies have shown the extraction with supercritical fluid as a possible alternative method to obtain compounds derived from natural matrices, including propolis [
