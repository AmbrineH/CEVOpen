<p>The variations in the chemical composition and consequently in the biological activity of propolis, are associated with its type and geographic origin. However, although propolis is a complex mixture, its biological activities are reported due to the presence of the flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ethers mainly obtained from plant-derived substances [

Hence, although propolis is obviously an animal product, a considerable proportion of its components responsible for biological activities are plant derived. In fact, the resin contains most of the compounds found in extracts consumed by people from many countries as food complements, nutraceuticals, or alternative medicine. In fact, propolis has been extensively used in folk medicine for many years, and there is substantial evidence to indicate that it has antiseptic, antifungal, antibacterical, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [
