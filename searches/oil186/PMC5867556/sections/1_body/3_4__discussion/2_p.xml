<p>The nature of the solvent, temperature, and time of treatment, as well as composition and physical characteristics of propolis samples, strongly influence the yield of extraction and quality of final products [

By maintaining the time and keeping the temperature constant, the polarity of the solvent and propolis composition are the two most important factors able to influence the quality of extracts. By using the same propolis extract, five different finished products were produced; one in powder form and the other four as liquid solutions. ESIT12 is a micronized sample containing a minimum of 12% total propolis polyphenols used in the preparation of tablets and capsules. Glycolic, glyceric, and oily extracts are largely used in various liquid products as nutraceuticals, and hydroalcoholic preparation was prepared due to its large application in the most common commercial products from propolis. Total phenolics and bioflavonoid components (flavones and flavonols, flavanones, and dihydroflavonols) were determined by HPLC-UV-ESI-MS and tandem mass and further characterized for antioxidant activity. In fact, according to its European brown poplar propolis origin, the raw propolis used to obtain the various preparations was found to possess flavonoids as the major species, with flavones (i.e., chrysin and apigenin), flavanones (pinocembrin), and flavonols (quercetin, pinobanksin, galangin, and their derivatives) being the most common components [

Up to now, very few data are available on glyceric and glycolic propolis preparations and no information has ever been published on propolis in oil, as well as propolis in powder form like ESIT12. As a consequence, it is not possible to make a comparison of the composition and activity with other information available in scientific literature. As reported in our study, we demonstrate that propolis solubilized in different solvents has a similar chemical composition when produced from the same raw material, even if a different total polyphenol percentage is obtained, i.e., more or less rich in polyphenol content. A direct consequence of the same composition is a quite similar antioxidant activity when calculated for mg of polyphenols. On the other hand, finished products may have different biological activity if extracted from propolis which has a different polyphenolic composition and quality [

 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00041" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Finally, this study could be of interest for the food and nutraceutical industries choosing suitable solvents and conditions to solubilize propolis extracts useful to prepare active finished products.
