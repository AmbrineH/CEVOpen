  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finished samples from the same poplar propolis extract were prepared by B Natural (Corbetta, Milano, Italy, 
   <span xlink:href="http://www.bnatural.it/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.bnatural.it/</span>) consisting of one powder product named ESIT12 and four liquid extracts. ESIT12 is a micronized sample composed of propolis with a minimum of 12% total polyphenols supported by sucrose and silicon dioxide. The four liquid samples were prepared by B Natural in hydroalcoholic (80% ethanol/20% water), glycolic (98% propylene glycol with the remaining 2% of ethanol), and glyceric (95% and 5% water) solutions, and oil (100% seed oil).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 500 mg of ESIT12 was dissolved in 50 mL (10 mg/mL) ethanol/water 80%/20%. After vigorous mixing and sonication for 10 min, polyphenols were extracted at 70 °C in a water bath for a minimum of 2 h under continuous mixing. After centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min, the sample was further analyzed according to the methodologies illustrated below. Liquid samples were analyzed with no further modification.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-performance liquid chromatography equipment was from Jasco (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (pump mod. PU-1580, UV detector UV-1570, Rheodyne injector equipped with a 20 µL loop, software Jasco-Borwin rel. 1.5). The phenolic acids and flavonoids from propolis were separated using a 250 × 4.6-mm stainless-steel column Discovery-C18 4 µm 80 Ä (from Sigma-Aldrich). The eluents were (A) 0.5% acetic acid and (B) acetonitrile. Separations were performed at room temperature by solvent gradient elution from 0 min at 50% A/50% B to 60 min at 100% B at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. A UV detector set at 260 nm was also used on-line with HPLC equipment.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An Agilent 1100 VL series mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was further used on-line with HPLC equipment. The electrospray interface was set in negative ionization mode with the capillary voltage at 3500 V and a temperature source of 350 °C in full scan spectra (200–2200 Da, 10 full scans/s). Nitrogen was used as a drying (9 L/min) and nebulizing gas (11 p.s.i.). Software versions were 4.0 LC/MSD trap control 4.2 and Data Analysis 2.2 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, 2–20 µL of samples were injected at a standardized concentration expressed as the total polyphenol content evaluated by a spectrophotometric assay according to Folin-Ciocalteau (see below) against a calibration curve performed by pure galangin.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenolic compounds are oxidized by Folin-Ciocalteau reactive (Sigma-Aldrich) and the blue colour produced presents a maximum absorption at 750 nm evaluated by a spectrophotometer against a specific blank. Briefly, 20 µL of the propolis extracts was added to 380 µL of ethanol and 100 µL of the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. Then, 200 µL of a saturated sodium carbonate solution and 4.3 mL water were added. The tubes were then allowed to stand at room temperature for 60 min before measuring the absorbance at 750 nm against the blank. The total polyphenolic content was expressed as galangin equivalents in %

Samples were dissolved in a buffer solution at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL or final dilution of 1 μL/mL. For each extract, a series of test tubes were prepared containing between 1 and 1000 μL of these solutions, and the volume completed to 1000 μL with buffer. Finally, 1 mL of a 500 μM DPPH solution was added to each tube. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm by a spectrophotometer. Results are expressed in terms of the percentage of decrease with respect to control values (absorbance of 1 mL DPPH solution + 1 mL of buffer) incubated under the same conditions. Readings were made in triplicate. The mean of each result is plotted on a graph constructed by plotting increasing concentrations of the antioxidant trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) vs. Optical Density (OD) values. Propolis samples’ antioxidant activity is expressed as µg trolox equivalent.
