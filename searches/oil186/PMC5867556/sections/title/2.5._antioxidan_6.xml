Samples were dissolved in a buffer solution at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL or final dilution of 1 μL/mL. For each extract, a series of test tubes were prepared containing between 1 and 1000 μL of these solutions, and the volume completed to 1000 μL with buffer. Finally, 1 mL of a 500 μM DPPH solution was added to each tube. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm by a spectrophotometer. Results are expressed in terms of the percentage of decrease with respect to control values (absorbance of 1 mL DPPH solution + 1 mL of buffer) incubated under the same conditions. Readings were made in triplicate. The mean of each result is plotted on a graph constructed by plotting increasing concentrations of the antioxidant trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) vs. Optical Density (OD) values. Propolis samples’ antioxidant activity is expressed as µg trolox equivalent.
