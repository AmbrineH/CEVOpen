 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 500 mg of ESIT12 was dissolved in 50 mL (10 mg/mL) ethanol/water 80%/20%. After vigorous mixing and sonication for 10 min, polyphenols were extracted at 70 Â°C in a water bath for a minimum of 2 h under continuous mixing. After centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min, the sample was further analyzed according to the methodologies illustrated below. Liquid samples were analyzed with no further modification.</p>
