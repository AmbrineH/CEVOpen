 <p>This research was aimed at investigating the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of 
  <italic>Bunium persicum</italic>, 
  <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>, and rose water on multidrug-resistant 
  <italic>Listeria</italic> species. The antibiotic resistance of 
  <italic>Listeria</italic> spp obtained from seafood samples were determined by the Kirby-Bauer method. The antioxidant and antibacterial activity of the essential oils and extracts were evaluated using ferric reducing antioxidant power and microdilution methods, respectively. A total 2 samples (1.88%) were positive for 
  <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. 
  <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> was found to be resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, penicillin, vancomycin, and kanamycin. 
  <italic>B persicum</italic> essential oil showed the greatest antioxidant activity (248.56 ± 1.09 µM Fe
  <sup>2+</sup>/g). The 
  <italic>E globulus</italic> essential oil showed consistently strong antimicrobial activity against 
  <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> and 
  <italic>L grayi</italic>, while rose water showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the tested bacterial strains. The results showed that after adding the 
  <italic>B persicum</italic> and 
  <italic>E globulus</italic> essential oils to bacteria, the cell components’ release increased significantly.
