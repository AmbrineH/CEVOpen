 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 25-g portion of each food sample was added to 225 mL of 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> enrichment broth (HiMedia Laboratories Limited, Mumbai, India) and stomached for 3 minutes and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Then, a loopful of each enrichment culture was spread plated onto 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> Selective Agar (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd, India) and was incubated for 24 hours, at 37°C. Following incubation, the suspected colonies with a dark brown color or black halo were selected and transferred onto tryptic soy agar (Merck Co, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 24 hours, at 37°C. The isolates were identified using conventional methods: Gram staining, catalase, typical umbrella motility and fermentation of mannitol, rhamnose, and xylose.
