  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gas chromatographic analyses of essential oils were carried out by an Agilent 6890 GC system with a HP-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The carrier gas (helium) was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The gas chromatograph oven temperature was kept at 40°C for 1 minute and programmed to 230°C at the rate of 3°C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 230°C and 250°C, respectively. Quantitative data were obtained electronically from flam ionization detector area percent data. The main chemical constituents of essential oils were compared with analytical standard and tested in triplicate.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of total phenolic content was measured in ethanolic extracts by colorimetric method using Folin-Ciocalteu. Standard solutions with concentration of 12.5, 25, 50, 62.5,100, and 125 ppm were prepared from gallic acid in 60% solution. A total of 0.1 mL of each solution was transferred to a test tube and 0.5 mL of reagent Folin-Ciocalteu solution 10% was added and after 3 to 8 minutes, 0.4 mL 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to it, then the tubes were kept at laboratory temperature for 30 minutes. The optical absorption was measured at a wavelength of 765 nm by a spectrophotometer (Unico UV-2100, Dayton, NJ, USA) and a standard curve was prepared. Then 0.01 to 0.02 g of the dried extract was dissolved in 60% methanol up to the volume of 10 mL. Total phenol content was determined based on Folin-Ciocalteu method with the difference that instead of the standard solution, 0.1 mL of the extract solution was added. The obtained absorbance rate was posed at the standard curve and thus the total phenol content of the extract in mg/g gallic acid equivalent was estimated.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The 96-well plastic microdilution tray were prepared by dispensing into each well 95 µL of Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Merck Co, Darmstadt, Germany) and 5 µL of each isolate suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. Finally, 100 µL of consecutive dilution of (serial 2-fold dilutions) each extract or essential oil were added to each well. Positive and negative controls were considered as follows: positive control—195 µL MHB containing DMSO and 5 µL of bacterial suspension without extracts and essential oils and negative control—200 µL of MHB containing DMSO without bacterial inoculum. After mixing the samples by shaker (with the rate of 300 rpm per 20 S), they were placed in an incubator for 18 to 24 hours at 37°C. The wells were examined according to the presence or lack of turbidity. Dilution plate of the well containing the lowest concentration of plant extracts or essential oils that inhibited growth of bacteria (lack of turbidity) was determined as the MIC. Furthermore, the lowest concentration that showed no visible growth on Mueller-Hinton agar was determined as the MBC.
