 </sup> A bacterial suspension with equivalent turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/mL) was prepared in sterile phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4). The sterile swab stick was dipped into bacterial suspension and then on the surface of agar was uniformly inoculated. Five antibiotic disks were placed for each plate and incubated at 35°C for 24 hours. Inhibition zones on agar plate were measured after 24 hours and the results were recorded in accordance with interpretive criteria provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The antibiotics discs (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, India) are reported as follows: ampicillin (10 µg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin (2 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), gentamycin (10 µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), penicillin (10 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10 µg), vancomycin (30 µg), nitrofurantoin (300 µg), norfloxacin (30 µg), kanamycin (30 µg), ceftriaxone (30 µg), and chloramphenicol (30 µg).
