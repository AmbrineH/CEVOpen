<p>The gas chromatographic analyses of essential oils were carried out by an Agilent 6890 GC system with a HP-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The carrier gas (helium) was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The gas chromatograph oven temperature was kept at 40°C for 1 minute and programmed to 230°C at the rate of 3°C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 230°C and 250°C, respectively. Quantitative data were obtained electronically from flam ionization detector area percent data. The main chemical constituents of essential oils were compared with analytical standard and tested in triplicate.</p>
