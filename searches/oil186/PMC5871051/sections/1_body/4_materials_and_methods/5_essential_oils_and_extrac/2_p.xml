<p>The amount of total phenolic content was measured in ethanolic extracts by colorimetric method using Folin-Ciocalteu. Standard solutions with concentration of 12.5, 25, 50, 62.5,100, and 125 ppm were prepared from gallic acid in 60% solution. A total of 0.1 mL of each solution was transferred to a test tube and 0.5 mL of reagent Folin-Ciocalteu solution 10% was added and after 3 to 8 minutes, 0.4 mL 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to it, then the tubes were kept at laboratory temperature for 30 minutes. The optical absorption was measured at a wavelength of 765 nm by a spectrophotometer (Unico UV-2100, Dayton, NJ, USA) and a standard curve was prepared. Then 0.01 to 0.02 g of the dried extract was dissolved in 60% methanol up to the volume of 10 mL. Total phenol content was determined based on Folin-Ciocalteu method with the difference that instead of the standard solution, 0.1 mL of the extract solution was added. The obtained absorbance rate was posed at the standard curve and thus the total phenol content of the extract in mg/g gallic acid equivalent was estimated.
