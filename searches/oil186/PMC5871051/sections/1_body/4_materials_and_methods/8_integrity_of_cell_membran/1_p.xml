<p>The cell integrity of 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> strains is tested by determining the release of cell components into supernatant according to the method described by Xu et al
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr26-2515690X17751314" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup> with some modifications. Bacteria from the working culture of 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> strains were collected by centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5000 rpm, washed 3 times, and resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution. Then, cell suspension obtained were incubated at 37Â°C under agitation for 4 hours in the presence of essential oils and extracts at MIC concentration. After that, 10 mL of samples were collected and centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 3 minutes. The concentration of the released components including especially of nucleic acids, 1 mL supernatant was used to measure ultraviolet absorption at 260 nm.
