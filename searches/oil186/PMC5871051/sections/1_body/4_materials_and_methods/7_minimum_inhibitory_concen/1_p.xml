<p>The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The 96-well plastic microdilution tray were prepared by dispensing into each well 95 µL of Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Merck Co, Darmstadt, Germany) and 5 µL of each isolate suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. Finally, 100 µL of consecutive dilution of (serial 2-fold dilutions) each extract or essential oil were added to each well. Positive and negative controls were considered as follows: positive control—195 µL MHB containing DMSO and 5 µL of bacterial suspension without extracts and essential oils and negative control—200 µL of MHB containing DMSO without bacterial inoculum. After mixing the samples by shaker (with the rate of 300 rpm per 20 S), they were placed in an incubator for 18 to 24 hours at 37°C. The wells were examined according to the presence or lack of turbidity. Dilution plate of the well containing the lowest concentration of plant extracts or essential oils that inhibited growth of bacteria (lack of turbidity) was determined as the MIC. Furthermore, the lowest concentration that showed no visible growth on Mueller-Hinton agar was determined as the MBC.
