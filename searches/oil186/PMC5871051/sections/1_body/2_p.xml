<p>Nowadays, the development of antibiotic resistance both in animal and human zoonotic bacterial pathogens has been related to the administration of antimicrobial agents in food animal production as growth promoters and their extensive therapeutic use. The antimicrobial agents can be passed through the food chain and contribute to the emergence of resistant bacteria that can be transferred directly to humans after consumption.
