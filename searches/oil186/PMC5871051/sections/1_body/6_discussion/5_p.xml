<p>The 4 essential oils and extracts inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>L grayi</italic>. In the present work, 2 essential oils studied had a lower MIC and MBC when used against the Gram-positive 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>L grayi</italic>. Our results are in agreement with the previous studies.

 </sup> have reported the 
 <italic>Enteromorpha linza</italic>, 
 <italic>Undaria pinnatifida</italic>, 
 <italic>Laminaria japonica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Porphyra tenera</italic> essential oils exhibited strong antilisterial activity against multiple strains of 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic>. A previous study has demonstrated antibacterial activity of cumin and eucalyptus essential oils against 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>. 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> has the same sensitivity to cumin and eucalyptus essential oils. The MIC and MBC values were 5.625 and 11.25 mg/mL, respectively.
