<p>The results of this study showed, increase in the optical density values at 260 nm of 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>L grayi</italic> treated with 
 <italic>B persicum</italic> and 
 <italic>E globulus</italic> essential oils over time, which can result in changes of cell membrane structure. Also, the cellular leakage can result from the effect of penetration of the hydrophobic essential oils. Therefore, some reducing sugars, K
 <sup>+</sup>, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Na
 <sup>+</sup> as small molecules or macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids released from the bacteria to the outside. Thus, we concluded that one of the modes of antibacterial action on 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp was that the essential oils from 
 <italic>B persicum</italic> and 
 <italic>E globulus</italic> first destroyed the cell membranes, next causing the leakage of cytosolic materials, which finally resulted in the cell death.
