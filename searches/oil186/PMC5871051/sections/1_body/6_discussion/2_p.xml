<p>The results of this work indicate resistance of 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp to antibiotics (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2515690X17751314">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> was resistant to ampicillin and penicillin as the first-choice antibiotics used for treatment of human listeriosis. Erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are generally used for treatment of listeriosis in pregnant women and patients having allergy to penicillin, respectively. In this study, 
 <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> was susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that is in agreement with the previous reports.
