<p class="p">The present work confirmed the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">B persicum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E globulus</italic>, and rose water. Also, 
 <italic class="italic">B persicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E globulus</italic> essential oils and extracts had relatively high antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic> spp. In addition, the essential oils can penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane, which causes a loss of the membrane permeability of the cellular membrane and leakage of the cytosolic materials. Therefore, it is suggested that the above extracts and essential oils used as a potential source of natural antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant
