  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The garlic (
   <span class="italic">A. sativum</span>) essential oils from Spain, obtained using three different distillation methods (Clevenger laboratory hydrodistillation, industrial steam distillation, and industrial hydrodistillation) were characterized by GC-MS (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00063-t002" href="#foods-06-00063-t002">Table 2</a>). The oils were dominated by allyl polysulfides, including diallyl sulfide (1.9–9.5%), diallyl disulfide (20.8–27.9%), diallyl trisulfide (16.8–33.4%), allyl methyl disulfide (4.4–8.3%), and allyl methyl trisulfide (14.5–19.2%). The major components of 
   <span class="italic">A. sativum</span> essential oil extracted by Clevenger-type laboratory distillation were diallyl trisulfide (allitridin) (33.4%), diallyl disulfide (20.8%), allyl methyl trisulfide (19.2%), allyl (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-1-propenyl disulfide (5.2%), and allyl methyl disulfide (4.4%) (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00063-f001" href="#foods-06-00063-f001">Figure 1</a>), whereas the main constituents in the oil extracted by industrial hydrodistillation were diallyl trisulfide (31.2%), diallyl disulfide (25.9%), allyl methyl trisulfide (14.5%), allyl methyl disulfide (5.2%), allyl (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-1-propenyl disulfide (4.6%) and diallyl sulfide (3.4%). Thus, the two hydrodistillation methods yielded very similar results. Extraction by industrial steam distillation, on the other hand, resulted in the identification of diallyl disulfide (27.9%), allyl methyl trisulfide (17.7%), diallyl trisulfide (16.8%), diallyl sulfide (9.5%), allyl methyl disulfide (8.3%), and allyl (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-1-propenyl disulfide (3.7%) as the major components. Thus, the steam distillation gave somewhat increased yields of diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide with a concomitant decrease in diallyl trisulfide and diallyl tetrasulfide yields. These differences are small, however; the three distillation methods gave comparable results overall.

   <a rid="B29-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-foods-06-00063">29</a>]. The major components of Serbian garlic essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation were diallyl trisulfide (33.6%), diallyl disulfide (28.1%), and allyl methyl trisulfide (17.8%) [
   <a rid="B26-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-foods-06-00063">26</a>]. Diallyl disulfide (49.1%) and diallyl trisulfide (30.4%) were the main components of Tunisian garlic essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation [

   <a rid="B27-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-foods-06-00063">27</a>] in which the major components were diallyl disulfide (37.9%), diallyl trisulfide (28.1%), allyl methyl trisulfide (7.3%), diallyl sulfide (6.6%), diallyl tetrasulfide (4.1%) and allyl methyl disulfide (3.7%). Douiri et al. [
   <a rid="B23-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-06-00063">23</a>] showed that

Similarly, Rao and co-workers have analyzed six geographical varieties of essential oils obtained by steam distillation of fresh garlic grown in India. These investigators found diallyl disulfide (27.1–46.8%) and diallyl trisulfide (19.9–34.1%) to be the dominant components, followed by allyl methyl trisulfide (8.3–18.2%), and allyl methyl disulfide (4.4–12.0%) [

Commercial Chinese garlic oil has shown abundant diallyl disulfide (45.1–63.2%), diallyl trisulfide (18.5–23.4%), diallyl sulfide (4.5–11.4%), and diallyl tetrasulfide (6.3–10.5%) (unpublished results from our laboratories). Kimbaris and co-workers obtained garlic oil from Greece (Likens-Nickerson hydrodistillation-extraction) and found diallyl disulfide (23.1–28.4%), diallyl trisulfide (18.2–22.1%), allyl methyl trisulfide (16.3–17.5%), and allyl methyl disulfide (8.5–11.2%) [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A hierarchical cluster analysis of garlic oils from this work and reported in the literature has been carried out (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00063-f002" href="#foods-06-00063-f002">Figure 2</a>). The cluster analysis revealed greater than 70% similarity between all oils, but five distinct clusters with greater than 90% similarity for each cluster can be defined based on the relative concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds: Cluster #1 (diallyl disulfide &gt; diallyl trisulfide ≈ allyl methyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl sulfide), Cluster #2 (diallyl trisulfide ≫ diallyl disulfide ≫ allyl methyl trisulfide ≈ diallyl tetrasulfide), Cluster #3 (diallyl trisulfide &gt; diallyl disulfide &gt; allyl methyl sulfide), Cluster #4 (diallyl disulfide &gt; diallyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl disulfide), and Cluster #5 (diallyl disulfide ≫ diallyl trisulfide ≫ diallyl tetrasulfide ≈ diallyl sulfide). Both of the hydrodistilled samples from Spain in this work fall into Cluster #3, while the steam-distilled sample falls into Cluster #1. Five of the Indian garlic varieties [
   <a rid="B28-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-foods-06-00063">28</a>] (Rajkot, Gondal, Jamnagar, Junagadh, and Gujarat) are in Cluster #4, while the Amreli variety is in Cluster #3. Four different commercial garlic oil samples from China (unpublished data from our laboratories) form Cluster #5.
