<p>A hierarchical cluster analysis of garlic oils from this work and reported in the literature has been carried out (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00063-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The cluster analysis revealed greater than 70% similarity between all oils, but five distinct clusters with greater than 90% similarity for each cluster can be defined based on the relative concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds: Cluster #1 (diallyl disulfide &gt; diallyl trisulfide ≈ allyl methyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl sulfide), Cluster #2 (diallyl trisulfide ≫ diallyl disulfide ≫ allyl methyl trisulfide ≈ diallyl tetrasulfide), Cluster #3 (diallyl trisulfide &gt; diallyl disulfide &gt; allyl methyl sulfide), Cluster #4 (diallyl disulfide &gt; diallyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl trisulfide &gt; allyl methyl disulfide), and Cluster #5 (diallyl disulfide ≫ diallyl trisulfide ≫ diallyl tetrasulfide ≈ diallyl sulfide). Both of the hydrodistilled samples from Spain in this work fall into Cluster #3, while the steam-distilled sample falls into Cluster #1. Five of the Indian garlic varieties [
