 <xref rid="B30-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Egyptian garlic essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation had diallyl disulfide (25.2%), allyl methyl trisulfide (23.8%) and diallyl trisulfide (21.1%) as the major constituents [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The major components of Serbian garlic essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation were diallyl trisulfide (33.6%), diallyl disulfide (28.1%), and allyl methyl trisulfide (17.8%) [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Diallyl disulfide (49.1%) and diallyl trisulfide (30.4%) were the main components of Tunisian garlic essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The profile identified in this study was also different from French garlic oil presented by Mnayer et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in which the major components were diallyl disulfide (37.9%), diallyl trisulfide (28.1%), allyl methyl trisulfide (7.3%), diallyl sulfide (6.6%), diallyl tetrasulfide (4.1%) and allyl methyl disulfide (3.7%). Douiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> essential oil obtained by Clevenger hydrodistillation was dominated by diallyl trisulfide (46.5%) followed by diallyl disulfide (16.0%), allyl methyl trisulfide (10.9%) and diallyl disulfide (7.2%). Similarly, Rao and co-workers have analyzed six geographical varieties of essential oils obtained by steam distillation of fresh garlic grown in India. These investigators found diallyl disulfide (27.1–46.8%) and diallyl trisulfide (19.9–34.1%) to be the dominant components, followed by allyl methyl trisulfide (8.3–18.2%), and allyl methyl disulfide (4.4–12.0%) [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Commercial Chinese garlic oil has shown abundant diallyl disulfide (45.1–63.2%), diallyl trisulfide (18.5–23.4%), diallyl sulfide (4.5–11.4%), and diallyl tetrasulfide (6.3–10.5%) (unpublished results from our laboratories). Kimbaris and co-workers obtained garlic oil from Greece (Likens-Nickerson hydrodistillation-extraction) and found diallyl disulfide (23.1–28.4%), diallyl trisulfide (18.2–22.1%), allyl methyl trisulfide (16.3–17.5%), and allyl methyl disulfide (8.5–11.2%) [
