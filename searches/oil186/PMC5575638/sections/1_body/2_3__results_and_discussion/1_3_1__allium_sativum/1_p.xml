<p>The garlic (
 <italic>A. sativum</italic>) essential oils from Spain, obtained using three different distillation methods (Clevenger laboratory hydrodistillation, industrial steam distillation, and industrial hydrodistillation) were characterized by GC-MS (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00063-t002">Table 2</xref>). The oils were dominated by allyl polysulfides, including diallyl sulfide (1.9–9.5%), diallyl disulfide (20.8–27.9%), diallyl trisulfide (16.8–33.4%), allyl methyl disulfide (4.4–8.3%), and allyl methyl trisulfide (14.5–19.2%). The major components of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> essential oil extracted by Clevenger-type laboratory distillation were diallyl trisulfide (allitridin) (33.4%), diallyl disulfide (20.8%), allyl methyl trisulfide (19.2%), allyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (5.2%), and allyl methyl disulfide (4.4%) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00063-f001">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the main constituents in the oil extracted by industrial hydrodistillation were diallyl trisulfide (31.2%), diallyl disulfide (25.9%), allyl methyl trisulfide (14.5%), allyl methyl disulfide (5.2%), allyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (4.6%) and diallyl sulfide (3.4%). Thus, the two hydrodistillation methods yielded very similar results. Extraction by industrial steam distillation, on the other hand, resulted in the identification of diallyl disulfide (27.9%), allyl methyl trisulfide (17.7%), diallyl trisulfide (16.8%), diallyl sulfide (9.5%), allyl methyl disulfide (8.3%), and allyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (3.7%) as the major components. Thus, the steam distillation gave somewhat increased yields of diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide with a concomitant decrease in diallyl trisulfide and diallyl tetrasulfide yields. These differences are small, however; the three distillation methods gave comparable results overall.
