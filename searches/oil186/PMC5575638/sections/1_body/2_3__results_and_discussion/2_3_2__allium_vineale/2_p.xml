<p>In contrast to wild garlic (
 <italic>A. vineale</italic>), garlic (
 <italic>A. sativum</italic>) essential oils tend to be very rich in allyl polysulfides, especially diallyl disulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide (see above) [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The compositions of 
 <italic>A. vineale</italic> are similar to those reported for 
 <italic>Allium ursinum</italic> (broad-leaved garlic, bear’s garlic, wild garlic) volatile oils, which showed allyl methyl disulfide (13.0–18.9%), methyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (3.4–6.2%), dimethyl trisulfide (3.5–7.5%), diallyl disulfide (16.2–19.9%), allyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (7.5–10.2%), and allyl methyl trisulfide (12.6–15.0%) [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>A. vineale</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> have qualitative similarities in composition to 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic>, which no doubt accounts for the similar uses of these two “wild garlic” species.
