<p>The gas chromatographic analysis of 
 <italic>A. vineale</italic> essential oils is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00063-t003">Table 3</xref>. A representative chromatogram (sample #4) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00063-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The major components in the essential oils were sulfur-containing compounds allyl methyl trisulfide (7.9–13.2%), allyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (7.9–12.5%), dimethyl trisulfide (4.3–17.4%), diallyl disulfide (4.4–12.2%), diallyl trisulfide (2.8–10.5%), and methyl (
 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide (2.6–12.5%). The high proportion of sulfur-containing components (74.9–91.6%) accounts for the very pungent aroma of the oils.
