 <italic>E</italic>)-1-propenyl disulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, 2-vinyl-4
 <italic>H</italic>-1,3-dithiine, diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide) were used to evaluate the chemical similarities and differences between the garlic oil samples by agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis using the XLSTAT software, version 2015.4.01 (Addinsoftâ„¢, New York, NY, USA). Pearson correlation was used to evaluate similarity and clusters were defined by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA).
