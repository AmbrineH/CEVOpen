<p>GC-MS characterization of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> oils was carried out as previously described using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This instrument was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode set at electron energy 70 eV with a scan range of 40–400 amu, a scan rate of 3.0 scans per second, and with GC-MS solution software. A ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), 30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter, with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm was used as the GC column. Helium was used as the carrier gas and the pressure was set at 551.6 kPa with a flow rate of 1.37 mL/min on the column head. The temperature of the injector was set at 250 °C and the temperature of the ion source was set at 200 °C. The temperature of the GC oven was programmed to be 50 °C initially and was programmed to increase at a rate of 2 °C/min to a final temperature of 260 °C. The samples were prepared with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> in a 5% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> solution. Then, 0.1 µL of the solutions were injected into the instrument with a split ratio of 30:1.
