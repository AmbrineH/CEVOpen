<p>Although there have been numerous investigations on the phytochemistry of garlic (

 <xref rid="B14-foods-06-00063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the chemistry of wild garlic (
 <italic>A. vineale</italic>) has not been investigated, and because of the history of the uses of 
 <italic>Allium</italic> species as both condiments and phytopharmaceuticals, we have investigated the essential oil compositions of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> from Spain, obtained by different isolation methods, and 
 <italic>A. vineale</italic> growing wild in north Alabama, USA.
