<p class="p">The essential oils of garlic and wild garlic are shown to be dominated by sulfur-containing compounds, particularly allyl polysulfides. Garlic oils from various geographical locations have shown qualitative similarities, but quantitative differences in the concentrations of organosulfur compounds, and are likely to affect both the medicinal and the organoleptic properties of the garlic. Wild garlic is qualitatively similar in composition to garlic, but there are some key differences: diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide concentrations are higher in garlic than in wild garlic, while allyl 1-propenyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide concentrations are higher in wild garlic than in garlic.</p>
