 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, three elite plants were selected from the variety ‘Anton’ (seed source: N.L. Chrestensen Erfurter Samen- und Pflanzenzucht GmbH, Erfurt, Germany, 2008) and one elite plant from the variety ‘Lubelski’ (seed source: PHARMASAAT Arznei- und Gewürzpflanzensaatzucht GmbH, Artern, Germany, 2009) based on their differing root morphology and essential oil contents (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Two elites were characterized as thin-rooted, meaning that they predominantly formed a highly branched and felted rootstock with thin adventitious roots. The other two elites predominantly formed a chunkier and less felted rootstock with thicker adventitious roots; these were called thick-rooted.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to common cultivation, in the current study, clones were used in order to have plants with known analytical and identical genetic backgrounds. Plants of seed propagated valerian populations would probably vary too much in the contents of secondary compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Therefore, the four elite plants were cloned by sterile micropropagation using inflorescences at an early bud stage as starting tissue and side shoots as propagation parts. Rooted plantlets were cultivated for 2 years in the field of the experimental station Baumannshof of the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture (48°42′N /11°32′E, 360 m MSL). A detailed description of the plant material, the cloning by in vitro propagation and the cultivation conditions are described in Penzkofer et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], where the same plant material was used.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the age of the plants, flowering was induced and shoots started to develop in spring of the harvest year. The inflorescence development influences the essential oil content and causes a decrease of the essential oil content from summer to autumn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Therefore, the inflorescences were cut off in an early stage of development to counteract the decline [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Our plant material was harvested in autumn (2014), the usual harvest time for valerian cultivation. At least one cloned plant of each elite was dug out carefully and the adventitious roots were separated into four diameter fractions (&lt; 2, &lt;  3, &lt; 4, &gt; 4 mm; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The fresh roots were stored in air-tight containers at 5–6  °C to prevent dehydration of the roots and a loss of essential oil. Prior to preparation for microscopy, the roots were washed carefully with water.
