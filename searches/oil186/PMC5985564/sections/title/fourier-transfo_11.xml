 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thin-section slices of 0.01 mm thickness were made by a freezing microtome (Leica CM 1100, Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). Each slice was screened for colorless round bodies by light microscopy that was integrated in the FTIR spectrometer. Sections with round bodies were subsequently analyzed applying FTIR imaging. FTIR transmission spectra of the thin-section slices were recorded with the FTIR spectrometer Varian 4100 FTIR (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) combined with the IR-microscope Varian UMA 600 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The thin-section slices were placed on a ZnSe window and FTIR images were produced with a 32 × 32 focal plane array detector (FPA). The spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 4000–850 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 128 scans per spectrum were accumulated.

  <span class="sup">−1</span> represents mainly cellulose, whereas the signal at 1737 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was assigned to C=O vibration of bornyl acetate. Both signals were used to display the distribution in pseudo-color images.
