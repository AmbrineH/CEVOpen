 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared our breeding plant material with the existing literature information by using classic light-microscopic imaging techniques. Many grains of starch are densely arranged in the cells and distributed over the entire parenchyma [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. In longitudinal-section slices from fresh roots, oil droplets were visible, who are located near the cell-wall [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Large-lumen cells of the exodermis were observed, however, the filling of the cell with one oil droplet [

 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The staining of the round bodies with sudan-III-solution worked well in the fresh roots, but not in the embedded roots. Probably, the essential oil volatilized due to either the use of ethanol during the embedding process or due to the ethanol-containing sudan-III-solution itself. Similar effects were observed by Fridvalszky [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] and Violon et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], who concluded hereupon that the lipid bodies contained ‘volatile oil’.
