 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To confirm literature observations we used the classic method for microscopic imaging by fixing the cell components with a formaldehyde-propionic acid–ethanol-solution (5–5–90% FPA) and embedding the fixed roots in historesin (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The starch was colored with a Lugol’s solution (potassium tri-iodide) and washed out with potassium hydroxide (KOH).</p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thin slices of embedded roots, as well as thin longitudinal-section slices of root parenchyma and exodermis from fresh valerian roots, were colored with sudan-III-solution to make the lipids visible [
