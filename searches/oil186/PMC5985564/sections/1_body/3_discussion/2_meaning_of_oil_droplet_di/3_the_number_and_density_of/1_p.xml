<p id="Par60" class="p">The mapping results showed an expected increase of the number of oil droplets per cross-section from thinner to thicker roots (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). For the fractions with low to high root diameters (RF1-RF3), the number of oil droplets was in accordance with the essential oil content results of Penzkofer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. The fraction with the largest root diameter (RF4) showed the highest number of oil droplets in our study, but the lowest essential oil content in their study. It has to be noted that the essential oil content was determined by a very small number of data points and comprised only the clone CE4, because the other clones did not develop roots of this diameter. Considering CE4 only, the oil droplet number was the same for thick and very thick roots (RF3 and RF4, respectively).
