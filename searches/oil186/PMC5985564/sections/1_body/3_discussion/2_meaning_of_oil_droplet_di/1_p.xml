<p id="Par56">With the current investigations, we were able to show that oil droplets can be found in the whole parenchyma. These results are in good agreement with previous studies of Violon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Szentpetery et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Besides the identification of the oil droplets, the number and density of oil droplets are also now available for different varieties, different root diameters on the same plant or for different positions along the roots.
