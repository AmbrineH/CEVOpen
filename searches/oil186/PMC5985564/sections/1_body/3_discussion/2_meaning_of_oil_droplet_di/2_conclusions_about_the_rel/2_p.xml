<p id="Par58" class="p">The comparison of the four clones gives only limited information for the relationship between oil droplet occurrence and oil content, due to the low number of clones, the limited genetic variability among clones and the environmental and year’s effect, which all potentially influence the essential oil content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Even Penzkofer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] could only detect trends in this regard, but identified clone CE2 as the one with the highest essential oil content. This did not coincide with our essential oil mapping data. Concerning the number of oil droplets per root cross-section, clone CE3 shows the highest values, followed by clone CE4 and CE2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, the number of oil droplets was not a suitable identifier for the essential oil content. This may be due to the varying oil droplet sizes in the inner parenchyma.
