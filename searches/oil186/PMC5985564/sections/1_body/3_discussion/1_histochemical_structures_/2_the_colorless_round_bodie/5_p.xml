<p id="Par53">Taking into account the above described characteristics of each method, FTIR imaging in combination with subsequent staining to affirm the preliminary results, seems to be the most favorable analytical strategy. The resulting FTIR distribution maps showing the strong C = O vibration at 1737 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> confirm the results of staining experiments and fluorescence-microscopy.
