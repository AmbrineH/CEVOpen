<p id="Par43">The distribution of the mean number of oil droplets in each factor level was approximately constant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Significant differences between the distributions of the factor levels of root classification (Wilcox: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), root diameter fraction and horizon (Friedman: 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, resp.) were especially visible in class nine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, C). In general, the mean number of oil droplets increased from the center to the outer cell layers. The central cylinder was almost free of oil droplets, whereas, the parenchyma included 57% (42–64%) of the mean number of oil droplets on average. In the outer cell layer, completely covered by class nine, 43% (36–56%) of the mean number of oil droplets were present, on average.
