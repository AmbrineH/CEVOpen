<p id="Par45">The root diameter of each factor level affected the number of oil droplets. Thicker root-slices contained more oil droplets, as presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. This meant, ultimately, that the number of oil droplets increased with root thickness, root diameter and in the upper located root horizons as compared to the lower horizon. As shown for the class comparison, the density of oil droplets allowed for a better comparison between factor levels. Among the cloned elites, CE2 showed the highest oil droplet density (ANOVA 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;  0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C). RF1 was the root diameter fraction with the highest oil droplet density (ANOVA 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C), whereas each horizon showed a significantly different oil droplet density (ANOVA 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;  0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D), with an increasing oil droplet density from HZ1 to HZ3.
