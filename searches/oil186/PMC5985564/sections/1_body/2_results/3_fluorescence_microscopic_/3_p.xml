<p id="Par44">To consider the varying areas of the classes, the oil droplet density was a more suitable parameter to compare the classes than the number of oil droplets. A constant density was not found. Similar to the mean numbers, the density of oil droplets also rose up from class one to class nine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Each factor showed a significant effect on the density of oil droplets (Friedman: CE
