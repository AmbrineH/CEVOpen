 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> presents the light-microscopic picture of a thin valerian root slice and the corresponding FTIR images obtained by integration of the absorbance at 1737 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 998 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (top, from left to right). Whereas the signal at 1737 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> can be tentatively assigned to bornyl acetate, the absorption at 998 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> mainly represents cellulose matrix. The spectrum presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>D was taken at the crossed lines shown in the integration map for 998 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>C). As indicated by arrows in the light microscopic picture, two intact oil bodies might be identified due to the intensive absorption at 1737 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The red colored part in the right upper corner of that image might be the result of destroyed oil bodies and smeared essential oil due to microtome preparation of the root slide. Generally, in the sections used for FTIR imaging, it was very rare to find intact colorless bodies for which high absorbance around 1737 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was observed. Unfortunately, the presence of oil bodies could not be confirmed by adjacent staining experiments.
