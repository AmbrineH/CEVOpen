<p id="Par69" class="p">Our results give insight into the cross-sectional essential oil distribution at valerian harvest time. Although the existing natural variability and the limited plant material investigated in this study only allow for a brief overview, some aspects derived from the results could be used for further investigations and for future breeding work:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p id="Par70" class="p" xmlns="">The number, density and distribution of essential oil droplets of genetically different plant material vary and allow for the selection of suitable plant material for breeding purposes, independent of root thickness.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p id="Par71" class="p" xmlns="">The breeding plant material should generally exhibit a high oil droplet density level as this is one of the factors for the essential oil content.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p id="Par72" class="p" xmlns="">A high and homogeneous oil droplet density should be aspired in the inner parenchyma in order to avoid essential oil losses during harvesting and post-harvest processes.</p>
