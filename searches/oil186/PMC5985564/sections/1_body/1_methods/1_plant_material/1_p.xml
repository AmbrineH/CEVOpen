<p id="Par17">In 2010, three elite plants were selected from the variety ‘Anton’ (seed source: N.L. Chrestensen Erfurter Samen- und Pflanzenzucht GmbH, Erfurt, Germany, 2008) and one elite plant from the variety ‘Lubelski’ (seed source: PHARMASAAT Arznei- und Gewürzpflanzensaatzucht GmbH, Artern, Germany, 2009) based on their differing root morphology and essential oil contents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two elites were characterized as thin-rooted, meaning that they predominantly formed a highly branched and felted rootstock with thin adventitious roots. The other two elites predominantly formed a chunkier and less felted rootstock with thicker adventitious roots; these were called thick-rooted.
