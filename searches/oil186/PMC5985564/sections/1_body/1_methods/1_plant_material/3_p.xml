<p id="Par19">Due to the age of the plants, flowering was induced and shoots started to develop in spring of the harvest year. The inflorescence development influences the essential oil content and causes a decrease of the essential oil content from summer to autumn [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the inflorescences were cut off in an early stage of development to counteract the decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our plant material was harvested in autumn (2014), the usual harvest time for valerian cultivation. At least one cloned plant of each elite was dug out carefully and the adventitious roots were separated into four diameter fractions (&lt; 2, &lt;  3, &lt; 4, &gt; 4 mm; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The fresh roots were stored in air-tight containers at 5–6  °C to prevent dehydration of the roots and a loss of essential oil. Prior to preparation for microscopy, the roots were washed carefully with water.
