<p id="Par34">The relative distance data was assigned to one of nine classes with a class width of 11.11%; this led to the interval limits for class 1 = [0–11.10%); class 2 = [11.11–22.21%); class 3 = [22.22–33.32%); class 4 = [33.33–44.43%); class 5 = [44.44–55.54%); class 6 = [55.55–66.65%); class 7 = [66.66–77.76%); class 8 = [77.77–88.87%); class 9 = [88.88–100%]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B shows a generalized illustration of the nine classes. Class 1 was always within the central cylinder; class 2 delineated mostly the border of the central cylinder. The area of both classes together was addressed as central cylinder. The classes 3–8 comprised the parenchyma, class 9 the outer cell layers. The area of the classes increased from the center to the edge. Therefore, both the number of oil droplets in each class and the oil droplet density were determined to compare the classes. The density was calculated as the quotient of number of oil droplets over the class area.
