<p id="Par33">For data evaluation, the determined x–y-coordinates were adapted and related to each other. The coordinates of the centers were used as new coordinate origins (formula Ia and Ib) and the distances of the oil droplets and the edges related to the center were calculated with Formula 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">II</xref>. This was only achievable when the center, the oil droplet and the corresponding point of the root edge all lay on an imaginary line. An example is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A. The corresponding point of the root edge was calculated with help of the polar angle, which must be the same for the distance between the center and the oil droplet (CD in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) and for the distance between the center and the corresponding point of the edge (CE in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The polar angle of both distances was calculated with Formula 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">III</xref>. At last, the relative distances of the oil droplets and the root edges to the center were determined (Formula 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">IV</xref>). This data was used for the evaluation.
