 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ion PGM™ was used to delineate the bacterial community structure of 10 soil samples contaminated with heavy crude oil collected from near oil wells used in the study. The hypervariable V4 region of 16S rDNA sequence was the target region. Stringent quality sequence curation of a total of 825081 raw reads obtained resulted in 84% reduction of initial reads. There are reports stating 50–80% filtering of initial reads [

  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative abundance of each phyla varied among the 10 soil samples, the predominant phyla observed to be Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the most abundant being Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes. The possible reason for abundance of Firmicutes (
  <span class="italic">Bacillus </span>sp.) could be their ability to form endospores to resist adverse conditions of the oil fields, as in desert habitats of Oman [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>–
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. Also, because of their metabolic and physiologic adaptability and ability to produce enzyme inhibitors and antibiotics, Firmicutes are considered to be better competitors in natural environment [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. The moisture content of the soil samples was too low, about 0.03–0.08 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>, which can be another possible reason. The heatmap analysis of genera showed that
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span> had the highest relative abundance followed by
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Brevibacillus</span> in all the 10 soil samples.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measures of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-diversity such as Shannon index and Simpson index showed that there was diversity of species OTUs within the community in all the 10 soil samples. Multiple rarefaction curves assembled from each sample's Shannon diversity index reached a plateau at approximately 5000 sequences suggesting that the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the full scope of microbial diversity [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>]. SHE analysis revealed the constant proportion of species in all 10 samples.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">β</span>-Diversity measured using UniFrac analysis provided a tree-based PCoA (Principal Coordinate Analysis) graph. The two approaches revealed the same pattern of clustering; the Monte Carlo simulation test with Bonferroni corrections revealed that there was significant difference in the communities present in the soil samples examined [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microbial community in soils is determined by the physicochemical parameters such as moisture content, temperature, salinity, and pH [
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>, 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. The extreme temperature conditions along with low moisture content (0.03–0.08 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) and a slightly alkaline pH will have an impact on the diversity of bacterial community in the soil. Similar results were reported earlier for Tibetan plateau [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>]. The presence of heavy crude oil can be another limiting factor for the microbial community.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of cultivable spore-forming isolates by 16S rDNA sequencing from the soil samples resulted in
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span> sp. The relative abundance of
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span> sp. in the microbial community in heavy crude oil sludge was reported in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Nigeria. [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>–
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>].
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus</span> sp. which were relatively abundant in the oil fields can be recommended to be chosen as candidates for hydrocarbon utilization study. One of our isolates,
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus ehimensis</span> BS1, showed maximum growth in presence of heavy oil and biotransformed it to lighter aliphatic and aromatic compounds demonstrating its potential in EOR and environmental bioremediation under aerobic and anaerobic reservoir conditions [
