 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from cultivable spore-forming bacteria by boiling suspended soil samples in 10 ml distilled water at 90°C for 30 min to kill all the vegetative cells and enrichment of the bacteria in Bushnell-Haas media (BH media) containing 1% heavy crude oil. The flasks inoculated with the boiled sample supernatant were incubated at 40°C for 24 h and plated on fresh BH agar plates to obtain pure cultures. The gDNA from the isolates and the soil samples was isolated using PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.). The nucleic acid concentration and purity were measured by Thermo Fischer NanoDrop™ 2000/2000 c spectrophotometer.</p>
