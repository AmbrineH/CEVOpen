 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultivable spore-forming bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing using 27F and 1492R universal primers as described previously [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], where briefly the genomic DNA was extracted using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.), and the amplification was performed using T100™ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGen). The BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems™) was used for de novo sequencing. The sequencing was done using 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Hitachi) at Central Analytical and Applied Research Unit (CAARU), Sultan Qaboos University, and was submitted to NCBI GenBank USA. The dendrogram was constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) methods, respectively, using PHYLIP, the Phylogeny Inference Package program. The ML program uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at different sites [
