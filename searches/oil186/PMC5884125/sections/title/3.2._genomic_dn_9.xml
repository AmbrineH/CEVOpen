  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(b)</a>) was extracted using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit and was successfully amplified using universal primers for bacteria, 27F and 1492R. The amplified product was 1400 bp (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The purified PCR product was sequenced using 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer and the sequences were submitted to NCBI under the accession numbers KP119097–KP119115 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sequences were aligned with the closely related species sequences from NCBI nucleotide blast. The branches with bootstrap values above 70% are reliable. The dendrogram was made using ML (maximum likelihood) method, which assumes every single site of the multiple sequence alignment independently with bootstrapping of 1000 replications. The ln likelihood for the cladogram was −6866.09722. The closer the value of likelihood to zero, the better is the dendrogram (
