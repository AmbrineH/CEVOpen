 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gDNA was amplified using specific primers targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3′) for Ion Torrent PGM analysis. A total of 825081 raw sequences were obtained from Ion torrent from all the 10 soil samples. After quality filtering 758305 reads were obtained. Clustering with UCLUST provided 755423 OTUs. The average reads per sample was 75542. The OTUs were rarefied to 30000 sequences and jackknifed at 25000 sequences.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-diversity measures of the samples were done in QIIME pipeline and Past3. Shannon index (
  <span class="italic">H</span>′) and Simpson index (
  <span class="italic">D</span>) were calculated for all the samples (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), which revealed that the species richness and relative abundance were present in all the samples, soil sample 2 being with the least diversity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rarefaction curves with chao1 and Shannon diversity were plotted with the average number of OTUs at each interval against the size of the subsample [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>] (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). It was found that, for all the 10 soil samples, the curve reached a plateau at approximately 5000 sequences indicating that sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the full scope of microbial diversity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taxonomic comparison of the OTUs identified four main phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the most abundant being Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Further comparison of genus belonging to these phyla showed that
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span> was the most abundant genus followed by
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus</span>, which was followed by
  <span class="italic"> Brevibacillus</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Planococcus</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Flavobacterium</span>, and so forth (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result was confirmed by heatmap analysis in which the highest relative abundance of
  <span class="italic"> Bacillus</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Paenibacillus</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> Brevibacillus</span> was found in all the 10 soil samples and the soil samples with more similar microbial populations were mathematically clustered closer together. The genera (consortium) were used for clustering. Thus, the samples with more similar consortium of genera cluster closer together with the length of connecting lines (top of heatmap) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) related to the similarity; shorter lines between two samples indicate closely matched microbial consortium. The heatmap represents the relative percentages of each genus. The predominant genera are represented along the right 
  <span class="italic">y</span>-axis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SHE analysis was performed to evaluate whether species proportion was similar in all of the 10 soil samples to assess the microbial diversity. The community structure was determined as a log-normal distribution, that is, a few species with high or low abundance and many with intermediate abundance [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>] (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resemblance between the bacterial communities, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-diversity, was measured using UniFrac analysis, which provided a tree-based (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" href="#fig9">Figure 9(a)</a>) Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) graph (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" href="#fig9">Figure 9(b)</a>), which grouped the soil samples to 4 main clusters. The eigenvalues for PC1, PC2, and PC3 were 0.014, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively, and accounted for 74%, 12%, and 6% of the total variance. Both the two approaches revealed the same pattern.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">UniFrac 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values were based on comparisons to 1,000 randomized trees. The 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values are significant only if they were &lt;0.05 (
