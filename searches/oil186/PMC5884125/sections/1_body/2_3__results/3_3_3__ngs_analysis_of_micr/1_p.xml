<p>The gDNA was amplified using specific primers targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3′) for Ion Torrent PGM analysis. A total of 825081 raw sequences were obtained from Ion torrent from all the 10 soil samples. After quality filtering 758305 reads were obtained. Clustering with UCLUST provided 755423 OTUs. The average reads per sample was 75542. The OTUs were rarefied to 30000 sequences and jackknifed at 25000 sequences.</p>
