<p>The result was confirmed by heatmap analysis in which the highest relative abundance of
 <italic> Bacillus</italic>,
 <italic> Paenibacillus</italic>, and
 <italic> Brevibacillus</italic> was found in all the 10 soil samples and the soil samples with more similar microbial populations were mathematically clustered closer together. The genera (consortium) were used for clustering. Thus, the samples with more similar consortium of genera cluster closer together with the length of connecting lines (top of heatmap) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) related to the similarity; shorter lines between two samples indicate closely matched microbial consortium. The heatmap represents the relative percentages of each genus. The predominant genera are represented along the right 
 <italic>y</italic>-axis.
