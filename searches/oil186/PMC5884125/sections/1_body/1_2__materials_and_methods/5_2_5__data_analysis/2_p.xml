<p>Short sequences &lt; 200 bp were removed after depleting primers and barcodes; sequences with ambiguous base calls were also removed. Sequences with homopolymer runs exceeding 6 bp were removed, as the threshold used was 6 bp. Sequences were then denoised and chimeras were removed. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were formed at 97% similarity (3% divergence) using UCLUST after removing singleton sequences [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. RDP classifier version 2.2 was used for taxonomic assignments within the GreenGenes taxonomy [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The OTUs were rarefied (randomly subsampled) to 30000 sequences and the signified sequences were aligned to
 <italic> 16S </italic>reference sequences with PyNAST [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The aligned multiple sequences were used to create tree in FastTree [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
