 <italic>Î²</italic>-Diversity or community similarity analysis was done by determining the pairwise distances using the phylogenetic distance metric, UniFrac generated by QIIME [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Monte Carlo simulations (weighted UniFrac significance test) were done to test the significant difference in OTUs in the samples in the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) tree generated by UniFrac analysis [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], followed by Bonferroni correction [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to reduce type 1 error rate.
