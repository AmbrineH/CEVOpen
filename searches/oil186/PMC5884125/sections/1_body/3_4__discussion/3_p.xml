 <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>-diversity such as Shannon index and Simpson index showed that there was diversity of species OTUs within the community in all the 10 soil samples. Multiple rarefaction curves assembled from each sample's Shannon diversity index reached a plateau at approximately 5000 sequences suggesting that the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the full scope of microbial diversity [
