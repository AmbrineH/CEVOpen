<p class="p">The relative abundance of each phyla varied among the 10 soil samples, the predominant phyla observed to be Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the most abundant being Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes. The possible reason for abundance of Firmicutes (
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus </italic>sp.) could be their ability to form endospores to resist adverse conditions of the oil fields, as in desert habitats of Oman [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Also, because of their metabolic and physiologic adaptability and ability to produce enzyme inhibitors and antibiotics, Firmicutes are considered to be better competitors in natural environment [
