<p>Ion PGM™ was used to delineate the bacterial community structure of 10 soil samples contaminated with heavy crude oil collected from near oil wells used in the study. The hypervariable V4 region of 16S rDNA sequence was the target region. Stringent quality sequence curation of a total of 825081 raw reads obtained resulted in 84% reduction of initial reads. There are reports stating 50–80% filtering of initial reads [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
