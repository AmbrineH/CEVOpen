<p>The identification of cultivable spore-forming isolates by 16S rDNA sequencing from the soil samples resulted in
 <italic> Paenibacillus</italic> and
 <italic> Bacillus</italic> sp. The relative abundance of
 <italic> Bacillus</italic> sp. in the microbial community in heavy crude oil sludge was reported in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Nigeria. [

 <italic> Bacillus</italic> and
 <italic> Paenibacillus</italic> sp. which were relatively abundant in the oil fields can be recommended to be chosen as candidates for hydrocarbon utilization study. One of our isolates,
 <italic> Paenibacillus ehimensis</italic> BS1, showed maximum growth in presence of heavy oil and biotransformed it to lighter aliphatic and aromatic compounds demonstrating its potential in EOR and environmental bioremediation under aerobic and anaerobic reservoir conditions [
