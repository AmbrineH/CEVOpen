In the study, the distribution of bacteria in steam-injected heavy oil wells (South Oman) with alkaline pH was characterized using high-throughput sequencing technique, Ion Torrent-Personal Genome Machine (PGM). The spore-forming bacteria in the samples were also identified using culture-based method.
