<p>For the advancement of a reliable MEOR protocol, understanding the microflora that exist in the oil reservoir is essential. Conventional culture-based techniques have been widely used for bacterial identification and enumeration in oil fields. Culture-based technique is selective and aids in the identification of only a few of the microbes. The problem is even worsened in extreme environmental conditions such as oil fields, where only microbes that can withstand strict circumstances will survive. Therefore, genomic analysis has become an important tool for understanding ecological biodiversity. It evades the need for laboratory cultivation and isolation of individual isolates.</p>
