 <p class="p" xmlns=""> (a) Purified gDNA from isolates electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. First lane contains the 10000 bp molecular weight markers from 300 bp to 10200 bp in length. Other lanes are gDNA samples extracted from the isolates using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit; (b) DNA extracted from 10 heavy crude soil samples in 2% agarose gel. Lane 1 is the 1 Kb DNA ladder. 1–10 represent the gDNA from 10 soil samples. </p>)
