<p class="p">The main compounds found in the present investigation were different quantitatively and qualitatively from those reported in the literature. The average rate of limonene and geranial was 17% and 9%, respectively, in different essential oils distilled from
 <italic class="italic"> A. citriodora</italic> grown in Morocco (leaves of
 <italic class="italic"> A. citriodora</italic> harvested in May period), whereas the amount of the monoterpene (limonene) is only 0.52% and the terpene aldehyde (geranial) is not detected in the present study. However, the rates of sesquiterpenes (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, Ar-curcumene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene, etc.), terpene oxides (caryophyllene oxide), some monoterpene alcohols (cis-verbenol), and sesquiterpene alcohols (spathulenol) were higher in the present studied essential oils [

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, p-cymene, linalool, citral, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, and 1.8-cineole are common compounds of essential oils of
 <italic class="italic"> Lippia</italic> sp. and thought to be responsible for specific biological effects and properties attributed to the genus
