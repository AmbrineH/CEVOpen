 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 cultures was carried out (in triplicate) by the agar disc diffusion method according to the NCCLS (the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards), recently called CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The Mueller-Hinton agar media in Petri dishes was swabbed with 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of the bacterial suspension 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml (0.5 NTU McFarland) and kept for 30 min at 4°C. Sterile filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] were soaked with 6 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l essential oil and placed aseptically on the surface of the inoculated Muller-Hinton agar plates. Plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h and the diameters of bacterial growth inhibition zones (in millimeters) were recorded. Standard antibiotic discs (6 mm) were used as positive controls: ceftriaxone (30 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g), ofloxacin (5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g), and blank discs were used as negative control.
