  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The collected leaves of
   <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> Palau were shade-dried during two weeks. Then the essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type device (samples were 100 g of crushed leaves in 1.5 l distilled water). At the end of the distillation process, the organic phase which contains the essential oil is separated from the hydrosol (aqueous phase) with ether followed by gentle removal of the solvent by evaporation. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.1% to 0.2%.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxic effect of essential oils was evaluated against P815 (Murine Mastocytoma, cell line), MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), and VERO (kidney carcinoma cell line of monkey). The used cell lines were obtained as a gift of Professor G. Lemaire, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Paris XI, France. PBMCs were isolated using the standard Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient from samples of healthy volunteers under medical supervision. These cells were maintained and grown in special culture medium (RPMI-1640, Sigma-Aldrich, France) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in humidified 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> incubator. The cytotoxicity assays were performed in triplicate on each cell line using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (Sigma-Aldrich), as described and modified by Mosmann [
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>] and Mouse et al. [

   <span class="italic">μ</span>l complete medium per well. Then 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of complete culture medium containing different concentrations of the tested essential oils (dissolved in DMSO) was added to each well. After 48 h exposure of cells to these concentrations of tested essential oils at 37°C and 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>, 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of medium was carefully aspirated from each well and replaced with 20 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml of PBS). After incubation in the same conditions for 4 hours, the plates were treated with 80 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>l of an HCl/isopropanol (24 : 1) solution to dissolve the blue intracellular formazan produced by living cells. One hour later, the absorbance (optical density OD) of the plates was determined by a Multiskan EX spectrophotometer reader at two wavelengths (540 and 630 nm). DMSO (0.5%) was used as the negative control and methotrexate (MTX) as the positive one.
