 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the essential oils cytotoxicity ranking [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], the five essential oils studied marked very high cytotoxic effect against P815 (BE essential oil is the most cytotoxic with IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 6.60 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml) and high to moderate activity against MCF7 and VERO cell lines (DE essential oil is the most cytotoxic with IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 34.72 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml and 32.90 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml, resp.). To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report about the cytotoxic activity of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> essential oil. However, the cytotoxic effect of
  <span class="italic"> Lippia alba</span>, with its main constituent citral on HeLa and VERO cell lines was reported [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. The interesting cytotoxicity toward cell lines could be due to the main compounds in the essential oil. Literature reports the induction of apoptosis by citrals (neral and geranial) in chronic lymphoid leukemia by activation of caspase-3 [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were also reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and exert analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and sedative activities [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Furthermore, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-elemene and spathulenol were reported as having anticancer activities on human glioblastoma and on MCF7 cancer cell lines [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>–
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Interestingly, no cytotoxic effect of
  <span class="italic"> A. citriodora</span> essential oil studied here was observed on Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
