 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIC values (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>) showed that the MA and BM essential oils were the most active against
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> and BM and DE were the most active against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>. In contrast, AG and BE were the least effective on
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> and on
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, respectively. All the five tested essential oils showed no activity against
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>. Other studies have shown that this bacterial strain is naturally resistant to other essential oils. The CMB/MIC ratio (2.14 for
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> and 2.02 for
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>) permitted to qualify the five studied essential oils as bactericidal [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>]. Interestingly, it was observable that cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of essential oils were different; for example, MA presented the moderate cytotoxicity but a very strong antibacterial activity. This may be explained by qualitative and quantitative variability of chemical compounds identified in these essential oils and their differential molecular mechanisms.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, the first site of action of essential oils on the bacterial cells is the membranes. This is directly related to the hydrophobicity of the essential oils components. This property ensures and facilitates permeability of membrane phospholipids bilayer to these molecules. The result is a destabilization of the plasma membrane structure and a change in its permeability to ions, protons, and other cellular components [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>–
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. In addition to the induced membrane alterations, such molecules can cross the lipid bilayer and interact with intracytoplasmic targets [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. Given the molecular diversity of the essential oils, it appears more likely that their antibacterial activity results from the combination of several mechanisms, acting synergistically on different cellular targets [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. In fact, among the dominant molecules in the five studied essential oils, caryophyllene and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene oxide have antibacterial and antifungal activities [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. Oxygenates (caryophyllene oxide, 1.8-cineole, etc.) have
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> antibacterial activity [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]; citral (neral and geranial) has a strong antibacterial effect [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. The interaction between p-cymene, ‎
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-terpinene, and the phenolic compounds could exhibt an antibacterial activity [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. Furthermore, the essential oils showing high antibacterial activity are phenol and cinnamic aldehyde rich oils (thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol) as in the essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Origanum compactum</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Satureja montana</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Eugenia caryophyllata</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span> [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>]. However, antimicrobial effectiveness of an essential oil is due to the nature and content of these various constituents that may act synergistically; the effect of minor compounds is not always negligible. Synergism between constituents can cause a much more pronounced effect than the expected activity of the major compounds [
