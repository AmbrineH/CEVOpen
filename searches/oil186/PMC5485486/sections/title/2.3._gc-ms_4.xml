 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obtained essential oil samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph Trace GC Ultra equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m film thickness) DB-5 (methyl polysiloxane with 5% phenyl); the injection volume was 1 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L. The gas chromatograph was coupled to a mass spectrometer Q Polaris MS that performs the analysis of the mass spectrometry (70 eV with an ion trap). The temperature program was 40°C for 2 min and then heated to 180°C at a rate of 4°C/min. The carrier gas was helium (1.4 ml/min).
