  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/ml (0.5 NTU McFarland) and kept for 30 min at 4°C. Sterile filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) [

  <span class="italic">μ</span>l essential oil and placed aseptically on the surface of the inoculated Muller-Hinton agar plates. Plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h and the diameters of bacterial growth inhibition zones (in millimeters) were recorded. Standard antibiotic discs (6 mm) were used as positive controls: ceftriaxone (30 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g), ofloxacin (5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g), and blank discs were used as negative control.
