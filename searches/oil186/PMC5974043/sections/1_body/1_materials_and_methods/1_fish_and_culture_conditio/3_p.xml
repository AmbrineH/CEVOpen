<p class="p">Pomegranate seed oil was provided by “ONEVA,” a turkish factory. A basal diet was formulated using commercial feed ingredients (fish meal, soybean meal, wheat meal, corn starch, and fish oil). The ingredients were blended in a mixer and pelleted using meat grinder. Pellets were dried in a heater at 30°C for 48 h and stored at -18°C in plastic bags until use.</p>
