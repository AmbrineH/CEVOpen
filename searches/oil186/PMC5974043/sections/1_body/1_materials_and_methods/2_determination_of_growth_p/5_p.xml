 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Helrich, 1990</xref>). The samples were digested with acid by using the auto Kjeldahl system and crude protein was detected according to Kjeldahl method. Soxtec system was used by the ether extraction method to determine crude lipid, moisture was determined using by oven drying at 105°C until constant weight was reached. The samples were placed in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 24 h and then ash content was measured.
