<p>Serum lysozyme activity was assessed using turbidimetric analysis (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Nudo and Catap, 2011</xref>). 25 μL of each serum were mixed with 175 μL of 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (Sigma, ATCC 4698) suspension at 0.75 mg/mL in phosphate/citrate buffer. The mixture was incubated at 25°C, and its OD was measured after 30 min at 530 nm using a plate reader (Thermo Multiskan Go). Hen egg white lysozyme was used as an external standard. The rate of reduction was converted in absorbance of the samples to lysozyme concentration (μg/mL) using a standard curve.
