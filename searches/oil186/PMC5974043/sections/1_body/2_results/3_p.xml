<p class="p">The application of one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of PSO on some blood parameters in the experimental Groups with respect to control. In particular, groups PSO
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and PSO
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> showed significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher levels of RBC, Hb, MCHC, and significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) respectively than control, while all three experimental Groups (PSO
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, PSO
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and PSO
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>) showed significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at lower levels of CHOL respectively than control. Only in group PSO
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> significantly lower values of MCV with respect to control were showed.
