<p class="p">With regard to the immunological status, in a previous study of 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Badawi and Gomaa (2016)</xref>, it was shown that PPE improved immune status by causing a significant increase in two important indices values of non-specific immunity (IgM and lysozyme) with respect to control; however, in our study the levels of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase did not show any significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the fish fed with PSO supplemented diet with respect to control. The negligible effects on lysozyme and myeloperoxidase content showed in our results were also found in rainbow trout fed diets enrichment with herbal feed additives (

 <italic class="italic">Citrus sinensis</italic>) essential oil (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Acar et al., 2015</xref>) in tilapia seems to determine an increase of lysozyme activity. Similarly, in 
 <italic class="italic">Ictalurus punctatus</italic> fed with oregano (
 <italic class="italic">Origanum heraleoticum</italic>) essential oil it was observed an increase in lysozyme activity respect to the control group (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). This discrepancy is mainly due to the different substance administered, experimental conditions, fish species and probably at the different absorption capacities of the fish.
