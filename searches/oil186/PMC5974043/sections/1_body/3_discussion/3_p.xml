<p class="p">In particular, it was observed a significant reduction of AST, ALT, ALP (specific enzymes that are indicators of cellular toxicity) in fish treated at PSO

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibrahim (2010)</xref> in a previous study on rat. Decrease in enzyme activities can be regarded as an indicator of the protective effect of pomegranate oil on cells, tissues, and organs (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Babalola et al., 2009</xref>) reported that vegetable oil sources (sunflower and cocoa butter) used in feeds of ductal fish increased liver enzymatic activities, which may be due to damage to liver cell membranes leading to the release of transaminases from the cytoplasm.
