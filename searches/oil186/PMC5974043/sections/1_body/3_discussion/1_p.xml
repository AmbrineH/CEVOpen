<p>Pomegranate seed oil has been established to have many pharmacological properties in terrestrial animal and aquatic species (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Badawi and Gomaa, 2016</xref>). But no information to date is available about its effects on growth and immunity of rainbow trout. The results of the present study demonstrated that PSO addition up to 10 g/kg in the diets barely affected the rainbow trout growth performance. Similar to our results the growth promoting effects has been reported other plant based feed additives (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al., 2017</xref>) reported that Nile tilapia (

This results suggesting that plant based feed additives has probable effects on modulation of intestine microbiota and digestive process therefore these supplements were improves growth performance of fish (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al., 2005</xref>). Our study showed that also RBC, Hb, and MCHC levels increased in fish treated with PSO at 0.5 and 1.00% levels. Hemoglobin (Hb) is a very important protein with which RBC is the key for blood oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) transport in nearly all vertebrates and some invertebrates; this protein optimizes tissue O
 <sub>2</sub> delivery by increasing the total O
 <sub>2</sub> that can be transported in the blood (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Rummer and Brauner, 2015</xref>). This suggests that PSO improves the performance of the oxygen transport thus promotes a better tissue perfusion.
