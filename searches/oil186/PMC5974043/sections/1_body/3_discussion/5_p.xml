<p>At the end of 60 days feeding trial to determine the resistance of rainbow trout to the enteric red mount disease fish were challenge with 
 <italic>Y. ruckeri</italic>. The cumulative survival in rainbow trout fed with PSO
 <sub>5</sub>, PSO
 <sub>10</sub>, and PSO
 <sub>20</sub> diets was 52.82, 56.86, and 56.86%, respectively and found significantly different from PSO
 <sub>0</sub> group. It was observed that cinnamon (

 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>) reduced mortality in Nile tilapia after challenge with 
 <italic>S. iniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactococcus garvieae</italic>, respectively (

This aspect is probably due to the interdependent influences of the active components of herb oils and to the hormesis effect. Hormesis is a phenomenon typically associated with the fields of health and toxicology. “Hormesis is a dose-response relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition.” Depending on the nature of the parameter being affected, the direction of that response changes (
