These results indicate that dietary treatment with various herb oils usually has a positive effect on infected fish, thus increasing survival rates. This aspect is probably due to the interdependent influences of the active components of herb oils and to the hormesis effect. Hormesis is a phenomenon typically associated with the fields of health and toxicology. “Hormesis is a dose-response relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition.” Depending on the nature of the parameter being affected, the direction of that response changes (
