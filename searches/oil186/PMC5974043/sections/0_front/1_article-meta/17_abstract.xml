 <p class="p">This study is aimed to assess the effects of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) supplementation on growth performance, some hematological, biochemical and immunological parameters, and disease resistance against 
  <italic class="italic">Yersinia ruckeri</italic> in cultured rainbow trout 
  <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> (Walbaum, 1792). 240 fish in total were randomly assigned into four triplicate groups (20 fish/per aquarium) corresponding to four dietary treatments: control (PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">0</sub>; no addition of PSO), 0.5% (PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sub>), 1.00% (PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub>), and 2.00% (PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub>) of PSO, respectively. After the 60 day-feeding trial, fish blood samples were collected and compared. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA) showed a significant (
  <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) effect of PSO on red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase parameters in PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sub> and PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub> with regard to control. Moreover, a pronounced (
  <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased in weight gain, growth and feed conversion was found in fish fed with PSO supplemented diets. After the feeding trial, fish were challenged with 
  <italic class="italic">Y. ruckeri</italic> and survival recorded for 20 days. Cumulative survival was 45.10% in fish fed with the control diet, whereas in fish fed with PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sub>, PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub>, and PSO
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> supplemented diets, survival was 58.82, 56.86, and 56.86%, respectively. In conclusion, dietary administration of PSO induced a reduction in mortality of rainbow trout infected with 
  <italic class="italic">Y. ruckeri</italic>, intercalary significant differences occurred on growth performance and some blood values among treated groups. These positive effects of PSO could be considered for new applications in aquaculture.
