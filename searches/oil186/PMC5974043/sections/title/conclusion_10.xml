 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation of responses in immunological parameters can be considered as driven variable condition of the animals but also it could be due to hormesis. The blood response to supplementation different levels of PSO could be hormetic, so in the future researches, it should be necessary to improve this research using other doses of PSO and different food times.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of our study showed that, PSO up to 10 g/kg in rainbow trout diets could determine an increase of growth performance and an improvement of innate immune response. The results indicated the potential of the PSO on 
  <span class="italic">Y. ruckeri</span> infection and it should be as the potential use as a substitute for antibacterial to controlling disease in rainbow trout farming because as antibiotics it should be more future studies on the pharmaceutical properties on this seed using the trout as animal model.
