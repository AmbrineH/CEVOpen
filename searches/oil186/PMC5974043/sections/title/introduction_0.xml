 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In aquaculture diseases such as bacterial and viral infections are controlled using antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics that also promote the growth performance (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Sasmal et al., 2005</a>), and therefore, ensure the animal welfare, but some of these substances have deleterious effect on animals, fish, and humans. Some natural plant origin products like vegetables, herbs, spices, edible plants, and their extracts are not explained as traditional feed additives for animal nutrition. This plant derivates that act as growth promoters, immunostimulants or antimicrobial agents, represents viable and alternative to the use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics which are not harmful for environment and which have fewer side effect then chemical drugs (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of herbal products on different species of fish was studied in several previous researches (

  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Tangestani et al., 2011</a>;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Johnson and Banerji (2007)</a> showed that herbal extract as an additive promotes hematological and biochemical performance, enhances the fish growth, and also protects from the diseases. However, studies related to pomegranate application in fish are scanty.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pomegranate (
  <span class="italic">Punica granatum</span>) is an edible fruit belonging to the family of Punicaceae, native of Iran and widely cultivated in many countries. All anatomical parts of this fruit (seed, flower, juice, peel, leaf, bark, and root) possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis properties (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Seeram et al., 2006</a>). For this reason pomegranate has largely been used as a natural remedy against different pathological conditions (microbial infections, acidosis, dysentery, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and respiratory diseases) (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High levels of antioxidant are contained in pomegranate juice, peel, and seed oil (

  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Singh et al., 2002</a>) and they represent potential candidates as a nutritional supplement for animals feed such as polyunsaturated oil called “punicic acid” (an omega 5 fatty acid) which has strong anti-inflammatory properties, for this it reason it is widely used in medicine and cosmetic (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research pomegranate seed oil (PSO), administered at different rates, was used as feed additive in diets of Rainbow Trout 
  <span class="italic">Onchorhynchus mykiss</span>, that is a species farmed in aquaculture both for food and sports in Europe and one of the most valuable fish in world (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Satari et al., 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study designed to determine the effects of PSO, which has not been investigated as a feed additives for rainbow trout on growth performance, hematological and biochemical values and resistance to
