 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of the cold-press oil were performed using a Shimadzu GCMS QP 2010 ULTRA GC–MS system operating in the EI mode 0.70 kW, equipped with a split/splitless injector (250°C). The interface temperature was 250°C. Helium was used as carrier gas (1.26 mL/min) in capillary column and the capillary column used was: RTX-5MS (30 m; 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm). The temperature program was the same with that used for the GC analysis; split ratio 1:5. The injected volume was 1 μL. Acquisition mass range 45–450 m/z. The identification of the compounds was based on comparison of their retention times (RTs), and/or Wiley libraries, and the literature (
