<p id="Par15">Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120~ 150 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center in Zhejiang, and the license number was SCXK (ZHE) 6008–0033. They were housed six per cage in a room with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and an ambient temperature of 22 ~ 25°C. All rats were fed a pelletized commercial chow for 7 days after arrival. Hyperlipidemia was induced in the rats by feeding them a high-fat diet based on the AIN-93 semisynthetic diet; the detailed ingredients of the diet are shown in Table
