<p id="Par29">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> includes the results of the histopathological examination of the livers. The results indicated that the livers of rats fed a high-fat diet were severely degenerated compared with the rats in the NC group. Liver histopathological examinations showed that there were different extents of cell steatosis in the hepatic lobules in rats from the groups fed a high-fat diet. In the NC group rats, there were no lipid droplets distributed in the hepatic lobule, and no cell steatosis or necrosis was found, meaning that the integrity of the lobular structure was maintained. The rats in the HFD-A and HFD-B groups, however, suffered from cell steatosis of the hepatic lobule, cell puffing, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the hepatic lobule and portal area, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It could therefore be concluded from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> that the garlic oil and onion oil alleviated the hepatic steatosis of the hyperlipidemia model in rats.
