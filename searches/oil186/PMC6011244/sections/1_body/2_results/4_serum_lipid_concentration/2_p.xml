<p id="Par27">At the end of the experiment, the serum levels of TG, TC, and LDL-C in the HFD-A and HFD-B group rats were significantly higher than those in the NC group rats, while HDL-C was significantly lower, which prompted the successful establishment of the hyperlipidemia model. The results listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> further illustrate that garlic oil, particularly in the high dose group, had the ability to decrease the level of TC while increasing the level of HDL-C compared with the rats in the HFD-B group. Additionally, onion oil, especially in the high dose group, had the ability to decrease the levels of TG, TC and LDL-C in the serum while increasing the HDL-C level at same time compared with the rats in the HFD-B group.
