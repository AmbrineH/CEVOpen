 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, the initial body weights of the eight groups were not significantly different. However, after 60Â days of treatment, the final body weights and body weight gains were significantly lower in the NC group. Additionally, the final body weights and body weight gains in the HFD-A and HFD-B groups were also considerably higher than those of the rats treated with garlic oil and onion oil, although they had received the same diet and had similar food intake. Additionally, garlic oil and onion oil had no effect on the food intake of the rats fed the high-fat diet, as shown in Table
