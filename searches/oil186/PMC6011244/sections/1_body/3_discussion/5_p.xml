<p id="Par34">The doses of garlic oil and onion oil used in our study were sufficient to obtain the physiological benefits without any side effects. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, histological liver analyses revealed that the rats fed an HFD had severe infiltrations of inflammatory cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> ② and ③), whereas the basal diet-fed rats exhibited normal and healthy histochemical structures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> ①). Additionally, the rats in the garlic oil and onion oil groups had greatly reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells (from ④ to ⑧ in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) compared with the HFD group. In conclusion, garlic oil and onion oil could play important roles in altering body fat and regulating lipid metabolism.
