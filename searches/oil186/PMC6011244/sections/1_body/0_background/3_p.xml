<p id="Par12" class="p">Patients with dyslipidemia are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the main cause of premature death and has been a major cause of disability and ill health in recent years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. In China, the situation is very serious, and the number of patients with dyslipidemia has reached 160 million, with annual numbers of disability and death originating from dyslipidemia-associated diabetes, stroke, cerebral infarction, hemiplegia, or myocardial infarction also increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. As a result, it is important to find reasonable and effective ways to prevent, control, and improve dyslipidemia to provide significant reductions in atherosclerosis and cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Obesity is one of the most prevalent heath conditions that may foster various diseases, such as dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. There have been few studies concerning the lipid-lowering and anti-obesity properties of garlic oil and onion oil prior to the current study. The objectives of this study were to explore the influence of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in dyslipidemia model rats, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of dyslipidemia through a dietary approach, and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion.
