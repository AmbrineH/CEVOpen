  <span class="italic">Allium sativum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Allium cepa,</span> respectively, were prepared by steam distillation using an essential oil extractor (provided by Nanjing WanQing Chemical Glassware Instrument Co. Ltd) and an electric heater thermostat (made by Tongzhou Shen Tong Heater Co. Ltd) with the existing technology in our laboratory [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. For the garlic oil, fresh garlic cloves were chopped, soaked in 3.5-fold distilled water at 35 °C for four hours, and then subjected to hydrodistillation in essential oil testing equipment for 2 hours. To attain the onion oil, fresh bulbs were chopped, soaked in 1.5-fold distilled water at 35 °C for 2.5 h, and then subjected to hydrodistillation in essential oil testing equipment for 2.6 h. All of the essential oils obtained were dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in the dark at room temperature until use. The chemical composition of the garlic and onion oil preparations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). DADS and DATS accounted for 64.7% of the composition of the garlic oil, while sulfur nitrogen compounds made up 80% of the composition of the onion oil.
