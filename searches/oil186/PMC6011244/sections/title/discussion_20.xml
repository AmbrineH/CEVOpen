 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dyslipidemia and obesity have been gaining significant attention from public health officials in developing countries because they can result in an astonishing increase in the risk factors of diabetes, hepatic adipose infiltration, and cardiovascular disease. In view of the perceived role of food and nutrition in the etiology of chronic diseases and in their prevention, effective nutritional intervention strategies for preventing or managing chronic diseases would be desirable. In this context, it would be most appropriate to evaluate the nutraceutical potential of non-nutrient phytochemicals, especially phytochemicals with hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties.</p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obesity is a cardiometabolic risk factor that adversely affects serum lipids by increasing TG levels and decreasing HDL-C levels [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. The consumption of a high-fat diet, which could facilitate the development of a positive energy balance and lead to an increase in visceral fat deposition, is considered a major risk factor for obesity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. It has been reported that some components in garlic and onion are known to be effective in the treatment of obesity and hyperlipidemia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>].

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This animal study has evaluated the anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of onion oil and garlic oil on hyperlipidemia experimentally induced through the feeding of a high-fat diet. The results revealed that the body weight gains of the rats in the HFD groups were significantly higher than that in the NC group, and the weight gains in the garlic oil and onion oil groups were normalized to or lower than that in the NC group (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). In particular, the epididymal fat pad weight, the perirenal fat pad weight, the ratio of adipose tissue weights to body weight, the ratio of liver weight to body weight and the Lee index were higher in the HFD-B group rats than in the NC group (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). In the present study, the anti-obesity activity of the onion oil and garlic oil was examined in rats fed an HFD by measuring the Lee index and markers of obesity. The epididymal fat pad weight, the perirenal fat pad weight, the ratio of adipose tissue weight to body weight, and the Lee index were found to be significantly lower in the GO and OO group rats than in the HFD-B group. These results suggest that garlic oil and onion oil have anti-obesity abilities. It has previously been suggested that onion or garlic extract may provide beneficial anti-obesity effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. In this study, the ratio of liver weight to body weight and the ratio of kidney weight to body weight in some intervention groups were significantly higher than those in the HFD-B group. These results may suggest that garlic oil and onion oil result in adverse effects on the liver, although the organ coefficient has its limitations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. The individual differences between animals and their source, initial weight, gender, batches, feeding season and environmental conditions all affect the normal range of growth and development and organ index [

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coronary heart disease risk is positively associated with TG, TC and LDL-C and is inversely associated with HDL-C. High levels of TC, TG and LDL-C lead to a high risk for the development of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Our data demonstrated that garlic oil and onion oil improved the lipid profile by lowering serum TC, TG, and LDL-C concentrations and the atherogenic index compared with the HFD-B group. As shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>, the serum TC concentration in the rats in the HFD-A (3.11 mmol/L) group increased by 88.9% compared with the NC group (1.65 mmol/L). However, the serum TC concentrations of the rats in the GO-H and OO-H groups decreased by 38.1 and 19.6%, respectively, compared with the HFD-B group. Similar results have been documented in the reports of Bordia and others [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. As shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>, the serum TG concentration (1.71 mmol/L) in the rats in the HFD-A group increased by 76.8% compared with the NC group (0.96 mmol/L). However, the serum TG concentrations of the rats in the GO-H and OO-H groups decreased by 20.6% and 35.1%, respectively, compared with the HFD-B group. The significant reduction in TC and TG with garlic oil and onion oil administration suggests potential health benefits through reductions in obesity, hyperlipidemia and/or similar to those described in the field of malignant cholesterol diseases. Moreover, the HDL-C concentration in the garlic oil and onion oil groups significantly increased compared with the HFD-B group (Table 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>). Our findings are in agreement with other studies that have shown that garlic and onion consumption increased HDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], animals[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], and patients with coronary artery disease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Finally, our results clearly demonstrated that the contributing dosages of garlic oil and onion oil were 46.3 mg/kg•bw/d (GO-M, OO-L) and 92.6 mg/kg•bw/d (GO-H, OO-H), rather than 11.6 mg/kg•bw/d (GO-L) (Tables 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>). That is, the lower garlic dose had no obvious anti-obesity or hypolipidemic effects.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The doses of garlic oil and onion oil used in our study were sufficient to obtain the physiological benefits without any side effects. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, histological liver analyses revealed that the rats fed an HFD had severe infiltrations of inflammatory cells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> ② and ③), whereas the basal diet-fed rats exhibited normal and healthy histochemical structures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> ①). Additionally, the rats in the garlic oil and onion oil groups had greatly reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells (from ④ to ⑧ in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) compared with the HFD group. In conclusion, garlic oil and onion oil could play important roles in altering body fat and regulating lipid metabolism.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study showed that the anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of onion oil and garlic oil in the rodent may be beneficial for human health, as onions and garlic are sustainable resources, and many components in their volatile oils have high application value. In addition to their traditional value as foodstuffs, they can also be widely applied to medicine, food additives, feed and other fields with broad prospects for development [
