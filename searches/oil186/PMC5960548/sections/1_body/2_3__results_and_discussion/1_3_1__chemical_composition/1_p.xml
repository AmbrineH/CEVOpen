<p>The essential oil from
 <italic> M. alternifolia </italic>can be obtained easily from the hydrodistillation of
 <italic> M. alternifolia </italic>leaves, and the chemical composition is dependent on the extraction method used and crop region the samples are taken from [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The chemical components of
 <italic> M. alternifolia </italic>essential oil used in this study are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. We identified 14 components representing 92.87% of the oil. Terpinene-4-ol (31.11%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (25.30%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinene (12.70%) were the major constituents followed by 1,8-cineole (6.83%), 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-cymene (4.23%), terpinolene (4.03%), limonene (2.50%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (2.35%), aromadendrene (1.75%), and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (1.41%). As alluded to above, the composition of
 <italic> M. alternifolia </italic>essential oil is influenced by several factors, including local, climatic, seasonal, and experimental conditions. Thus, the biological activities of each essential oil preparation will likely vary [
