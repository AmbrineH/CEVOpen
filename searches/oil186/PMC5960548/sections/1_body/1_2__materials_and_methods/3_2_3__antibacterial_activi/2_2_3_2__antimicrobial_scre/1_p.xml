<p class="p">Paper disks with 6 mm diameter were soaked with 0.1 mL of the essential oil from
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> and placed on the surface of solid media plates previously inoculated with the different microorganisms (6.0 log⁡CFU/mL) tested in this study.
 <italic class="italic"> P. italicum Wehmer</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. digitatum Sacc. </italic>were cultured at 28°C and 120 rpm for 48 h, whereas
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus, </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </italic>were cultured at 37°C and 120 rpm for 24 h. The size of the halo for each microorganism was recorded by measuring the zones of growth inhibition surrounding the disks. Individual samples were examined in triplicate. The size of the halos is presented as means ± standard deviation.
