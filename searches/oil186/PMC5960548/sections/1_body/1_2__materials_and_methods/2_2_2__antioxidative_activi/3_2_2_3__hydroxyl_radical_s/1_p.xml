One milliliter of thiobarbituric acid (1%) and 1.0 mL of trichloroacetic acid (2.8%) were added and the solution incubated at 100°C for 20 min. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: (%, elimination of hydroxyl radical) = (
