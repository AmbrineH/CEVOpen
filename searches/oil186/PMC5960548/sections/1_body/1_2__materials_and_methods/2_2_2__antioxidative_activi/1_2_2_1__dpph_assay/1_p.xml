<p>This spectrophotometric assay uses the stable 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical as a reagent [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One milliliter of various concentrations of the samples in methanol was added to 3 mL of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M DPPH dissolved in methanol. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured against a blank at 517 nm. The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: (%, elimination of DPPH) = (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>blank</sub> − 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>sample</sub>/
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>blank</sub>) × 100. The extract concentration providing 50% elimination (EC50) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
