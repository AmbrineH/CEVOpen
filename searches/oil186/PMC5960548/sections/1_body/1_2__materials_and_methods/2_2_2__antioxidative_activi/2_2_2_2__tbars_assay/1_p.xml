<p>The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method was used as described by [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One milliliter of various concentrations of the samples in methanol was added to 3 mL of 10% yolk homogenate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 0.1 mL of a ferrous sulfate solution was added and the reaction incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Next, 3.0 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added and the reaction centrifuged at 2000
