 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>can be obtained easily from the hydrodistillation of
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>leaves, and the chemical composition is dependent on the extraction method used and crop region the samples are taken from [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">3</a>]. The chemical components of
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>essential oil used in this study are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. We identified 14 components representing 92.87% of the oil. Terpinene-4-ol (31.11%), 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-terpinene (25.30%), and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpinene (12.70%) were the major constituents followed by 1,8-cineole (6.83%), 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span>-cymene (4.23%), terpinolene (4.03%), limonene (2.50%), 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol (2.35%), aromadendrene (1.75%), and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>-cadinene (1.41%). As alluded to above, the composition of
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>essential oil is influenced by several factors, including local, climatic, seasonal, and experimental conditions. Thus, the biological activities of each essential oil preparation will likely vary [
