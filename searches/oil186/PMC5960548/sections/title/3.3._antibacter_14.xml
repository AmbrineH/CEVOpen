  <span class="italic">E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, P. italicum Wehmer, and P. digitatum Sacc.</span> are different types of microorganisms.
  <span class="italic"> E. coli, S. aureus,</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> are pathogenic bacteria [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">24</a>], whereas
  <span class="italic"> P. italicum Wehmer</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. digitatum Sacc.</span> are fungi [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">25</a>]. Because these organisms infect, damage, and destroy material used in manufacturing goods or infect the goods produced; these microorganisms increase economic costs in various industries, including medicinal, cosmetic, agriculture, and food industries. Thus, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil from
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span> was investigated with three different methods: the antimicrobial screening method and the MIC and MBC assays. The results presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a> clearly show that the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia </span>displayed significant antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms tested. The Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the essential oil than Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span> had the lowest MIC (2â€‰mg/ml). These data are consistent with previous observations that
  <span class="italic"> Melaleuca alternifolia </span>essential oil possesses antibacterial and antifungal activity [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">11</a>]. According to Cox et al. (2000), the antimicrobial activity of the
  <span class="italic"> M. alternifolia</span> terpenes is associated with their strong hydrophobicity. Here, the hydrophobic terpenes interact strongly with the membrane lipids of the pathogenic microorganisms, which affect the permeability of the membrane [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">10</a>]. Among the main consequences of membrane permeability are (i) modification of the proton-motive force, leading to a deficit in the production of cellular energy caused by the decrease in ATP generation, and (ii) cellular lyses due to leakage or coagulation of the cytoplasm [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">26</a>, 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">27</a>]. The compound terpinene-4-ol, also identified amongst the main constituents of the Iranian Cymbopogon Olivieri essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span> [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">28</a>].
