<p id="Par20">Antibiofilm activity was determined by microtiter-plate technique [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with crystal violet (CV) assay, counting viable cells in Colony Forming Units (CFU) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In order to determine the PAEO and carvacrol action in the biofilm, plates were subjected to optical density microplate reading (Molecular Devices -SpectraMaxParadigmMulti-Mode) at a wavelength of 570Â nm. Activity was found in concentrations that failed to display the adhesion of crystal violet in any of the wells.
