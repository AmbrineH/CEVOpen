 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. The following antibiotics discs were used: oxacillin (1 μg), penicillin G (10 U), ampicillin (10 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftriaxone (30 μg), cefepime (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg), vancomycin (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), and chloramphenicol (30 μg). Antimicrobial susceptibility was detected by analyzing the inhibition zones, measured and compared according the standards set by the CLSI (2012) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] which classify the strains as sensitive, intermediate or resistant.
