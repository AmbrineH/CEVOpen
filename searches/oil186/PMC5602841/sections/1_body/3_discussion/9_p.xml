<p id="Par36">Regarding the CIM carvacrol, the same value (0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was observed when both strains (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and OVRSA) were tested (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Carvacrol and thymol present the ability to dissolve themselves in the cytoplasmic membrane, aligning the fatty acid chains and providing an increase in the passive permeability of the membrane.
