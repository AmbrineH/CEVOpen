<p id="Par32" class="p">Our findings corroborate several studies when reporting carvacrol as a major component of 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> essential oil. On the other hand, the concentration of carvacrol (88.17%) in the PAEO obtained in the present study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) was greater than the variation already described in literature - from 28 to 70%. Compounds such as γ-terpinene, ρ-cement and caryophyllene oxide have been found in smaller amounts when compared to data from this study [
