<p id="Par35">Rodrigues et al. (2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] evaluated the antimicrobial activity of OEPA containing 67.9% carvacrol, and found that the MIC against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 12692 (0.128 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was higher than MIC against the strain of multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S .aureus</italic> (0.032 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). In the present study, it was observed that the MIC for OEPA OVRSA strain (0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was higher than the MIC for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 (0.25 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The difference between the two studies may be related to the chemical composition of the oils, since the OEPA obtained by Rodrigues et al., (2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] had 13 compounds including thymol (1.3%) and thymol methyl ether (1.6%), while the OEPA used inthe present study contained seven constituents, with a concentration of carvacrol (88.17%) higher.
