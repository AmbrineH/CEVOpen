<p id="Par41">Arfa et al. (2006) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] relate antibiofilm activity of carvacrol with the presence of free hydroxyl group, as carvacrol without this composition does not show antibacterial activity. In addition, the mixture of free hydroxyl with other chemical compounds enhances the effect against biofilm carvacrol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although its mechanism is not fully understood, evidences indicate that its antimicrobial activity is due to: (1) Increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, silted H
 <sup>+</sup> into the cell by binding to the hydroxyl group and (2) modification of fatty membrane acids [
