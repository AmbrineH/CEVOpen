 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.Studies often relate the effect of inhibiting biofilm formation OEPA and carvacrol to: (1) damage to the cell envelope, leading to cell death and to the ability to attach biofilms; and (2) a reduction in the expression of quorum sensing activation of genes, due to decreased bacterial density caused by a delay in the development of cell growth in planktonic cells [
