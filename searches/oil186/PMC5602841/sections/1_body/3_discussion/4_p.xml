<p id="Par31">Of the 28 resistant strains, 7 (25%) showed plasmid of 12,000 bp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) that are probably related to resistance, since these seven strains were isolated from milk and presented multi-drug resistance profile (Pen + Amp + Oxa + Van). For McCarthy and Lindsay (2012) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], plasmids are responsible for the spread of virulence and resistance genes in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations. The authors assigned a total of 39 plasmid groups of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (p
 <italic>GSA</italic>) based on the combination of the 
 <italic>rep</italic> genes each plasmid had and revealed 28 plasmid groups with large genomes (&gt;15Kb),which carried a diverse range of genes.
