  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> were used for extraction of essential oil (PAEO) by hydrodistillation technique and EO chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) isolated from food and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 6538 were used to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of PAEO and carvacrol. All strains (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility profile by disk diffusion method. Determination of MIC and MBC was performed by microdilution technique and antibiofilm activity was determined by microtiter-plate technique with crystal violet assay and counting viable cells in Colony Forming Units (CFU).
