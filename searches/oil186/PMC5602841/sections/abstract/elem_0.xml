  <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a worldwide concern and in order to find an alternative to this problem, the occurrence of antimicrobial compounds in 
   <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> essential oil was investigated. Thus, this study aims to determine susceptibility of 
   <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> isolated from food to antibiotics, 
   <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> essential oil (PAEO) and carvacrol.

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves and stem of 
   <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> were used for extraction of essential oil (PAEO) by hydrodistillation technique and EO chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) isolated from food and 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 6538 were used to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of PAEO and carvacrol. All strains (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility profile by disk diffusion method. Determination of MIC and MBC was performed by microdilution technique and antibiofilm activity was determined by microtiter-plate technique with crystal violet assay and counting viable cells in Colony Forming Units (CFU).

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carvacrol (88.17%) was the major component in the PAEO. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 28 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains (80%) and 12 strains (34.3%) were oxacillin and vancomycin-resistant (OVRSA). From the 28 resistant strains, 7 (25%) showed resistance plasmid of 12,000 bp. All strains (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) were sensitive to PAEO and carvacrol, with inhibition zones ranging from 16 to 38 mm and 23 to 42 mm, respectively. The lowest MIC (0.25 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and MBC (0.5 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) values were observed when carvacrol was used against OVRSA. When a 0.5 mg mL
   <span class="sup">−1</span> concentration of PAEO and carvacrol was used, no viable cells were found on 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> biofilm.
