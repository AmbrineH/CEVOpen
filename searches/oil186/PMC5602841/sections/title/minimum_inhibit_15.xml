 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination of MIC and MBC was performed by microdilution technique in Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], using polystyrene plates of 96 wells and two strains: 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 6538, and oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> (OVRSA).Concentration of both strains was adjusted in TSB to 1.25 × 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> Colony Forming Units (CFU mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>).20 replicates of each strain were tested with PAEO and carvacrol in concentrations of 4 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 2 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 1 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0.25 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0.125 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 0.0625 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. MIC was determined from visual reading and was considered the concentration able to inhibit microbial growth. In order to determine the MBC, a pool was made of 10 wells for each concentration, and then plating was performed in 10 μL in triplicate Tryptone Soy Agar. The concentration which was not verified microbial growth was considered CBM.
