 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multidrug-resistant profile was detected in 15 strains (53.6%) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Some studies have described the incidence of multidrug-resistant strains of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> in foods and in those who handle them, confirming the assertion that one of the main sources of food contamination by 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> is the handler [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Contamination of foods by 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> multiresistant are related to care in handling, processing and transport of food, as well as correlation of bacterial resistance to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in agriculture and aquaculture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the considerable rate of penicillin resistance, it is valuable to mention the high incidence of strains resistant to oxacillin (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 22; 78.6%) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Oxacillin resistance is associated of the 
  <span class="italic">mec</span>A gene, which encodes a protein with low binding affinity to β-lactam. Thus, in vitro resistance to oxacillin indicated resistance to all other β-lactam drugs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In case of infection caused by strains resistant to oxacillin, the clinically chosen therapy is vancomycin. Thus, another fact worth mentioning in this study is that 14 (50%) of 28 all the resistant strains would persist against vancomycin (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The present research corroborate studies of Akindolire et al. (2015) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] and Nunes et al. (2016) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], that reporting a high incidence (60–100%) of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains resistant to vancomycin in isolated samples of milk or its derivatives. Baumgartner et al. (2014) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] reported the presence of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> carriers of beta-lactam resistance genes, methicillin and vancomycin in foods, including dairy products.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 28 resistant strains, 7 (25%) showed plasmid of 12,000 bp (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) that are probably related to resistance, since these seven strains were isolated from milk and presented multi-drug resistance profile (Pen + Amp + Oxa + Van). For McCarthy and Lindsay (2012) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], plasmids are responsible for the spread of virulence and resistance genes in 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> populations. The authors assigned a total of 39 plasmid groups of 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (p
  <span class="italic">GSA</span>) based on the combination of the 
  <span class="italic">rep</span> genes each plasmid had and revealed 28 plasmid groups with large genomes (&gt;15Kb),which carried a diverse range of genes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings corroborate several studies when reporting carvacrol as a major component of 
  <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> essential oil. On the other hand, the concentration of carvacrol (88.17%) in the PAEO obtained in the present study (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) was greater than the variation already described in literature - from 28 to 70%. Compounds such as γ-terpinene, ρ-cement and caryophyllene oxide have been found in smaller amounts when compared to data from this study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Phytocompounds variation in essential oils may be related to the time of botanical material collection, region, soil and seasons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Although detected in small quantities (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>), it is known that p-cymene boosts the pharmacological effects of carvacrol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All strains (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 35) of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> were sensitive to PAEO and carvacrol. Most strains isolated from milk showed sensitivity to tetracycline with halos of 21–25 mm (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11; 91.6%) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). When subjected to the test with carvacrol, 100% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12) demonstrated halos size of an equal sensitivity or greater than those of positive control. Moreover, inhibition halos of an equal or greater than those of positive control were observed in 66.6% of the tested strains from milk with OEPA.
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains isolated from shrimp showed sensitivity to tetracycline and most of them presented halos between 31 to 40 mm (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13, 56.52%) in size (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). When tested with carvacrol and OEPA, 39.13% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9) and 13.04% (n = 3) strains showed, respectively, halos sizes greater than or equal to control. Thus, the carvacrol was also more effective when used against the strains of shrimp samples. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of PAEO seems to be related to the concentration of carvacrol (88.17%), whereas all strains were susceptible to both compounds tested and the largest halos were observed when using carvacrol.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Providing support to the findings of this research, Ajitha et al. (2014) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] found potential inhibition of the species 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> spp. The authors describe halos measuring around 10 mm, i.e., values lower than those found in the present study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rodrigues et al. (2013) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] evaluated the antimicrobial activity of OEPA containing 67.9% carvacrol, and found that the MIC against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 12692 (0.128 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was higher than MIC against the strain of multidrug-resistant 
  <span class="italic">S .aureus</span> (0.032 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). In the present study, it was observed that the MIC for OEPA OVRSA strain (0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was higher than the MIC for 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 6538 (0.25 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The difference between the two studies may be related to the chemical composition of the oils, since the OEPA obtained by Rodrigues et al., (2013) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] had 13 compounds including thymol (1.3%) and thymol methyl ether (1.6%), while the OEPA used inthe present study contained seven constituents, with a concentration of carvacrol (88.17%) higher.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the CIM carvacrol, the same value (0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was observed when both strains (
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> ATCC 6538 and OVRSA) were tested (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). Carvacrol and thymol present the ability to dissolve themselves in the cytoplasmic membrane, aligning the fatty acid chains and providing an increase in the passive permeability of the membrane.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the values of CBM, OEPA and carvacrol showed better results against the OVRSA strain (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). This finding is of utmost importance, since it demonstrates a promising potential of those two bioactive substances as antimicrobial agents tested against medically resistant strain. Hosseinkhani et al. (2016) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] also obtained promising results when testing the antibacterial activity of an essential oil rich in monoterpenes against multidrug resistant strains of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>. According to the authors, the results may indicate the possibility of using monoterpenes incorporated into antimicrobial formulations in order to treat infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, the isolated carvacrol demonstrated a bactericidal activity against both strains (ATCC and OVRSA) twice as effective when compared to OEPA. This fact may be explained considering that biological action of essential oils is probably related to the synergy between all its compounds, and not only to the action of their main constituent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Sokovic et al. (2010) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] tested several essential oils with therapeutic potential and also noted that the carvacrol compound had higher activity against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> when compared with essential oils.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Souza et al. (2013) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] investigated the influence of carvacrol on 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> strains isolated from food, and the monoterpenestrongly interfered in the permeability of the plasmic membrane, in halotolerance, in coagulase activities, and in the production of enterotoxins. In addition, the authors report that the damage caused by carvacrol in the membrane is accompanied by important changes in the surface cells of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the biofilm reduction of two strains of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> caused by the use of OEPA and carvacrol. All OEPA and carvacrol concentrations had inhibitory effect on the biofilm of ATCC strains, as a statistically significant difference (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) was observed when compared to the negative control. Regarding the OVRSA strain, all carvacrol concentrations showed an inhibitory effect on the biofilm, but complete inhibition was detected at a concentration of 0.25 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The OEPA had inhibitory effect against biofilm OVRSAwhen used concentration of 0.25 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, but only completely inhibited biofilm at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>.Studies often relate the effect of inhibiting biofilm formation OEPA and carvacrol to: (1) damage to the cell envelope, leading to cell death and to the ability to attach biofilms; and (2) a reduction in the expression of quorum sensing activation of genes, due to decreased bacterial density caused by a delay in the development of cell growth in planktonic cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Yadav et al. (2015) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] found activity of carvacrol in combination with eugenol against against Methicillin-Resistant and Methicillin-Sensitive 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> biolfim.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arfa et al. (2006) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] relate antibiofilm activity of carvacrol with the presence of free hydroxyl group, as carvacrol without this composition does not show antibacterial activity. In addition, the mixture of free hydroxyl with other chemical compounds enhances the effect against biofilm carvacrol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Although its mechanism is not fully understood, evidences indicate that its antimicrobial activity is due to: (1) Increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, silted H
  <span class="sup">+</span> into the cell by binding to the hydroxyl group and (2) modification of fatty membrane acids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
