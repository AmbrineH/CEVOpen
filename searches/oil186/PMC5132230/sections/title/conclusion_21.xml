 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Aeollanthus suaveolens</span> were chemically analyzed and determined the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity. With regard to chemical analysis, the major compounds identified were (E) -β-farnesene, Linalool, α-Santalene, and linalyl acetate. The antimicrobial activity showed that the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">suaveolens</span> showed better bacteriostatic potential for gram-negative bacteria (
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>) than to gram-positive bacteria (
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>) and potential bactericidal for gram-negative bacteria (
  <span class="italic">E</span>. 
  <span class="italic">coli</span>). The essential oil showed little antioxidant activity by DPPH radical capture method when compared with standard vitamin C and rutin. However, it showed high Cytotoxic activity on 
  <span class="italic">Artemia salina</span>. The data show the importance of preliminary bioassays as a screening of the biological potential of plant products, as well as the importance of these products as a source of bioactive compounds.
