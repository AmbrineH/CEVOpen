 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of natural products as raw material for synthesis of bioactive substances, especially drugs, has been widely reported over the time [
  <a rid="pone.0166684.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0166684.ref001">1</a>]. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the world often employs indigenous or traditional medicines for their primary health care needs, especially those that use therapies that involve the use of herbal medicines. Brazil has a huge biodiversity, where much of the native plant species has not been studied. It is estimated that about 3000 essential oils are known, of which about three hundred are commercially important, intended mainly for the fragrance market [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are organic compounds of heterogeneous chemical structure that are widely distributed in higher plants. The constituents of the essential oils may belong to several classes of compounds, but terpenes and phenylpropenes are the most commonly compounds found. Terpenes found more frequently in essential oils are monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes minor constituents of essential oils [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Lamiaceae family comprises 240 genders and 7200 species of nearly cosmopolitan distribution. In Brazil, there are 46 native genera and about 524 species [
  <a rid="pone.0166684.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0166684.ref005">5</a>]. In folk medicine, the Lamiaceae family ranks third in order of importance, with many species with biologically active substances [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">suaveolens</span> popularly known as catinga de mulata, belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is an herb with about 40 cm tall, circular stem branched, petiolate leaves, coated with trichomes with aromatic essence in its pre-flowering and valve. It has metaclamideas flowers type bisexual, trimerous. Its androecium has didynamous stamens, spherical pollen grains, with supero and unilocular carpels. It has its ovarian in a gynobasic type supero, and the inflorescence racemes [

  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">suaveolens</span> is used to control epileptic seizures, combat fever, headache, the onset of stroke, "quebranto" (it is a kind of bad enchantment). Its sheet is utilized in form of tea and juice [

In riverine community of the Solim√µes River in Amazonas, the species is used to treat gastritis, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Their baths are used to relieve symptoms in victims of "mau-olhado" (it is also a kind of bad enchantment) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few studies have been reported on a cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of essential oil species of this family. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the chemical composition, antimicrobial activity (against gram-negative and gram-positive), toxicity (compared to the larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Artemia salina</span>), and antioxidant activity of the essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>.
