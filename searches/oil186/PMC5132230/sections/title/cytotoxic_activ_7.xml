 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity assay against 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">salina</span> Leach was based on the technique of Araujo et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0166684.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0166684.ref014">14</a>] and Lobo et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0166684.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0166684.ref015">15</a>], with adaptations. an aqueous solution of synthetic sea salt was prepared (35.5 gL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) for the incubation of 25 mg of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">salina</span> eggs, which were placed in the dark for 24 h to larvae hatching (nauplius), then the nauplius were exposed to artificial light in 24 hour period to reach metanauplius stage. The mother solution was prepared to contain 54 mg of essential oil added 22.5 mL of synthetic sea salt solution and 4.5 mL of 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to facilitate solubilization of it.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The metanauplius were selected and divided into 7 groups of 10 subjects in each test tube, held in triplicate. Each group received aliquots of the stock solution (2500, 1250, 625, 250, 25 and 2.5 uL), which were then completed to 5 mL volume with a synthetic sea salt solution to yield final solutions with the following concentrations 1000, 500, 250, 100, 10 and 1 Î¼g.mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. Tests were performed in triplicates. To the test control, it was used a saline solution. After 24 hours it was counted the number of dead. The lethal concentration that causes 50% mortality in the population (LC
  <sub>50</sub>) was determined by probit analysis using the software SPSS [version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA].
