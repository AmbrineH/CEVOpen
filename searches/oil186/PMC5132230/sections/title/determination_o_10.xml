 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIC determination was performed by diluting technical microplate (96 wells) according to the protocol established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [
  <a rid="pone.0166684.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0166684.ref016">16</a>], with some adjustments.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bacteria were initially taken from the stock cultures maintained on Mueller-Hinton broth (MHC) for 18 h at 37°C. After bacterial growth, an inoculum in 0.9% saline solution was prepared for each colony, adjusted to 0.5 McFarland scale, further diluted in MHC and tested in concentration 1,5 x10
  <span class="sup">7</span> Colony forming unit (CFU/mL).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the MIC, the EO was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (4% DMSO). The orifices of the microplate were filled with 50 μL NaCl and 50 μL of solution OE 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">suaveolens</span>. Then serial dilutions were made from 100 to 0.048 μg.mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. Additionally, 50 μL was distributed suspensions of microorganisms in each well of the microplate. As a positive control, it was used amoxicillin (50 μL.mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). There were performed the control of the culture medium, EO control and the negative control (4% DMSO). The microplates were incubated at 37°C for 24h. The experiments were performed in triplicate. The MIC was considered the lowest concentration of EO which was not displayed microbial growth. The presence of turbidity in the wells indicated microbial growth and therefore there was no antimicrobial activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination MBC was performed based on the results obtained in testing the MIC. The wells of microplates of microbial growth were replicated in Muller-Hinton agar and incubated at 37°C for 24h. The MBC was considered as the lowest concentration of essential oil in which, there was no growth of microorganisms in the Petri dishes, and there was an elimination of microorganisms.</p>
