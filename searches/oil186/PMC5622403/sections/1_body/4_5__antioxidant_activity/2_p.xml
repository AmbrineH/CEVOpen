<p>The pronounced antioxidant activity may be due to the phenolic constituents. 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> oil showed maximal DPPH activity at dose of 2 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B110-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], however, 
 <italic>A. herba</italic>-
 <italic>alba</italic> oil showed strong DPPH activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 6 μg/mL) than ABTS assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 40 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B72-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In another study, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 
 <italic>A. turanica</italic> oil reported were 7.00 mg/mL, 9.69 μg and 14.63 μg, in DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide anion radicals, respectively. The oil showed ferrous-ion chelating activity at 16.97 μg of IC
 <sub>50</sub> [
 <xref rid="B59-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] reported that 0.005 mg/mL of ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> oil showed 121.5% radicle scavenging activity. However, essential oil of 
 <italic>A. deserti</italic> exhibited more antioxidant activity by DPPH free radical scavenging method (57.2%) than that of β-carotene bleaching test (50%) [
 <xref rid="B17-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the β-carotene method, 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> oil also showed 50% scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the contrary, essential oils from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, 
 <italic>A. biennis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. cana</italic>, 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. frigida</italic>, 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ludoviciana</italic> from Western Canada showed poor antioxidant activity in both the β-carotene/linoleate model and DPPH radical scavenging tests [
 <xref rid="B112-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In addition, the antioxidant and DPPH radical scavenging activities of camphor and 1, 8-cineole isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species were determined in vitro [
 <xref rid="B113-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B114-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] reported more IC
 <sub>50</sub> (146.3 μg/mL) of 
 <italic>A. scoparia</italic> than that of the antioxidant BHT (140.9 μg/mL) in DPPH bioassay. The residue essential oil also scavenged OH with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 145.2 μg/mL in the Fenton reaction using a deoxyribose assay. However, unlike scavenging of OH, residue essential oil exhibited a decreased scavenging activity towards H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 270.1 μg/mL). They also reported that OH scavenging activities of citronellal and citronellol (25–200 μg/mL) were 8–34 and 11–55%, respectively. For the 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> oil, 50% DPPH radicle scavenging inhibition was reported at 1.1 μL/mL, while it increased for 
 <italic>A. abyssinica</italic> (28.9 μL/mL) oil. In lipid peroxidation bioassay only 0.09 μL/mL of oil is required for 50% inhibition [
 <xref rid="B115-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. From Tunisia, Riahi et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported the variable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (28.2 and 46.5 g/mL of leaf and flower oils, resp.) in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> oil. Additionally, essential oils from leaves (595.26 mol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L) and flowers (286.42 mol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L) also exhibited significant ferric-reducing antioxidant activity. From Serbia, 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> oil showed 50% scavenging of radicle cations at 2.90 μg/mL in DPPH bioassay, and 50% antioxidant activity at 0.640 μg/mL in ABTS assay [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, oil did not show superoxide-scavenging activity. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the chemical constituents in DPPH and ABTS methods reported were 4.00 and 1.79 μg/mL for Artemisia ketone, 87.0 and 30.1 μg/mL for α-pinene, 47.9 and 6.46 μg/mL for 1,8-Cineole, and 34.4 and 23.6 μg/mL for camphor, respectively. Mohammadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils extracted before flowering stage exhibited strong DPPH activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.307 mg/mL) than that of the oils extracted at flowering (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.11 mg/mL), and after flowering stage (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.26 mg/mL). This may be due to presence of effective compounds such as sabinene, beta-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, p-cymene, and chamazulene which were more (58.36%) before flowering stage than that of at flowering (48.98%) and after flowering (53.99%). This may be also due to synergistic effect of the compounds [
