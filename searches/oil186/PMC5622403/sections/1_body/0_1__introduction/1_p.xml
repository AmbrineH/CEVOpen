<p>Aromatic and medicinal plants are important sources of secondary metabolites, which have a wide range of applications in control of plant and human diseases, cosmetics, as well as in the pharmaceutical industry [
 <xref rid="B1-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the plant kingdom, family Asteraceae is endowed with essential oil-yielding plants, and among these plants, the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> occupies top position for its bio-prospection. The genus consists of small herbs and shrubs, found in northern temperate regions and comprises of about 500 species from South Asia, North America and European countries [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Species of the genus are called by the common names mugwort, wormwood and sagebrush. Due to presence of terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones, most of the species possess strong aromas and bitter tastes, which discourage herbivory, and may have had a selective advantage [
 <xref rid="B3-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These species have wide and varied applications in plant and human disease control and in the pharmaceutical industry. There are several species of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> that have been investigated as antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, insecticidal, repellent and anticonvulsant agents [
 <xref rid="B4-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although a review on the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> was published by Abad et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on the chemical composition, ethanopharmacological and biocidal activity of essential oils, they took the data from 2000–2011, and mainly focused on human pathogens. Recently, another review compiled by Al-Snafi [
 <xref rid="B6-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which focused only on 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic>, revealed several pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, insecticidal, antivenomous, and many other pharmacological effects. In this review, we have compiled the data from 2012–2017 on chemical composition, antimicrobial, insecticidal and antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species. Regarding antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of essential oils, here, we have mainly focused on pathogens and pests of plants and, since Abad et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] did not describe earlier literature on antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> oils on same aspects and also antioxidant activity, so in this review we have also covered the literature from 2000 onwards on these aspects.
