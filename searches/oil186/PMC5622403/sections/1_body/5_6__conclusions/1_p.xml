<p>Among herbal plants of the world, genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> biological activity is comparatively less explored against plant pathogens and insect pests. This genus is represented by more than 40 species, especially in the tropics. This review covers the chemical composition of essential oils from different geographical regions where a significant difference in the composition of different species of the same genus is observed. Major components consisted of several terpenes, terpenoids and phenolic compounds; and 1, 8-cineole, beta-pinene, thujone, artemisia ketone, camphor, caryophyllene, camphene and germacrene D were dominant in several species. The different 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> oils and their compounds have been reported as effective antimicrobial, insecticidal and antioxidant agents. Some oils also exhibited poor to moderate potency against pests and pathogens. Antioxidant activity found in oils is basically due to presence of phenolic compounds. The information summarized here is intended to serve as a reference tool to people in the field of plant protection and natural products chemistry. Although the current review focuses on the antimicrobial role of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> essential oils against phytopathogens, it has also shown promising results against several human and animal pathogens. Recently this genus has attracted attention of the world when it commanded a Nobel prize regarding its use in traditional medicine for combating malaria. Although preliminary studies have been done on several species of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> regarding its antimicrobial, antioxidant, insecticidal properties, elaborate bioprospection on its probable bioactivites against plant pathogens and pests is needed at field level. Recent times are desperate times where research interest has shifted towards exploration of natural compounds, especially for human welfare. More accurate reporting and data analysis is still needed. Other major issues such as mammalian toxicity, residual toxicity, phytoxicity and legal regulations/obligation and its long-term physiological and ecological effects of the effective oils need to be answered.
