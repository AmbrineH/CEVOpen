<p>Plant essential oils are volatile in nature and consist of a complex mixture of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which give strong odor to the essential oils. These essential oils are extracted from plants by various methods such as steam or hydro-distillation methods and are frequently being used in the natural product laboratory [
 <xref rid="B7-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Essential oils are composed of more than 60 different components in different concentrations; among them few have higher amounts of composition. From time to time, the chemical composition of essential oils of the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> has been studied by researchers from the different regions of the world. The essential oil composition of genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> investigated during 2012â€“2017 is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00068-t001">Table 1</xref>. The table shows that investigator used leaf, stem, areal part and inflorescence for essential oil extraction and GC and GC/MS methods for the chemical analysis. 1, 8-Cineole, beta-pinene, thujone, artemisia ketone, camphor, caryophyllene, camphene and germacrene D were the major components reported in the essential oils of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00068-t001">Table 1</xref>). The table also shows that the composition of essential oil of the same species varied in different investigations depending upon a change of geographical origin. Variation in the volatile components of these plants may occur during plant ontogeny or growth at different altitudes. However, few chemical constituents were restricted to limited species. For instance, methyl chavicol was only reported in higher amounts in 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, piperitone in 
 <italic>A. judaica,</italic> capillene in 
 <italic>A. stricta</italic> and chamazulene in 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> L, artedouglasia oxide in 
 <italic>A. stelleriana</italic>. Most of the investigations into the chemical composition of essential oils were from Iran, followed by India and China.
