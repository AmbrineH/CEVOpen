<p>In addition to essential oil screening, chemical compounds isolated from different species of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> have also been evaluated against plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B81-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. 5-phenyl-1,3-pentadiyne and capillarin isolated from 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> oil showed fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>C. fragariae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Dadasoglu et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] assessed some chemical constituents like camphor, caryophyllene oxide, linalool, 1, 8-cineole, teminen-4-ol, borneol and α-terpineol isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, 
 <italic>A. santonicum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. spicigera</italic> oils against plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The MIC value of linalool was in the range of 50–110 mg/mL, terpinen-4-ol, 60–110 mg/mL for 
 <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic>vitians</italic> RK-Xcvi; α-terpineol-8, 60–70 mg/mL for 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cichorii</italic> RK-166, 
 <italic>P. huttiensis</italic> RK-260, 
 <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>syringae</italic> RK-204 and 
 <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. 
 <italic>vesicatoria</italic>. Other chemical compounds such as caryophyllene oxide, bomeol, camphor and 1, 8-cineole did not show activity against any of the pathogens. Additionally, camphor, 1, 8-cineole and chamazulene isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> oil from the Turkish population has been described as an effective fungicidal agent against wilt fungi 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B83-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and from Uruguay the same species rich in thujone showed potent fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B84-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Thus, efficacy of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> oils may be due to the presence of these chemical constituents and these chemical constituents can be used as potential antimicrobial agents against said pathogens [
 <xref rid="B74-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Mycologists assumed that these chemical constituents present in the essential oils cause degeneration of fungal hyphae result in potent antifungal activity. Chemical compounds of essential oils dissolved in the membranes and therefore increase the permeability of the cell membrane, resulting in membrane swelling and reduction of membrane function [
 <xref rid="B85-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Additionally, essential oils penetrate the cell walls of fungi due to their lipophilic property therefore affecting the enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis reactions, thus causes morphological changes in fungi which further lead to the lysis of the fungal cell wall [
