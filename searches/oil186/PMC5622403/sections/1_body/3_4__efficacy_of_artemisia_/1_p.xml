<p>Research has been conducted to see the effect of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> oils against insect pests of agricultural crops, especially pests of stored products, in order to search out their efficacy as a repellent, insecticidal agent or antifeedant. From several national and international research institutions, investigators evaluated the essential oils from different species of genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> against storage and field insect pests. 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> essential oil exhibited insecticidal effects against stored grain pest 
 <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> at the dose of 50 μL in Petri dish [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A 37 μL/L and 24 h of exposure time of 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic> oil was sufficient to cause 100% mortality of 
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic>, Sitophilus oryzae and 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum.</italic> LC
 <sub>50</sub> (lethal concentration) values estimated for oil were 1.45 μL/L against 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic>, 3.86 μL/L against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> and 16.76 μL/L against 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In a filter-paper arena test, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> oil had a very strong repellent activity against 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> adults at a 0.6 μL/mL (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). In fumigation tests, 8.0 μL/mL dose of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> oil exhibited 100% mortality of 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> adults; mortality of larvae achieved was only 53%. A 20 μL/L air and a 96 h exposure of the oil showed 100% ovicidal activity; however, at a higher dose (60 μL/L) of this oil no larvae, pupae and adults were observed [
 <xref rid="B88-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In fumigant toxicity test, 11.2 and 15.0 mg/L air LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were reported against 
 <italic>Sitophilus zeamais</italic> adults, while in a contact toxicity test LD
 <sub>50</sub> (lethal dose) were 55.2 and 112.7 mg/adult for 
 <italic>A. lavandulaefolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sieversiana</italic> oils, respectively [
 <xref rid="B89-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In another study [
 <xref rid="B90-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], they found LC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.31 and 7.35 mg/L, respectively for 
 <italic>A. capillaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. mongolica</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> adults in fumigant bioassay, while in contact bioassay LD
 <sub>50</sub> values were 105.95 and 87.92 μg/adult, respectively. Again, 
 <italic>A. scoparia</italic> essential oil achieved 100% mortality of 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> at 37 μL/L air (24 h) in fumigant bioassay with LC
 <sub>50</sub> for the oil was 1.46 μL/L against 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> and 2.05 μL/L air against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B91-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Similarly, 80–90% mortality of granary weevil, 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> (L.) was reported due to 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, 
 <italic>A. santonicum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. spicigera</italic> oils at a dose of 9 μL/L air after 48 h of exposure [
 <xref rid="B92-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. princeps</italic> oil when mixed with 
 <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, it showed strong repellent effect in 1:1 ratio and 1000 μg/mL of dose exhibited insecticidal action [
 <xref rid="B93-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. LC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <italic>A. vestita</italic> oil against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> in fumigant bioassay was 13.42 mg/L air, while LD
 <sub>50</sub> reported was 50.62 mg/adult in contact bioassay [
 <xref rid="B94-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Later on, using same insect, they [
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] determined 6.29 and 17.01 mg/L air LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>A. giraldii</italic> and 
 <italic>A. subdigitata</italic> oils in fumigant test and that of corresponding LD
 <sub>50</sub> 40.51 and 76.34 μg/adult, in a contact test. EC
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> oil was estimated to be 2.6 and 4.1 μL/mL against 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B95-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of

 <sub>50</sub> against 
 <italic>L. bostrychophila</italic> [
 <xref rid="B96-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. This oil has also been proved as an effective insecticide against larval, pupal and adult stages of 
 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B97-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. 
 <italic>Plodia interpuntella</italic>, a polyphagous insect pest of different stored products worldwide, is found to be controlled by 
 <italic>A. khorassanica</italic> essential oil (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 9.6 μL/L air) with lethal time reported at 2.07 h [
 <xref rid="B98-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Sharifian et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] found that 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> was more susceptible (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 52.47 μL/L air) and 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> was more tolerant (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 279.86 μL/L air) towards 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> essential oil after 24 h of exposure. Respective LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LC

 <italic>A. argyi</italic> essential oil determined by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] were 6.42 μg/adult and 8.04 mg/L air against 
 <italic>Lasioderma serricorne</italic> adults. Their other report on 
 <italic>A. stolonifera</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B45-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed LD

 <italic>T. castaneum</italic>. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>A. frigida</italic> essential oil exhibited 17.97 μg/adult and 254.38 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> LD
