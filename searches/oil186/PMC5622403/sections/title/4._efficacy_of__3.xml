  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> Oils against Insect Pests
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has been conducted to see the effect of 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> oils against insect pests of agricultural crops, especially pests of stored products, in order to search out their efficacy as a repellent, insecticidal agent or antifeedant. From several national and international research institutions, investigators evaluated the essential oils from different species of genus 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> against storage and field insect pests. 
  <span class="italic">A. arborescens</span> essential oil exhibited insecticidal effects against stored grain pest

  <span class="italic">A. sieberi</span> oil was sufficient to cause 100% mortality of 
  <span class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</span>, Sitophilus oryzae and 
  <span class="italic">Tribolium castaneum.</span> LC
  <sub>50</sub> (lethal concentration) values estimated for oil were 1.45 μL/L against 
  <span class="italic">C. maculatus</span>, 3.86 μL/L against

  <a rid="B87-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-medicines-04-00068">87</a>]. In a filter-paper arena test, 
  <span class="italic">A. vulgaris</span> oil had a very strong repellent activity against 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span> adults at a 0.6 μL/mL (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>). In fumigation tests, 8.0 μL/mL dose of 
  <span class="italic">A. vulgaris</span> oil exhibited 100% mortality of 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span> adults; mortality of larvae achieved was only 53%. A 20 μL/L air and a 96 h exposure of the oil showed 100% ovicidal activity; however, at a higher dose (60 μL/L) of this oil no larvae, pupae and adults were observed [

  <span class="italic">A. princeps</span> oil when mixed with

This revealed that the toxic properties of the oil could be attributed to the synergistic effects of its diverse major and minor components. All these results evidence that essential oils from these species of 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> oils and their constituents can be used in the formulation of botanical insecticides against the said insects for the long-term preservation of food commodities infested by these insects. The mechanism behind the insect mortality in the contact toxicity test is that the volatiles penetrate in the insect body via the respiratory system and result in abnormal breathing, which leads to asphyxiation and finally the death of insects [
  <a rid="B103-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103-medicines-04-00068">103</a>]. During fumigant application, main target sites of essential oils and their constituents in insects is the octopaminergic system. When insects are exposed to the essential oils, a breakdown of the nervous system of insects occurs [
  <a rid="B104-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104-medicines-04-00068">104</a>] which lead to the blockage of the nerve impulse, later paralysis and then death of the insects occurs.
