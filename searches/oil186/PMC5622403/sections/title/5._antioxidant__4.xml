 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils and chemical constituents of several 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> species have been investigated in the laboratory to protect against oxidative damage by inhibiting or quenching free radicals and reactive oxygen species. They have been proved as alternative antioxidants of synthetics. The antioxidant properties of the oils were assessed by several methods such as β-carotene bleaching (BCB) test, the 2,20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method, thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC I-III assay), Total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter assay (TRAP assay), N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylendiamine assay (DMPD assay), 2,2′-Azinobis 3-Ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-Sulphonate (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-
  <span class="sc">l</span>-picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH assay), Photochemiluminescence assay (PCL assay) and Ferric reducing ability of plasma assay (FRAP assay) [
  <a rid="B105-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105-medicines-04-00068">105</a>]. We assessed the antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">A. nilagirica</span> essential oil in our laboratory and found that the oil significantly inhibited radical cation formation, with 15.729 μL IC
  <sub>50</sub> (Inhibitory concentration) and 13.539 μL IC
  <sub>50</sub> preventing the bleaching of β-carotene [
  <a rid="B106-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106-medicines-04-00068">106</a>]. While this oil exhibited higher antioxidant activity in the experiment of Sandip et al. [
  <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00068">33</a>] in the DPPH (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 6.72 μg/mL) test, they reported the 
  <span class="italic">A. chamaemelifolia</span> essential oil as weak antioxidant. Oil of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">scoparia</span> induced secondary metabolites production in root cells viz., scavenging enzymes—superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate and guaiacol peroxide and was phytotoxic to root growth causing its inhibition [
  <a rid="B107-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107-medicines-04-00068">107</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">A. annua</span> essential oil (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 27.07 mg/mL) was able to reduce the stable violet DPPH radical to the yellow DPPH-H, reaching 50% of reduction. However, IC
  <sub>50</sub> reported in ABTS method was 5.97 mg/mL lower than that of DPPH method. This oil was also 50% able to reduce the ferric ions to ferrous ions (Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>) at 127.17 mg/mL [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00068">11</a>]. This oil showed 18% antioxidant activity of the reference compound (tocopherol) [
  <a rid="B108-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-medicines-04-00068">108</a>]. Phenolic compounds present in the 
  <span class="italic">A. campestris</span> essential oil contributed its major antioxidant activity, where 47.66 μg/mL EC
  <sub>50</sub> was reported in radical scavenging activity, 5.36 μg/mL in FRAP, 0.175 μg/mL in superoxide scavenging activity and 0.034 μg/mL in OH scavenging activity [
  <a rid="B109-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-medicines-04-00068">109</a>]. Thus, this oil can be used as an antioxidant in the pharmaceutical industry.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pronounced antioxidant activity may be due to the phenolic constituents. 
  <span class="italic">A. campestris</span> oil showed maximal DPPH activity at dose of 2 mg/mL [
  <a rid="B110-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110-medicines-04-00068">110</a>], however, 
  <span class="italic">A. herba</span>-
  <span class="italic">alba</span> oil showed strong DPPH activity (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 6 μg/mL) than ABTS assay (IC

  <a rid="B72-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-medicines-04-00068">72</a>]. In another study, IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 
  <span class="italic">A. turanica</span> oil reported were 7.00 mg/mL, 9.69 μg and 14.63 μg, in DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide anion radicals, respectively. The oil showed ferrous-ion chelating activity at 16.97 μg of IC
  <sub>50</sub> [
  <a rid="B59-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-medicines-04-00068">59</a>]. Ali et al. [
  <a rid="B111-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111-medicines-04-00068">111</a>] reported that 0.005 mg/mL of ethyl acetate fraction of 
  <span class="italic">A. macrocephala</span> oil showed 121.5% radicle scavenging activity. However, essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">A. deserti</span> exhibited more antioxidant activity by DPPH free radical scavenging method (57.2%) than that of β-carotene bleaching test (50%) [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00068">17</a>]. In the β-carotene method,

  <span class="italic">A. dracunculus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. frigida</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. longifolia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. ludoviciana</span> from Western Canada showed poor antioxidant activity in both the β-carotene/linoleate model and DPPH radical scavenging tests [
  <a rid="B112-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112-medicines-04-00068">112</a>]. In addition, the antioxidant and DPPH radical scavenging activities of camphor and 1, 8-cineole isolated from 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> species were determined in vitro [
  <a rid="B113-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-medicines-04-00068">113</a>]. Singh et al. [
  <a rid="B114-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114-medicines-04-00068">114</a>] reported more IC
  <sub>50</sub> (146.3 μg/mL) of 
  <span class="italic">A. scoparia</span> than that of the antioxidant BHT (140.9 μg/mL) in DPPH bioassay. The residue essential oil also scavenged OH with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 145.2 μg/mL in the Fenton reaction using a deoxyribose assay. However, unlike scavenging of OH, residue essential oil exhibited a decreased scavenging activity towards H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 270.1 μg/mL). They also reported that OH scavenging activities of citronellal and citronellol (25–200 μg/mL) were 8–34 and 11–55%, respectively. For the 
  <span class="italic">A. afra</span> oil, 50% DPPH radicle scavenging inhibition was reported at 1.1 μL/mL, while it increased for 
  <span class="italic">A. abyssinica</span> (28.9 μL/mL) oil. In lipid peroxidation bioassay only 0.09 μL/mL of oil is required for 50% inhibition [
  <a rid="B115-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115-medicines-04-00068">115</a>]. From Tunisia, Riahi et al. [
  <a rid="B31-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-medicines-04-00068">31</a>] reported the variable IC
  <sub>50</sub> values (28.2 and 46.5 g/mL of leaf and flower oils, resp.) in 
  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span> oil. Additionally, essential oils from leaves (595.26 mol Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>/L) and flowers (286.42 mol Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>/L) also exhibited significant ferric-reducing antioxidant activity. From Serbia, 
  <span class="italic">A. annua</span> oil showed 50% scavenging of radicle cations at 2.90 μg/mL in DPPH bioassay, and 50% antioxidant activity at 0.640 μg/mL in ABTS assay [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00068">24</a>]. However, oil did not show superoxide-scavenging activity. IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for the chemical constituents in DPPH and ABTS methods reported were 4.00 and 1.79 μg/mL for Artemisia ketone, 87.0 and 30.1 μg/mL for α-pinene, 47.9 and 6.46 μg/mL for 1,8-Cineole, and 34.4 and 23.6 μg/mL for camphor, respectively. Mohammadi et al. [
  <a rid="B116-medicines-04-00068" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-medicines-04-00068">116</a>] showed that 
  <span class="italic">A. absinthium</span> essential oils extracted before flowering stage exhibited strong DPPH activity (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 3.307 mg/mL) than that of the oils extracted at flowering (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 4.11 mg/mL), and after flowering stage (EC
  <sub>50</sub> 4.26 mg/mL). This may be due to presence of effective compounds such as sabinene, beta-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, p-cymene, and chamazulene which were more (58.36%) before flowering stage than that of at flowering (48.98%) and after flowering (53.99%). This may be also due to synergistic effect of the compounds [
