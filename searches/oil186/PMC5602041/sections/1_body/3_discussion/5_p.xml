<p id="Par27">Furthermore, different chemotypes of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>herba alba</italic> have been previously described originating from different localities. Identification of Sinai chemotype was achieved by GC–MS and two main oils were discerned, the cineole-bornane type and pinene type. The oils were rich in monoterpenes but did not contain any sesquiterpene components (Feuerstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1986</xref>). This is not consistent with our findings where we found piperitone as main compound. Essential oil of 
 <italic>A. herba alba</italic> from Israel revealed the presence of sesquiterpene lactone and oxygenated monoterpenes (Segal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1985</xref>). The population in Israel consist of a larger number of chemotypes of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>herba alba</italic> than was previously believed (Fleisher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>). An additional 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>herba alba</italic> chemotype was described in Spain (Salido et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>). Some Tunisian 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>herba alba</italic> chemotypes showed the presence of similar compounds as in our essential oil however, the composition of the constituents was different (Mohsen and Ali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Another study from 
 <italic>A. herba alba</italic> essential oil from Tunisia described the presence of a number of potential tick repellent compounds; α-thujone (24.9%), germacrene D (14.5%), camphor (10.8%), 1,8-cineole (8.9%), β-thujone (8.3%), chrysanthenone (4.7%) and borneol (3.1%) in Kadri et al. (
