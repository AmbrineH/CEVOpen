<p id="Par23">There is a great potential for the use of plants from Africa, Asia and South America tropical and subtropical regions for finding new bioactive molecules and for our purposes new compounds for tick control (Habeeb 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> numerous candidates with putative repellency activity are listed and oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are among the most frequently identified compounds. A number of plants have earlier shown repellent activity against 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymph and the majority of the compounds are oxygenated monoterpenes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The present study exhibited repellent activity of essential oils extracted from eleven Egyptian medicinal plants against 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> nymphs. Among the studied essential oils 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dioscoridis</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>herba alba</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> exhibited a strong repellency for ticks in laboratory bioassays. These three plants are belonged to Asteraceae family and showed the presence of a number of major compounds that might be responsible for their bioactivity.
