<p id="Par24">Usually the biological activity of a plant extract is due the presence of one or more major compounds (El-Seedi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) but in the case of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dioscoridis</italic> essential oil, it seems the greater activity is due to presence of blend of diverse type of compounds which might have additional or synergistic effects. However, in case of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> there was a number of major compounds which could be responsible for its higher activity. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> produced the same oxygenated sesquiterpene as major compounds but the amount and bioactivity was slightly different between species. The most abundant compound of these plant oils was α-cadinol that was detected only in the essential oils of these two plants. α-Cadinol was found to be highly effective for controlling two house mite species 
 <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic> and 
 <italic>D. farinae</italic> (Chang et al.
