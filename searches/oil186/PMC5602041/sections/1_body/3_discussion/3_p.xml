<p id="Par25">The chemical composition of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dioscoridis</italic> in the present study is partly in accordance with Grace (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>), where he presented the essential oil of 
 <italic>Pluchea</italic> (=
 <italic>Conyza</italic>) 
 <italic>dioscoridis</italic> which consisted of both sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in large proportions with α-cadinol as the major constituent. However, our results are different from other previous studies (Nassar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>; Elshamy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). Both studies showed that the major constituents of 
 <italic>C. dioscoridis</italic> essential oil were mainly sesquiterpene hydrocarbons comprising more than 40% of the oil whereas there are more of oxygenated sesquiterpenes in the present essential oil. This difference in chemical composition might partly be explained by harvesting time, soil fertility, cultivation and drying methods of the plant materials have a significant impact on the chemical composition of essential oils (Okoh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>; Hussain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>; Omer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>; Antal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>). The effect of soil type and the seasonal variations on the quality and quantity of essential oil constituents was investigated by Omer et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>) and Hussain et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). There is also a correlation between the age of plants and their essential oil yield and composition (Okoh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>) as well as harvesting season of three rose-scented geranium (
 <italic>Pelargonium grayeolens</italic> L’Her ex Ait; Geraniaceae) cultivars (Verma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>).
