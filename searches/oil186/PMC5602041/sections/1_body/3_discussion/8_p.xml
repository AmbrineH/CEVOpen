 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> and all the oils contained oxygenated terpenes. However, the most active essential oils did not have similar volatile profiles. The current result strongly indicate that the oils contain a number of compounds having repellent properties and that many of them belong to the oxygenated group of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The recent analyses did not include separation of the enantiomers of the chiral constituents. This lacking information might explain why essential oils with similar constituents have different repellent activity. However, it seems unlikely to find a specific compound in common that can explain the whole repellent activity, and most probably there is a combined effect of several constituents (Jaenson et al.
