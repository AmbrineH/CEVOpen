<p id="Par3">The common tick, 
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a triphasic tick that parasitizes a large number of vertebrates including small, medium to large mammals; birds and lizards (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). The abundance of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> on different vegetation types in a wooded area of Southern Italy was determined by Dantas-Torres and Otranto (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). They found that the abundance of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> larvae on the ground-level vegetation was generally higher than on the higher vegetation whereas both nymphs and adult stages were more abundant on higher vegetation. The questing behavior of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> consists of climbing the low vegetation to a point from where it can attach to the passing hosts. The host-seeking activity of the castor-bean tick indicated that this tick has a bimodal seasonal activity with a dominant peak during spring whereas a minor peak during autumn (Schulz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>). The immature stages (larvae and nymphs) feed on woodland birds and small to medium-sized mammals while the adult female feeds on large mammals. Each life stage (larva, nymph, adult) of this tick feeds once on different host for continuous period lasting several days (Heylen et al.
