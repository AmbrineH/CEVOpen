<p id="Par5">Despite recent advances in tick control strategies, large-scale reduction of tick populations has not been achieved (Tabanca et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>). The synthetic repellents are commonly accepted means of personal protection against tick bites (Iori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>). However, the use of such commercial synthetic acaricides leads to resistance, residual effects and potentially can harm the environment (Elmhalli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>). There is a direct need to establish alternative substances for tick control which are safer, available, cheaper and more effective (Frances and Wirtz
