 <italic>Ixodes</italic>
 <italic>ricinus</italic> is a potential vector of different pathogens. The cattle parasite, 
 <italic>Babesia divergens</italic> (the causative agent of humanâ€™s babesiosis) is transmitted to human by 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> (Zintl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2014</xref>). Spirochete, 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic>
 <italic>burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato (the causative agent of Lyme disease) is considered diderm (double-membrane) bacteria with a worldwide distribution. 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> is mostly associated with 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> complex in Northern Hemisphere. The density of questing 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in Northern Norway was determined for the first time by Hvidstena et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). They found that the overall prevalence of nymphs and adult ticks infected by 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.l. was 21 and 46%, respectively. The high incidence rate of reported Lyme borreliosis in Bonnoy region can be explained by the high 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic>-infection prevalence in ticks (Hvidstena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). The encephalitis virus is transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> nymphs and adults. The infection prevalence of tick-born-encephalitis virus (TBE) was significantly lower in 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> nymphs (0.51%) than adults (4.48%) stage (Pettersson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Due to the role of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> tick in the transmitting of many serous pathogens, personal protection against bites of the infected stages of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> is essential.
