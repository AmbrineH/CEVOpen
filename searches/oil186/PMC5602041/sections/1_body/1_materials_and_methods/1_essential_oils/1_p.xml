 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) were purchased from a commercial source in Cairo-Egypt. One hundred gram of each plant material was subjected to steam distillation for 4 h. The distillate was collected and extracted three times with 100 ml of HPLC grade n-hexane (VWR Int. Sweden), dehydrated using anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Alfa Aesar UK), filtered and solvent was evaporated using rotary evaporator at 20 °C under reduced pressure. The essential oils were weighed and reconstituted in hexane as 20 mg/ml, stored in tightly closed glass vials in freezer at −20 °C until further investigations.
