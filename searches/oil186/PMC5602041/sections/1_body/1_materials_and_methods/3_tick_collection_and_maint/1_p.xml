 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>ricinus</italic> were collected from the field during summer 2009 in Stockholm, Sweden using methods described by Garboui et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) and El-Seedi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). Briefly, two wooden poles of 1 m length and 3 cm diameter were attached to two opposite sides of a white flannel cloth (1 × 1 m) and a long string was tied on both ends of one wooden pool attached to the cloth. The cloth was dragged over the vegetation by holding string in hand whereas the two wooden poles made it possible to expand the cloth during dragging so that maximum cloth surface could be exposed and touch the vegetation. Nymphs attached to the cloth were removed with the help of soft forceps and put into tubes having wet filter paper. Nymphs were maintained in complete darkness at 4 °C and 80–95% relative humidity until they were used in laboratory bioassay. Before starting experiment the ticks were kept in room temperature for 24 h.
