<p id="Par15">Eleven plants originating from Egypt were investigated as potentially active against blood sucking ticks. The Egyptian plants used in the present study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were found to be rich in essential oils, which were obtained by steam distillation. The largest yield of essential oil was obtained from the seeds of 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. (1.1%) followed by 
 <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic> L. (0.2%), whereas 
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> L. exhibited the lowest yield (0.01%). Furthermore, the oils obtained from 
 <italic>Conyza dioscoridis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> Asso were 0.17, 0.14 and 0.11% yield, respectively (Table
