 <p id="Par1" class="p">Due to the role of 
  <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</italic> (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) in the transmission of many serious pathogens, personal protection against bites of this tick is essential. In the present study the essential oils from 11 aromatic Egyptian plants were isolated and their repellent activity against 
  <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> nymphs was evaluated Three oils (i.e. 
  <italic class="italic">Conyza dioscoridis</italic> L., 
  <italic class="italic">Artemisia herba-alba</italic> Asso and 
  <italic class="italic">Calendula officinalis</italic> L.) elicited high repellent activity in vitro of 94, 84.2 and 82%, respectively. The most active essential oil (
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">dioscoridis</italic>) was applied in the field at a concentration of 6.5 µg/cm
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> and elicited a significant repellent activity against 
  <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> nymphs by 61.1%. The most repellent plants 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">dioscoridis</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">herba-alba</italic> yielded essential oils by 0.17, 0.11 and 0.14%, respectively. These oils were further investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. α-Cadinol (10.7%) and hexadecanoic acid (10.5%) were the major components of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">dioscoridis</italic> whereas in 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic>, α-cadinol (21.2%) and carvone (18.2%) were major components. 
  <italic class="italic">Artemisia</italic>
  <italic class="italic">herba-alba</italic> contained piperitone (26.5%), ethyl cinnamate (9.5%), camphor (7.7%) and hexadecanoic acid (6.9%). Essential oils of these three plants have a potential to be used for personal protection against tick bites.
