 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Separation and identification of volatiles from essential oils were carried out by GC–MS using a Varian 3400 GC connected to a Finnigan SSQ 7000 quadrupole mass spectrometer. 1 µl aliquot containing 3 µg/µl of essential oil was injected to GC injector for analysis. The GC was equipped with a split/split less injector (split less mode, 30 s; injector temperature, 230 °C; carrier gas, Helium with a constant pressure of 10 psi). A DB-WAX capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, and 0.25 µm film thickness, J &amp; W USA) was used. The temperature program was: 40 °C for 1 min then increased with a rate of 4 °C/min up till 235 °C and held at 235 °C for 10 min. Transfer line connecting GC to the MS was isothermally set to 240 °C throughout the analysis. The temperature of MS ion source was 150 °C and mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with a mass range of 30–400
