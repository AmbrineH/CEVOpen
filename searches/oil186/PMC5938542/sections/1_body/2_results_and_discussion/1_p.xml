<p>PREO was studied against human cancer cell lines i.e., cultured HCT-116 (colon cancer), KBM-5 (myelogenous leukemia), U-266 (multiple myeloma cells), MiaPaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer cells), A-549 (lung carcinoma cells) SCC-4 (squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines by MTT assay. The percentage inhibition activity of PREO was found to be concentration-dependent (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). U-266 exhibited maximum inhibition of 83 %, while HCT-116, SCC4, MiaPaCa-2, A-549 and KBM-5 showed 71, 69, 73, 73 and 76 (%) inhibitions, respectively. These finding are in line with previous studies i.e., effect of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> oil against A-549 (lung), C6 (glioma), T47D (breast), MCF-7 (breast) and TH-1(colon) cell lines by MTT assay that oil exhibits cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cells (Qadir and Shah, 2014[
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). In another study, needle and bark oil of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> showed cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cell at 100 µg/mL (Satyal et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). Similarly, petroleum, ether and chloroform extract of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> also showed cytotoxicity against IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cell lines (Kaushik et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). The cytotoxicity of PREO was correlated with high concentrations of terpinen-4-ol, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene, which have been shown to be cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells (Wright et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). Initially, different cell lines were used and the result showed that oil is effective against all cell lines. Then, the PREO oil activity against two types of cancer cell lines a) adherent (A549, HCT-116) and b) suspension (U-266, KBM-5) was tested (depending on the cell condition) because some assays perform good with adherent cell lines and some performed better with suspension cell lines (since assays are specific due to their adherent and suspension nature) (Gupta et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; Kang et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). So far HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO for 24 h and subjected to live/dead assay. The apoptotic cells percentages were 2.07, 13.22 and 68.87 (%) at 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL (Figure 2A, B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>), respectively. It was observed that PREO had less effect on colony formation of HCT-116 cells at 25 μg/mL, but it completely suppressed the colony-forming ability of tumor cells at 100 μg/mL concentration. The colonies were reduced from 417 to 6 as the concentration of PREO increased (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). Most of the studies were performed using the human myeloid cell line KBM-5 because these cells express tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and the inflammatory pathway in these cells is well understood (Han et al., 2014[
