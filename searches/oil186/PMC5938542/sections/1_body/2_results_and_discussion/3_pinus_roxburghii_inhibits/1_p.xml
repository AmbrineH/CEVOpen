<p>The chronic myeloid leukemia cells (KBM-5) were used for TNF-α induced NF-κB activation study since these cells express tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and also inflammatory pathway is well understood (Han et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). The cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO and activated with TNF-α for NF-κB. As evident from results, the PREO induced TNF-α (NF-κB) in KBM-5 cells, the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was dose-dependent to PREO concentration. It was observed that the inhibition in NF-κB activation was maximum at 50 μg/mL dose (Figure 5
