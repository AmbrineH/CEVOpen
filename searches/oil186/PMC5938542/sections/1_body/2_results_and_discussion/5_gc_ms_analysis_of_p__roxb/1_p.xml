<p>The PREO was subjected to GC-MS analysis for identification of individual components in PREO. Total fifty-four components were identified constituting 99.47 % of PREO (Table 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). The major constituents include α-pinene (27.11 %), which is an important component in 
 <italic>pinus</italic> species (Asta et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Other components identified were monoterpenes hydrocarbons 3-carene (9.20 %), β-pinene (7.02 %) and D-limonene (2.33 %). Caryophyllene (2.46 %) and longifolene (0.87 %) sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes caryophyllene oxide (10.83 %) and humulene epoxide II (2.04 %) were also identified. These results were in good agreement with reported finding i.e., α-pinene was the major component in 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> needles oil having percentage composition of 29.3 % (Iqbal et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Some authors also reported the composition of PREO grown in diverse climates (Adams et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Hassan and Amjid, 2009[
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). PREO from Algeria showed β-caryophyllene and β-selinene major component (Mimoune et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). From Nepal, β-caryophyllene was recorded to be a major component (Satyal et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) and α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, camphene, betapinene, β-caryophyllene and α-terpinol form India has been reported as major components (Qadir and Shah, 2014[
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). From Egypt, α-pinene, 3-carene, β-pinene and longifolene were reported (Salem et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). The slight difference in chemical composition of essential oil might be due to climatic, seasonal, geographical or genetic variations (Farooq et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). However, these findings are in agreement with previous results demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii </italic>(Kaushik et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Plants are a potential sources of drug development of cancer chemoprevention or treatment (Bayala et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) since plants are potent source of bioactive compounds (Ashraf et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; Asif, 2015[
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; Aslam et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; Gull et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; Hameed et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; Mensah and Golomeke, 2015[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). However, a lot of studies are necessary to carry out on the anti-cancer activity of PREO. However, interest in medicinal plant as a source of drug development has increased. However, few researchers reported the cytotoxicity for essential oils (Cavalieri et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; Lampronti et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). However, there is a long road before using PREO them as an anticancer agent since very few studies have been done on the PREO. So far, there is need to study the composition of PREO and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> trials to test the PERO anticancer activity.
