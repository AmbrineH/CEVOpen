<p>Since PREO inhibited the survival of cancer cells, also PREO can inhibit the expression of gene products involved in tumor cells survival, which was also investigated. The effect of PREO on anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-IAP-2, and surviving were studied, which are well known to contribute in cell survival. The effect of PREO on cell proliferative proteins i.e., cyclin D1 and c-Myc was investigated, both of which are known to play a major role in cell proliferation. Results revealed that all proteins were down-regulated by increasing the PREO concentration. The effect of PREO on the expression of gene products was higher at a concentration of 100 Î¼g/mL. In next step, effect of PREO was investigated on the activation of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. It was observed that caspase-3 cleaved in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PREO also induced PARP cleavage in dose-dependent manner (Figure 6
