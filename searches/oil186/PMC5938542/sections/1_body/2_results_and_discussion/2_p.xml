<p class="p">In order to investigate the changes in cell cycle regulation, the KBM-5 cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO i.e., 10, 25 and 50 Âµg/mL for 24 h and subjected to FACS analysis. Treatment with PREO showed a significant increment in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and proportion of cells in S phase was also increased with time (Figure 4
