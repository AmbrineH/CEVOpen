<p>In order to investigate the changes in cell cycle regulation, the KBM-5 cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO i.e., 10, 25 and 50 Âµg/mL for 24 h and subjected to FACS analysis. Treatment with PREO showed a significant increment in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and proportion of cells in S phase was also increased with time (Figure 4

 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> bark extract also induced apoptosis in Hep-G2 cells (Ma et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) and 
 <italic>P. koraiensis</italic> essential oil induced G1-arrest and inhibits cell proliferation and migration in human colon cancer cells (Cho et al., 2014[

 <italic>Pinus</italic> plant influences the cell cycle and induced apoptosis.
