<p class="p">Chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii </italic>(needles, stem, bark and essential oil) have been studied well (Iqbal et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]; Qadir and Shah, 2014[
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]; Satyal et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]) and caryophyllene, thunbergol, 3-carene, cembrene and Î±-pinene were the major constituents in 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii </italic>extracts (Hassan and Amjid, 2009[
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]; Salem et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]). In view of considerable anticancer activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinacea </italic>family plants, it will be of worth to study the anticancer activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii </italic>plant. Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to appraise the anticancer potential of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii</italic> leaves essential oil using different human cancer cell lines. Moreover, chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. roxburghii</italic> essential oil (PREO) was also evaluated using advanced techniques. For anticancer activity evaluation of PREO, initially, different cell lines were used. After initial trails, two types of cells i.e., adherent (A549, HCT-116) and suspension (U-266, KBM-5) were selected. For colony forming assay adherent cancer cell lines line HCT 116 are required, whereas KBM-5 cell line was used to study apoptosis effect of PREO.
