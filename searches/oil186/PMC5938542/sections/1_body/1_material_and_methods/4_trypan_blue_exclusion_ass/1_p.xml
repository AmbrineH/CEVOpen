<p class="p">Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and treated with 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL PREO concentrations for 24 h at 37 °C and mixed with equal volume of isotonic trypan blue (0.4 %). Total cell number and fraction of nonviable, dye accumulating cells were counted after 2 min in Fuchs-Rosenthal hemocytometer under light microscope (Sung et al., 2013[
