<p>Cells were grown and colonized by clonogenic assay. HCT-116 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1.0×10
 <sup>3 </sup>cells/well. After 24 h, cells were treated with essential oil 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL concentrations, incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and subjected to clonogenic assay as reported elsewhere (Gupta et al., 2013[
