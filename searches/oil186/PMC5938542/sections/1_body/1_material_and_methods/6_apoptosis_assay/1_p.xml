<p>For determination of apoptotic effects of PREO on colon cancer cells, Live/dead assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) method was used, which determines the intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. Intracellular esterases from live cells convert nonfluorescent, cell-permeable calceinacetoxy methyl ester to the intensely green fluorescent calcein, a polyanionic dye which was retained within cells. This assay was also used to examine the damaged membrane of cells (the ethidium bromide homodimer-1 enters damaged cells when bound to nucleic acids, it produces a bright red fluorescence). HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates 2.0×10
 <sup>4</sup>/well. After 12 h, cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL PREO concentrations for 24 h and then, washed with PBS (Gupta et al., 2011[
