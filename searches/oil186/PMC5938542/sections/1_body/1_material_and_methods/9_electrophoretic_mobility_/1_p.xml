<p>KBM-5 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (2.0×10
 <sup>6 </sup>cells/1 mL), incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and treated with 10, 25 and 50 µg/mL PREO concentrations. After 8 h of incubation, cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. Swelling induction in cell was induced by adding cold cytoplasmic extraction buffer and content was kept in ice for 15 min. The cytoplasmic cell fraction was lysed by adding 3.125 µL, 10 % Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)/100 µL CEB and mixed on vortex for 20 sec. Then, suspension was centrifuged for 5 min and cytosolic supernatant was discarded and cold nuclear extraction buffer was added to the pellet. Nuclear suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice (mixed the contents after every 5 min on vertex) and then, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Nuclear protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. The binding reaction was initiated by adding 15 µg nuclear extract to binding buffer (100 µM HEPES, pH7.9; 50 µMEDTA; 100 µMDTT; and 10 % glycerol), 2 µg poly (dI:dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 3.0 ×10
 <sup>5</sup> counts per minute 32P-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligo nucleotide (15 μg of protein with 16fmol DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGG ACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) and 1 % Igepal (total volume, 20 µL) and incubated the mixture for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 µL 6X DNA loading dye and sample was placed on ice and then, loaded on a pre-run 6.6 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide (5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCA CTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The gel was dried and placed on film for autoradiography (Han et al., 2014[
