<p class="p">PREO effect on the proliferation of cancer cell was determined by measuring the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using MTT assay. This assay relies on the mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells which cleave the tetrazolium ring of MTT and yields formazan form, which is monitored at 570 nm (ELISA micro plate reader, Bio-Tek, USA). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5.0×10

PREO was dissolved in DMSO and cells were treated in triplicate with 10, 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL oil concentrations (with this solution being added to the appropriate growth media to yield a final DMSO concentration of 0.1 % and final mixture was incubated for 72 h at 37 °C). Then, 20 µL MTT (5 mg/mL) solutions were added and again contents were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, 100 µL buffers (cell lysis) was added and incubated overnight at 37
