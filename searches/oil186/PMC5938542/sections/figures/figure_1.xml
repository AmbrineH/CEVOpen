 <p> Effect of Pinus roxburghii on tumor cell proliferation. U266, A549, HCT16, SCC4, MiaPaCa2 and KBM-5 (5×10 3 cells/well) were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates; cells were treated in triplicate with (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) concentrations of Pinus roxburghii essential oil (PREO) for 72 h, and then assayed for cell viability by the MTT method. </p>)
