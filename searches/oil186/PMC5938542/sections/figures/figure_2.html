 <p> HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates 2.0×10 4. After 12 h, cells were treated with (25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) concentrations of PREO for 24 h, removed the media and washed with PBS. Cells were then stained with assay reagents for 30 min at ambient temperature. Cell cytotoxicity was determined by live/dead assay. Data represent the mean±SD of three field measurements. </p>)
