 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Pinus roxburghii suppresses expression of gene products involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. KBM-5 cells were treated (10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) of PREO for 24 h. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was sliced according to molecular weight to probe with different antibodies. After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with β-actin to verify equal protein loading. </p>)
