  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PREO effect on the proliferation of cancer cell was determined by measuring the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using MTT assay. This assay relies on the mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells which cleave the tetrazolium ring of MTT and yields formazan form, which is monitored at 570 nm (ELISA micro plate reader, Bio-Tek, USA). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5.0×10
   <span class="sup">3</span> cells/0.1 mL in a 96-well plate for 12 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5 % CO
   <sub>2</sub> (CO

PREO was dissolved in DMSO and cells were treated in triplicate with 10, 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL oil concentrations (with this solution being added to the appropriate growth media to yield a final DMSO concentration of 0.1 % and final mixture was incubated for 72 h at 37 °C). Then, 20 µL MTT (5 mg/mL) solutions were added and again contents were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, 100 µL buffers (cell lysis) was added and incubated overnight at 37

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For determination of apoptotic effects of PREO on colon cancer cells, Live/dead assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) method was used, which determines the intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. Intracellular esterases from live cells convert nonfluorescent, cell-permeable calceinacetoxy methyl ester to the intensely green fluorescent calcein, a polyanionic dye which was retained within cells. This assay was also used to examine the damaged membrane of cells (the ethidium bromide homodimer-1 enters damaged cells when bound to nucleic acids, it produces a bright red fluorescence). HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates 2.0×10

Proteins were separated on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and blocked for 1 h in 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) with the primary antibody directed against MMP-9, cyclinD1, PARP, c-IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, c-Myc, β-actin, c-FLIP, survivin and caspase-3 at a 1:3,000 dilution in blocking buffer at 4 °C on a shaker, washed thrice with washing buffer and then, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 90 min at ambient temperature. Membranes were washed five times. Specific antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) using ECL reagent (GE Healthcare).

After 8 h of incubation, cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. Swelling induction in cell was induced by adding cold cytoplasmic extraction buffer and content was kept in ice for 15 min. The cytoplasmic cell fraction was lysed by adding 3.125 µL, 10 % Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)/100 µL CEB and mixed on vortex for 20 sec. Then, suspension was centrifuged for 5 min and cytosolic supernatant was discarded and cold nuclear extraction buffer was added to the pellet. Nuclear suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice (mixed the contents after every 5 min on vertex) and then, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min.
