 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PREO was studied against human cancer cell lines i.e., cultured HCT-116 (colon cancer), KBM-5 (myelogenous leukemia), U-266 (multiple myeloma cells), MiaPaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer cells), A-549 (lung carcinoma cells) SCC-4 (squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines by MTT assay. The percentage inhibition activity of PREO was found to be concentration-dependent (Figure 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">(Fig. 1)</a>). U-266 exhibited maximum inhibition of 83 %, while HCT-116, SCC4, MiaPaCa-2, A-549 and KBM-5 showed 71, 69, 73, 73 and 76 (%) inhibitions, respectively. These finding are in line with previous studies i.e., effect of 
  <span class="italic">P. roxburghii</span> oil against A-549 (lung), C6 (glioma), T47D (breast), MCF-7 (breast) and TH-1(colon) cell lines by MTT assay that oil exhibits cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cells (Qadir and Shah, 2014[
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">43</a>]). In another study, needle and bark oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. roxburghii</span> showed cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cell at 100 µg/mL (Satyal et al., 2013[
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">46</a>]). Similarly, petroleum, ether and chloroform extract of 
  <span class="italic">P. roxburghii</span> also showed cytotoxicity against IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cell lines (Kaushik et al., 2012[
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]). The cytotoxicity of PREO was correlated with high concentrations of terpinen-4-ol, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene, which have been shown to be cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells (Wright et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">51</a>]). Initially, different cell lines were used and the result showed that oil is effective against all cell lines. Then, the PREO oil activity against two types of cancer cell lines a) adherent (A549, HCT-116) and b) suspension (U-266, KBM-5) was tested (depending on the cell condition) because some assays perform good with adherent cell lines and some performed better with suspension cell lines (since assays are specific due to their adherent and suspension nature) (Gupta et al., 2016[
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>]; Kang et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">31</a>]). So far HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO for 24 h and subjected to live/dead assay. The apoptotic cells percentages were 2.07, 13.22 and 68.87 (%) at 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL (Figure 2A, B
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>), respectively. It was observed that PREO had less effect on colony formation of HCT-116 cells at 25 μg/mL, but it completely suppressed the colony-forming ability of tumor cells at 100 μg/mL concentration. The colonies were reduced from 417 to 6 as the concentration of PREO increased (Figure 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">(Fig. 3)</a>). Most of the studies were performed using the human myeloid cell line KBM-5 because these cells express tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and the inflammatory pathway in these cells is well understood (Han et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">24</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to investigate the changes in cell cycle regulation, the KBM-5 cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO i.e., 10, 25 and 50 µg/mL for 24 h and subjected to FACS analysis. Treatment with PREO showed a significant increment in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and proportion of cells in S phase was also increased with time (Figure 4
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">(Fig. 4)</a>). Similar to present investigation, the 
  <span class="italic">P. massoniana</span> bark extract also induced apoptosis in Hep-G2 cells (Ma et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">38</a>]) and 
  <span class="italic">P. koraiensis</span> essential oil induced G1-arrest and inhibits cell proliferation and migration in human colon cancer cells (Cho et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14</a>]). Thus, present study revealed that 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> plant influences the cell cycle and induced apoptosis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chronic myeloid leukemia cells (KBM-5) were used for TNF-α induced NF-κB activation study since these cells express tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and also inflammatory pathway is well understood (Han et al., 2014[
   <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">24</a>]). The cells were treated with different concentrations of PREO and activated with TNF-α for NF-κB. As evident from results, the PREO induced TNF-α (NF-κB) in KBM-5 cells, the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was dose-dependent to PREO concentration. It was observed that the inhibition in NF-κB activation was maximum at 50 μg/mL dose (Figure 5
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">(Fig. 5)</a>). In support of these findings, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of 
   <span class="italic">P. roxburghii </span>has also been reported elsewhere (Kaushik et al., 2012[
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>])

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since PREO inhibited the survival of cancer cells, also PREO can inhibit the expression of gene products involved in tumor cells survival, which was also investigated. The effect of PREO on anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-IAP-2, and surviving were studied, which are well known to contribute in cell survival. The effect of PREO on cell proliferative proteins i.e., cyclin D1 and c-Myc was investigated, both of which are known to play a major role in cell proliferation. Results revealed that all proteins were down-regulated by increasing the PREO concentration. The effect of PREO on the expression of gene products was higher at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. In next step, effect of PREO was investigated on the activation of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. It was observed that caspase-3 cleaved in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PREO also induced PARP cleavage in dose-dependent manner (Figure 6
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">(Fig. 6)</a>). There is lack of reports about the expressions of proteins by PREO. Although, the effect of 
   <span class="italic">P. densiflora</span> leaf essential oil on expression of caspases, PARP, Bcl-2, Bax and XIAP in YD-8 human oral cancer cells have been reported and a similar trend was observed in the present investigation (Jo et al., 2012[

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS analysis of P. roxburghii</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PREO was subjected to GC-MS analysis for identification of individual components in PREO. Total fifty-four components were identified constituting 99.47 % of PREO (Table 1
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a>). The major constituents include α-pinene (27.11 %), which is an important component in 
   <span class="italic">pinus</span> species (Asta et al., 2006[
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>]). Other components identified were monoterpenes hydrocarbons 3-carene (9.20 %), β-pinene (7.02 %) and D-limonene (2.33 %). Caryophyllene (2.46 %) and longifolene (0.87 %) sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes caryophyllene oxide (10.83 %) and humulene epoxide II (2.04 %) were also identified. These results were in good agreement with reported finding i.e., α-pinene was the major component in 
   <span class="italic">P. roxburghii</span> needles oil having percentage composition of 29.3 % (Iqbal et al., 2011[
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">28</a>]). Some authors also reported the composition of PREO grown in diverse climates (Adams et al., 2014[
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>]; Hassan and Amjid, 2009[
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>]). PREO from Algeria showed β-caryophyllene and β-selinene major component (Mimoune et al., 2013[
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>]). From Nepal, β-caryophyllene was recorded to be a major component (Satyal et al., 2013[
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">46</a>]) and α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, camphene, betapinene, β-caryophyllene and α-terpinol form India has been reported as major components (Qadir and Shah, 2014[
   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">43</a>]). From Egypt, α-pinene, 3-carene, β-pinene and longifolene were reported (Salem et al., 2014[
   <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">44</a>]). The slight difference in chemical composition of essential oil might be due to climatic, seasonal, geographical or genetic variations (Farooq et al., 2008[
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>]). However, these findings are in agreement with previous results demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of 
   <span class="italic">P. roxburghii </span>(Kaushik et al., 2012[
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]). Plants are a potential sources of drug development of cancer chemoprevention or treatment (Bayala et al., 2014[
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]) since plants are potent source of bioactive compounds (Ashraf et al., 2015[
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]; Asif, 2015[
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>]; Aslam et al., 2016[
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>]; Gull et al., 2015[
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>]; Hameed et al., 2015[
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>]; Mensah and Golomeke, 2015[
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">39</a>]). However, a lot of studies are necessary to carry out on the anti-cancer activity of PREO. However, interest in medicinal plant as a source of drug development has increased. However, few researchers reported the cytotoxicity for essential oils (Cavalieri et al., 2004[
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>]; Lampronti et al., 2006[
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">36</a>]). However, there is a long road before using PREO them as an anticancer agent since very few studies have been done on the PREO. So far, there is need to study the composition of PREO and 
   <span class="italic">in vivo</span> trials to test the PERO anticancer activity.
