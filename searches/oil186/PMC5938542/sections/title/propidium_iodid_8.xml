 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">KBM-5 cells were seeded at 2×10
  <span class="sup">6 </span>cells/1 mL in 6 well plates and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, then treated with 10, 25 and 50 µg/ mL PREO for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 1 min at 4 °C) and washed with PBS and re-suspended in 0.3 mL of PBS followed by 700 µL ethanol with constant slow stirring. After complete mixing, the content kept at -20 °C for 30 min, centrifuged and supernatant was decanted and cells were washed with PBS. The pellets obtained were re-suspended in 0.5 mL Propidium Iodide (PI) (1 mg/mL in PBS) and 5 µL of RNAse (Li et al., 2004[
