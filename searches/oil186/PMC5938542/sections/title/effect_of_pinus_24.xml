  <span class="italic">Pinus roxburghii </span>on NF-κB activation. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus roxburghii </span>suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. KBM-5 cells (2.0×10
  <span class="sup">6</span> cells/mL) were pre-incubated with PREO (0, 10, 25, 50 μg/mL) for 8 h and then treated with 0.1 nM TNF for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA (left panel). Values below the EMSA gel indicate percent growth inhibition. Percent inhibition of NF-κB by PREO was calculated by quantitation of NF-κB bands using a Storm 820 phosphorimager equipped with ImageQuant software (Amersham) (right panel). Data represent the mean±SD of three measurements. *p&lt;0.05, versus control.
