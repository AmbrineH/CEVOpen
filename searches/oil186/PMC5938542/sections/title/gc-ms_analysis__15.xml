 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PREO was subjected to GC-MS analysis for identification of individual components in PREO. Total fifty-four components were identified constituting 99.47 % of PREO (Table 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a>). The major constituents include α-pinene (27.11 %), which is an important component in 
  <span class="italic">pinus</span> species (Asta et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>]). Other components identified were monoterpenes hydrocarbons 3-carene (9.20 %), β-pinene (7.02 %) and D-limonene (2.33 %). Caryophyllene (2.46 %) and longifolene (0.87 %) sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes caryophyllene oxide (10.83 %) and humulene epoxide II (2.04 %) were also identified. These results were in good agreement with reported finding i.e., α-pinene was the major component in 
  <span class="italic">P. roxburghii</span> needles oil having percentage composition of 29.3 % (Iqbal et al., 2011[
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">28</a>]). Some authors also reported the composition of PREO grown in diverse climates (Adams et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>]; Hassan and Amjid, 2009[
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>]). PREO from Algeria showed β-caryophyllene and β-selinene major component (Mimoune et al., 2013[
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>]). From Nepal, β-caryophyllene was recorded to be a major component (Satyal et al., 2013[
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">46</a>]) and α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, camphene, betapinene, β-caryophyllene and α-terpinol form India has been reported as major components (Qadir and Shah, 2014[
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">43</a>]). From Egypt, α-pinene, 3-carene, β-pinene and longifolene were reported (Salem et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">44</a>]). The slight difference in chemical composition of essential oil might be due to climatic, seasonal, geographical or genetic variations (Farooq et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>]). However, these findings are in agreement with previous results demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of 
  <span class="italic">P. roxburghii </span>(Kaushik et al., 2012[
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]). Plants are a potential sources of drug development of cancer chemoprevention or treatment (Bayala et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]) since plants are potent source of bioactive compounds (Ashraf et al., 2015[
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]; Asif, 2015[
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>]; Aslam et al., 2016[
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>]; Gull et al., 2015[
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>]; Hameed et al., 2015[
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>]; Mensah and Golomeke, 2015[
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">39</a>]). However, a lot of studies are necessary to carry out on the anti-cancer activity of PREO. However, interest in medicinal plant as a source of drug development has increased. However, few researchers reported the cytotoxicity for essential oils (Cavalieri et al., 2004[
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>]; Lampronti et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">36</a>]). However, there is a long road before using PREO them as an anticancer agent since very few studies have been done on the PREO. So far, there is need to study the composition of PREO and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> trials to test the PERO anticancer activity.
