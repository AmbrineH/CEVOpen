<p class="p">Fifty number clean fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> were dried in an oven at 40°C for 5 days in order to separate the pulp from the seed because the pulp is thin and juicy. The pulp was separated from the seed, and freely ground with Kenwood food blender. The seed was also carefully de-shelled using kitchen knife, and the kernel was dried in an oven at 45°C for 36h and ground into powder. Flours of the two samples were separately kept in the refrigerator at -4°C prior to use.
