<p>The results of fatty acid composition of 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> indicate that both the pulp and seed oils have a high content of linoleic acid (C18:2) of 50.56% and 38.87%, respectively (Table 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
 </bold>). It was also observed that the oils contained significant amount of unsaturated fatty acids of 78.43% and 66.65% for the pulp and seed oils of 
 <italic>H. barteri.</italic> Palmitic acid (C16:0) was found to be predominant saturated fatty acid (SFA) in the oil samples with values of 15.34% (pulp) and 25.37% (seed). The observed values of palmitic acid are in agreement with the reported data of some leguminious plant seeds such as 
 <italic>C. lanatus</italic> (17.71%) and 19.15% for 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> seed oils, and 20.87% for 
 <italic>G. jasminoide</italic> by [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. respectively. It is one of the most common saturated fatty acid found in cheese, milk, butter, animals and plants and it is an antioxidant, a nematicide used in making soups.
