<p>Saponification value (SV) is an indicator of the average molecular weight and, hence, chain length. It is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the lipid. The SV values of the studied oils were 189.40 mg KOH/g and 190.22 mg KOH/g for pulp and seed samples, respectively. The results are in good agreement with Codex standard for cotton oil (189 - 198 mg KOH/g), soybean oil (189 - 195 mg KOH/g), corn oil (187 - 195 mg KOH/g) and peanut oil (187 - 196 mg KOH/g) [

 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], 227.49 for groundnut seed oil [
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and 224.40 for shea butter tree seed oil [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Oil fractions with saponification values of 200 mg KOH/g and above, had been reported to possess low molecular weight fatty acids [
