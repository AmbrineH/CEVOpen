<p>Some studies have indicated the various impacts of SFAs on the human health. It has been concluded that lauric acid (C12:0) as well as myristic acid (C14:0) raise plasma total cholesterol concentrations, due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the rise of both LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations respectively [

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Oils rich in lauric acid (C12:0) decreased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. On the other hand, myristic (C14:0) and palmitic acids (C16:0) affected this ratio only little and stearic acid (C18:0) slightly reduced this ratio. Lauric acid was not found as a component of the
