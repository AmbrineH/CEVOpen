<p>It is observed that the unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and oleic) account for most of the 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> pulp and seed oils. It is also noted that linoleic and oleic acids are the major fatty acids in peanut, soy beans and lentil [
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The pulp oil has the highest content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs); that is, oleic acid (C18:1) (22.31%). Various studies indicate that a diet rich in oleic acid decreases the development of atherosclerosis and lowers serum cholesterol by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators while promoting antioxidant defenses [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Davidson 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] all reported that the deleterious effects of oleic acid have been attributed to increase in the permeability of both vascular and alveolar epithelium to solute caused by changes in membrane fluidity and increase in intracellular calcium concentration.
