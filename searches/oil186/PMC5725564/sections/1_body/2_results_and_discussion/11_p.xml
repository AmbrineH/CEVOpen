<p class="p">The oleic/linoleic (O/L) acid ratio has been associated with high stability and potentiality of the oil for deep frying fat. The O/L levels were 0.32% in seed and 0.44% in pulp oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic>. These values are lower than that of 
 <italic class="italic">Anarcadium occidentale</italic> (12.28%) [
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], peanut oil (1.48%) [
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], raw tiger nut (2.11%) [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], hence 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> oils may not be stable compared with soya bean, peanut and groundnut oils. The relationship between the saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid content is expressed as P/S index. In a diet, it is important the index value be higher than 1, due to the essential character of the linoleic fatty acid (n-6) [
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Several studies indicate that the P/S relation influences in the level of nutrient metabolization in the body, and as the proportion increases a smaller deposition of lipids [
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The values of the P/S indexes of the oils studied are shown in Table

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
