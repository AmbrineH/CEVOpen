<p>Phosphatidyserine (PS) and lysophosphatidycholine (LPC) were the minor phospholipids with concentrations ranging between 33.66 to 38.37 mg/100g and 2.52e
 <sup>-2</sup> to 9.85 mg/100g, respectively. In addition to its function as a component of cellular membranes and as a precursor for other phospholipids, PS is an essential cofactor that binds to and activates a large number of proteins, especially those with signalling activities [
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. LPC (which is mostly found in trace amounts in most tissues) has pro-inflammatory properties and it is known to be a pathological component of oxidized lipoproteins (LDL) in plasma and of atherosclerotic lesions; it has been shown to promote demyelination in the nervous system. Recently, LPC has been found to have some functions in cell signalling, and specific receptors (coupled to G proteins) have been identified. It activates the specific phospholipase C that releases diacylglycerols and inositol triphosphate with resultant increases in intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and activation of protein kinase C. LPC also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase in certain cell types [
