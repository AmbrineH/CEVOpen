 </bold> also presents distributions of results into TSFA, TMUFA, TPUFA TUFA, TEFA, TNEFA, oleic to linoleic (O/L) and linoleic to Î± - linolenic (n6/n3) ratios. It was generally observed that the percentage of both unsaturated and essential fatty acids in pulp oil was higher than that of seed oil, whereas the percentages of saturated and non essential fatty acids were higher in the seed oil sample. TSFA ranged from 21.57% to 33.35% in pulp and seed
