<p>The most abundant PUFA was linoleic acid (LA, C18:2, n-6) in all analyzed samples, in the range from 38.87% in seed oil to 50.56% in pulp oil. Similar results of LA predominating have been reported for grape, almond, wheat germ, sesame, pumpkin seed and safflower oil [

 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; and for hemp oil [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The high content of linoleic acid in both oils is an indication that the oil is of high nutritional value for linoleic acid being an essential acid with cholesterol-lowering activity [
