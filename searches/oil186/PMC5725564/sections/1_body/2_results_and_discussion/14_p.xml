<p class="p">Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is usually the second most abundant phospholipid in animal and plant lipids [
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The PE values were 164.33 mg/100g in seed and 56.74 mg/100g in pulp samples. In animal tissues, phosphatidylethanolamine is especially important in the sarcolemmal membranes of the heart during ischemia, it is involved in secretion of the nascent very-low-density lipoproteins from liver and it has functions in membrane fusion and fission. It also has a functional role in the Ca
