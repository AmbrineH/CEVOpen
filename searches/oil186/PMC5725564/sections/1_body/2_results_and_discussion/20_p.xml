<p class="p">Iodine index is a property of the unsaturation of fatty acids or its esters. Lipids with unsaturated fatty acids (containing one or more double bonds) are easily assimilated and broken down to produce calorific energy than saturated fatty acids. However, when the iodine value becomes too high, the stability of the oil reduces because it is more likely to undergo oxidation. Oils with iodine value above 125mg of I/100g are classified as drying oils; those with iodine value 110 - 125mg of I/100g are classified as semidrying oils. Those with iodine value less than 110 are considered as nondrying oil [

Thus, the oil will not attract high interest in the paint and coatings industry unless it undergoes dehydration before use. The differences in iodine values between pulp and seed oil samples may be due to the different fatty acid compositions.
