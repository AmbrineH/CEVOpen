<p>Moreover, linoleic acid as reported by Gunstone and Norris [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] usually cures essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency as it can be neutralized to the required C20 and C22 polyene acids. Essential fatty acid deficiency in human results in abnormal skin conditions such as scaliness and dermatitis, increased water loss, reduced regeneration of tissue and increase susceptibility to infection [

Therefore, as the pulp oil contained higher PUFA than the seed oil, it is clear that the cholesterol of the pulp oil could be very low and this will make it very useful for foods preparation to reduce the incidence of heart attack (arteroscleroses) caused by high intake of cholesterol. The TEFA in pulp oil (52.55%) is much higher than TEFA in rice, sorghum, millet, maize and Bambara groundnut [
