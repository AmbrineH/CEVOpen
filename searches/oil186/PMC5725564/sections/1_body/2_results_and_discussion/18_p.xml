<p>The results of the physicochemical analysis of the 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> pulp and seed oils are presented in Table 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>
 </bold>. The iodine, acidity, peroxide and saponification values are the major characterization parameters for oil quality. Peroxide value (PV) is a measure of oxidation during storage and the freshness of lipid matrix. It is a useful indicator of the early stages of rancidity occurring under mild condition and also, a measure of the primary lipid oxidation products. One of the most important parameters that influence lipid oxidation is the degree of unsaturation of its fatty acids. When double bonds of unsaturated fats are oxidized, peroxides are among the oxidation products formed. Peroxide values of all the oil samples were in agreement with the maximum Codex standard peroxide value (10 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg) for vegetable oil deterioration. The 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> oils have significantly high peroxide values (8.15 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg for pulp and 9.20 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg for seed) and hence high degree of unsaturation. This observation suggests that 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> oils have high content of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1), which are responsible for oxidative rancidity.
