<p>Linoleic acid (C18:2) occurs most abundantly in soybean oil, corn oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, grape seed oil and sunflower oil which are leguminous seeds. The amount of linoleic acid (50.55%) and (38.87%) in pulp and seed oils of 
 <italic>H. barteri</italic> (Table 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
 </bold>) is comparable with that reported for harms seed (47.95%) [

 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], boiled tiger nut (46.71%) [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but lower than that of 
 <italic>Adenopus breviflorus</italic> oil (60.73%) [

In dry skin, it strengthens the lipid barrier of epidermis, protects against transepidermal loss of water and normalises the skin metabolism. Linoleic acid is a natural component of sebum. In persons with acne skin, a decrease in LA content in sebum is observed, which leads to blocked pores and formation of comedos and eczemas. The use of linoleic acid for oily skin and problematic skin care leads to improvement of the work of sebaceous glands, unblocking of pores and decrease in the number of comedos. Moreover, this acid is built in the structure of cell membrane and is also used for production of intercellular cement of the skin. These two processes are possible thanks to the presence of the enzymatic complex in the stratum corneum of epidermis [

 <italic>H. barteri</italic> contained the highest concentrations of all the fatty acids except for stearic (C18:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), linoleic acid (C18:2) and Î± - linolenic acids which differ from the pulp oil by 14.23%, 87.20%, 23.11% and 33.04% respectively. The level of RSD ranged from 7.71% in Stearic acid to 88.50% in lignoceric acid (Table
