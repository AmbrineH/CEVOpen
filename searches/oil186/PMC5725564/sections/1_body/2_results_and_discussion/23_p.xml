<p class="p">Flash point is the lowest temperature at which a liquid can form an ignitable mixture in air near the surface of the liquid. It has value of 290.00 (pulp) and 295.00 (seed) 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> oils. The lower the flash point, the easier it is to ignite the material. The extracted oils were light amber yellow and pale yellow colour for pulp and seed oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. barteri</italic> samples, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 0.00% in specific gravity to 18.52 in acid value.
