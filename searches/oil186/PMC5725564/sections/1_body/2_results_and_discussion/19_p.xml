<p class="p">Acid value is a measure of the free fatty acids in oil. The higher the acid value found, the higher the level of free fatty acids which translates into decreased oil quality. Acceptable levels for all oil samples should be below 0.6 mg KOH/g (measured in potassium hydroxide per gram) [
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Among the oil samples studied, the seed oil has highest (24.00 mg KOH/g) acid value which indicates high free fatty acids and leads to a tendency to become rancid (off-flavor). Acid value is also used as an indicator for edibility of an oil and suitability for use in the paint and soap industries [
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. High acid values in the oils (16.50mg KOH/g and 24.00mg KOH/g) for pulp and seed samples, respectively showed that the oils may not be suitable for use in cooking (edibility), but however, be useful for production of paints, liquid soap and shampoos [
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Acid value of the oil suitable for edible purpose should not exceed 4 mg KOH/g [
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>].
