<p>The total unsaturated fatty acids (TUFA) were 66.65% in seed and 78.43% in pulp oils. The linoleic (n-6) and α–linolenic (n-3) fatty acids have critical roles in the membrane structure and as precursors of eicosanoids, which are potent and highly reactive compounds. Since they compete for the same enzymes and have different biological roles, the balance between the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in the diet can be of considerable importance [
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The recommended ratio of linoleic to α–linolenic acids in the diet should be between 5:1 and 10:1 [

The extracted oil from the pulp sample contained high concentration of MUFA, PUFA, TUFA, TEFA and O/L (%) which differ positively by 0.96%, 21.63%, 15.02%, 23.48% and 27.27%, respectively; from that of the seed oil, while the TSFA and TNEFA (%) of the seed oil sample varies respectively by 54.61% and 26.01% from the pulp sample (Table
