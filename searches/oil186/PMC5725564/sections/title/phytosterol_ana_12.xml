 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phytosterol analysis was done as described by AOAC [
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>]. The aliquots of the extracted fat were added to the screw - capped test tubes. The samples were saponified at 90°C for 30min, using 3 ml of 10% KOH in ethanol, to which 0.20 mL of benzene was added to ensure miscibility. Deionized water (3 mL) was added and 2 mL of hexane was added in extracting the non – saponifiable materials. Three different extrations, each with 2 mL of hexane were carried out for 1h, 30min and 30min, respectively. The hexane was concentrated to 1 mL in the vial for gas chromatography analysis and 1 μL was injected into the injection pot of GC. The GC conditions of analyses were similar to the GC conditions for methyl esters analyses [
