 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil extracted from each sample was converted to the methyl ester using the method described by Adeyeye and Adesina [
  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>]. A 50 mg aliquot of the dried oil was saponified for 5 min at 95°C with 3.4 ml of 0.5 M KOH in dry methanol. The mixture was neutralized by 0.7 M HCl and 3 ml of 14% boron trifloride in methanol was added. The mixture was heated for 5 min at 90°C to achieve complete methylation. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using an HP 6890 gas chromatograph powered with HP Chemistation Rev. a 09.01 (1206) software fitted with a flame ionization detector and a computing integrator. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The column initial temperature was 250°C rising at 5°C/min to a final temperature of 310°C, while the injection port and the detector were maintained at 310°C and 350°C, respectively. A polar (HP INNO Wax) capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 0.25 μm) was used to separate the esters. The peaks were identified by comparison with standard fatty acid methyl esters obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis MO, USA) [
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>]. However, the quantitative evaluation was carried out on the basis of gas chromatography peak areas of the different methyl esters. The heptadecanoic ester was used to calculate the response factor for fatty acids which was found to be 0.96. Three determinations were made for each sample.
