 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The constituents of the essential oil were identified by retention indices under temperature-programmed conditions based on co-injection of homologous n-alkanes (C
  <sub>6</sub>-C
  <sub>24</sub>) on the RTX-5 MS capillary column. Compounds were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the internal reference mass spectral NIST-107 library.
