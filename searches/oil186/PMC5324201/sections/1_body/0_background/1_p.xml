 <italic class="italic">Apiaceae</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Umbelliferae</italic>), comes under genus 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum</italic> and it is an annual and winter spice crop in Bangladesh. It is mostly grown in the northern part of Bangladesh. A variant called Indian dill or sowa (

 <italic class="italic">Anethum graveolens</italic> L.) and Indian dill (
 <italic class="italic">Anethum sowa</italic> L.) are differentiated mainly by the apiol and carvone content. 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum sowa</italic> is rich in apiol whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum graveolens</italic> is rich in carvone. The typical flavor of dill herb oil is due to α-phellandrene, limonene and dill ether (anethofuran) [
