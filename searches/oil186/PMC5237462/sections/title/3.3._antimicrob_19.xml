 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural products have become an excellent therapeutic alternative, where the research for plant compounds that have some pharmacological property has intensified significantly in recent years. That has awakened new looks to the Amazon region, because its flora is estimated at more than 55,000 species and less than 1% of it has been scientifically investigated [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Gram-positive bacterium protects its cytoplasmic membrane with a thick cell wall. The layers of peptidoglycan prevent the passage of hydrophilic compounds due to the presence of sugars and amino acids. The outer lipoprotein membrane presents characteristics and the bacteria need to have a mechanism enabling the entry of hydrophilic compounds like sugars, amino acids, and ions. Therefore, the outer membrane has special channels called porins, which allow the passive diffusion of hydrophilic compounds [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils mechanism of action about antimicrobial effect is acting directly on the bacterial cell wall structure, denaturing and coagulating proteins. Specifically, they act by altering the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane by hydrogen ions (H
  <span class="sup">+</span>) and potassium (K
  <span class="sup">+</span>). The amendment of the ion concentration gradients leads to deterioration of the essential processes of cell, such as transport of electrons, translocation proteins, stages of oxidative phosphorylation, and other reactions dependent enzymes, resulting in loss of chemiosmotic control of the affected cell, leading to cell death [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. piperita</span> has submitted inhibition zone in 100 mg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> concentrations at 7.6 ± 0,57 mm and 10 mg·mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> with 9 ± 1.0 mm for
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>, respectively. Compared with positive control and concentrations tested, there was significant difference between the inhibition zones, in which the halo in the positive control showed halo of 15 mm. The nonoccurrence of menthol may have influence on the occurrence of only one strain of bacteria, whereas linalool is also described such as potential agent in the control of bacteria.

  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">48</a>]. The linalool is a major component and it contributes to the antimicrobial potential of this plant. This potential essential oil of
