 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results found in this study show a great potential for use/application of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> M. Piperita</span> species because it has a diversified class of chemical compounds at antioxidant, microbial, and cytotoxic activities. The information obtained in this research corroborates the use of species reported by traditional communities and literature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, the use of these plants for the prevention and treatment of various human diseases seems reasonable and useful. The research contributes to enhancement and aggregation of the products of the Brazilian biodiversity, in the field of utilization of the species and insertion in the treatment of underlying disease in isolated regions where drugs in primary care health centers are sometimes not provided.</p>
