 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of antioxidant activity was held in Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry Laboratory of the Federal University of Amapá (UNIFAP). Based on the methodology proposed, we used 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) with some modifications [

  <span class="sup">−1</span>). For the evaluation, they were added into a test tube of 2.7 mL of the stock solution of DPPH, followed by addition of 0.3 mL of the essential oil solution. Meanwhile, the negative control was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7 mL of methanol and the methanolic solution of evaluated compounds. After 30 minutes, the readings were taken in a spectrophotometer (Biospectro SP-22) at a wavelength of 517 nm. For comparison, ascorbic acid was evaluated.
