 <p> (A) Effects of NiO NPs and PLEO on ROS production in A549 cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. H 2O 2 was used as a negative control. (B) PLEO attenuates NiO NPs induced ROS generation. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also. Data represented are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p &lt; 0.05; *** p &lt; 0.001 treatments compared to control; ≠ p &lt; 0.05 compared to NiO NPs. </p>)
