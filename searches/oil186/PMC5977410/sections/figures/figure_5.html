  <p class="p">Intracellular ROS generation in A549 cells. Images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX73). Effects of NiO NPs (A) and PLEO (B) on ROS production. Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. (C) PLEO attenuate NiO NPs induced ROS generation in dose-dependent manner. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oil for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also.</p>
