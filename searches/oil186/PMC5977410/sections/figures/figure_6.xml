 <p> (A) Effects of NiO NPs and PLEO on SOD activity in A549 cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. H 2O 2 was used as a negative control. (B) P. lentiscus essential oil attenuates NiO NPs decreased SOD activity. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also. Data represented are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p &lt; 0.01 treatments compared to control; ≠ p &lt; 0.05 and # p &lt; 0.01compared to NiO. </p>)
