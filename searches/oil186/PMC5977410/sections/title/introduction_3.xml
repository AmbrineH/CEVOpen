 <p id="par0025" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rapid development of nanotechnology has exposed man and his environment to a number of exotic metals. In the recent years, overgrowing nanotechnology industries have led to the large-scale production of engineered nanoparticles (NPs), especially the metal NPs, for various uses [
  <a rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0005">1</a>]. Nanoparticles are defined as particles with a diameter of less than 100â€¯nm in one structural dimension. Compared to the same materials with micrometer scale dimensions, nanomaterials have specific properties, such as small size, large surface area, shape, and special structure [
  <a rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0010">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0030" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NPs of many different metal oxides are currently being used in numerous applications, we give as examples: magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, electronics, catalysis, optical devices [
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">[4]</a>]; as well as consumer products like cosmetics, sunscreens, sports accessories, inks and pigments, etc. [
  <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">5</a>]. Due to the growing number of applications and the recent development of combustion-based engine transportation [
  <a rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0030">6</a>], there is an increasing risk for human, environment and exposure to NPs. Their potential toxicological impacts are still a matter of investigation and our actual knowledge on the effects of nano-sized contaminants on biological systems remains incomplete [
  <a rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0035">7</a>]. Their use also (which is still largely unregulated) has become a recognized social health problem because the inhalation, dermal absorption or ingestion of particles of various sizes and compositions leads to increased rates of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [
  <a rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0040">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nickel oxide nanoparticales (NiO NPs) have attracted increasing attention owing to potential use in a variety of applications such as catalysts, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lithium-ion batteries, resistive random access memory, electrochemical sensors and biosensors [
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">9</a>]. Therefore, increasing use of NiO NPs necessitates an improved understanding of their potential impact on the environment and human health. Besides, toxic effects of NiO NPs have been investigated in different human cell systems, mainly on liver and airway cells [
  <a rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0050">10</a>].

 <p id="par0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and the antioxidant systems favoring a ROS excess, has been identified as a common mechanism for cell damage. This imbalance can be amplified by aging, smoking, diseases and some kinds of food [
  <a rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0055">11</a>]. During oxidative stress, ROS are produced mainly from the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In addition, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to generate more free radicals and reactive oxygen species than larger particles, likely due to their higher surface area [
  <a rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0060">12</a>]. The inverse correlation between cell viabilities and the ROS level proved that oxidative stress is probably a key route by which nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity [
  <a rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0055">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0045" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, focus on plant research has increased all over the world. Many plant extracts have demonstrated potent chemo-preventive properties; most of these extracts are known to exert their effects via antioxidant mechanisms either by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting lipid peroxidation or by stimulating cellular antioxidant defenses [
  <a rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0065">[13]</a>,

  <span class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus</span> L. also known as mastic tree, belongs to the family Anacardiaceae which consisting of more than eleven species [
  <a rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0075">15</a>]. It is largely distributed in the Mediterranean region ecosystems where it grows wild in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, France, Spain, Italy and Greece [
  <a rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0080">16</a>]. Despite its limited distribution in the world, this plant is known internationally for several therapeutic properties. The aerial parts have been used in the treatment of hypertension and possess stimulant and diuretic properties [
  <a rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0085">17</a>]. According to Ali-Shtayeh et al. (1998) the leaves are extensively used in traditional medicine for the treatment of eczema, diarrhea, and throat infections, and as a potent antiulcer agent [
  <a rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0090">18</a>]. Several studies have also reported that essential oil from aerial parts possesses appreciable biological properties such as antioxidant [
  <a rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0095">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0100">[20]</a>], anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial [
  <a rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0095">19</a>], anti-fungal [
  <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">21</a>], and antiatherogenic [
  <a rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0110">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0055" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of PLEO using 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> tests complemented with a study of their cytoprotective activity against NiO NPs induced oxidative stress in human cell culture. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation using essential oil to reduce NPs inducing cytotoxicity.
