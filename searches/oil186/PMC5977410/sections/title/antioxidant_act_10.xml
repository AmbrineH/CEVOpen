 <p id="par0090" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DPPH and superoxide free radicals scavenging activity was evaluated according to Hatano et al. [
  <a rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0140">28</a>] and Beyer and Fridovich [
  <a rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0145">29</a>], respectively. The sample concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was calculated and reported as mean ± SD. Further, the ABTS assay was carried out utilizing the method of Re et al. [
  <a rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0150">30</a>]. TEAC value was calculated from the Trolox standard curve and expressed as Trolox equivalent (μmol/mg). The reducing power of the PLEO was determined according to reported method and expressed as Gallic acid equivalent (μg/g extract) [
  <a rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0155">31</a>]. Ascorbic acid and BHT served as positive control in all the previous assays, the experiments were also performed in triplicate and mean values recorded.
