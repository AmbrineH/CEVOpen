 <p id="par0210" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data demonstrated that NiO NPs induced cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, which the mechanism may be through ROS generation and oxidative stress. The crucial results highlight, for the first time, the antioxidant and the protective activities of essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. lentiscus</span> against cell oxidative damage induced by NiO NPs. These findings also showed the guidelines in the placement of NPs in safety to promote non-hazardous applications of nanotechnology.
