<p id="par0030">NPs of many different metal oxides are currently being used in numerous applications, we give as examples: magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, electronics, catalysis, optical devices [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]; as well as consumer products like cosmetics, sunscreens, sports accessories, inks and pigments, etc. [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to the growing number of applications and the recent development of combustion-based engine transportation [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], there is an increasing risk for human, environment and exposure to NPs. Their potential toxicological impacts are still a matter of investigation and our actual knowledge on the effects of nano-sized contaminants on biological systems remains incomplete [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Their use also (which is still largely unregulated) has become a recognized social health problem because the inhalation, dermal absorption or ingestion of particles of various sizes and compositions leads to increased rates of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [
