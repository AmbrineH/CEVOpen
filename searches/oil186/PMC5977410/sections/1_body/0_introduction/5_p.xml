<p id="par0040" class="p">Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and the antioxidant systems favoring a ROS excess, has been identified as a common mechanism for cell damage. This imbalance can be amplified by aging, smoking, diseases and some kinds of food [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. During oxidative stress, ROS are produced mainly from the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In addition, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to generate more free radicals and reactive oxygen species than larger particles, likely due to their higher surface area [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The inverse correlation between cell viabilities and the ROS level proved that oxidative stress is probably a key route by which nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity [
