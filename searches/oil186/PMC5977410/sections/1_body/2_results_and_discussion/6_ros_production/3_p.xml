<p id="par0185" class="p">Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between ROS production and the antioxidant systems favouring a ROS excess, has been identified as a common mechanism for cell damage. During oxidative stress, ROS are produced mainly from the mitochondrial electron transport chain. To minimize the damage induced by ROS, free radicals can be transformed to other less toxic molecules, for example, the superoxide anion is enzymatically converted into hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide may be enzymatically converted into water by catalase or glutathione peroxidase enzymes [
