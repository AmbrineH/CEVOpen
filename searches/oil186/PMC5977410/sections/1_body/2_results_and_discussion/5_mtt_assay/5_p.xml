<p id="par0175">According to the Natiaonal Cancer Institute (USA), vegetables crude extracts are cytotoxic considered when their IC

Whereas, the concentration of 80 μg/ml has the highest cytoprotective effect on NiO NPs reduced cell viability. In addition on the obtained results, it was not detected toxic effect in this model of human pulmonary cell line exposed to PLEO. The present study agree with the results of Remila et al. (2015) who have demonstrated that pre-trearment of THP-1 cells with
