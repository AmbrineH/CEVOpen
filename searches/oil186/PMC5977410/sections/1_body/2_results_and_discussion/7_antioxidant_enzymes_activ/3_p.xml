In contrast, these findings suggest that pre-treatment of cells with essential oil averted cell damage by preventing the decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes, SOD and CAT, induced by NiO NPs. In keeping with our results, many previously works has described the ability of essential oil to modulate the endogenous enzymatic system [
