<p id="par0105">The human lung epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin–streptomycin at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C. At 85% confluence, cells were harvested utilizing 0.25% trypsin and were sub-cultured into 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks, 96-well or 12-well plates according to selection of experiments. Cells were allowed to attach the surface for 24 h prior to treatment. NiO NPs were suspended in cell culture medium and diluted to appropriate concentrations (0.5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 μg/ml) for 24 h. The appropriate dilutions of NiO NPs were then sonicated using a sonicator bath at room temperature for 10 min at 40W to avoid nanoparticles agglomeration prior to administration to the cells. Cells were treated with PLEO at concentration of 60 and 80 μg/ml for 24 h before exposure to NiO NPs (80 and 100 μg/ml). Essential oil samples were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the medium (final concentration of DMSO in the medium was &lt;0.3%)
