 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 50–550 and ionization energy of 70 eV) data were measured on the same gas chromatograph coupled with MSD 5975. MS source temperature at 230 °C; MS quadrapole temperature at 150 °C; MSD transfer line was maintained at 280 °C. The HP-INNOWax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was directly coupled to the MS; the other parameters were the same as with GC analysis.
