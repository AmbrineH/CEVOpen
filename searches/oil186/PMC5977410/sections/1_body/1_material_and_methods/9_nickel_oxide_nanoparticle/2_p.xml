<p id="par0100">Crystalline nature of NiO NPs was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Shidmadzu XRD-6000 Diffractometer at room temperature, while shape and size were determined by field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM- 2100F, JEOL Inc., Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 120â€¯kV. On the other hand, dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Nano-ZetaSizer-ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK) was used to determine the hydrodynamic size and Zeta potential of the NiO NPs as described by Ahamed et al.
