<p id="par0090">DPPH and superoxide free radicals scavenging activity was evaluated according to Hatano et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Beyer and Fridovich [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], respectively. The sample concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated and reported as mean ± SD. Further, the ABTS assay was carried out utilizing the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TEAC value was calculated from the Trolox standard curve and expressed as Trolox equivalent (μmol/mg). The reducing power of the PLEO was determined according to reported method and expressed as Gallic acid equivalent (μg/g extract) [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ascorbic acid and BHT served as positive control in all the previous assays, the experiments were also performed in triplicate and mean values recorded.
