 <p> Cytocompatibility (viability %) of fibroblasts with all the nanoparticle suspensions, loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary oils (1/20, 1/40, and 1/100). Notes: Nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pullulan were also tested at 1/100 dilution. GM was used as comparison (positive control) (mean value Â± SD; n=8). Abbreviations: e, eucalyptus oil; GM, growth medium; NLC, nanostructured lipid carriers; o, olive oil; r, rosemary oil; s, sesame oil; SLN, solid lipid nanoparticles. </p>)
