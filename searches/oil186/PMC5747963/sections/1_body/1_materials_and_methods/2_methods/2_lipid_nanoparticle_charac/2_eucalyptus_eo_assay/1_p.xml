<p>Loading of eucalyptus EO in lipid carriers was determined by means of head space solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (according to eucalyptus oil – 07/2010:0390, Eur Ph. 9.0 Ed monograph). The following HSSPME experimental parameters were used: sample amount, 100 µL; water addition, 10 mL; fiber polydimethylsiloxane (100 µm); extraction temperature, 40°C; extraction time, 30 min; desorption temperature, 280°C; desorption time, 5 min.</p>
