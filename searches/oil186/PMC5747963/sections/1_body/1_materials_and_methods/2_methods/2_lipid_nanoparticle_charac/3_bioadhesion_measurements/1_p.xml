<p>Bioadhesion measurements were carried out using a texture analyzer apparatus (TA.XT plus, Stable Microsystems, ENCO, Spinea, Italy) equipped with a 1 kg load cell, a cylinder probe having a diameter of 10 mm (P10), and the A/MUC measuring system.

 <xref rid="b19-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The A/MUC measuring system consists of a support in which a biologic substrate can be fixed. In this case, the biologic substrate chosen to mimic damaged skin was an egg shell membrane,
 <xref rid="b18-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> wetted with 100 µL of isotonic saline (NaCl 0.9% w/v). To recover the membrane, the egg shell was placed in a 0.5 M HCl solution for 1 h. The A/MUC system was thermoset at 32°C. One hundred microliters of each nanosystem containing 5% w/w of pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, and 5%/w pull solution, as control, were placed onto the cylinder probe covered by filter paper disc and the sample and the biologic substrate were put in contact under a preload of 2.5 N for 3 min.
