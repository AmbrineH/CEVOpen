<p>GC-MS analysis was effected on a Thermo Scientific DSQII single quadrupole GC-MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) (Xcalibur MS Software Version 2.1) equipped with a Restek Rtx-5 MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness), according to the following temperature program: 4 min at 60°C, then 10°C/min up to 220°C, held for 10 min; carrier gas helium, 1.0 mL/min; injector temperature, 280°C, splitless mode; transfer line temperature, 250°C; run time, 30 min. All mass spectra were acquired in electron-impact mode with ionization voltage equal to 70 eV; ion source temperature 250°C; acquisition mass range 35–500 Da.</p>
