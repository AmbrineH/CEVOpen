<p class="p">All experiments on animals were carried out in full compliance with the standard international ethical guidelines (European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC), approved by Italian Health Ministry (D.L. 116/92). The study protocol was approved by the Local Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Pavia for the use of animals. Male rats (Wistar 200–250 g) were anesthetized with equitensine at 3 mL/kg (39 mM pentobarbital, 256 mM chloral hydrate, 86 mM MgSO

Three circular full-thickness burns, having a diameter of 4 mm, were produced on the back of the animals by contact with an aluminum rod (105°C for 40 s). Twenty-four hours later, the formed blisters were removed using a 4-mm diameter biopsy punch to obtain full-thickness lesions. Either 20 µL of nanoparticles suspension or 20 µL of nanoparticles suspension containing 5% w/w pull as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, was applied to the lesions. Lesions treated with 20 µL of saline solution were considered as control. After treatment, each lesion was protected with a sterile gauze and the rat’s back was wrapped with a surgery stretch (Safety, Bovisio Masciago, Italy). At prefixed times after blister removal (0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 18 days), photographs of the lesions were taken by a digital camera (Sigma SD 14, Sigma Corporation, Milan, Italy), which allowed sizing of the lesions and monitoring the healing process. Each treatment was repeated after each photograph. The dimensions of wounded area were determined by an image analysis software (ICY, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France).
