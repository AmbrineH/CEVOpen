<p>An aqueous phase (12.5 mL) containing lecithin (150 mg) was heated to 40°C and poured into the lipid phase under homogenization at 24,000 rpm for 5 min with an UltraTurrax equipment (T25, IKA, Labortechnik, Denmark). The resulting emulsion was cooled by diluting with distilled water (12 mL) at 2°C–8°C and subjected to ultrasounds (ultrasound frequency 37 kHz) (Elmasonic S80 H, Elma Hans Schmidbauer GmbH &amp; Co, Singen, Germany) for 10 min, to avoid agglomeration.</p>
