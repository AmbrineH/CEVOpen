 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> concentration and grown at confluence in standard conditions as previously described. After 24 h, cells reached confluence and the insert was removed displaying two areas of cell substrates divided by the gap. The cell substrates were put in contact with 200 ÂµL of each sample. Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, diluted with GM in a 1/100 w/w ratio were tested. Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as control. At prefixed times (0 and 48 h), microphotographs were taken to evaluate cell migration in the gap.
