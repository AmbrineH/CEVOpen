<p>The gap closure cell migration/proliferation assay was performed according to a previously described procedure.
 <xref rid="b21-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="b22-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The assay employs Petri µ-Dishes (35 mm, Ibidi, Giardini, Milan, Italy), which contain a special insert consisting of two cell chambers (growth area: 0.22 cm
 <sup>2</sup> each) divided by a septum (500±50 µm in width), intended to simulate a cell-free gap.
