<p class="p">Resident cells are less proliferating in chronic wounds and possess a morphology similar to that of senescent cells. In particular, fibroblasts of chronic wounds (long-lasting vascular leg ulcers) are characterized by a poorer response to platelet-derived growth factor, altered capability of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor expression, and abnormal phosphorylation of critical signal transduction proteins. Such features are typical of cells exposed to low oxygen tension, suggesting that chronic wounds are hypoxic.
