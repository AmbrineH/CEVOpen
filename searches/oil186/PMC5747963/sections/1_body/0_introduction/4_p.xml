<p>The effect of microbial burden on healing of chronic wound is not completely understood and it is probably underestimated.
 <xref rid="b2-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The presence of a biofilm was indicated as a critical factor and a correlation between depth and duration of the lesion and the presence of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains was demonstrated.
 <xref rid="b4-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, microbial wound colonization (typically due to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and some 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> strains) was proved responsible for a further delay in wound recovery.
