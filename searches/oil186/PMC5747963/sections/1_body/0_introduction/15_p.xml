<p>Nanoparticles were characterized for physicalâ€“chemical properties, bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was evaluated against two reference microbial strains, one of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the other 
 <italic>of Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. Finally, the capability of nanoparticles to promote wound healing in vivo was evaluated on a rat burn model.
