<p>Eucalyptus oil was characterized by the same MIC value (3 mg/mL) against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, either as a free oil or after loading into NLC, indicating that encapsulation did not impair its antimicrobial activity. On the contrary, it showed an enhanced antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> when encapsulated in NLC, because MIC values decreased from 1.5 mg/mL, for free oil, to 0.75 mg/mL, for NLC o/e.
