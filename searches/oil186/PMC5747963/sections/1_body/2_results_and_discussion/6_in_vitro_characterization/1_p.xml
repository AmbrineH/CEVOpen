 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-13-175">Figure 6</xref> reports the TEM microphotograph of NLC o/e. Nanoparticles were round shaped and showed a relatively small size dispersion around 50–60 nm, smaller than that expected on the basis of PCS measurements, which were probably affected by the presence of aggregates, responsible for a high PI (close to 0.5).
 <xref rid="b26-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> NLC o/e was characterized by a highly negative zeta potential equal to −22.07±0.29 mV (mean value ± SD, n=3). These results should conceivably be due to the presence onto nanoparticle surface of lecithin, which was proved to confer a negative zeta potential to nanosystems.
 <xref rid="b27-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The presence of lecithin allowed particle stabilization and controlled particle aggregation as evidenced by 3-month stability results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-175">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Eucalyptus EO loaded in NLC o/e was close to 100% (101.74±9.06%, mean value ± SD, n=3), indicating that the preparation procedure did not impair oil stability and loading, although it is a volatile extract.
