<p class="p">Independent of nanoparticle composition, PS ranged from 220 to 300 nm and remained almost constant up to 3 months of storage. Similar results were obtained for PI that was close to 0.5, indicating nanoparticle populations characterized by a quite wide PS distribution, stable up to 3 months.</p>
