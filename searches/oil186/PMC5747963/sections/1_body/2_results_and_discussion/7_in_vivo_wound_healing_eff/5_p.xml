 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-13-175" class="xref">Figure 8C</xref>), skin appeared completely re-epithelized, and epidermis (bracket) was well organized in multiple cell layers, with a fair degree of keratinization, similar to the structures observed in the section obtained from wound treated with NLC o/e (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-13-175" class="xref">Figure 8B</xref>). Dermal papillae (white star) were in developing phase; furthermore, granulation tissue (arrows) and dilated vessels (black star) were present in a limited area, while collagen fibers were organized in large bundles, typical of the reticular layer of the dermis (white arrow).
