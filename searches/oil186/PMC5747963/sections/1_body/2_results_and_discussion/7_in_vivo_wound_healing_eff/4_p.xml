<p>In correspondence with the wound treated with NLC o/e suspension (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-13-175">Figure 8B</xref>), epidermis (bracket) appeared continuous and well organized in multiple cell layers with a fair degree of keratinization. In the underlying connective tissue, skin appendages were vacant, but dermal papillae (white star) began to reform. A mild inflammatory infiltrate was visible (arrow), as well as a number of blood vessels (black star). Some scattered collagen fibers were present at the border with epidermis, while in the reticular layer of the dermis, the typical large bundles of collagen (white arrow) were already formed.
