<p class="p">Both SLN systems, either loaded with eucalyptus oil or with rosemary oil, were characterized by scarce bioadhesive properties. This result could be attributable to rigid structure of these nanoparticles, which impaired their interaction with the biologic substrates, preventing the formation of the bio-adhesive joint. On the contrary, all NLC formulations were characterized by good bioadhesive properties. The systems containing olive oil showed bioadhesion parameters significantly higher than those of the corresponding systems prepared by using sesame oil (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test
