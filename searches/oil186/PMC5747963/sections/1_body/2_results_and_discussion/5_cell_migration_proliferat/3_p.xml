<p>The contact with NLC o/e determined a higher concentration of green-stained cells in the gap, that were proliferating cells, with respect to the other nanosystems. It is conceivable that oleic acid determined a synergic effect with eucalyptus oil to enhance cell proliferation. Given these results, NLC o/e was chosen as the most promising nanosystem and subjected to further characterization.</p>
