The incorporation of BrdU was detected by an immunostaining reaction with anti-BrdU antibody (Amersham Bioscience, VWR) as follows: the substrates were washed with PBS and incubated with HCl 2N for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were neutralized in 0.1 M sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) for 15 min, washed twice for 5 min in PBS, and incubated for 20 min in a blocking solution, consisting of 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02% w/v Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.
