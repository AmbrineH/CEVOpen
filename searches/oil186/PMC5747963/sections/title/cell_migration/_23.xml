  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-13-175" href="#f5-ijn-13-175">Figure 5</a> reports the microphotographs of cell substrates taken at time 0 (immediately after insert removal) and after 48 h growing, by using an optical microscope or a fluorescence microscope (cell nuclei stained with Hoechst 33258 in blue and proliferating cells stained with anti-BrdU antibody in green).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the samples were able to promote cell migration/proliferation in the gaps at least as the GM. In particular, cell substrates put in contact with NLC o/e, based on olive oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil, containing 5% w/w pull, showed a complete gap closure within 48 h after insert removal and a cell concentration higher than that of standard growth condition (control, GM). This nanosystem, therefore, demonstrated to be more effective in promoting wound healing in vitro.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contact with NLC o/e determined a higher concentration of green-stained cells in the gap, that were proliferating cells, with respect to the other nanosystems. It is conceivable that oleic acid determined a synergic effect with eucalyptus oil to enhance cell proliferation. Given these results, NLC o/e was chosen as the most promising nanosystem and subjected to further characterization.</p>
