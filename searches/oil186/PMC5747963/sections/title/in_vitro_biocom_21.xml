  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-175" href="#f3-ijn-13-175">Figure 3</a>, cytocompatibility (% viability) of all the nanosystems developed, loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary oil, are compared. All the nanosytems (independent of the EO loaded) were characterized by concentration-dependent cytocompatibility. For a given formulation, the higher nanoparticle concentration (corresponding to the lowest dilution, 1/20) was characterized by % viability ranging from 30% to 50%, not significantly different than that of 1/40 dilution. On the contrary, 1/100 dilution determined a % viability ranging from 50% to 95%, significantly higher than those of the other two dilutions (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.05). The presence of pull determined an increase in cyto-compatibility. NLC systems based on olive oil and containing 5% w/w pull were characterized at 1/100 dilution by cyto-compatibility not significantly different than that of GM and significantly higher than those of NLC containing sesame oil (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.05).
