 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bioadhesion measurements were carried out using a texture analyzer apparatus (TA.XT plus, Stable Microsystems, ENCO, Spinea, Italy) equipped with a 1 kg load cell, a cylinder probe having a diameter of 10 mm (P10), and the A/MUC measuring system.

  <a rid="b19-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19-ijn-13-175">19</a> The A/MUC measuring system consists of a support in which a biologic substrate can be fixed. In this case, the biologic substrate chosen to mimic damaged skin was an egg shell membrane,
  <a rid="b18-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18-ijn-13-175">18</a> wetted with 100 µL of isotonic saline (NaCl 0.9% w/v). To recover the membrane, the egg shell was placed in a 0.5 M HCl solution for 1 h. The A/MUC system was thermoset at 32°C. One hundred microliters of each nanosystem containing 5% w/w of pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, and 5%/w pull solution, as control, were placed onto the cylinder probe covered by filter paper disc and the sample and the biologic substrate were put in contact under a preload of 2.5 N for 3 min.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cylinder probe was then moved upward at a prefixed speed of 2.5 mm/s up to the complete separation of the bioadhesive interface (egg shell membrane–sample).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The force of detachment was recorded as a function of displacement and the bioadhesion parameter work of adhesion (area under the curve [AUC]) (mN mm, AUC) was calculated as the area under the force vs displacement curve.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The normalized adhesion parameter ΔAUC/AUC was subsequently calculated according to the following equation:
