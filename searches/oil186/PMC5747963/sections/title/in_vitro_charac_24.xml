  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-13-175" href="#f6-ijn-13-175">Figure 6</a> reports the TEM microphotograph of NLC o/e. Nanoparticles were round shaped and showed a relatively small size dispersion around 50–60 nm, smaller than that expected on the basis of PCS measurements, which were probably affected by the presence of aggregates, responsible for a high PI (close to 0.5).
  <a rid="b26-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26-ijn-13-175">26</a> NLC o/e was characterized by a highly negative zeta potential equal to −22.07±0.29 mV (mean value ± SD, n=3). These results should conceivably be due to the presence onto nanoparticle surface of lecithin, which was proved to confer a negative zeta potential to nanosystems.
  <a rid="b27-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27-ijn-13-175">27</a> The presence of lecithin allowed particle stabilization and controlled particle aggregation as evidenced by 3-month stability results (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-175" href="#f1-ijn-13-175">Figure 1A and B</a>). Eucalyptus EO loaded in NLC o/e was close to 100% (101.74±9.06%, mean value ± SD, n=3), indicating that the preparation procedure did not impair oil stability and loading, although it is a volatile extract.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eucalyptus oil was characterized by the same MIC value (3 mg/mL) against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, either as a free oil or after loading into NLC, indicating that encapsulation did not impair its antimicrobial activity. On the contrary, it showed an enhanced antimicrobial activity against 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> when encapsulated in NLC, because MIC values decreased from 1.5 mg/mL, for free oil, to 0.75 mg/mL, for NLC o/e.
