 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NLC based on cocoa butter and olive oil, as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, and loaded with eucalyptus oil (NLC o/e) were prepared by high shear homogenization and ultrasound method. Lecithin was used as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to avoid their aggregation. NLC o/e was characterized by a PS of 200–300 nm and demonstrated to be physically stable up to 3 months (2–8°C). It showed good bioadhesive properties, probably determined by NLC flexibility, which could promote interaction with the biologic substrate and the consequent bioadhesive joint formation; this is an important feature to allow an intimate contact between formulation and lesion, to assure treatment efficacy. NLC o/e showed good biocompatibility and proliferation properties toward normal human fibroblasts in an in vitro wound healing model. These properties could be due to the presence of olive oil, a fatty acid with a high content of oleic acid, already known for its good proliferation enhancement potential.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Encapsulation of eucalyptus oil in NLC did not impair its antimicrobial properties against two gram-positive bacterial strains commonly present in the skin (
