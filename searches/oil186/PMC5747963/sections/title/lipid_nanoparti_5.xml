 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cocoa butter (225 mg) was used as lipid phase for SLNs, whereas NLCs were based on a lipid phase made of cocoa butter (150 mg) mixed with olive oil (75 mg) or sesame oil (75 mg).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each lipid phase was melted at 40°C and eucalyptus or rosemary EO (75 mg) was added. The total amounts of lipid components were the same for SLN and NLC.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An aqueous phase (12.5 mL) containing lecithin (150 mg) was heated to 40°C and poured into the lipid phase under homogenization at 24,000 rpm for 5 min with an UltraTurrax equipment (T25, IKA, Labortechnik, Denmark). The resulting emulsion was cooled by diluting with distilled water (12 mL) at 2°C–8°C and subjected to ultrasounds (ultrasound frequency 37 kHz) (Elmasonic S80 H, Elma Hans Schmidbauer GmbH &amp; Co, Singen, Germany) for 10 min, to avoid agglomeration.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resulting lipid nanoparticle suspension was characterized as such or after addition of pull to obtain 5% w/w as final pull concentration in the lipid nanoparticle suspension. The quali-quantitative composition of all the nanosystems is reported in
