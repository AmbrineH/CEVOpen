 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Oils and fats have important roles in cooking, frying and salad dressings or in food formulations; they make an important contribution to our diet and our health. Omega-3 (ω
  <sub>3</sub>) fatty acids such as linolenic acid, and omega-6 (ω
  <sub>6</sub>) fatty acids such as linoleic acid, are essential fatty acids; thus, they must be supplied through foods. Today, most of the oils consumed in our daily diet such as corn, sunflower, rice bran and grape seed oils have a high amount of ω
  <sub>6</sub>fatty acids and therefore, lead to ω
  <sub>6</sub>:ω
  <sub>3</sub> ratio increases ranging from 8-12:1; however, this ratio should be 4:1.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> ω
  <sub>3</sub> and ω
  <sub>6</sub> fatty acids are essential for normal growth and have an important role in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of immune function. The ω
  <sub>6</sub> eicosanoids without ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids are pro-inflammatory and may lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and arthritis.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>
  </span> Therefore, their balance is very important in our daily intake.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Different fats/oils have various chemical and physical properties. Pure vegetable oils can have low functional characterization or nutritional properties. For example, using olive oil or sesame oil alone has some drawbacks such as their low amount of ω
  <sub>3</sub> essential fatty acids. Instead, flaxseed oil is a rich source of ω
  <sub>3</sub>, tocopherols and other bioactive compounds,
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>
  </span> but in pure form it is very unstable and oxidizes quickly.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Sesame oil is a good source of ω
  <sub>6</sub> fatty acids and has a considerable level of sesamin and sesamolin lignans, which have different bioactive and health promoting effects.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a>
  </span> Furthermore, sesame oil has anti-inflammatory activity and antiproliferative effects on cancer cells caused by tocopherol homologues.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>,
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>
  </span> Sesame oil in spite of containing 85% unsaturated fatty acids, is one of the most stable vegetable oils to oxidation.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>
  </span> However, sesame oil, which has positive nutritious and healthy effects, is low in ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids and because of its high price has limited application in the food industry.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Olive oil is a good source of ω
  <sub>9</sub> and bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and phytosterols
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>,
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>
  </span> and because of its fatty acid composition and natural antioxidants such as tocopherols and polyphenols, it is more stable to heat treatments.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Consuming edible oils with a suitable ratio of essential fatty acids, appropriate stability to heat treatment and storage is a very important issue in the food industry. Unfortunately, no pure oil has both an ideal fatty acid composition and good oxidative stability.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Blending is the simplest physical and economical procedure to change fatty acid composition, increase the bioactive components and natural antioxidants and make a new at an affordable price.

   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>,
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Flaxseed and products fortified with flaxseed powder and oil is gaining more attention because of its valuable nutritional properties.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>
  </span> In the present study, flaxseed oil was blended with sesame and olive oils in different ratios to provide optimal essential fatty acids with a suitable stability and high bioactive content. These mixtures were stored at different temperatures to study the feasibility of introducing these functional vegetable oils to the market.
