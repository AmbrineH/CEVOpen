 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> PV results of the oil blends stored at 65°C for 10 days showed that olive oil is more stable than sesame and flaxseed oils. Flaxseed oil had the lowest stability which has also been previously reported.

  </span> Oil blends had a significant differences in PV obtained using the Schaal test (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). As the amount of flaxseed oil was increased in the oil blends the oxidation stability of the oil blends decreased.
