  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aerial plant parts (leaves, stems and flowers) were collected during its flowering time from Jericho region (Palestine) in May, 2015. Botanical identification was carried out by Pharmacognosist Dr. Nidal Jaradat in the Pharmacognosy and Herbal Products Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, An-Najah National University, Palestine. The identification process was conducted using live herbal specimens and photographs from books. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Pharmacognosy and Herbal Products Laboratory under the code number: Pharm-PCT-2432.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To extract the volatile oil, the aerial parts of 
   <span class="italic">T. bovei</span> were separated carefully and then washed twice using distilled water to avoid contamination. The washed parts were cut into small pieces for future use.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil isolation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microwave-ultrasonic method is a recently developed method used for the extraction of essential oils from medicinal plants. In this method, the volatile oil was extracted using a microwave oven with ultra-sonication. However, during the extraction process, the powder suspension being extracted was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process. In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used (Ultrasonic-microwave Cooperative Extractor/Reactor (CW-2000, China)). A one L round bottom flask containing about 100 g of the plant was placed in this apparatus. In this flask, the plant was suspended in about 500 ml deionized water. Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus, which was placed in the same apparatus. While carrying out the extraction process, the power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50 W and at a frequency of 40 kHz). The extraction process using this apparatus was conducted for 10 min at 100 °C. This process was repeated three times. The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried and stored in well closed dark amber colored bottles in the refrigerator at −4 °C. The yield of this extraction method was 1.4 % w/w based on the fresh weight.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS chromatograms were recorded using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS. The GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (30 m long, 0.25 μm thickness and 0.250 mm inner diameter). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Injector temperature was 220 °C. Oven temperature was programmed from 50 °C (1 min hold) at 5 °C/min to 130 °C, then at 10 °C/min to 250 °C and kept isothermally for 15 min. Transfer line temperature was 290 °C. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with detector volts of 1.7 KV was used. A scan rate of 0.5 s, and scan speed 1000 amu/s was applied, covering a mass range from 38–450 M/Z.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A stock solution of 
   <span class="italic">T. bovei</span> essential oil was used to prepare stock solutions in methanol and Trolox, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Each of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100 μg/ml. A fresh solution of prepared DPPH (0.002%w/v) was mixed with methanol and with each of the above mentioned working solutions at 1:1:1 ratio. In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the above mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in 1:1 ratio. Then, all of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min. The optical density of these solutions was determined by using spectrophotometer at a wave length of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil and Trolox were determined using the following formula:
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Percentage of inhibition of DPPH activity (%) = (A-B)/A × 100 %, where: A = optical density of the blank and B = optical density of the sample.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">T. bovei</span> was investigated for its antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antibacterial activity was examined against the growth of four reference bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); 
   <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC 25923), 
   <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC 25922) and

   <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> clinical isolate. The antimicrobial activities of 
   <span class="italic">T. bovei</span> oil used in this study were determined by using broth micro-dilution method as described previously by Wikler 2007 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">T. bovei</span> was dissolved in 5 % Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml. The prepared oil solution was filter-sterilized and then was serially micro-diluted (2 folds) 11 times in sterile nutrient broth. The dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions in 96 well plates. In the micro-wells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the oil, the concentration of this oil ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml. While the concentrations of this oil in the micro-wells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml. In these plates, micro-well number 11 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. On the other hand, micro-well number 12 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth that was left un-inoculated with any of the test microbes. This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Micro-wells numbers 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5 × 10
   <span class="sup">5</span> and 0.5–2.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and

Anthelmintic assay was carried out by dividing the earth worms into eight groups containing 10 worms in each group, five different concentrations of the essential oil (10, 40, 50, 75, and 100 mg/ml) in distilled water were prepared for the study. Distilled water was used as control. The reference drug piperazine citrate were also prepared in distilled water at 10 mg/ml. The time of paralysis was recorded when no movement was observed even after vigorous shaking. The time of death of worms was recorded after ascertaining that the worms neither moved when shaken vigorously nor when dipped in warm water (50 °C). The anthelmintic activity was determined by the method followed by Dash et al. 2002 [
