 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils were extracted by the method of Folch et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Seeds (2.5 g) were washed with boiling water for 5 min and then crushed in a mortar with chloroform/methanol (2:1, 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/v). The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min and the lower chloroformic phase containing the total lipids was kept and dried in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The saponification and the Thin layer chromatography analysis of unsaponoifiables were done according to the previous reports [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The unsaponifiable fraction and the authentic 1-eicosanol were spotted on preparative silica gel thin-layer plates (silica gel 60G F254) and developed with hexane–diethyl ether (65:35, 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/v). After development, the plate was sprayed with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein and viewed under UV light. The band corresponding to aliphatic alcohols was scraped, extracted three times with chloroform–diethyl ether (1:1, v/v), filtered to remove the residual silica, dried in a rotary evaporator and stored at − 10 °C.
