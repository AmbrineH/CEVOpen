  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of seed oil samples was determined using DPPH radicals as described by Kozłowska et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Fifty mg of oil was dissolved in 3 mL of ethyl acetate and then 1 mL of oil solution was diluted with 2.75 mL ethyl acetate. 0.25 mL of DPPH solution (1 mM) was added and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 10s in a vortex apparatus. After 20 min, the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using UV/Vis scanning spectrophotometer (Model 2650, Labomed, Inc. U.S.A) and the percent of inhibition was calculated using this formula:

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ABTS radical scavenging capacity of the oil was measured using the method described by Rubalya and Neelamegam [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The ABTS
   <span class="sup">+</span> radical was generated by oxidation of 2.5 ml of ABTS solution (7 mM) with potassium persulfate (14.7 mM). The mixture is kept in the dark for 16 h at room temperature (25 °C). Before usage, the mixture was diluted with water to obtain an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.05 at 734 nm. The radical scavenging activity is assessed by mixing 2 ml of this diluted ABTS+ solution with different oil samples dissolved in benzene. After 30 min, the percentage inhibition at 734 nm was calculated for each sample relative to blank absorbance. The percentage inhibition of ABTS radical by the oils was calculated using the equation described in the DPPH assay.
