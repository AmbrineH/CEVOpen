 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stress in the human tissues leads to several diseases like cancer, diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis and chronic inflammatory disorders. Nearly one-fifth of the world’s population is affected by rheumatoid arthritis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. The anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory drugs presently used are characterized by their possible adverse effects on the body such as ulcers and cardiovascular problems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Also, the use of synthetic antioxidants like butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene in the pharmaceutical and food industries has various side effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Therefore, much attention has been focused on the development of alternative anti- arthritic agents and antioxidants from natural resources. It was reported that the intake of natural antioxidants has been inversely associated with morbidity and mortality from degenerative disorders and other infections [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Medicinal plant may offer an alternative source for the anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs. The antioxidant capacity of plant extracts was influenced by different parameters such as environmental conditions, genotype and stage of maturity [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Policosanol is a mixture of long-chain (C20 to C36) aliphatic primary alcohols exhibiting various beneficial effects on the human health. It was originally isolated from sugar cane wax and is also found in a number of other natural sources such as beeswax and vegetable oils [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Policosanol may be effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, enhancing LDL catabolism and increasing high density lipoprotein levels in serum [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. These aliphatic alcohols have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Octacosanol (C28-OH), the main active policosanol, has gained attention due to its health benefits including anti-parkinsonian, antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Triacontanol (C30-OH) is able to induce anti-inflammatory responses in animals, prevent oxidative stress and inhibit lipid peroxidation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Millán et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] revealed that the nutraceutical combination containing policosanol, berberine, and red yeast rice induced significant improvements in plasma lipids. Therefore, there is growing interest in the identification of natural sources of policosanol for the functional foods and nutraceutical applications [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Contents and compositions of policosanol in different plant sources such as rice bran, wheat bran, sugar cane wax, corn kernel, green tea leaves, grain sorghum, perilla seeds and grape seed have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Milk thistle (
  <span class="italic">Silybum marianum</span> L.) is an important medicinal plant from the family 
  <span class="italic">Asteraceae</span>. The bioactive compounds are mainly concentrated in its seeds which have been used for more than 2000 years to treat liver diseases. Milk thistle seeds contain 17.5–30.5% of lipids rich in unsaturated fatty acids and 1–3% of silymarin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>].. Recently, certain 
  <span class="italic">Silybum marianum</span> accessions have begun to be cultivated in several countries and the specie is undergoing domestication for making the supply of silymarin sustainable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Previously published studies examined the triacylglycerol, fatty acid, tocopherol, sterol and polyhpenol composition of milk thistle seeds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Significant differences were observed between milk thistle cultivars for the content of bioactive compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Also, the antioxidant properties of ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds and methanolic extracts of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>].To the best of our knowledge, however, no data has been published on the policosanol composition and the anti-arthritic activity of milk thistle oil. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the policosanol profile, anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities of milk thistle oil at different stages of seed maturity. Such data could serve for the evaluation of nutritional and health impact of milk thistle oil and for the development of new source of natural bioactive compounds.
