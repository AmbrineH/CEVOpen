<p id="Par42">Protein denaturation is a process in which proteins lose their tertiary structure and secondary structure. It is one of the causes of arthritic disease and inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Mechanism of denaturation probably involves alteration in electrostatic, hydrogen, hydrophobic and disulphide bonding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In vitro anti-arthritic activity of studied oil samples was evaluated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation and egg albumin denaturation methods. Our study reveals that the milk thistle oil is capable to inhibit the denaturation of protein (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The oil extracted from mature seeds showed inhibition of denaturation of BSA and egg albumin by 72.49% and 59.89%, respectively. This result suggested that milk thistle oil might prevent denaturation of protein in rheumatoid arthritis and could be used as a potential anti- arthritic agent. Previously published studies examined the anti-arthritic activity of various plant extracts. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> inhibited the egg albumin and bovin serum denaturation by 84.15% 60.47%, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The methanolic stem extract of 
 <italic>Cuscuta pedicellata</italic> also exhibited strong inhibition of protein denaturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Kamble et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] indicated that ethanolic extract of leaves of 
 <italic>Vitex negundo</italic> and Punica granatum showed potential anti-arthritic activity as compared to aqueous extract.
