<p id="Par43" class="p">Our results showed that the anti-arthritic activity of oil samples was affected by the seed maturity stage, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. The maximum inhibition of BSA denaturation (92.53%) and egg albumin denaturation (86.36%) were exhibited by the oil extracted from the immature seeds. Throughout seed maturation, the total policosanol content of milk thistle oil was highly correlated with the inhibition of BSA denaturation (0.774) and egg albumin denaturation (0.901) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).Therefore, the anti-arthritic activity of oil can be attributed, in part, to the policosanol content. Kumari et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora mucronata</italic> might be due to the presence of active principles such as polyphenolic content, triterpenoids, alkaloids and flavanoids. Though present in small amounts, the minor constituents of dietary oils may supplement the dietary therapies for rheumatoid arthritis [
