<p id="Par41" class="p">During seed maturation, a high positive correlation was observed between total policosanol content and antiradical activity of seed oil samples through DPPH (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.952) and ABTS (r = 0.899) assays (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). This result suggested that policosanol content may contribute to the antioxidant potential of oil sample. The antioxidant activity was correlated not only with the total amount of antioxidants, but also with the presence of selected compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Dabbour et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] reported that the high free radical scavenging capacity of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds and alpha-tocopherol. For the ethanolic extract of milk thistle seeds, the antioxidant potential was mainly correlated to the total content of flavonoids and phenolics rather than the content of individual compounds including silybin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Other reports indicated a positive correlation between radical scavenging capacity of seed oils and their levels of unsaponifiables and phytosterols, while a negative relation was noted with the amounts of phenolics and tocopherols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Conversely, Kozłowska et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] reported a positive correlation between total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of seed oils and a negative correlation with total sterols. The general consensus within the literature is that the antioxidant capacity appears to be related to the complementary role of different synergic compounds rather than being ascribed to one or a few compounds [
