<p id="Par37">The aliphatic alcohols fraction of the milk thistle oil was submitted to the GC-MS analysis. Nine aliphatic alcohols were identified in the oil samples and they range from C
 <sub>22</sub> to C
 <sub>32</sub> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The dominant policosanols in the mature seed oil were Octacosanol (75.44%) and triacontanol (8.61%), however the other aliphatic alcohols detected including C
 <sub>22</sub>, C
 <sub>23</sub>, C
 <sub>24</sub>, C
 <sub>26</sub>, C
 <sub>27</sub>, C
 <sub>29</sub>, and C
 <sub>32</sub> were present in amounts ranging from 1.52 to 3.34%. Milk thistle oil extracted from mature seeds could serve as natural source of octacosanol, which has been shown to exhibit various beneficial effects such as anti-parkinsonian, antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Octacosanol is also the single most abundant policosanol in sugar cane wax (60–70%) and perilla seeds (55.93%) with a minor quantity of many other policosanols [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The policosanol composition in vegetable oils was greatly source dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the commercial green tea leaves, octacosanol (29.9–42.7%) and triacontanol (27.4–41.5%) were the main policosanol components [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Olive oil was characterized by the predominance of hexacosanol, tetracosanol and octacosanol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Harrabi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that dotriacontanol (30.1–35.5%) was the major policosanol in whole corn kernel, followed by triacontanol (17.7–24.8%) and tetracosanol (15.2–25.7%). However in wheat, tetracosanol was the most abundant compound, followed by docosanol and hexacosanol [
