 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the percentages of octacosanol, triacontanol and dotriacontanol were largely influenced by seed maturity stages. In immature seeds, the dominant alcohol was C
 <sub>30</sub> (40.25%), followed by C
 <sub>28</sub> (30.42%) and C
 <sub>32</sub> (16.36%). During seed maturation, the percentage of octacosanol increased rapidly, while those of triacontanol and dotriacontanol decreased. The levels of the other detected compounds were relatively constant, as the seed developed. In agreement to our present trends, the level of triacontanol was also found to decrease during corn kernel development [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The variation in the policosanol composition might be due to the physiological changes that accompany ripening of seeds. Triacontanol exhibited anti-inflammatory action in animals and has been suggested to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug [
