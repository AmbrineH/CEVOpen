<p id="Par35">To the best of our knowledge, the policosanol composition of milk thistle oil has never been previously reported. As seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the total policosanol content of the mature milk thistle seeds was 574.4 mg/kg of oil (equivalent to about 175.2 mg/kg of dry weight) and was higher than those of grape seed and rice bran oils (171.17–245.15 mg/kg of oil) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it was lower than those of other plant sources such as sorghum kernel (800 mg/kg dry weight) and green tea leaves (726.2–1363.6 mg/kg dry weight) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Milk thistle seed oil had high content of policosanols which are considered important from a nutritional and functional point of view. Policosanol contents in vegetables are shown to vary due to many factors like species, ripening grade of fruits and type of tissue [
