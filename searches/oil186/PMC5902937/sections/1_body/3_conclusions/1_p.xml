<p id="Par44" class="p">The results of the present study demonstrated that milk thistle oil exhibited potential antioxidant and anti-arthritic activities. Thus, this oil might prevent denaturation of protein in rheumatoid arthritis and could serve as natural antioxidant and anti-arthritic agents for application in the food industries and pharmaceutic. The immature seed oil that contained the highest policosanol amount showed the maximum anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities as compared to mature seed oil. Policosanol contents in the seed oils may have a great impact on their biological effects. Further studies are needed to explore the medicinal value of milk thistle oil and to elucidate the mechanism of the In-vitro anti-arthritic activity of the seed oil.</p>
