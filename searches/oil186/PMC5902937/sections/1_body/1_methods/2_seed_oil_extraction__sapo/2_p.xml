<p id="Par25">The saponification and the Thin layer chromatography analysis of unsaponoifiables were done according to the previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The unsaponifiable fraction and the authentic 1-eicosanol were spotted on preparative silica gel thin-layer plates (silica gel 60G F254) and developed with hexane–diethyl ether (65:35, 
 <italic>v</italic>/v). After development, the plate was sprayed with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein and viewed under UV light. The band corresponding to aliphatic alcohols was scraped, extracted three times with chloroform–diethyl ether (1:1, v/v), filtered to remove the residual silica, dried in a rotary evaporator and stored at − 10 °C.
