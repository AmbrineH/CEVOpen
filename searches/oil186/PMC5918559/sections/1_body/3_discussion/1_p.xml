<p id="Par28">The use of in vitro assays in veterinary parasitology, especially a series of tests for the evaluation of action against the main stages of a parasite (eggs, larvae and adults), is advantageous for the choice of substances to be tested in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These assays are rapid, inexpensive and simple. They reduce the number of animals that are necessary for in vivo testing, and permit the combined and optimized assessment of a series of compounds for both the development of new drugs and the study of resistance to different anthelmintics. Within this context, different approaches have used this experimental strategy for the study of anthelmintic agents, including those against
