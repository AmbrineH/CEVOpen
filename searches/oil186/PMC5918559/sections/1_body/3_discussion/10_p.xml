<p id="Par37" class="p">The application of ethnopharmacological/chemotaxonomic-based strategies is important to optimize studies of botanical anthelmintic agents in order to increase the success of developing new plant-derived or herbal agents of interest for the pharmaceutical-veterinary industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Although in vivo studies are still needed, the present work preliminarily validates the ethnopharmacological and chemotaxonomic data that indicate the use of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. nobile</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> as anthelmintics. This is the first study testing the essential oils of these plants against 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic>, highlighting their ethnopharmacological use and pharmaceutical-veterinary value.
