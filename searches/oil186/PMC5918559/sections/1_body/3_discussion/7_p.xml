<p id="Par34" class="p">Linalool acetate and trans-sabinene hydrate are the major constituents of plants of the family Lamiaceae, especially in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. These were also the two main compounds identified in the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> (35.97% and 29.17%, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition to limonene (see above), other compounds present in the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> should be mentioned, including γ-terpinene and β-pinene at proportions of 11.42% and 11.86%, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Two major constituents are present in the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nobilis</italic>, isobutyl angelate (29.26%) and isoamyl angelate (15.27%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). These compounds, which are major constituents of all three oils studied, might be the main substances responsible for the different anthelmintic activities observed in this study. However, we cannot rule out that different compounds act synergistically to establish the final pharmacological effect in each case, or that compounds present in small or trace amounts are involved in the anthelmintic effect observed. In the latter case, α-thujene was not a major constituent in any of the oils studied, but was found in all three of them, although at variable low proportions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This compound may represent a common functional link between the three different oils, all of them exhibiting anthelmintic activity.
