<p id="Par35">In addition to the representative importance of major constituents of each oil studied, some of these compounds possess known anthelmintic properties, highlighting their potential importance in final anthelmintic activity. The evidence for the activity of such compounds can be direct or indirect, as observed for 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>. For example, limonene is found in the oils of different plants with anthelmintic activity, such as 
 <italic>Lippia sidoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martinii</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus staigeriana</italic> [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This compound accounts for 96.0% of the composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, causing 100% inhibition of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> eggs and larvae in vitro at most concentrations tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Linalool acetate is known for its anthelmintic activity against 
 <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although not a major constituent of any of the oils, 1,8-cineole was present in both the oil of 
 <italic>A. nobilis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. officinalis</italic>. This compound is well known to be effective against the egg and larval stage of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].
