<p id="Par36">In view of the economic impacts of gastrointestinal infections on sheep farming, which are increasingly aggravated by anthelmintic resistance, the identification and development of new therapeutic options for prevention, control or eradication of this problem is essential [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In this respect, there has been intensified search for botanical anthelmintics against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> because of the advantages of these agents, such as low cost and easy access, especially in less developed countries with biodiversity [
