<p id="Par32" class="p">In the present study, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> was more effective in the EHT than the oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> and especially of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nobile</italic>. In fact, the IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> value of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> oil was about 2.0â€“2.5 times lower than that of the other two oils tested (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In the LDT, the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantifolia</italic> exhibited the best performance, with an IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> value that was about 2.5 and 6.5 times lower than those obtained for the oils of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nobile</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic>, respectively, and was therefore the most potent against larval development (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The variations in anthelmintic performance between the different tests and oils might be explained by qualitative and quantitative differences in the composition of the essential oils studied (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and different sensitivity to the various developmental stages of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic>. However, similar results were obtained in the AWMT for the oils tested, which did not permit a clear distinction of their pharmacological efficacy for this assay (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Furthermore, regardless of the variations in absolute IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> values, all oils acted effectively and in a dose-dependent manner against the three developmental stages of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic>, which is a relevant finding.
