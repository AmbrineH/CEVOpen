<p id="Par30">Essential oils consist of a mixture of volatile and lipophilic compounds with a strong and characteristic odor. Terpenes and terpenoids are their main chemical constituents. These compounds differ by the presence of an oxygen atom in terpenoids and a methyl radical in terpenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In view of the low solubility of essential oils in water, a tensoactive solution or solvent was used to increase the solubilization of these substances in the present experiments. Tween 80 at 3% (v/v) and at 2% (v/v) was used in the EHT and AWMT, respectively, while 1% DMSO (v/v) was used in the LDT because L1 larvae are more sensitive to Tween 80 than to DMSO [
