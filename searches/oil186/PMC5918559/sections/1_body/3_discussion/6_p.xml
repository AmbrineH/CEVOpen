<p id="Par33">Regarding the chemical compounds shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, some of the volatile compounds identified are major constituents or are common in the different plant species studied. For example, limonene was identified as a major constituent in the oil of 
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> (56.37%). Limonene is characteristic of species of the genus 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, although at low concentrations, limonene was also found in the oil of 
 <italic>L. officinalis</italic> (0.52%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Myrcene was identified at low concentration in the oils of 
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>L. officinalis</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Borneol, butyl acetate, camphene, 1,8-cineol and sabinene, also at low concentrations, can be found in both the oils of 
 <italic>A. nobilis</italic> and of 
 <italic>L. officinalis</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Except for Î±-thujene, which occurs in the oils of 
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>A. nobilis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. officinalis</italic> at proportions of 2.85%, 8.82% and 0.31%, respectively, no other compound identified occurred simultaneously in the three types of oils studied (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), a finding supporting the chemical diversity of the oils. In fact, the essential oils studied here are composed of a wide diversity of compounds that represent a vast repertoire of active biomolecules of biotechnological interest. This permits the theoretical establishment of a natural product library for structure-activity correlation studies that are important for current pharmacology [
