<p id="Par11">There is a great interest in sheep farming because of the high added value of its commercial products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This livestock sector has faced serious problems related to gastrointestinal infections caused mainly by the parasite 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The epidemiological importance of this nematode species is related to its wide geographical distribution and pathogenicity. In addition, this parasite is a cause of significant economic losses for the sheep livestock industry around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a result of the inadequate management of infections, resistance against the main classes of commercially available antiparasitic agents (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidazothiazoles) has been developed by this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
