After incubation for 24 h (27 °C), different concentrations of each essential oil (3.0, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.187, 0.0937, 0.0468, 0.0234, 0.0117, 0.0058 and 0.0029 mg/ml) were solubilized in distilled water and DMSO (1%, v/v) and added to each well, resulting in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After 6 days, the differential count of L1, L2 and L3 larvae was performed and compared to the data obtained for the positive (levamisole, 20 mg/ml) and negative controls (1% DMSO, v/v). The results are the average of three replicates and are expressed as the percentage of larval development inhibition of three independent experiments.
