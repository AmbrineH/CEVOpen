<p id="Par27">In the AWMT, all essential oils induced faster paralysis of adult parasites than the negative controls [PBS + 4% antibiotic (penicillin-streptomycin) + 2% Tween 80; PBS + 4% antibiotic (penicillin-streptomycin)], completely inhibiting motility within the first 8–12 h of observation. In addition, a marked overall inhibition of motility of 50% or higher was observed for all oils within the first 2–4 h of the experiment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The profile of anthelmintic activity of the oils was similar to that observed for the positive control, even when levamisole was used in a very high concentration (20 mg/ml) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
