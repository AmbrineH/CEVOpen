 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plant species were selected based on substantial ethnopharmacological information. Analysis of the composition of each oil by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated the presence of limonene (56.37%), isobutyl angelate (29.26%) and linalool acetate (35.97%) as the major constituents in 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span>, respectively. Different concentrations of each oil were tested in vitro for their capacity to inhibit egg hatching (EHT), larval development (LDT) and adult worm motility (AWMT) using a multidrug-resistant strain of 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> (Embrapa 2010). The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values obtained for the oils of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> were 0.694, 0.842 and 0.316 mg/ml in the EHT and 0.044, 0.117 and 0.280 mg/ml in the LDT, respectively. The three oils were able to inhibit adult worm motility completely within the first 8â€“12 h of observation in the AWMT.
