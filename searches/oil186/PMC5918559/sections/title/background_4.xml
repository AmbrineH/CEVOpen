 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a great interest in sheep farming because of the high added value of its commercial products [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. This livestock sector has faced serious problems related to gastrointestinal infections caused mainly by the parasite 
  <span class="italic">Haemonchus contortus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The epidemiological importance of this nematode species is related to its wide geographical distribution and pathogenicity. In addition, this parasite is a cause of significant economic losses for the sheep livestock industry around the world [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. As a result of the inadequate management of infections, resistance against the main classes of commercially available antiparasitic agents (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidazothiazoles) has been developed by this species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], reducing their therapeutic efficacies and consequently increasing associated economic impacts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A technical resource for the prevention and treatment of different veterinary diseases is the use of medicinal plants. Plants have already been used for medical purposes by ancient civilizations and are currently considered a more sustainable and more easily accessible therapeutic and/or preventive alternative to synthetic drugs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. These potential advantages have favored the search for new herbal or plant-derived agents for veterinary use, particularly those for the control of gastrointestinal parasites, including 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of the plant species for pharmacological studies is important and should be based on solid operational strategies and relevant ethnopharmacological/chemotaxonomic data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Within this context, 
  <span class="italic">Citrus aurantifolia, Anthemis nobile</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lavandula officinalis</span> were traditionally used in folk medicine as anthelmintics against different etiological agents. They are widely distributed in Brazil, and are relatively good producers of essential oils. The oils extracted from the plants are a rich mixture of terpenes and terpenoids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Many of these compounds have already proven their anthelmintic activities against different parasites, including 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>. Furthermore, the botanical families and genera to which 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span> (family Rutaceae; genus 
  <span class="italic">Citrus</span>), 
  <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> (family Asteraceae; genus 
  <span class="italic">Anthemis</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> (family Lamiaceae; genus 
  <span class="italic">Lavandula</span>) belong are traditionally known for their anthelmintic activity against 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>â€“
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the great potential of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> as anthelmintics, there are no data on the potential activities of the essential oils of these plants against 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro anthelmintic activity of essential oils obtained from the fruit peel of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantifolia</span> (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae); flowers of 
  <span class="italic">A. nobile</span> (syn. 
  <span class="italic">Chamaemelum nobilis</span> (L.) All.) (Asteraceae); and flowers of 
  <span class="italic">L. officinalis</span> (Chaix &amp; Kitt.) (Lamiaceae), against different developmental stages of the parasite 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>.
