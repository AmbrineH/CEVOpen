 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two male Santa Inês sheep (4–6 months-old, 20–30 kg) were used as feces donors for all experimental protocols. The animals were purchased in the region of Ribeirão Preto (SP, Brazil) and kept at the experimental farm of the University of Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), receiving ration and hay two times per day and water 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For artificial and monospecific infection with 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span>, the animals were first treated with Zolvix® (Monepantel, Novartis Animal Health, 2.5 mg/kg body weight; Dundee, UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 14 days, a total reduction in egg load was confirmed by counting the number of eggs per gram of feces (epg = 0). The multidrug-resistant 
  <span class="italic">H. contortus</span> strain, Embrapa 2010, was used for monospecific infection and each animal was inoculated orally with approximately 4000 third-stage (L3) larvae. After 28 days of incubation, infection was confirmed by epg count. Animals with a count of 1500 to 5000 epg were considered parasitologically competent as feces donors for the in vitro assays. According to Chagas et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], strain Embrapa 2010 was isolated from naturally contaminated animals of Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste, São Carlos, SP, and is characterized as resistant to anthelmintics of the benzimidazole, macrocyclic lactone and imidazothiazole classes.
