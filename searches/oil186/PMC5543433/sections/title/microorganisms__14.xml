 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Authentic pure cultures of bacteria and fungi were obtained from international culture collections: American type culture collection (ATCC) and the local culture collection of the Center of Biotechnology of Sfax, Tunisia. They included Gram-positive bacteria: 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span> ATCC 6633
  <span class="italic">, Bacillus cereus</span> ATCC 14579
  <span class="italic">, Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 25923
  <span class="italic">, Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> ATCC 12228
  <span class="italic">, Enterococcus faecalis</span> ATCC 29212 and 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> ATCC 19117 and Gram-negative bacteria: 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella enterica</span> ATCC 43972
  <span class="italic">, Escherichia coli</span> ATCC 25922 and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> ATCC 9027.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following fungal strains were also tested: 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> CTM 10099
  <span class="italic">, Aspergillus flavus</span> (food isolate)
  <span class="italic">, Aspergillus nidulans</span> (food isolate), 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> (food isolate), 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span> (ISPAVE 271
  <span class="italic">), Fusarium oxysporum</span> (CTM10402)
  <span class="italic">, Fusarium culmorum</span> (ISPAVE 21w) and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span> (CTM 10230)
  <span class="italic">.</span> The bacterial strains were grown on Mueller Hinton broth (Bio-Rad, France) at 37 °C for 12–14 h while potato dextrose agar (PDA) (1.5% agar) at 28 °C for 4 days were used for fungi. Inocula were prepared from an overnight broth culture by their dilution in saline solution to approximately 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> colony-forming units (CFU)/ml for bacteria and 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> spores/ml for fungus.
