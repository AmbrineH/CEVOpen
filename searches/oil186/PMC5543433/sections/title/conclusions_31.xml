 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present work, we reported the phytochemical and biological properties of Tunisian essential oil from flowers of 
  <span class="italic">Cirus limon</span>. The chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO revealed that limonene and Î²-Pinene were the main components. We also demonstrated, in vitro and in situ, the efficiency of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. In this regard, beef meat including 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO is an interesting target during refrigerated storage as contamination of beef meat by food spoilage and food-borne pathogens is considered one of the major problems to the progress of food industry.
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fractionation and characterization of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO active compounds will be the future work to investigate; but also several other characterizations of 
  <span class="italic">Citrus limon</span> will be worthwhile to contribute to a better valorization of this medicinal plant.
