 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants with radical scavenging property and antioxidant capacity are useful for medicinal applications and as food additive. So, in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging method by comparing with the activity of the Ascorbic acid as a known antioxidant. The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH
  <span class="sup">.</span> by donation of hydrogen atom or an electron [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. If the extracts have the capacity to scavenge the DPPH free radical, the initial blue/purple solution will change to a yellow colour due to the formation of diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of the different 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to those of ascorbic acid, used as positive control, and appreciated by the determination of the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, DPPH test revealed that the free radical-scavenging activity was a dose dependent manner. From the analysis of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, we can conclude that the radical-scavenging activity of the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO and positive controls ascorbic acid increased with increasing concentration (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;0.05). The current study demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO exhibited a strong radical scavenging activity as compared to the standard ascorbic acid.

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibitory effect of the different 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO concentrations on lipid peroxidation was determined by the β-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> showed a various degree of the linoleic acid oxidation and subsequently the β-carotene bleaching after addition of the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO and the BHT used as positive control at different concentrations. This antioxidant activity of the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was increased with the increasing concentration (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05). Overall results were better than those provided by the radical-scavenging activity (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In fact, 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an EC
  <sub>50</sub> of 15.056 μg/ml and a strong β-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120 min of incubation with an EC
  <sub>50</sub> of 40.147 μg/ml (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by addition of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO could be used to improve the quality and stability of food products. 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was able to quenching peroxide radicals and to terminate the peroxidation chain reaction.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity may be ascribed to the presence of the same chemical components. Monoterpenes found in this essential oil may act as radical scavenging agents. It seems to be a general trend that the essential oils which contain monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes have greater antioxidative properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. These activities may be attributed to the presence of 1,8-cineol, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene found in 
  <span class="italic">C. limon</span> essential oils. Essential oils are quite complex mixtures constituted by several tens of components, and this complexity makes it often difficult to explain the activity pattern. For this reason, many reports on the antioxidant potentials of the essential oils often refer to concepts such as synergism, antagonism and additivity.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monoterpene hydrocarbons; particularly terpinolene, α- and γ-terpinene, could also be taken into account for the antioxidative activity observed, but obviously, none has stronger than that of oxygenated monoterpenes. The presence of strongly activated methylene groups in these molecules is probably the reason for this behavior. On the other hand, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives have very low antioxidant activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The findings above showed the presence of natural antioxidant property in 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO, which are better than that of BHT, a very efficient synthetic antioxidant agent which is widely used in food technology. Basically, interest has increased noticeably in the research of naturally occurring antioxidants for use in foods or medicinal materials as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, which are being limited because of their possible toxicity [
