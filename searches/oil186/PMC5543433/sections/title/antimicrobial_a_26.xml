  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity against all strains tested. The inhibition zones were in the range of 13–26 mm. Among Gram positive bacteria, highest inhibitory zone was observed against

 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies investigating the action of essential oils against food spoilage organisms and food borne pathogens agree that, generally, essential oils are slightly more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. That Gram-negative organisms are less susceptible to the action of antibacterials is perhaps to be expected, since they possess an outer membrane surrounding the cell wall, which restricts diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through its lipopolysaccharide covering. However, our results show that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to the investigated oil, with a range of 0.039 to 1.25 mg/ml than Gram-negative bacteria in the range of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/ml, which has been confirmed and extended in the present studies. From a comparison of our results with values reported in the literature, it is interesting the oil showed an antimicrobial effect in the concentration range as the most active essential oils [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The antimicrobial activity of essential oils is believed to be associated with phytochemical components. Essential oils are volatile and odorous principles of plant secondary metabolism which have wide applications in food flavoring and preservation industries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Recently, some researchers have reported that monoterpene or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives, which are the major components of essential oils, exhibit potential antimicrobial activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. These findings strongly supported the results of this study as the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. limon</span> s was also found to contain these components, which confirmed its efficacy as natural antimicrobial agent.
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity was evaluated against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> sp., 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span>. Results showed a strong inhibitory effect of 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO on the growth of 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> with inhibition zone diameters of 26 mm and MIC values of 0.625 and 0.312 mg/ml respectively (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Also, the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO exhibited an antifungal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> sp., which are responsible for spoilage of many foods. The maximal inhibition zone diameters were 17–21 mm and MIC values ranged from 0.625 to 1.25 mg/ml (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). The high antifungal activity may be attributed to the presence of the said chemical components in the essential oil. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">C. limon</span> apparently related to its terpenes type components such as pinene, myrcene and limonene (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), since there is a relationship between the chemical structures of the most abundant oils and their antimicrobial activities. Limonene has been shown to have strong antifungal properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Although the mechanism of action of terpenes is not fully understood, it is thought to involve membrane disruption by the lipophilic compounds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. The essential oils containing terpenes are also reported to possess antimicrobial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], which are consistent with our present studies.
