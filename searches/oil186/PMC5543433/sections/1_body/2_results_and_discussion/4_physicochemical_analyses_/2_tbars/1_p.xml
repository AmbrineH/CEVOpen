<p id="Par53" class="p">TBARS values represent the content of secondary lipid oxidation products, mainly aldehydes and carbonyls of hydrocarbons, which cause off-aromas in meat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Over the storage period, TBARS values were higher in control samples (C) than treated samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The lowest TBARS values (0.55 ± 0.12 mg of malonaldhyde/kg) were achieved by treatment T4 after 10 days. It has been reported that an index of 2 was considered the limiting threshold for the acceptability of oxidised beef [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. These results indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO/BHT (T
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) exhibited higher antioxidant performance compared with 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO treatments (T
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). However, antioxidant effects of BHT at 0.01% (T
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) can not be ignored. Furthermore, those treated samples (T1, T2 and T3) were noted to remain below the detection limit (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The antioxidant performance of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EO could be attributed to their phenolic contents found in leaves [
