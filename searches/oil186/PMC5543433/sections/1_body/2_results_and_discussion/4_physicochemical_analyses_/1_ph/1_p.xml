 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> indicate the pH evolution in raw minced beef meat treated with four different treatments. The initial pH recorded for the control and the treated samples was above 5.6. The pH value of (C) was found to raise from 5.66 ± 0.26 to 7.0 ± 0.24 at the end of storage period. Compared with control sample, no significant differences were found concerning pH value of T
