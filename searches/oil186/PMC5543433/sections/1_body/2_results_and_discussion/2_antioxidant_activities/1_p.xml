<p id="Par43" class="p">Plants with radical scavenging property and antioxidant capacity are useful for medicinal applications and as food additive. So, in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging method by comparing with the activity of the Ascorbic acid as a known antioxidant. The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH

 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>EO exhibited a strong radical scavenging activity as compared to the standard ascorbic acid.
