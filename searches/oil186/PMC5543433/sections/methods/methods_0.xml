 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we assessed chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 
  <span class="italic">C. limon</span> essential oil (
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO) with its preservative effect against 
  <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> inoculated in minced beef meat. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the major components of the obtained 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO. The antioxidant activities of this 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO were determined according to the Î²-carotene bleaching assay, as well as by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For antimicrobial activity, agar well diffusion method was used and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as well as the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined. The in situ effect of the 
  <span class="italic">Cl</span>EO was evaluated through physicochemical parameters (pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as against 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span> in minced beef meat model.
