<p>‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit (
 <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic>) is the first international red-fleshed cultivar in Sichuan of China. Due to its unique flavor and abundant nutrients, such as high levels of vitamin C, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, and amino acids, ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit has interested consumers (

China is the leading kiwifruit producing country, and the average level of production topped the list in 2013–2016 (44.5% of the world production). Kiwifruit is infected by different fungi associated with fruit diseases. For instance, gray mold, caused by 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, is one the important postharvest diseases of kiwifruit (

 <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, can also cause decay in harvested kiwifruit, although it is not as prevalent as gray mold (

Especially, the anthracnose of kiwifruit is severe, which can infect leaves, canes, and fruits, resulting in significantly economic losses during storage. However, at present, relevant studies on anthracnose of kiwifruit have seldom been reported.
