<p>We evaluated the antifungal activity of CEO 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against 
 <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> The antifungal activity was mainly determined by inhibition of mycelial growth and spore germination of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic>. The mycelial growth of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> was sensitive to CEO (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>
 </bold>). The mycelial growth of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> (CEO-treated group) was reduced during incubation compared with the untreated group, with the greater inhibitory at the higher concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The mycelial growth of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> was completely inhibited by CEO at the concentration of 0.2 μL/mL. The efficacies of CEO on the spore germination of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> were shown in 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>
 </bold>. The different concentrations of CEO had a significant inhibitory effect on spore germination (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>
 </bold>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Observations showed an inhibition on the spore germination of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> within the range of 0.075–0.150 μL/mL. Results indicated that the spore germination was reduced with the increasing CEO concentrations. CEO could completely inhibit the spore germination at the concentration of 0.175 μL/mL. In summary, the CEO completely prevented the mycelial growth and spore germination of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> at concentrations of 0.2 μL/mL and 0.175 μL/mL, respectively. Further, the MIC and MFC values of CEO against 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> were presented in 
 <bold>Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>
 </bold>. The MIC of CEO was 0.200 μL/mL. The MFC of CEO was found to be equal to the corresponding MIC results. CEO showed the good fungistatic and fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>C. acutatum.</italic>
