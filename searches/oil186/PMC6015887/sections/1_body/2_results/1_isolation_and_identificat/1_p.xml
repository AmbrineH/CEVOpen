<p>The kiwifruit infected by anthracnose appeared on round spots from brown to dark brown launched from center, whose surface was depression, dried-up, and severe dehydration, while the tissue obviously turned into soft (

 </bold>). The pathogenic sarcocarp turned from green into pale yellow. Subsequently, the whole fruit was rotten (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>
 </bold>). The colony of pathogen was circular on PDA after 7-day incubation, and its texture was soft and villous, as well as the color was pink (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>
 </bold>). The aerial mycelia grew radially from the center to the surrounding area. Mycelia were hyaline and septate (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>
 </bold>). The ellipsoidal spores produced the pale pink spore heaps, while the spore was single, colorless, and hyaline, diameter of 13.1–18.6 × 3.0–4.0 μm (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>
 </bold>). The germinal spore was spheroidal and the diameter of the germinal spore was 11.0–15.0 × 2.0–3.0 μm (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>
 </bold>). Thus it could be considered as 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. It was verified that the isolated pathogen could cause the kiwifruit anthracnose through pathogenicity test. The colonial morphology and some microscopic features of the isolated pathogen were accordance with previous observations.
