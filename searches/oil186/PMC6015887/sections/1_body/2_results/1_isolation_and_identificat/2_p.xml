<p>To further identify the isolated pathogen, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of isolate was sequenced. The PCR product was 531 bp. The obtained sequence was submitted to GenBank, and the accession number was MF 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="124796" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">124796</ext-link>. The ITS sequence was preliminarily analyzed and submitted to GenBank as closest to those of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. For the identification purposes, the sequence was compared to those available in the NCBI database using the BLAST. Furthermore, the homology sequences were analyzed with MEGA 5.02 software to construct phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining method (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>
 </bold>). Confidence values above 50% obtained from a 1,000-replicate bootstrap analysis were shown at the branch nodes. Bootstrap values from neighbor-joining method were determined. 
 <italic>Goidanichiella sphaerospora</italic> (FR 681846.2) and 
 <italic>Ascomycota</italic> sp. (AF 508280.1) were used as the out group. The isolated pathogen had higher similar sequences of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> than any other reference taxa. In the neighbor-joining tree, the anthrax pathogen and other three reference taxa including 
 <italic>Glomerellaceae</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Purpureocillium lilacinum</italic> and 
 <italic>Hypocreomycetidae</italic> sp. formed a clade with 100% bootstrap support. In this clade, the reference taxon, 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> (AB 042300.1) and 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> (AJ 749677.1) also clustered together with it, meanwhile they were same species. The result of similarity comparisons of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region sequence revealed that isolated pathogen had the highest nucleotide similarities with 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic>.
