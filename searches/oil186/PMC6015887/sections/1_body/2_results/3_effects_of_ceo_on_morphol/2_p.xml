<p>The results of staining 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> mycelia and spores with propidium iodide were presented in 
 <bold>Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>
 </bold>. The cells are intact, which cannot be stained by propidium iodide. The mycelia treated without CEO could not be stained by propidium iodide (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E-1</xref>
 </bold>), and the cell structure was integral and clear (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D-1</xref>
 </bold>). The propidium iodide penetrated mycelia treated with CEO after 3 and 6 days (
 <bold>Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E-2,E-3</xref>
 </bold>), and the cell structure was indistinct (
 <bold>Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D-2,D-3</xref>
 </bold>). The damage of PM of mycelia was positively correlated with treatment time of CEO. The changes of spores treated with CEO were similar to that of mycelia (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F,G</xref>
 </bold>). The propidium iodide penetrated spores treated with CEO, showing that the membrane integrity has been compromised. In summary, the permeation to propidium iodide indicated that the CEO was responsible for a fungicidal effect, resulting in extensive damage to the plasmatic membrane between mycelia and spores (
 <bold>Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>
 </bold>). MI of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> spores declined obviously with the increase of incubation time on PDA containing MFC of CEO (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>
 </bold>). However, MI stayed at a relatively high level for spores incubated in PDA without CEO (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, results showed that the damage of the plasmatic membrane of spores was markedly more severe than the membrane of mycelia, which were in accordance with the above mentioned result that the spore germination was more sensitive to CEO treatment than that of mycelial growth (
