<p>In order to confirm the CEO targets in the PM, the amount of ergosterol was assessed. Ergosterol is the major sterol component of the fungal CM, helping to maintain cell function and integrity (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Vale-Silva et al., 2010</xref>). It is a sterol with a CM specific of fungi and microalgae with the advantage of indicating only viable biomass, since it is quickly degraded after the cellâ€™s death (
