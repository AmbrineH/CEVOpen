<p>The isolated pathogen was inoculated in the surface-sterilized and healthy kiwifruit. The results showed that the sample was attacked after inoculating 24 h at 25°C because of brown dots on the surface of fruit. Then the lesion rapidly expanded and showed drying shrinkage and depression on the 5th day. The color of pericarp turned to dim and pink, and then sticky particulates on pathogenic sites, which were the conidial heaps. Finally, as the decay spread out, the whole of fruit was brown rot and even dried. According to the morphological and molecular identification, the pathogen from ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit was further determined as 
 <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> Previous studies found that 
 <italic>C. musae</italic> occurring anthracnose could cause the development of black circular/ lenticular spots during ripening in banana (

 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> from ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit.
