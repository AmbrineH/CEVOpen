<p class="p">Essential oil showed a superior antimicrobial activity that the growth of tested organisms was inhibited more efficiently by gaseous contact than by solution contact (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oonmetta-Aree et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the antifungal activity of CEO was carried out with its volatile substances, and the antifungal effect was good. The results showed that CEO exhibited antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> as a volatile 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>. Both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.200 μL/mL. These results confirmed other findings on antifungal activity of CEO against several fungal pathogens including 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Zygosaccharomyces bailii in vitro</italic> (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ribes et al., 2017</xref>). CEO had a strong antifungal effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, with a MIC of 0.05–0.10 mg/mL, and a MFC of 0.05–0.20 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Manso et al., 2013</xref>). The MIC of CEO against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> strains and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus oryzae</italic> were 0.125 μL/mL and 0.250 μL/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kocevski et al., 2013</xref>). CEO could effectively inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Botryosphaeria parva</italic> in the dilution method, and both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.078 μL/mL (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">He et al., 2015</xref>). Volatiles of CEO obviously affected appressorium formation, while in control treatment germinal spores formed one or more appressoria. Results showed that inhibitory activity of CEO was significantly correlated with the concentration of CEO. In present study, the spore germination was more sensitive to CEO treatment than mycelial growth, which was in accordance with previous studies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). CEO had a fungistatic effect against mycelial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> isolated from strawberry anthracnose at 0.667 μL/mL. Meanwhile, CEO completely prevented the spore germination and appressorium formation at 0.00153 μL/mL (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, CEO strengthens its merits as a post-harvest fungicide against food-borne pathogens. Moreover, the MIC and MFC of CEO against 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic> sp. were lower than those of some earlier reported EO viz., 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zambonelli et al., 1996</xref>), clove [
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.)] (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ranasinghe et al., 2002</xref>) and tea tree oil (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Szczerbanik et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicated that CEO had high potential of economic exploitation.
