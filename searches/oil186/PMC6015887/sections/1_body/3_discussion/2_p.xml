<p>Essential oil showed a superior antimicrobial activity that the growth of tested organisms was inhibited more efficiently by gaseous contact than by solution contact (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oonmetta-Aree et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the antifungal activity of CEO was carried out with its volatile substances, and the antifungal effect was good. The results showed that CEO exhibited antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> as a volatile 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.200 μL/mL. These results confirmed other findings on antifungal activity of CEO against several fungal pathogens including 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, 
 <italic>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</italic> and 
 <italic>Zygosaccharomyces bailii in vitro</italic> (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro-Santos et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Ribes et al., 2017</xref>). CEO had a strong antifungal effect against 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, with a MIC of 0.05–0.10 mg/mL, and a MFC of 0.05–0.20 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Manso et al., 2013</xref>). The MIC of CEO against 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> strains and 
 <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> were 0.125 μL/mL and 0.250 μL/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kocevski et al., 2013</xref>). CEO could effectively inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Botryosphaeria parva</italic> in the dilution method, and both MIC and MFC of CEO were 0.078 μL/mL (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>). Volatiles of CEO obviously affected appressorium formation, while in control treatment germinal spores formed one or more appressoria. Results showed that inhibitory activity of CEO was significantly correlated with the concentration of CEO. In present study, the spore germination was more sensitive to CEO treatment than mycelial growth, which was in accordance with previous studies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). CEO had a fungistatic effect against mycelial growth of 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> isolated from strawberry anthracnose at 0.667 μL/mL. Meanwhile, CEO completely prevented the spore germination and appressorium formation at 0.00153 μL/mL (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Duduk et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, CEO strengthens its merits as a post-harvest fungicide against food-borne pathogens. Moreover, the MIC and MFC of CEO against 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. were lower than those of some earlier reported EO viz., 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zambonelli et al., 1996</xref>), clove [
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.)] (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ranasinghe et al., 2002</xref>) and tea tree oil (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Szczerbanik et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicated that CEO had high potential of economic exploitation.
