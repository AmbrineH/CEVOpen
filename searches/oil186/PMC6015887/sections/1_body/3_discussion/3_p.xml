<p class="p">The potential mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity of plant essential oils are not fully understood, but a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed. The results of TEM indicated that the CEO destroyed not only the CW, but also the PM, by interacting with the structures of cytoplasmic organelles in comparison with untreated samples. The degree of damage had dose-effect relationship, and that destructiveness of 2MFC was stronger than MFC. The CEO showed antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> causing cellular damages and irreversible morphological changes. Previous studies revealed morphological alterations in 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> by TEM observations (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nogueira et al., 2010</xref>). Results showed that a marked disruption of membranes of major organelles such as nuclei, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic> EO passed not only through the CW, but also through the PM and then interacted with membranous structures of the cytoplasmic organelles. Studies also reported irreversible damage to CW, CM and organelles of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> by 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum jensenianum</italic> essential oil (CJEO) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). In the CJEO-treated hyphae, the fibrillar layers had gradually lost their integrity, becoming thinner, and eventually failing to deposit on the CW. In addition, the mitochondria suffered a severe disruption of the internal structure with complete lysis. Indeed, studies demonstrated that the TTO could destruct for organelles of 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</italic> by TEM observation (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The PM appears to be the main target of the EO according to TEM data. Furthermore, FMS observation showed that the propidium iodide could permeate CM into intracellular cytoplasm while cells were destroyed. Then CEO was responsible for a fungicidal effect, resulting in extensive lesion to the plasmatic membrane, either from a direct effect or as a secondary result of metabolic impairment. Results showed that CEO could be used as a fungicide to damage membrane integrity.
