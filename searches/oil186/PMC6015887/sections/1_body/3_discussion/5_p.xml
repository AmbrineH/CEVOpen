<p>The lipophilicity of EOs enable them to preferentially part from an aqueous phase into membrane structures of the fungi, resulting in expansion of membrane, and then increase of membrane fluidity and permeability, disturbance of membrane-embedded proteins and soluble sugars, and other cellular contents. The electric conductivity was examined to express the changes of CM permeability. Our results showed that the extracellular conductivity rose with the increasing of CEO concentration and treatment time. The results clearly indicated that there was a leakage of electrolytes due to the disruption of cell permeability caused by CEO. Excessive electrolyte loss would cause the death of

Analyzing the leakage of cell constituents could therefore give further insight into the mechanism of antifungal action. The ability of CEO to disturb the integrity of the PM of fungal cells was also assessed by measuring the protein, sugar, and nucleic acid released in cell suspensions. Results showed that the leakage increased with the extension of treatment time.
