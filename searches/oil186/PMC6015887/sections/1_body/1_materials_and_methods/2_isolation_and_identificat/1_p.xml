<p>According to the tissue separation method (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jogee et al., 2017</xref>), the surface of the spoiled ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruits was washed with sterile double-distilled water (SDW), and disinfested in 75% ethanol for 30 s and in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 s, and then rinsed three times in SDW. Then, pieces of kiwifruit sarcocarp about 4 mm
 <sup>2</sup> were excised from diseased berries with a sterile scalpel from the marginal area between the diseased and healthy tissue. The pieces were incubated on PDA. After isolation, the purified fungi were cultivated on PDA. After incubation at 25°C for 7 days, colonial morphology including micromorphological features, viz., color of colony on both of dorsal and ventral sides, growth diameter and texture of colony, and some microscopic features like mycelial size and conidial shape were measured. The isolated pathogen was assayed its pathogenicity in ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit. Further, the pathogen was isolated again from diseased kiwifruits using the above tissue separation method. Finally, the pathogen was subcultivated on PDA and stored at 4°C for consequent identification. The isolated pathogen was coded as WQ1. The pathogen was deposited in Agricultural Culture Collection of China, and the accession number was ACCC
