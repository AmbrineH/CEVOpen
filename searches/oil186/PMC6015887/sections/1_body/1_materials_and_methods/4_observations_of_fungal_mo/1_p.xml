<p>The action mechanism of CEO was determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) according to a previous study with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bozzola and Russell, 1999</xref>). Seven-day-old 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> exposed to 0, MFC and 2MFC of CEO were cultivated in the dark at 25°C for 2 days. The mycelia was harvested from PDA with 10 mL of SDW and softly scraping the colonies with a sterile L-shaped glass rod. The mycelium suspension was centrifuged at 7000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to obtain mycelia. The small segments measuring 5 × 5 mm were excised at the margin of the mycelium colony. Then, the segments were promptly placed in vials containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) at 4°C and fixed overnight. The fixed samples were rinsed with the same buffer three times for 10 min. Afterward, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 20 min in each alcohol dilution. The last step was performed for 30 min thrice. The dehydrated specimens were then embedded and polymerized in Spurr’s resin at 65°C for 72 h. Ultrathin sections (approximately 50 nm in thickness) were hand trimmed with a diamond knife using an MT-X Ultratome for TEM observations (H-600, Hitachi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
