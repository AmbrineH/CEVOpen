<p>Membrane integrity was determined using fluorescent microscope (FSM) according to a previous study with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). 
 <italic>C. acutatum</italic> was treated with the MFC of CEO as described previously. PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls. Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days in the dark at 25°C, and washed with cold PBS (0.05 mol/L, pH 7.0) to remove residual medium, respectively. Mycelia were then fixed by cold ethanol (70%, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) at 4°C for 1 h. After removal of ethanol, and the mycelia were washed twice with PBS. Then the mycelia were stained with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide for 20 min at 4°C in the dark. Mycelia were collected by centrifugation (4000 ×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min), and washed twice with PBS to remove residual dye. Samples were observed with the E200 Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan). Fields of view from each cover slip were chosen randomly, and each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice. The number of spores in bright-field was defined as the total number, and membrane integrity (MI) was calculated as:
