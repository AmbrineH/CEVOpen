 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> was determined using a vapor contact method proposed from previous study with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). To stimulate sporulation, 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> was grown on PDA in the dark at 25°C. Spores were harvested from 7 days old cultures with 10 mL of SDW and softly scraping the colonies with a sterile L-shaped glass rod. Spore suspension was filtered through sterile paper to remove mycelial fragments. Hundred microlliter of spore suspension of 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL was plated on the inner side of petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm) with 20 mL of PDA. The same CEO concentrations used in the mycelial growth assay were examined. Each plate was incubated in the dark at 25°C for 1 days. In the end, germinal spores were observed using a light microscope (Olympus CX 31, Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 400× magnification. Each slide was fixed in lactophenol cotton blue. Results were expressed in terms of the percentage of spore germination inhibition by comparing control and treated plates (
