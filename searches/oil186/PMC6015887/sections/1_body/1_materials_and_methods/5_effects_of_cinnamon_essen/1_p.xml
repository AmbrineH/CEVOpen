<p>The ergosterol content was determined using a previously described method with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). The same treatment used in the mycelial growth assay was examined. After incubation, mycelia were harvested and washed with 10 mL of SDW. A 5 mL of mixed solution (20 mL of methanol, 5 mL of ethanol and 2.0 g of potassium hydroxide) was added to each sample. After 2 min of vortex using TS-1 Eddy oscillometer (Kylin-Bell Lab Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), the mixed solution was incubated at 85Â°C for 4 h. Sterols were extracted from each sample by adding a mixture of 2 mL of SDW and 5 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-heptane. Then, the mixture was sufficiently mixed by vortex for 2 min allowing the layers to separate for 1 h at room temperature. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-heptane layer was analyzed by UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer at 230 and 282 nm (Shanghai AoXi Science Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China). The presence of ergosterol (at 282 nm) and the sterol intermediate 24(28) dehydroergosterol (at 230 nm) in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-heptane layer led to a characteristic curve. The content of ergosterol was calculated as a percentage of the wet weight based on the absorbance and wet weight of the initial pellet. It was calculated as the follow equation,
