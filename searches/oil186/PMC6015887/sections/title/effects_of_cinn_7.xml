 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of CEO on intracellular leakage were determined using a extracellular conductivity method with minor modifications (
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">Tao et al., 2014</a>). Initially, the mycelia disks (Ø = 5 mm) were placed upside down on the center of Petri dishes with 20 mL of PDA and incubated in the dark at 25°C until the growth reached the edge of the plates. Then, the sterile filter paper was added with the MFC of CEO, and PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls. Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days in the dark at 25°C, and washed with 15 mL of SDW. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation. The extracellular conductivity at each time point was carried out using a DDS-11A conductivity meter (Shanghai Precision Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) and expressed as μS/cm. Each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice.

  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> was treated with the MFC of CEO as described above. PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls. Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, and washed with 15 mL of SDW. The mycelium suspension was centrifuged at 4000 ×
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 10 min to obtain mycelium, and the filtrate was collected for the determination of the leakage of intracellular content by the assays of total soluble protein, total soluble sugar, and nucleic acid. The content of soluble protein was determined with bovine serum albumin (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) as standard (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Bradford, 1976</a>). The content of soluble sugar was estimated by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using glucose (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) as standard (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Dubois et al., 1956</a>). The protein or sugar leakage was expressed as g/kg wet weight of mycelia. To determine the concentration of the released nucleic acid, 1 mL of supernatant was used to measure the absorbance at 260 nm with a UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer (Shanghai AoXi Science Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) (
