 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit (
  <span class="italic">Actinidia chinensis</span>) is the first international red-fleshed cultivar in Sichuan of China. Due to its unique flavor and abundant nutrients, such as high levels of vitamin C, anthocyanins, dietary fiber, and amino acids, ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit has interested consumers (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Lin et al., 2017</a>). China is the leading kiwifruit producing country, and the average level of production topped the list in 2013–2016 (44.5% of the world production). Kiwifruit is infected by different fungi associated with fruit diseases. For instance, gray mold, caused by 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span>, is one the important postharvest diseases of kiwifruit (
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Williamson et al., 2007</a>); Blue mold, caused by 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium expansum</span>, can also cause decay in harvested kiwifruit, although it is not as prevalent as gray mold (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Neri et al., 2010</a>). Especially, the anthracnose of kiwifruit is severe, which can infect leaves, canes, and fruits, resulting in significantly economic losses during storage. However, at present, relevant studies on anthracnose of kiwifruit have seldom been reported.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of chemically synthetic preservative in controlling food spoilage and pathogenic fungus has been a controversial topic (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">Tian et al., 2014</a>). The artificially chemical compounds are considered as chronic and reproductive toxicants causing respiratory diseases or other health risks (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Fleming-Jones and Smith, 2003</a>). In this case, natural preservatives such as essential oil (EO) have been extensively used due to its biodegradable and antimicrobial properties. EO contains a variety of substances called ‘phytochemicals’, which belong to natural components in plants (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Pratt, 1992</a>). The phytochemical preparations with dual functionalities in preventing lipid oxidation and antimicrobial properties have tremendous potential for extending shelf life of food products (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Singh et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Fadli et al., 2012</a>). Generally, EO possesses high volatility. When EO is applied as a vapor, less oil is used. Further, the residues of EO on the product are minimized, and there will be less of a problem with tainting (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Szczerbanik et al., 2007</a>). It may be more appropriate to use EO in their vapor phase for postharvest applications (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Concha et al., 1998</a>; 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Zollo et al., 1998</a>). Cinnamon (
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</span>), rich in EO, belongs to Lauraceae family comprising about 250 species and usually distributes in India, China, Sri Lanka, and Australia (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Prasad et al., 2009</a>). Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) is a promising food preservative for the inhibition of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Tian et al., 2012</a>). Our previous studies have shown that CEO have good efficacy on preservation of ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit. Moreover, ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit fumigated with 0.4 μL/mL of CEO could be stored at (4 ± 1) °C with relative humidity of 90–95% for 120 days (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">He et al., 2015</a>). CEO has been demonstrated as a strong and broad range of inhibition for bacteria, fungi and yeast (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Chao et al., 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Manso et al., 2015</a>). Our previous studies have demonstrated that CEO have good inhibitory effects against 
  <span class="italic">Botryosphaeria parva in vitro</span>, and can reduce soft rot on ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">He et al., 2015</a>). Antifungal activity of CEO against 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> isolated from strawberry anthracnose was investigated (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Duduk et al., 2015</a>). Cell plasma membrane (PM) is the action site invaded by antifungal substances, such as silicon and chlorine dioxide (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Wei et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Liu et al., 2010</a>). For fungi, the integrity of PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cell constituents being important to viability, such as sugar, protein and nucleic acid. The soluble sugar, soluble protein and nucleic acid are the basic and functional components in the cell. The PM is damaged, and the intracellular components can be leaked (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Wei et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Kim et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Liu et al., 2010</a>). The antifungal activity of EO was strongly associated with its compositions, such as monoterpenic phenoles, especially thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Barrera-Necha et al., 2008</a>). The antifungal mechanism of EO is speculated to induce membrane disruption by their lipophilic compounds (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Cowan, 1999</a>). The low-molecular-weight and highly lipophilic components of EO pass easily through cell membranes and cause disruption to the fungal cell organization (
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Chao et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Shukla et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, in this study, the dominant pathogens, which caused postharvest diseases such as anthracnose in ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit, was firstly isolated and identified. Further, the antifungal activity and the possible antifungal mechanism of CEO against 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> isolated from decayed ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit were investigated.
