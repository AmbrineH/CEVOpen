 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibitory effect of CEO on mycelial growth was determined using filter paper method with minor modifications (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Briefly, the mycelia disks (Ø = 5 mm) of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>, cut from the edge of 7 days actively growing cultures on PDA, were placed upside down on the center of the inner side of the plate lid with 20 mL of PDA. The sterile filter paper (Ø = 5 mm) was added with different amounts of CEO (4.5, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5, 12.0, and 13.5 μL). The filter paper containing CEO were placed on the center of the bottom of the petri dishes to obtain final concentrations of 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150, 0.175, 0.200, and 0.225 μL/mL of air (
  <span class="italic">v/v</span>). PDA plates without CEO were used as negative controls. Each plate was sealed with Parafilm
  <span class="sup">®</span> (Top Group Co. Ltd., Chengdu, China) to prevent leakage of CEO vapor and incubated in the dark at 25°C until the growth in the control plates (without treatment) reached the edge of the plates. The plates were incubated in inverted position. Each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice. The inhibition radius around the oil disk (colony-free perimeter) was measured using a digital vernier caliper (Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan). Mycelia growth (cm) was recorded and the percentage inhibition (PI) was determined after comparison with the control (

  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Trabelsi et al., 2016</a>). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of CEO at which the growth of microorganism was inhibited (
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Rasooli and Abyaneh, 2004</a>). The fungus treated with the MIC of CEO was sub-cultivated on treatment-free PDA at 25°C for 2 days to determine whether the inhibition was reversible. The minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) was regarded as the lowest concentration in which the growth of any fungal colony was prevented on PDA (

  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> was grown on PDA in the dark at 25°C. Spores were harvested from 7 days old cultures with 10 mL of SDW and softly scraping the colonies with a sterile L-shaped glass rod. Spore suspension was filtered through sterile paper to remove mycelial fragments. Hundred microlliter of spore suspension of 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/mL was plated on the inner side of petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm) with 20 mL of PDA. The same CEO concentrations used in the mycelial growth assay were examined. Each plate was incubated in the dark at 25°C for 1 days. In the end, germinal spores were observed using a light microscope (Olympus CX 31, Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 400× magnification. Each slide was fixed in lactophenol cotton blue. Results were expressed in terms of the percentage of spore germination inhibition by comparing control and treated plates (
