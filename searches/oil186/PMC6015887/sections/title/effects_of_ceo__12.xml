  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission electron microscopy could intuitively reflect the morphological alterations of the cell wall (CW), cell membrane (CM) and cytoplasm. The growth inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> induced with different concentrations of CEO for 2 days was found to be well correlated with morphological changes of fungi exposed to control, MFC and 2MFC of CEO. The morphological changes of untreated and treated fungal cell were shown in 
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>
  </span>. In the control samples, the cells were dense appearance (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>
  </span>). Results showed that the CW was uniform and thoroughly surrounded by an intact fibrillar layer for untreated fungi. Indeed, the CM was unfolded and uniform in shape (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>
  </span>). All organelles had a normal appearance, and were clearly observed. In treated fungi, the destroyed cell structures were marked in CW and organelles (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B,C</a>
  </span>). The major disruption was the endomembrane system, containing the CM and membranous organelles. 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> was treated with the MFC of CEO, the CW was deformed (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>
  </span>). The fibrillar layers gradually lost their constitutions, becoming thinner and eventually detaching from the CW (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>
  </span>). The fibrillar layers were hardly observed when the cells were treated with CEO of 2MFC (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3C</a>
  </span>). The CM of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> treated with CEO lost its linear structure, becoming rough and villous with invaginations of vesicles. The CM was ruptured and detached from the cytoplasm (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B,C</a>
  </span>). After treatment with CEO, most organelles were indistinct and many structures were unidentifiable (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B,C</a>
  </span>). The intracellular organization was noticeably disrupted with uneven distribution, showing cytoplasmic condensation and absent (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B,C</a>
  </span>). Moreover, the damage in the intracellular organization was more severe with the increasing concentration of CEO (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B,C</a>
  </span>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of staining 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> mycelia and spores with propidium iodide were presented in 
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3D</a>–
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">G</a>
  </span>. The cells are intact, which cannot be stained by propidium iodide. The mycelia treated without CEO could not be stained by propidium iodide (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3E-1</a>
  </span>), and the cell structure was integral and clear (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3D-1</a>
  </span>). The propidium iodide penetrated mycelia treated with CEO after 3 and 6 days (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3E-2,E-3</a>
  </span>), and the cell structure was indistinct (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3D-2,D-3</a>
  </span>). The damage of PM of mycelia was positively correlated with treatment time of CEO. The changes of spores treated with CEO were similar to that of mycelia (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3F,G</a>
  </span>). The propidium iodide penetrated spores treated with CEO, showing that the membrane integrity has been compromised. In summary, the permeation to propidium iodide indicated that the CEO was responsible for a fungicidal effect, resulting in extensive damage to the plasmatic membrane between mycelia and spores (
  <span class="bold">Figures 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3D</a>–
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">G</a>
  </span>). MI of 
  <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> spores declined obviously with the increase of incubation time on PDA containing MFC of CEO (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4A</a>
  </span>). However, MI stayed at a relatively high level for spores incubated in PDA without CEO (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4A</a>
  </span>). Moreover, results showed that the damage of the plasmatic membrane of spores was markedly more severe than the membrane of mycelia, which were in accordance with the above mentioned result that the spore germination was more sensitive to CEO treatment than that of mycelial growth (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3D</a>–
