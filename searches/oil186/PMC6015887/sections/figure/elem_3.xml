  <p>Effects of CEO on percentage of plasma membrane integrity

   <span class="bold">(F)</span> leakage of

   <span class="bold">(A)</span> Percentage of plasma membrane integrity of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> spores, 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> was cultured in PDA containing CEO or in PDA without CEO as the control at 25°C; 
   <span class="bold">(B)</span> Ergosterol contents of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span> on PDA containing different concentrations of CEO at 25°C were assayed; 
   <span class="bold">(C)</span> Cellular leakage from fungal tissues was determined 0–6 days after incubation with the CEO. Mycelia were cultured in PDA containing CEO or in SDW without EO as the control at 25°C. Samples for the leakage were measured for 6 days; 
   <span class="bold">(D)</span> Soluble protein leakage of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>; 
   <span class="bold">(E)</span> Soluble sugar leakage of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>; 
   <span class="bold">(F)</span> Nucleic acid leakage of 
   <span class="italic">C. acutatum</span>. Values are the averages of the replicates for all the analyses. Error bars are ± SD of the means. In some cases the error bar is obscured by the symbol. Columns with different letters at each time point indicate significant differences according to Duncan’s multiple range tests at 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05.
