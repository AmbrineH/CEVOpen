 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Symptoms of kiwifruit anthracnose (A,B), and cultural (C) and morphological (D–F) characteristics of isolated pathogen, as well as its phylogenetic tree (G). (A) Symptoms on the surface of diseased kiwifruit; (B) Symptoms inside of diseased kiwifruit; (C) Colonies of pathogen cultured for 7 days at 25°C; (D) Mycelia of pathogen and 400× magnification; (E) Spores of pathogen and 400× magnification; (F) Germinal spores and 400× magnification; (G) Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences obtained from fragments of the ITS rDNA from the isolate along with the reference sequences from NCBI. The analysis was conducted using neighbor joining method. The scale bar represents 0.02% substitutions of nucleotide. </p>)
