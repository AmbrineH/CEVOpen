 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Effects of CEO on percentage of plasma membrane integrity (A), ergosterol content (B), extracellular conductivity (C), and protein (D), sugar (E), and nucleic acid (F) leakage of C. acutatum. (A) Percentage of plasma membrane integrity of C. acutatum spores, C. acutatum was cultured in PDA containing CEO or in PDA without CEO as the control at 25°C; (B) Ergosterol contents of C. acutatum on PDA containing different concentrations of CEO at 25°C were assayed; (C) Cellular leakage from fungal tissues was determined 0–6 days after incubation with the CEO. Mycelia were cultured in PDA containing CEO or in SDW without EO as the control at 25°C. Samples for the leakage were measured for 6 days; (D) Soluble protein leakage of C. acutatum; (E) Soluble sugar leakage of C. acutatum; (F) Nucleic acid leakage of C. acutatum. Values are the averages of the replicates for all the analyses. Error bars are ± SD of the means. In some cases the error bar is obscured by the symbol. Columns with different letters at each time point indicate significant differences according to Duncan’s multiple range tests at p &lt; 0.05. </p>)
