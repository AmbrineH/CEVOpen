  <italic>Teucrium polium </italic>L. and solvent free microwave extraction oil from leaf of 
  <italic>Ajuga chamaecistus </italic>Ging. Subsp chamaecistus were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Germacrene D (11.10%, 28.31% and 21. 06%) was the main constituent in the stem, leaf, and flower oils of 
  <italic>P. aucheri, </italic>respectively. The other main component in the stem oil of the plant was (E) - anethole (24.58%) and in the flower oil was 
  <italic>β</italic>- caryophyllene (15.93%). All three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes. The main components in the stem, leaf and root of 
  <italic>T. polium </italic>were 
  <italic>α</italic>- muurolol (25.02%, 20.03% and 19.53%), 
  <italic>α</italic>- cadinol (15.72%, 8.11% and 13.01%) and 
  <italic>β</italic>-cayophyllene (10.86%, 10.11% and 10.64%) respectively. All three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes. The major components in the leaf oil of 
  <italic>A.chamaecistus </italic>were (z)-
  <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (12.11%) and germacrene D (10.11%). The oil of the plant was rich in regard to both monoterpens and sesquiter penes.
