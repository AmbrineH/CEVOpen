  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>-
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>). There are reports indicating various activities such as anti inflammatory, antinociceptive (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium </span>comprises about 340 species, 12 are described in the flora of Iran, among which three are endemic: 
  <span class="italic">T.melissoides </span>Boiss et Hausskn ex Boiss.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Teucrium polium </span>is a perennial shrub, 20-50 cm high, distributed widely in the dry and stony hills and deserts of almost all Mediterranean countries, South western Asia, Europe and North Africa. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the traditional Iranian medicine, 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>tea is used to treat oilments such as abdominal pain, indigestion, common colds, and urogenital diseases (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some biological and therapeutic effects have been reported for 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>such as antioxidant (17), anti inflammatory (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>), antinociceptive (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>), anti pyretic (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several reports on the composition of volatile oils from 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>are found in literature. In the oil from 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>collected in Athens (Greece), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene(17.7%) was shown to be the major constituent accompanied by δ- cadinene (9.3%), caryophyllene oxide (5.9%) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>- cadinol (5.4%) (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>). The oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>subsp. valentinum from Spain, was found to contain 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (15.8%) and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (11.7%) as major constituents (

  <span class="italic">α</span>-Muurolene (8.7%), 
  <span class="italic">α</span>- cadinol (5.9%) and δ-cadinene (5.1%) were found to be the major constituents of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>from northern region of Saudi Arabia (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>). The dominant compounds in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus

  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several biological studies have been performed on many species of this genus which have confirmed their ethno pharmacological properties such as hypoglycemic (

  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>) properties and also their application in the treatment of join diseases (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>) . 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many phytochemical studies on 
  <span class="italic">Ajuga </span>species were performed which led to the isolation of phytoecdysteroids (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>), clerodane and neoclerodane di terpenoids (

  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>). Previously, we studied the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">A. chamaecistus </span>Ging. ssp. chamaecistus, collected from Fasham, 35 km east of Tehran, which contained 
  <span class="italic">β</span>- pinene (15.0%) and linalool (14.5%) as major constituents (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study deals with the analysis of the oils from stems, leaves, and flowers of 
  <span class="italic">Phlomi</span>s 
  <span class="italic">aucheri</span>, from stems, leaves, and roots from 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium polium </span>and also from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Ajuga chamaecistus </span>growing wild in Iran.
