 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the essential oils from stems, leaves, and flowers of 
  <span class="italic">Phlomis aucheri</span>, stems, leaves and roots of 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium polium </span>and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Ajuga chamaecistus</span>, are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>, respectively, in which the percentage and relative retention indices of components are given. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As it is shown from 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, in 
  <span class="italic">P. aucheri </span>we identified 46 compounds representing 91.58%, 40 constituents representing 91.04% and 40 components representing 89.53% of the stem, leaf and flower oils, respectively. The main component in three oils was germacrene D (11.10%, 28.31% and 21.06%), respectively. Other notable constituents were 
  <span class="italic">β</span>- caryophyllene (5.58%, 4.96% and15.93%) and bicyclogermacrene (6.30%, 8.86% and 7.63%), respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(E)- Anethole (24.58%) was the other main component in the stem oil of the plant and not detected in the leaf and flower oils. As can be seen from the above information, all three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes (51.52%, 78.52% and 85.16%), respectively. The</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">monoterpene fraction was relatively small, representing only 12.32%, 8.88% and 1.70%, respectively. In the stem oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. aucheri</span>, considerable percentage of non terpenoid compounds, compairing to other parts of the plant oils, were identified (27.74%). In an earlier study, Javidnia et al. analyzed the essential oil of the aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">P. aucheri </span>collected in Fars province. The oil was found to be rich in caryophllyene oxide (33.5%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>- caryophyllene (27.0%) and
  <span class="italic">β</span>-selinene (9.9%) (44). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only a few reports on the analysis of essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Phlomis </span>species have been published. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water distilled essential oils from aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">P. persica and P. olivieri</span>, which are endemic to Iran, have been the subject of our previous studies. The major components of both oils were germacrene D (38.2% and 26.4%) and bicyclogermacrene (16.3% and 12.7%), respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both oils consisted mainly of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>). Also we reported the oil composition of 
  <span class="italic">P. pungens</span>. The major constituents of the oil of the plant were germacrene D (24.5%), bicyclogermacrene (14.1%), α-pinene (13.5%) and (E) -

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Camparison of the present results with those of our previous investigation of oils of the 
  <span class="italic">Phlomis </span>genus showed that they are also dominated by sesquiterpenes. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Germacrene D has been identified in other species of

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As it is shown from 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>, 45 components representing 96.84%, 41 constituents representing 98.48% and 20 compounds representing 88.7% were identified in the oils of stem, leaf and root of 
  <span class="italic">T. polium</span>, respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main components in all three oils were

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other notable compounds were in stem oil; caryophyllene oxide (6.49%), elemol (5.53%) and hexadecanoic acid (5.17%), in leaf oil, (z) nerolidol (7.13%) and

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to these results, the composition of the stem, leaf and root oils of 
  <span class="italic">T. polium </span>show significant similarity for the concentration of the main components. All three oils were rich in regard to sesquiterpenes (80.89%, 75.58% and 59.96%), respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The monoterpene fraction of the stem and leaf oils was relatively small, representing (6.73% and 21.45%) of the total oils, resepectively. In the root oil of the plant we could not find any trace of monoterpenes. In the root oil of 
  <span class="italic">T.polium</span>, considerable percentage of non terpenoid compounds, compared to other parts of the plant oils, were identified (28.74%). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water distilled oil obtained from the aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">T. persicum</span>, which is endemic to Iran, have been the subject of our previous studies. epi-
  <span class="italic">α</span>-Cadinol (23.2%) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (17.3%) were the main components among the thirty-one constituents characterized in the oil of 
  <span class="italic">T. persicum </span>representing 95.9% of the total components detected (
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>). The oil of

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaf oil of

  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>) for the constituents of the oil from aerial parts may be attributed to the different environment conditions and different methods of extraction of the oils.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Ajuga </span>have been the subject of only a few studies. The oil of
