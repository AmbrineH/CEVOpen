<p class="p">Gas chromatography analysis was performed on Schimadzu 15A gas chromatograph equipped with a split /splitless injector (25 °C) and a flame ionization detector (250 °C). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas () and the capillary column used was DB-5 (50 m × 0.2 mm, film thickness 0.32 . The column temperature was kept at 60 °C for 3 min and then heated to 220 °C with a 5 °C rate and kept constant at 220 °C for 5 min. Relative percentage amounts was calculated from peak area using a Schimadzu C- R4 A chromatopac without the use of correction factors. </p>
