<p>Several reports on the composition of volatile oils from 
 <italic>T. polium </italic>are found in literature. In the oil from 
 <italic>T. polium </italic>collected in Athens (Greece), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene(17.7%) was shown to be the major constituent accompanied by δ- cadinene (9.3%), caryophyllene oxide (5.9%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>- cadinol (5.4%) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The oil of 
 <italic>T. polium </italic>subsp. valentinum from Spain, was found to contain 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (15.8%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (11.7%) as major constituents (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). 
 <italic>α</italic>-Muurolene (8.7%), 
 <italic>α</italic>- cadinol (5.9%) and δ-cadinene (5.1%) were found to be the major constituents of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. polium </italic>from northern region of Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The dominant compounds in 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>polium </italic>from Corsica were
