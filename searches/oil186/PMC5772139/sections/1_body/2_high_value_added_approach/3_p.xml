 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> presents the research papers and reviews published during this period, highlighting their main focus, the green or sustainable techniques/approaches adopted, raw materials (mostly agro-industrial waste) and target compounds studied. The most common raw materials described as chemical feedstocks were waste derived from plants, for instance, food, mainly fruits (citrus, mango, papaya, grape, passiflora, banana, tomato, olive), grains (corn, soybean, sunflower, coffee) and other abundant materials (sugarcane bagasse, tea, wood bark, rice and wheat straw). Additional issues that affect the quality of the final products were also discussed, namely the procedure used for waste collection, selection, storage, drying, matrix characteristics (particle size, shape, specific surface area and porosity). The latter aspects play an important role in extraction efficiency due to the mass and heat transfer processes. Understanding the nature of raw material is crucial to avoid negative influences impacting the quality and yield during the removal of the target compounds, e.g., caused by co-extracted contaminants or due to the presence of some components in these matrices, such as water or high molecular weight compounds [
