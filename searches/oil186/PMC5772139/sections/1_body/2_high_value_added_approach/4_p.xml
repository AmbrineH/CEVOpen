<p id="Par20" class="p">The decision concerning the best method to separate the compounds of interest from the raw material is dependent on several aspects, such as the characteristics of the target extracts and raw material (physical–chemical properties), available technology, required purity, selectivity, stability and, more importantly here, the greenness of the whole process. As can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the most cited techniques in these research papers were based on solvent/maceration (25% of the total), microwave (19%), ultrasonication (14.7%) and supercritical fluid processing (13%), followed by methods using ionic liquids (7%), enzymatic and subcritical fluid treatment (6%), as well as the association of two or more techniques.
