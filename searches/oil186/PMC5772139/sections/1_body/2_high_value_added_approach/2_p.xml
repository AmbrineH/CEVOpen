<p id="Par18">The obtained data reflect the growing interest and potential of green and sustainable methods to separate natural products from waste. One tendency observed in particular was the innovative ways to remove (integrating extraction, purification and/or modification in the same integrated system) and use such compounds in more contemporary sectors, promoting human and environmental health instead of general and old-fashioned remediation [

As a result, new applications for food, nutraceutical, and agricultural sectors have been further explored, based on their advantageous properties as natural colorants, flavors, aromas, antioxidants, antifungals, bioformulations (bio-pesticides) or simply their use as precursors to generate other compounds for similar uses. Some details related to patents, (non-) clinical trials, sustainable indicators, scaling-up, regulatory, agro-industrial variability and availability, traceability, seasonality, good laboratory and manufacturing practices, additional economical and marketing issues have also been discussed.
