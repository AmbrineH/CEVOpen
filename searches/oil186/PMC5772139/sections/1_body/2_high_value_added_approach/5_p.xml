<p id="Par21">According to the literature, the most widespread approaches for separating natural products from a number of matrices are based on liquid–liquid or solid–liquid extraction (LLE and SLE). Several greener alternatives have been proposed by replacing toxic or non-renewable organic solvents, as well as the extraction times. In some cases, solid-phase extractions (SPE) were also carried out and decreased both the amount of solvent and the number of extraction cycles, offering high enrichment factors [

Actually, the mass transfer enhancement for SLE has been largely studied and applied, contributing to technology innovation, process intensification and integration, and energy saving, especially important for microwave, ultrasound, and high-pressure processing, for instance [
