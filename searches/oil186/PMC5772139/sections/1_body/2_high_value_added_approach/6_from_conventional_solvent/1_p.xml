<p id="Par22">Solvent processing is one of the most traditional methods to remove natural products from bio-derived materials. In this extraction approach, the raw material in adequate size is exposed to different solvents, mostly organic, which remove soluble components of interest. The samples are then usually centrifuged and filtered to separate the solid residue, and the extract is used in this way (as a food supplement or for preparing functional foods, for example) or treated after this step. Solvent extraction is attractive compared to other methods due to low cost and simplicity. However, this method does not always use benign solvents; it frequently requires an evaporation/concentration step for recovery, it usually demands large amounts of solvent and needs a long time to be carried out. Additionally, the possibility of thermal degradation of natural bioactive components is also possible due to the high temperatures used during the extraction process [

In general, the raw material (in its liquid or solid form) is mixed with a solvent, and the separation kinetic of the target compounds is influenced by parameters such as the solvent ratio, pH, and temperature and, for SLE, the particle size. The solvent should be atoxic, non-flammable and stable at working conditions, ideally renewable and cheap, with low viscosity and an adequate boiling point, allowing for easier solvent removal from the extract/fraction [

Recently, several models have been proposed to predict the best solvents to be used in a specific case, which do not only take into account physical descriptors, such as enthalpy of vaporization, dielectric constant, refractive index, boiling point, etc., but also empirical descriptors to evaluate, for instance, intermolecular forces (specific and non-specific soluteâ€“solvent interactions, e.g., hydrogen bond donor and/or hydrogen bond acceptor, Van der Waals and ion/dipole forces). Purely theoretical descriptors have been also introduced, offering the most important advantage of not requiring any experiments, as is the case of the model known as quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR), able to predict 127 polarity scales for more than 700 solvents [
