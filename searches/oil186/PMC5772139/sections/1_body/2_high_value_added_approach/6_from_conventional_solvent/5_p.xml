This sector is highly wasteful, generating 50% of waste from the total fruit/starting material (e.g., peel, bagasse, seeds and yellow water). Around 20 million tonnes of orange peel per year are produced worldwide, which consist of water (80%) and sugars, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and

Compared to other conventional extraction methods, it was found that the microwave treatment was more efficient, resulting in a higher overall yield due to the access to a higher amount of
