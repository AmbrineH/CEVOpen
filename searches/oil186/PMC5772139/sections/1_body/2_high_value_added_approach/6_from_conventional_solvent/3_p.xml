<p id="Par24">Maceration using green and non-toxic solvents for the separation of natural products from plant-derived waste has been described over the last years (e.g., to remove dyes from quince leaves or catechins, theaflavins, gallic acid, and antioxidants in general from walnut green husk, cranberry pomace, black tea and banana processing waste). According to these studies, using water, methanol, ethanol or a mixture of them at 70–100 °C can be a low-cost, benign alternative for the recovery of high added-value compounds derived from residual biomass [
