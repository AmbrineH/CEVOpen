<p id="Par29">As can be noted, ultrasound has been widely utilized for helping to extract target components from waste plant-derived sources, reducing separation time, solvents, energy consumption and improving the product quality. The effectiveness of ultrasound is attributed to the cavitation phenomenon, assisting the solubilization of the compounds of interest into the solvent, enhancing their removal from the bulk raw material [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], the ultrasound waves (from 20 kHz to 10 MHz) pass through an elastic medium, inducing a longitudinal displacement of particles resulting in a succession of compression and rarefaction phases in this medium. Every medium has a critical molecular distance and, below this critical point, the liquid remains intact. However, above this distance, the liquid would break down, creating voids (cavitation bubbles) in the liquid. When the size of these bubbles reaches a critical point they collapse, releasing a large amount of energy. The estimated temperature and pressure at this time are estimated at 5000 and 2000 K atmospheres. This creates hotspots that accelerate the chemical reactivity into the medium, generating microjets directed towards the solid surface, also responsible for the general higher effectiveness of this technique, as the high pressure and temperature involved in the process destroy the cell walls of the plant matrices and their content can be released into the medium more easily.
