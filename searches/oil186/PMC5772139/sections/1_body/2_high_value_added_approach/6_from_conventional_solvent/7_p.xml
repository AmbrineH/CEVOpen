<p id="Par28">The combination of two or more extraction/concentration methods is quite common in the literature (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As described by Boukroufa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the removal of essential oil, polyphenols and pectin from orange waste was conducted using microwave and ultrasound technology, without adding any solvents. Essential oil separation was performed by Microwave Hydrodiffusion and Gravity (MHG), and thereafter the remaining water of this process was used as a solvent for the subsequent extraction of flavonoids and pectin. For polyphenol separation, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was used, and response surface methodology (RSM) using the central composite design (CCD) approach was used to investigate the influence of some variables. The CCD revealed that the optimized conditions of ultrasound power and temperature were 0.956 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and 59.83 °C giving a polyphenol yield of 50.02 mg GA/100 g dm, which, compared to conventional extraction, promoted an increase of 30% in the yield. Pectin was extracted by microwave-assisted extraction, resulting in a maximal yield of 24.2% for microwave power of 500 W (3 min), whereas traditional extraction provides18.32% (120 min). As can be seen, the combination of microwave, ultrasound and recycled water resulted in higher recoveries of the compounds of interest in a shorter time, so that a systemic loop/cycle could be closed using only the resources generated in the plant. This makes the whole process optimized in terms of time, energy savings, cleanliness and reduced amount of waste.
