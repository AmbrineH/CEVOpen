 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the second most cited green and sustainable separation process is based on microwave heating and can be considered a non-conventional technique nowadays. Heating is based on non-ionizing electromagnetic waves. Those between 0.915 and 2.45 GHz are used for industrial, scientific and medical applications. The overall principle of heating is rooted in its direct impact with polar materials/solvents and is dependent on ionic conduction and dipole rotation, occurring simultaneously in most cases. The increased temperature can overcome the natural product-matrix interaction caused by Van der Waals forces, dipole attraction, hydrogen bonding of the compounds of interest and active sites in the matrix. Therefore, thermal energy can disrupt both solute–solute and solute–matrix interactions, providing the activation energy required for the desorption process. The mass transfer of the compounds from the raw material to the solvent is also accomplished by convection and diffusion mechanisms, causing the explosion of plant cells and releasing their content into the liquid phase [
