<p id="Par31">The green recovery of cellulose from oil palm bunches by autoclave-based and ultrasonication pre-treatments were successfully developed to replace the non-green chlorite method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. An ultrasonic process with hydrogen peroxide yielded 49% cellulose with 9.13% alpha-cellulose content and 68.7% crystallinity, as compared to 64% cellulose with an autoclave treatment. The cellulose/polypropylene composites generated with high tensile strength, high thermal stability, and low water and diesel sorption showed great potentials for conversion into eco-composite products such as polymeric material insulated cables for high voltage engineering, automotive parts, sports tools and other household or office items.
