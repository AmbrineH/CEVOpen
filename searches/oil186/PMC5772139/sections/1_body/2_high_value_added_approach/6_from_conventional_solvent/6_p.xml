<p id="Par27">The successful microwave-assisted solvent-free modification of pectin derived from citrus waste has also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. These approaches not only allow for the separation of the major components of citrus peel, but they also add further value through the production of other high value-added products, such as pectin, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene and a rare form of mesoporous cellulose which are produced in a single step, without added acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Along these lines, the concept of dry-biorefinery is gaining momentum, since valuable products can be recovered from plant by-products without adding solvents or water, using green processes such as MW [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Innovation relies on the separation of the target compounds from raw materials, which are rich in water, achieved without adding solvents or water, illustrating a circular systemic process; i.e., all materials and resources could be reintegrated into the integrated and zero-waste biorefinery [
