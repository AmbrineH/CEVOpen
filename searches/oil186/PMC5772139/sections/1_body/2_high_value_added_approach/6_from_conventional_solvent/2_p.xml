<p id="Par23" class="p">The solvent selection also depends on the physicalâ€“chemical proprieties of the compounds of interest, considering principally the selectivity and greenness degree of the process, aiming at obtaining high recoveries and the integrity of the target compounds. In general, the raw material stays in contact with the solvent for a certain period (from minutes to days), when the soluble compounds are transferred from the matrix to the extractor phase, usually by shaking the system. For SLE, the dispersion of the particles in the solvent is facilitated agitating them, optimizing their contact and accelerating the separation process. Traditionally, solvent treatment is performed at room temperature, although heating can promote higher recoveries to these compounds that are not thermosensitive. In some cases, LLE and SLE can be time-consuming, demanding further purification and concentration steps, which are their main drawbacks [
