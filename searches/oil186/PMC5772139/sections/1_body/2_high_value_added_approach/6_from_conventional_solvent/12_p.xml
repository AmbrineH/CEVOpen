<p id="Par33">The approach using scCO
 <sub>2</sub> has been widely used for isolation and purification of chlorophylls, carotenoids, lipids, alkaloids, antioxidants from matrices such as filter tea, spruce bark, tomato and elderberry pomace, grape, passiflora, coffee and cupuassu seed waste [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. In addition to the optimization of the separation process, some studies also aim to evaluate the techno-economic viability of large-scale commercial production, for example, to obtain cupuassu butter from cold-pressed seed residues, also evaluating the influence of thermodynamic and kinetic variables of yield, chemical composition and production costs of the extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Optimal conditions related to extraction kinetics, chemical composition and production costs were 30–35 MPa and 50 °C. It was shown that the phenolic content (0.47–2.82 mg/g) was lower than those commonly found using other methods (20–23 mg/g). The high contents of tocopherols, as well as the unsaturated fatty acids (48%) compared to the saturated fatty acids (52%) present in the butter obtained by scCO
 <sub>2</sub> demonstrated its great potential as an ingredient in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In addition, process intensification for biodiesel production involving supercritical fluids has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Such approaches can allow biodiesel production without any addition of catalyst, or via catalytic in situ or reactive extraction process, combining the extraction and reaction phase together in a single operation unit. These studies also discuss both processes towards the future bio-refinery setup and more efficient use of all waste produced.
