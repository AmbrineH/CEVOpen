<p id="Par34">The use of fluids different to CO
 <sub>2</sub> has been described in the literature, but as they are usually organic solvents, they do not show any distinct advantages and often have high critical temperatures. Despite having a very high critical temperature, water shows unique properties in the subcritical region (200–300 °C), as a reduction in dielectric constant (20–30) and density (0.7–0.8 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>) compared to water at room temperature, improving its ability to dissolve nonpolar organic and inorganic compounds. Under these conditions, the water dissociation constant into hydroxide and hydrogen ions are more than three orders of magnitude higher, so that near-critical water acts as a self-neutralizing acid or base catalyst, avoiding salt waste generation. Moreover, using subcritical and supercritical water conditions greatly simplifies the product purification step in some cases, since nonpolar products are insoluble in water in lower temperatures [
