<p id="Par40">Using sustainability indicators and tools will be increasingly demanded in this field, contributing to the greenness or sustainability of the whole processing system. The development of a sustainable separation method which provides better recovery efficiency will not only add value to the agro-industrial waste, reducing the overall manufacturing costs and the use of synthetic chemicals, but will also aggregate value to the whole production chain, including its final products. The emergence of bio-based industries is changing the current status of the producing systems, contributing to the current biomass residual losses. Based on the literature, the scenario for future research and innovation in green and sustainable separation for the recovery of agro-industrial waste is truly beginning, bringing together various areas and sectors towards more efficient and circular systems.</p>
