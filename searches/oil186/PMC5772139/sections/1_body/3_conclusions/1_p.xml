<p id="Par37">The establishment of vanguard biorefineries for bioeconomy and circular economy urgently demands innovation in green and sustainable separation for the recovery of natural products from agro-industrial by-products all over the world. Sustainable separation includes the idea of integrated valorization not only in an economic sense, but also strengthens other social and environmental dimensions, from small to large producing scales. According to the literature over the last decade, the number of studies in this field has grown significantly in recent years. New approaches incorporating holistic extraction and/or purification techniques, also integrating systemic chemical transformation through the design and use of renewable materials and optimized processes should combine the best green analytical figures of merit with online evaluation of the whole production chain. These approaches should generate healthier and more efficient products, methods and processes at an affordable and fair cost.</p>
