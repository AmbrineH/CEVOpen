<p id="Par38">Overall, solvent processing and its modification towards the enhancement of mass transfer to remove the compounds of interest from selected waste have been widely used (25%), also on industrial scales. Alternative extraction or purification methods have shown increasingly more applications, such as for microwave, ultrasonication and supercritical fluid processing. It was shown that a wide range of natural products and their derivatives are used mainly in food (as dyes, aromas, flavors) in medicines or green formulations in agriculture. According to the data available, one paradigmatic case largely studied is the valorization of citrus waste, representing more than 10% of all residues considered in the research papers.</p>
