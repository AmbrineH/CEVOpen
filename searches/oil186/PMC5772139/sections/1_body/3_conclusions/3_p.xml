<p id="Par39">Moreover, an emergent challenging topic is to evaluate biorefinery processing alternatives, i.e., sustainability assessment tools, for example LCA, which include parameters such as feedstock supply (to verify the suitability and adequacy of a potential biomass feedstock for the separation or transformation treatment), process performance (to assess the inputâ€“output balance of material and energy flows) and bio-based chemical production [

Therefore, the decision about the best separation approach takes into account various fundamental aspects and is based on green and sustainable assessment tools, considering the type of agro-industrial waste (e.g., quantity, periodicity, chemical variability, water amount, distance to the processing unit), the natural target products (chemical quality, purity, humidity, costs etc.) and available technologies.
