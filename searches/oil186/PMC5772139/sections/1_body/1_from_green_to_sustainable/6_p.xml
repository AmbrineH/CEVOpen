<p id="Par15" class="p">It is expected that high value-added components from biomass waste such as essential oils, polyphenols, and other food or medicinal-related products are extracted first, followed by polysaccharides, lignocelluloses or waxes via advanced separation and depolymerization processes. Among them, green solvents in general, supercritical CO

Green solvents offer important separation advantages, including near-supercritical or supercritical fluids, which have outstanding mass transport properties, polarity, and easiness of solvent removal after extracting the compound of interest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Another interesting solvent is water, but the range of compounds that are soluble in this medium is quite limited. Nevertheless, the use of subcritical water has been demonstrated to be advantageous for organic modification to depolymerize, hydrolyze, gasify, and carbonize biomass to produce bioactive compounds, sugars, biogas, and other valuable solids [
