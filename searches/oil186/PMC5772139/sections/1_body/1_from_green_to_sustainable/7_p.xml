<p id="Par16">Integrating two or more green techniques combining different strategies has played an important role in overcoming the main drawbacks of a single technique towards sustainable separation. For instance, for high-pressure solvent extraction in which the extractants do not reach supercritical conditions, the temperature, time, and solvent consumed can be dramatically reduced associating ultrasound-assisted treatment [

In fact, more attention has been paid to green extraction, purification, or modification of natural products derived from agro-industrial waste nowadays, opening up new opportunities for sustainable approaches designed for bioeconomy and circular economy models. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the design and application of green and sustainable separation of natural products for vanguard zero-waste biorefineries. The main analytical techniques and procedures described over the last 10Â years will be described in detail, showing the potentialities, challenges, and perspectives in this topical and emergent scenario.
