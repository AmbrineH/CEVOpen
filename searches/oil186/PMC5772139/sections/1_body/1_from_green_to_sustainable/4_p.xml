<p id="Par13">Natural products are among the most attractive value-added chemicals to be considered, which can be classified as organic compounds formed by living systems divided into three main categories: (1) compounds that occur in all cells and have a central role in their metabolism and reproduction (nucleic acids, amino acids, and sugars), also known as primary metabolites; (2) high-molecular polymeric materials which form cellular structures (cellulose, lignins, and proteins) and; (3) chemicals which are characteristic of a limited number of species, called secondary metabolites [

Many of these bioactive compounds (e.g., alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenols) have been extensively used as medicine, nutraceuticals, flavors, fragrances, cosmetics, food additives, antimicrobials, bio-pesticides, etc. However, among the biggest challenges for biomass utilization is establishing benign methods to separate, purify and modify it into chemicals, fuels, and new materials. This is partially due to, with rare exceptions, the small amounts which are lower than 0.01% of the dry weight of vegetal, associated to possible product inhibition issues, large raw material variability, feed detoxification (when necessary), instability of the target compound (or fractions) and its presence in a complex mixture [
