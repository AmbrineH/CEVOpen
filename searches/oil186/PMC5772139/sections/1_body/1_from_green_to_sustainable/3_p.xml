<p id="Par12">Sustainable separation can be defined as a holistic approach grounded on the circular and flexible design and application of renewable benign materials and auxiliaries (including bio-derived solvents, solid phases, membranes) and processes [rooted on green analytical techniques and sustainability metrics and indices, e.g., life cycle analysis (LCA), chemometrics, and other interdisciplinary indicators]. The aim is to optimize the tuneable use of energy, time, reagents, devices, scale, yield and number of steps to extract, fractionate, purify or even modify the components of interest from bio-derived waste during these in situ processes, ensuring analytical reproducibility, efficiency, selectivity robustness and scalability, with online evaluation regarding measurable objectives to create safer, healthier, and more efficient products, processes, and services under fair conditions, commercially available at accessible and just prices [
