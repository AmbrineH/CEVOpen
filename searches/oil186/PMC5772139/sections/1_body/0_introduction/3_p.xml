Primary and secondary processing generates unpreventable food supply chain waste. This can be due to a number of factors along the supply chain, differing by the commodity and country in question. In general terms, developing countries such as some African countries suffer the greatest loss during the early, upstream part of the primary processing, corresponding to 75% of food losses during production and postharvest. Various initiatives, e.g., building better infrastructure through knowledge transfer (more efficient storage and transport technologies) and improving collaboration and market opportunities in the food supply chain could have a positive role. In industrialized countries, waste occurs especially in the consumption stage, accounting for 50% of overall loss of crops in some countries of North America, Europe, and Oceania. In this case, together with educational and cultural actions, other aspects such as developing legislation to make date labels more user-friendly for consumers (sell-by, best-before, and consume-by), redesigning packaging characteristics (avoiding the “buy 1 get 2” offers) and retailer marketing strategies should be considered [
