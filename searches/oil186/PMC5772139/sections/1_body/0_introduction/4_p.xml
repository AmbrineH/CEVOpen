Using alternative strategies to avoid additional losses and produce several high value-added chemicals could minimize the volume of non-renewable materials used today (i.e., roughly 50 billion tons of fossil fuels), enough to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-sustainable resources. Therefore, considering their available volume and practically low costs locally and globally, associated to rich function, structure and chemical heterogeneity, all agro-industrial waste should also be considered for their chemical and material potential, as well as a source of energy [
