In this case, the agro-industrial waste hierarchy has a different meaning from top to bottom, since all biomass is valued as raw material. ‘Prevention’ is an intrinsic part of optimized processes, avoiding overproduction. Therefore, the least probable option is ‘disposal’ as the supply chain is designed to attend sustainable consumption, using all bio-based material generated. Here, sustainable production also includes eco-efficiency, cleaner and green productivity, whereas sustainable consumption allows greener choices to be made by individuals based on eco-procurement, supply chain management, waste minimization, recycling, and resource efficiency measures. Both sustainable production and consumption comprises ‘life-cycle thinking’, aiming at preventing problems shifting from one life-cycle stage to another, one geographical area or environmental compartment to another.
