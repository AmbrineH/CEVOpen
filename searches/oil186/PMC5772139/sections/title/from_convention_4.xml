 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solvent processing is one of the most traditional methods to remove natural products from bio-derived materials. In this extraction approach, the raw material in adequate size is exposed to different solvents, mostly organic, which remove soluble components of interest. The samples are then usually centrifuged and filtered to separate the solid residue, and the extract is used in this way (as a food supplement or for preparing functional foods, for example) or treated after this step. Solvent extraction is attractive compared to other methods due to low cost and simplicity. However, this method does not always use benign solvents; it frequently requires an evaporation/concentration step for recovery, it usually demands large amounts of solvent and needs a long time to be carried out. Additionally, the possibility of thermal degradation of natural bioactive components is also possible due to the high temperatures used during the extraction process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Despite this, it is largely used in industries, where solvent reuse is of great economic importance. In general, the raw material (in its liquid or solid form) is mixed with a solvent, and the separation kinetic of the target compounds is influenced by parameters such as the solvent ratio, pH, and temperature and, for SLE, the particle size. The solvent should be atoxic, non-flammable and stable at working conditions, ideally renewable and cheap, with low viscosity and an adequate boiling point, allowing for easier solvent removal from the extract/fraction [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Recently, several models have been proposed to predict the best solvents to be used in a specific case, which do not only take into account physical descriptors, such as enthalpy of vaporization, dielectric constant, refractive index, boiling point, etc., but also empirical descriptors to evaluate, for instance, intermolecular forces (specific and non-specific solute–solvent interactions, e.g., hydrogen bond donor and/or hydrogen bond acceptor, Van der Waals and ion/dipole forces). Purely theoretical descriptors have been also introduced, offering the most important advantage of not requiring any experiments, as is the case of the model known as quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR), able to predict 127 polarity scales for more than 700 solvents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The solvent selection also depends on the physical–chemical proprieties of the compounds of interest, considering principally the selectivity and greenness degree of the process, aiming at obtaining high recoveries and the integrity of the target compounds. In general, the raw material stays in contact with the solvent for a certain period (from minutes to days), when the soluble compounds are transferred from the matrix to the extractor phase, usually by shaking the system. For SLE, the dispersion of the particles in the solvent is facilitated agitating them, optimizing their contact and accelerating the separation process. Traditionally, solvent treatment is performed at room temperature, although heating can promote higher recoveries to these compounds that are not thermosensitive. In some cases, LLE and SLE can be time-consuming, demanding further purification and concentration steps, which are their main drawbacks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maceration using green and non-toxic solvents for the separation of natural products from plant-derived waste has been described over the last years (e.g., to remove dyes from quince leaves or catechins, theaflavins, gallic acid, and antioxidants in general from walnut green husk, cranberry pomace, black tea and banana processing waste). According to these studies, using water, methanol, ethanol or a mixture of them at 70–100 °C can be a low-cost, benign alternative for the recovery of high added-value compounds derived from residual biomass [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Scaling-up was also studied, whose results showed to be useful in determining industrial process feasibility and the economic value of polyphenols for commercial use, increasing the overall profitability of the cranberry industry [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whenever possible, higher temperatures allow for higher mass transfer in a shorter time with lower energy consumption in general, resulting in better recovery efficiency than conventional systems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. As observed in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, the second most cited green and sustainable separation process is based on microwave heating and can be considered a non-conventional technique nowadays. Heating is based on non-ionizing electromagnetic waves. Those between 0.915 and 2.45 GHz are used for industrial, scientific and medical applications. The overall principle of heating is rooted in its direct impact with polar materials/solvents and is dependent on ionic conduction and dipole rotation, occurring simultaneously in most cases. The increased temperature can overcome the natural product-matrix interaction caused by Van der Waals forces, dipole attraction, hydrogen bonding of the compounds of interest and active sites in the matrix. Therefore, thermal energy can disrupt both solute–solute and solute–matrix interactions, providing the activation energy required for the desorption process. The mass transfer of the compounds from the raw material to the solvent is also accomplished by convection and diffusion mechanisms, causing the explosion of plant cells and releasing their content into the liquid phase [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eco-friendly removal of essential oils, pectin and polyphenols from a number of plant raw materials mediated by microwave irradiation has been described over the last years, paying special attention to citrus waste [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. In fact, the orange juice processing industry can be considered more than a good case study. This sector is highly wasteful, generating 50% of waste from the total fruit/starting material (e.g., peel, bagasse, seeds and yellow water). Around 20 million tonnes of orange peel per year are produced worldwide, which consist of water (80%) and sugars, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-limonene (20%). Recently, it was shown using a mathematical model that 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-limonene extraction consisted of a two stage diffusion process for a microwave (MW) heating approach: initial extraction from the exterior of cells followed by trans-membrane diffusion. Compared to other conventional extraction methods, it was found that the microwave treatment was more efficient, resulting in a higher overall yield due to the access to a higher amount of 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-limonene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The successful microwave-assisted solvent-free modification of pectin derived from citrus waste has also been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. These approaches not only allow for the separation of the major components of citrus peel, but they also add further value through the production of other high value-added products, such as pectin, 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-limonene and a rare form of mesoporous cellulose which are produced in a single step, without added acid [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. Along these lines, the concept of dry-biorefinery is gaining momentum, since valuable products can be recovered from plant by-products without adding solvents or water, using green processes such as MW [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Innovation relies on the separation of the target compounds from raw materials, which are rich in water, achieved without adding solvents or water, illustrating a circular systemic process; i.e., all materials and resources could be reintegrated into the integrated and zero-waste biorefinery [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Although very attractive, as expected, the design and use of real MW industrial scale equipment requires additional studies related to safety, corrosion and maintenance intervals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of two or more extraction/concentration methods is quite common in the literature (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). As described by Boukroufa et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], the removal of essential oil, polyphenols and pectin from orange waste was conducted using microwave and ultrasound technology, without adding any solvents. Essential oil separation was performed by Microwave Hydrodiffusion and Gravity (MHG), and thereafter the remaining water of this process was used as a solvent for the subsequent extraction of flavonoids and pectin. For polyphenol separation, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was used, and response surface methodology (RSM) using the central composite design (CCD) approach was used to investigate the influence of some variables. The CCD revealed that the optimized conditions of ultrasound power and temperature were 0.956 W/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span> and 59.83 °C giving a polyphenol yield of 50.02 mg GA/100 g dm, which, compared to conventional extraction, promoted an increase of 30% in the yield. Pectin was extracted by microwave-assisted extraction, resulting in a maximal yield of 24.2% for microwave power of 500 W (3 min), whereas traditional extraction provides18.32% (120 min). As can be seen, the combination of microwave, ultrasound and recycled water resulted in higher recoveries of the compounds of interest in a shorter time, so that a systemic loop/cycle could be closed using only the resources generated in the plant. This makes the whole process optimized in terms of time, energy savings, cleanliness and reduced amount of waste.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As can be noted, ultrasound has been widely utilized for helping to extract target components from waste plant-derived sources, reducing separation time, solvents, energy consumption and improving the product quality. The effectiveness of ultrasound is attributed to the cavitation phenomenon, assisting the solubilization of the compounds of interest into the solvent, enhancing their removal from the bulk raw material [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. According to Chemat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>], the ultrasound waves (from 20 kHz to 10 MHz) pass through an elastic medium, inducing a longitudinal displacement of particles resulting in a succession of compression and rarefaction phases in this medium. Every medium has a critical molecular distance and, below this critical point, the liquid remains intact. However, above this distance, the liquid would break down, creating voids (cavitation bubbles) in the liquid. When the size of these bubbles reaches a critical point they collapse, releasing a large amount of energy. The estimated temperature and pressure at this time are estimated at 5000 and 2000 K atmospheres. This creates hotspots that accelerate the chemical reactivity into the medium, generating microjets directed towards the solid surface, also responsible for the general higher effectiveness of this technique, as the high pressure and temperature involved in the process destroy the cell walls of the plant matrices and their content can be released into the medium more easily.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some new process aiming at agro-industrial waste application in food industries based on ultrasound-assisted extraction of natural products have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>], as is the case of carotenoid separation from pomegranate peels using different vegetable oils as solvents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. Sunflower and soybean oils were used as solvents and parameters such as time, temperature, solid/oil ratio used were analyzed considering the yield. It was found that the optimum mild operating conditions were: extraction temperature, 51.5 °C; peel/solvent ratio, 0.10; amplitude level, 58.8%; solvent, sunflower oil. Additionally, a subsequent separation of oil and carotenoids was not necessary, since the pigmented oil can be used as a carotenoid source in different commercial products in this format.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The green recovery of cellulose from oil palm bunches by autoclave-based and ultrasonication pre-treatments were successfully developed to replace the non-green chlorite method [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>]. An ultrasonic process with hydrogen peroxide yielded 49% cellulose with 9.13% alpha-cellulose content and 68.7% crystallinity, as compared to 64% cellulose with an autoclave treatment. The cellulose/polypropylene composites generated with high tensile strength, high thermal stability, and low water and diesel sorption showed great potentials for conversion into eco-composite products such as polymeric material insulated cables for high voltage engineering, automotive parts, sports tools and other household or office items.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another highly cited green and sustainable technique to isolate organic compounds from bio-based waste is based on supercritical fluid processing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). It is widely known that substances at temperatures and pressures near or above their critical points have exceptional solvent characteristics for analytical purposes. These supercritical fluids possess liquid-like solvating and gas-like diffusivity power, and other tuneable properties that can be adjusted varying temperature, pressure and the addition of other components acting as a modifier. Due to its gas-like low viscosity and high diffusivity, the supercritical fluid can easily penetrate into plant materials with a fast mass transfer rate. Possibly, the most important property of supercritical fluids for separation processes is diffusion, obtaining solubility and diffusion good enough to provide quantitative extraction yield [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>]. Carbon dioxide (scCO
  <sub>2</sub>) is the fluid most widely used for extractions, with critical parameters of 31.1 °C and 73 atm (7.39 MPa), at relatively low operating conditions. It behaves as a nonpolar or polarizable solvent and low molar mass alcohols (co-solvents) are often added in small quantities to modify the solvent polarity. Because carbon dioxide can be depressurized to the gaseous state, the solvent is easily removed and supercritical fluid-based separation methods are easily coupled with subsequent analysis. Therefore, scCO
  <sub>2</sub> provides miscibility to the majority of natural products, availability and low cost, reliably high purity, negligible toxicity, facility for removal and reuse, resulting in many advantages for downstream processing in terms of product purification and/or catalyst recycling [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The approach using scCO
  <sub>2</sub> has been widely used for isolation and purification of chlorophylls, carotenoids, lipids, alkaloids, antioxidants from matrices such as filter tea, spruce bark, tomato and elderberry pomace, grape, passiflora, coffee and cupuassu seed waste [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>]. In addition to the optimization of the separation process, some studies also aim to evaluate the techno-economic viability of large-scale commercial production, for example, to obtain cupuassu butter from cold-pressed seed residues, also evaluating the influence of thermodynamic and kinetic variables of yield, chemical composition and production costs of the extracts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>]. Optimal conditions related to extraction kinetics, chemical composition and production costs were 30–35 MPa and 50 °C. It was shown that the phenolic content (0.47–2.82 mg/g) was lower than those commonly found using other methods (20–23 mg/g). The high contents of tocopherols, as well as the unsaturated fatty acids (48%) compared to the saturated fatty acids (52%) present in the butter obtained by scCO
  <sub>2</sub> demonstrated its great potential as an ingredient in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In addition, process intensification for biodiesel production involving supercritical fluids has been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>]. Such approaches can allow biodiesel production without any addition of catalyst, or via catalytic in situ or reactive extraction process, combining the extraction and reaction phase together in a single operation unit. These studies also discuss both processes towards the future bio-refinery setup and more efficient use of all waste produced.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of fluids different to CO
  <sub>2</sub> has been described in the literature, but as they are usually organic solvents, they do not show any distinct advantages and often have high critical temperatures. Despite having a very high critical temperature, water shows unique properties in the subcritical region (200–300 °C), as a reduction in dielectric constant (20–30) and density (0.7–0.8 g/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>) compared to water at room temperature, improving its ability to dissolve nonpolar organic and inorganic compounds. Under these conditions, the water dissociation constant into hydroxide and hydrogen ions are more than three orders of magnitude higher, so that near-critical water acts as a self-neutralizing acid or base catalyst, avoiding salt waste generation. Moreover, using subcritical and supercritical water conditions greatly simplifies the product purification step in some cases, since nonpolar products are insoluble in water in lower temperatures [
