 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, green extraction and purification have been presented as methods based on establishing processes that reduce energy consumption, using solvents and renewable materials, as well as ensuring a safe and high-quality fraction/product [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The aim of their application is to obtain natural products from industrial waste, which is considered a highly attractive initiative [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a more adequate term for such extraction and purification processes towards vanguard biorefineries could be sustainable separation, adding to the previous green definition, the notion of innovation across all sectors that allows for increased value in a wide sense, enhancing human and environment benefits and providing economically accessible technologies also advantageous to industry and large scale processing systems. It includes another dimension related to the generation of more creative and healthy jobs, contributing to the construction of a positive long-term sustainability agenda, encompassing bio-circular economy, environmental and social justice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sustainable separation can be defined as a holistic approach grounded on the circular and flexible design and application of renewable benign materials and auxiliaries (including bio-derived solvents, solid phases, membranes) and processes [rooted on green analytical techniques and sustainability metrics and indices, e.g., life cycle analysis (LCA), chemometrics, and other interdisciplinary indicators]. The aim is to optimize the tuneable use of energy, time, reagents, devices, scale, yield and number of steps to extract, fractionate, purify or even modify the components of interest from bio-derived waste during these in situ processes, ensuring analytical reproducibility, efficiency, selectivity robustness and scalability, with online evaluation regarding measurable objectives to create safer, healthier, and more efficient products, processes, and services under fair conditions, commercially available at accessible and just prices [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural products are among the most attractive value-added chemicals to be considered, which can be classified as organic compounds formed by living systems divided into three main categories: (1) compounds that occur in all cells and have a central role in their metabolism and reproduction (nucleic acids, amino acids, and sugars), also known as primary metabolites; (2) high-molecular polymeric materials which form cellular structures (cellulose, lignins, and proteins) and; (3) chemicals which are characteristic of a limited number of species, called secondary metabolites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Many of these bioactive compounds (e.g., alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenols) have been extensively used as medicine, nutraceuticals, flavors, fragrances, cosmetics, food additives, antimicrobials, bio-pesticides, etc. However, among the biggest challenges for biomass utilization is establishing benign methods to separate, purify and modify it into chemicals, fuels, and new materials. This is partially due to, with rare exceptions, the small amounts which are lower than 0.01% of the dry weight of vegetal, associated to possible product inhibition issues, large raw material variability, feed detoxification (when necessary), instability of the target compound (or fractions) and its presence in a complex mixture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is well known that the separation steps, especially extraction, correspond up to 40–80% of the total costs of most common chemical processes currently used. From the point of view of a holistic biorefinery, separation has attracted more and more attention [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. For instance, for natural products, solvent-based extraction is one of the best options nowadays considering the nature of many bio-based chemicals and matrices, and also the fact that other separation methods, such as those based on chromatography or membranes, do not have the same advantages taking into account commercial scales [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is expected that high value-added components from biomass waste such as essential oils, polyphenols, and other food or medicinal-related products are extracted first, followed by polysaccharides, lignocelluloses or waxes via advanced separation and depolymerization processes. Among them, green solvents in general, supercritical CO
  <sub>2</sub>, subcritical water, microwave (MW)-assisted acidolysis and gas-expanded liquids have been mentioned [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Green solvents offer important separation advantages, including near-supercritical or supercritical fluids, which have outstanding mass transport properties, polarity, and easiness of solvent removal after extracting the compound of interest [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Another interesting solvent is water, but the range of compounds that are soluble in this medium is quite limited. Nevertheless, the use of subcritical water has been demonstrated to be advantageous for organic modification to depolymerize, hydrolyze, gasify, and carbonize biomass to produce bioactive compounds, sugars, biogas, and other valuable solids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrating two or more green techniques combining different strategies has played an important role in overcoming the main drawbacks of a single technique towards sustainable separation. For instance, for high-pressure solvent extraction in which the extractants do not reach supercritical conditions, the temperature, time, and solvent consumed can be dramatically reduced associating ultrasound-assisted treatment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. In fact, more attention has been paid to green extraction, purification, or modification of natural products derived from agro-industrial waste nowadays, opening up new opportunities for sustainable approaches designed for bioeconomy and circular economy models. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the design and application of green and sustainable separation of natural products for vanguard zero-waste biorefineries. The main analytical techniques and procedures described over the last 10 years will be described in detail, showing the potentialities, challenges, and perspectives in this topical and emergent scenario.
