 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The establishment of vanguard biorefineries for bioeconomy and circular economy urgently demands innovation in green and sustainable separation for the recovery of natural products from agro-industrial by-products all over the world. Sustainable separation includes the idea of integrated valorization not only in an economic sense, but also strengthens other social and environmental dimensions, from small to large producing scales. According to the literature over the last decade, the number of studies in this field has grown significantly in recent years. New approaches incorporating holistic extraction and/or purification techniques, also integrating systemic chemical transformation through the design and use of renewable materials and optimized processes should combine the best green analytical figures of merit with online evaluation of the whole production chain. These approaches should generate healthier and more efficient products, methods and processes at an affordable and fair cost.</p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, solvent processing and its modification towards the enhancement of mass transfer to remove the compounds of interest from selected waste have been widely used (25%), also on industrial scales. Alternative extraction or purification methods have shown increasingly more applications, such as for microwave, ultrasonication and supercritical fluid processing. It was shown that a wide range of natural products and their derivatives are used mainly in food (as dyes, aromas, flavors) in medicines or green formulations in agriculture. According to the data available, one paradigmatic case largely studied is the valorization of citrus waste, representing more than 10% of all residues considered in the research papers.</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, an emergent challenging topic is to evaluate biorefinery processing alternatives, i.e., sustainability assessment tools, for example LCA, which include parameters such as feedstock supply (to verify the suitability and adequacy of a potential biomass feedstock for the separation or transformation treatment), process performance (to assess the inputâ€“output balance of material and energy flows) and bio-based chemical production [

Therefore, the decision about the best separation approach takes into account various fundamental aspects and is based on green and sustainable assessment tools, considering the type of agro-industrial waste (e.g., quantity, periodicity, chemical variability, water amount, distance to the processing unit), the natural target products (chemical quality, purity, humidity, costs etc.) and available technologies.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using sustainability indicators and tools will be increasingly demanded in this field, contributing to the greenness or sustainability of the whole processing system. The development of a sustainable separation method which provides better recovery efficiency will not only add value to the agro-industrial waste, reducing the overall manufacturing costs and the use of synthetic chemicals, but will also aggregate value to the whole production chain, including its final products. The emergence of bio-based industries is changing the current status of the producing systems, contributing to the current biomass residual losses. Based on the literature, the scenario for future research and innovation in green and sustainable separation for the recovery of agro-industrial waste is truly beginning, bringing together various areas and sectors towards more efficient and circular systems.</p>
