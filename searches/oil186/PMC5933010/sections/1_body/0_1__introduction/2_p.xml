 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> L. (peppermint) is one of the most popular and widely used herbs. Pharmacological investigations have demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> possesses analgesic, antifungal [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], antiparasitic, and immunomodulatory activities [
