<p>Medicinal plants and their derivatives contain a wide variety of bioactive phytochemicals with a diverse pharmacological spectrum [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Essential oils constituents including terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, and other degradation products have been reported to exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The effectiveness of some essential oils to alleviate the hepatotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and hepatic fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] has been proven. 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. (peppermint) is one of the most popular and widely used herbs. Pharmacological investigations have demonstrated that 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> possesses analgesic, antifungal [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antiparasitic, and immunomodulatory activities [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the hepatoprotective effects of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> leaves extract [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], oil [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or its active components menthol and menthone [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect against hepatic fibrosis has not been reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. essential oil (MPEO) against hepatic fibrosis and to elucidate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms.
