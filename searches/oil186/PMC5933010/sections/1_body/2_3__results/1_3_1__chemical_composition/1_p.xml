<p>Hydrodistilled MPEO was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Ten chemical constituents could be identified by elution on HP-5872 column (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The major constituents of MPEO, in order of their percentage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), were menthol (46.7%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthone (18.3%), 
 <sc>l</sc>-carvone (15.2%), pulegone (6.3%), 
 <italic>iso</italic>-menthone (5.3%), and 
 <sc>d</sc>-camphor (3.3%). Small amounts of 1,8-cineol, beta pinene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene, and limonene were also identified.
