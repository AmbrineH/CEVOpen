<p class="p">Hydrodistilled MPEO was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Ten chemical constituents could be identified by elution on HP-5872 column (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The major constituents of MPEO, in order of their percentage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), were menthol (46.7%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthone (18.3%),

 <italic class="italic">iso</italic>-menthone (5.3%), and 
 <span class="sc" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</span>-camphor (3.3%). Small amounts of 1,8-cineol, beta pinene,
