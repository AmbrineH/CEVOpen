 <italic>α</italic>-SMA and desmin immunoreactivity appeared to be cytoplasmic and stained brown in colour. 
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA expression was seen in smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels in the normal control and the MPOE control (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(d)</xref>). In the liver fibrosis control group, 
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA staining located in the myofibroblast cells along collagenous septa bridging portal areas and central areas and desmin immunostaining was observed in perisinusoidal cells and interstitial myofibroblasts. 
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA and desmin protein expression were significantly elevated in liver fibrosis control group than in the normal control (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Group 3 (MPOE-treated) showed a significant reduction of 
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA and desmin protein expression compared to the liver fibrosis control group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 was a cytoplasmic immunostaining, and it was observed in periductal cells in the portal tract of the normal control and MPOE control groups (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>). SMAD3 expression was nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining. The fibrotic control group showed TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 immunoreactivity in the periductal cells in the portal tract, in perisinusoidal cells, around the blood vessels, in sinusoidal lining cells, in inflammatory cells, and in the network around the necrotic hepatocytes; and a small amount was observed in necrotic hepatocytes. TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 and SMAD3 protein expression were significantly increased in the liver fibrosis control group than in the normal control (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Group 3 (MPOE-treated) showed a sustained reduction of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 and SMAD3 protein expression compared to the liver fibrosis control group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, resp.). No significant difference was recorded between the normal control and MPOE control groups.
