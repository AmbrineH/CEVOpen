<p class="p">Histopathological analysis of liver sections provided an initial evidence of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-induced liver hepatocellular damage and fibrosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Degenerative changes including fatty degeneration, congestion, and cytoplasmic vacuolization were observed in the liver fibrosis control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2(b)</xref>). These findings were in agreement with those obtained by Ogaly et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and Yacout et al. [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Additionally, MT staining revealed clear fibrotic bridging in the liver sections of group 2 (
