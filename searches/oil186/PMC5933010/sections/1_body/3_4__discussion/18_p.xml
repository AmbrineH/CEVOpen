<p class="p">Few reports on the role of p53 and TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 and their interplay in the mechanism of fibrogenesis have arisen [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>–
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. This encouraged our team to study the possible role of p53 and TGF-

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Figure 8(a)</xref>). Consequently, a considerable level of p53 protein was detected in the livers of the fibrosis group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). These findings agreed with those of previous studies that reported that p53 expression increases following the onset of liver injury [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In the MPOE-treated group, both Tp53 mRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Figure 8(a)</xref>) and p53 protein expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" class="xref">Figure 9(c)</xref>) were significantly suppressed. This p53 downregulation might have contributed to the reduced hepatic fibrosis in this group.
