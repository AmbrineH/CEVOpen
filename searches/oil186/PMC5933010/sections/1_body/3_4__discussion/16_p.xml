<p>p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein that regulates the transcription of a plethora of target proteins involved in the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In normal redox state, p53 expression and degradation are tightly regulated by a variety of proteins to maintain a low level of p53 [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Different stress signals including ROS, hypoxia, and oncogene activation induce p53 that becomes transcriptionally active, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was reported that hepatocyte p53 activation resulted in spontaneous liver fibrosis and induced hepatocyte apoptosis, in addition to upregulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [

 <italic>In vitro</italic> study showed that p53 induces CTGF in hepatocytes that occur via regulation of microRNA [
