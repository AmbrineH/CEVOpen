<p>In the present study, eight weeks of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> administration was sufficient to induce severe hepatotoxic changes detected by the considerably elevated activities of serum ALT and AST markers (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). Increased release of these cytosolic enzymes in the serum reflects hepatocyte damage and leakage and provides important diagnostic biomarkers for hepatic diseases [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, high AST and ALT levels are associated with an increased risk of fibrosis progression [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. MPEO administration reversed the elevated levels of ALT and AST compared to those of the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies [
