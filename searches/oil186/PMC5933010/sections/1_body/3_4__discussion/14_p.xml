<p>Coadministration of MPOE with CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly improved the liver histopathology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and reduced the fibrotic changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). Furthermore, the MPOE-treated group showed a marked reduction in both 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-SMA- and desmin-immunopositive cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>). These data reflect the efficacy of MPOE to reduce the hepatocellular toxic effects of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and to suppress HSCs activation and proliferation as well.
