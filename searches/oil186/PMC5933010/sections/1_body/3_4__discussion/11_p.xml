<p class="p">Another important evidence for the activation of HSCs and progression of fibrosis was the significantly increased number of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-SMA-immunopositive cells in the CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fibrosis group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(b)</xref>), as compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4(a)</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-SMA is a reliable hallmark for HSCs activation into the myofibroblastic phenotype and considered as an important myogenic marker that plays a significant role in collagen I deposition by activated HSCs [

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], indicate that CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> stimulated HSCs activation and transdifferentiation. Moreover, it was found that SMAD3 increases 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-SMA production and stimulates its organization into stress fibers [
