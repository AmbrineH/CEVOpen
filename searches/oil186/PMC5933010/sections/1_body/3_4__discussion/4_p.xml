<p class="p">Fibrogenesis is mediated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways. Of particular note, TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1/SMAD is one of the core mechanisms of fibrogenesis [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Recently, much information has emerged concerning the central role of TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 as the principal driver of excessive scarring and tissue fibrosis. TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1, in HSCs, acts by stimulating collagen I expression and inhibiting ECM degradation [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Excessive TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 release by necrotic hepatocytes is considered as one of the first signals to adjacent quiescent HSCs to be activated by transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts-like cells [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Upon activation, TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 binds to its cell-surface receptor complexes and initiates an intracellular signaling cascade resulting in phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. Subsequently, the activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 form stable oligomer complexes with SMAD4. These complexes actively shuttle into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that SMAD3 is a key element in TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1–induced fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. A number of fibrogenic genes (e.g., collagens) and markers (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-SMA) are SMAD3-dependent as SMAD3 directly binds to the DNA regulatory sequences of these target genes [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Moreover, SMAD3 inhibits matrix metalloprotease 1 activity in fibroblasts and activates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases and thus inhibits ECM degradation [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Considering this major role of TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 signaling in the pathobiology of liver fibrosis, TGF-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>1 or its downstream mediators may provide important targets for the new therapeutic strategies of liver fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>].
