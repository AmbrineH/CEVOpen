<p>Analysis of CYP2E1 gene expression aimed to evaluate for the detoxifying capacity of the liver. CCl
 <sub>4</sub> intoxication resulted in a significant suppression in CYP2E1 mRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8(b)</xref>). This specific CYP2E1 downregulation in CCl
 <sub>4</sub> hepatic fibrosis was previously reported [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and may have contributed to a direct attack of CYP2E1 transcript by the reactive CCl
 <sub>4</sub> metabolites leading to its degradation. Besides, the inflammatory response associated with fibrosis could exert a suppressive effect on CYP2E1 expression [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Interestingly, MPOE treatment counteracted this CYP2E1 downregulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This preservation of CYP2E1 expression could be one of the MPOE hepatoprotective and antifibrogenic actions [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] that reported the ability of peppermint to modulate both phase I and phase II liver drug-metabolizing enzymes. Besides, eugenol, an active component of MPOE (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), has been previously shown to induce detoxification enzymes [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
