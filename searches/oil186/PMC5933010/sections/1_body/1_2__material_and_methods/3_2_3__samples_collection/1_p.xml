<p class="p">At the end of experiment, animals were anesthetized with ethyl ether. Blood samples (3-4 mL) were collected by retro-orbital puncture, and serum was separated by centrifugation (4000 rpm/10 min). Afterward, all animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under ethyl ether anesthesia for humane reasons; the whole liver was immediately removed, rinsed in cold normal saline, and kept at −20°C until further analyses. Liver homogenates (10%) were prepared in 0.1 M ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, 15 min at 4°C. The separated supernatants were kept at −20°C. For histopathological examination, parts of liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and underwent routine processing for paraffin embedding.</p>
