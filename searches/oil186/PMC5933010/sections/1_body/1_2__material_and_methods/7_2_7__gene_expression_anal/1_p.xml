<p class="p">Total RNA isolated from liver tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was reverse transcribed and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. mRNA expression levels of Tp53 and CYP2E1 genes were assessed using GAPDH gene as the reference gene. Briefly, cDNA was added to a Quantifast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen) containing 30 pg/mL of each primer (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The thermal program included 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. The first denaturation was extended to 1 min. Calculation of gene expression was done following Livak and Schmittgen [
