<p>Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 (control) was given corn oil (2 mL/kg, IP). Group 2 (fibrosis model) was given CCl
 <sub>4</sub> 1 : 4 mixture with corn oil (2.5 mL/kg, IP) twice weekly for eight weeks. Rats in group 3 received CCl
 <sub>4</sub> for two weeks to establish liver injury and fibrosis and then treated with MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP), daily from the 3rd to 8th week. Group 4 received MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP) from the 3rd to 8th week. The selected dose for MPOE (50 mg/kg) was previously reported to be hepatoprotective for rats [
