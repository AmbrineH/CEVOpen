  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The antigen retrieval was performed by pretreating the tissue sections for 20 min with citrate buffer pH 6 at microwave oven. Sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-SMA diluted 1 : 200 (ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal antidesmin antibody diluted 1 : 200 (ab15200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF-
  <span class="italic">β</span>1 antibody with concentration of 20 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL (ab92486; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-SMAD3 antibody diluted 1 : 100 (ab28379; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Tp53 antibody diluted 1 : 100 (ab131442; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for two hours in a humidified chamber. The tissue sections were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG H&amp;L (HRP) (ab205718; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Finally, the slides were incubated for 10 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) as chromagen, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with DPX. The image analyses of the stained sections were performed by Leica Qwin 500 Image Analyzer (Leica, Cambridge, England). In each group, seven sections were examined. The percentage of the immunopositive area (%) was calculated as mean of 10 fields/section.
