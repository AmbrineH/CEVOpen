 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrodistilled MPEO was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Ten chemical constituents could be identified by elution on HP-5872 column (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The major constituents of MPEO, in order of their percentage (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), were menthol (46.7%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-menthone (18.3%), 
  <span class="sc">l</span>-carvone (15.2%), pulegone (6.3%), 
  <span class="italic">iso</span>-menthone (5.3%), and 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-camphor (3.3%). Small amounts of 1,8-cineol, beta pinene, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene, and limonene were also identified.
