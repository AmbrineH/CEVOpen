  <sub>4</sub>-intoxicated rats (group 2) showed a severe increase in liver marker enzymes, ALT and AST, to about 62- and 23-folds, respectively, compared to the control group. MPOE coadministration (group 3) exerted a significant reduction of ALT and AST levels to 76.8% and 60.4%, respectively, as compared to the CCl
  <sub>4</sub> group. There were no significant differences in liver enzymes between groups 1 and 4 (
