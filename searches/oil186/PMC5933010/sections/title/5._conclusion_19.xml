 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MPEO significantly ameliorates the severity of CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis through improving the oxidative status and restoring hepatic CYP2E1 expression. These MPEO actions could be mediated by inhibiting TGF-
  <span class="italic">Î²</span>1/SMAD signaling proteins and downregulation of p53 at both gene and protein levels. These data suggest that MPEO might be an effective antifibrogenic agent in the prevention of liver fibrosis progression. MPEO could help in developing a promising approach against oxidation-caused liver fibrosis.
