 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total RNA isolated from liver tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was reverse transcribed and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. mRNA expression levels of Tp53 and CYP2E1 genes were assessed using GAPDH gene as the reference gene. Briefly, cDNA was added to a Quantifast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen) containing 30 pg/mL of each primer (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The thermal program included 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. The first denaturation was extended to 1 min. Calculation of gene expression was done following Livak and Schmittgen [
