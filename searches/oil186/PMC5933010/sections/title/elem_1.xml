   <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span> L. leaves were purchased from Harraz Drug stores (Cairo, Egypt). A voucher specimen of the studied plant material was deposited at Biochemistry Department, National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), Egypt. Essential oil was extracted and characterized for its chemical composition using gas-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described by Ogaly et al. [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult male rats (150–170 g) were obtained from the breeding unit of the Research Institute of Ophthalmology (Giza, Egypt). Rats were housed under constant temperature and 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to water and standard chow diet. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Cairo University (CU-II-F-1-18).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 (control) was given corn oil (2 mL/kg, IP). Group 2 (fibrosis model) was given CCl
   <sub>4</sub> 1 : 4 mixture with corn oil (2.5 mL/kg, IP) twice weekly for eight weeks. Rats in group 3 received CCl
   <sub>4</sub> for two weeks to establish liver injury and fibrosis and then treated with MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP), daily from the 3rd to 8th week. Group 4 received MPOE (50 mg/kg, IP) from the 3rd to 8th week. The selected dose for MPOE (50 mg/kg) was previously reported to be hepatoprotective for rats [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of experiment, animals were anesthetized with ethyl ether. Blood samples (3-4 mL) were collected by retro-orbital puncture, and serum was separated by centrifugation (4000 rpm/10 min). Afterward, all animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under ethyl ether anesthesia for humane reasons; the whole liver was immediately removed, rinsed in cold normal saline, and kept at −20°C until further analyses. Liver homogenates (10%) were prepared in 0.1 M ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, 15 min at 4°C. The separated supernatants were kept at −20°C. For histopathological examination, parts of liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and underwent routine processing for paraffin embedding.</p>

The tissue sections were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG H&amp;L (HRP) (ab205718; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Finally, the slides were incubated for 10 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) as chromagen, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with DPX. The image analyses of the stained sections were performed by Leica Qwin 500 Image Analyzer (Leica, Cambridge, England). In each group, seven sections were examined. The percentage of the immunopositive area (%) was calculated as mean of 10 fields/section.
