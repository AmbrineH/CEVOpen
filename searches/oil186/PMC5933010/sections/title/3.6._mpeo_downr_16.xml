  <sub>4</sub>-Induced Fibrosis
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tp53 gene expression level showed a significant elevation in the liver fibrosis control (group 2). Tp53 mRNA level reached to about 16-folds of the control level. This CCl
  <sub>4</sub>-induced overexpression of Tp53 was markedly suppressed in MPOE-treated rats to about 2-fold as compared to that in the control (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8(a)</a>). At the protein level, p53 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the liver fibrosis control. Group 3 treated with CCl
  <sub>4</sub> + MPOE showed significantly decreased p53 immunoreactivity (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" href="#fig9"> Figure 9(e)</a> summarizes the IHC analysis of p53 protein expression in the different groups. Nonsignificant differences in p53 mRNA and protein levels were detected between groups 1 and 4 (Figures
