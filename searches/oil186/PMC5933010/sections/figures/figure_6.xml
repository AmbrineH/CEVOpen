 <p> Representive TGF- β1 immunohistochemistry in liver tissue of the different experimental groups (×200). (a and d) The normal control (group 1) and MPEO control (group 4) showing weak immunopositive reaction in portal areas. (b) Liver fibrosis control (group 2) showing intense immunostaining in periductal cells in the portal tract, in perisinusoidal cells, around the blood vessels, and in sinusoidal lining cells. (c) MPEO-treated (group 3) showing mild reaction in some perisinusoidal cells. (e) Bar chart represents the TGF- β1 immunohistochemistry in liver expressed as area %. Mean values with different superscripts are significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>)
