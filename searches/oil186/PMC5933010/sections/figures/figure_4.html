 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Representative α-SMA immunohistochemistry in liver tissues of the different experimental groups (×200). (a and d) The normal control (group 1) and MPEO control (group 4) showing α-SMA staining in the smooth muscle cells of the hepatic vessels. (b) Liver fibrosis control (group 2) showing strong immunostaining reaction in myofibroblast cells. (c) MPEO-treated (group 3) showing marked reduction in immunopositive reactive areas. (e) Bar chart represents the α-SMA immunohistochemistry expressed as area %. Mean values with different superscripts are significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>)
