 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To confirm the involvement of voltage operated, and /or receptor operated calcium channels, and the enhancement of calcium release form internal stores in the vasodilator effect of AcEO, two sets of experiments were carried out as described by [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. First, cumulative doses of the AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) were added to aorta precontracted with both K
  <span class="sup">+</span> (80 mM) and Phen (1 μM). In another set of experiments, a comparative profile of the vasorelaxant effect of ACEO cumulative doses (10
  <span class="sup">−4</span>–10
  <span class="sup">−1</span> mg/ml) and verapamil (10
  <span class="sup">−8</span>-10
  <span class="sup">−6</span> M) was challenged on the aorta precontracted by K
  <span class="sup">+</span> (80 mM).
