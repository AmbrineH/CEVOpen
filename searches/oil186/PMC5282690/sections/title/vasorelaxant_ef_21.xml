 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calcium channels and prostanoid mediated vasodilation was studied following the protocol detailed by Li et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10
  <span class="sup">−5</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), and to explore the role of calcium channels in the vasorelaxant effect, endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>-channel type VOC, verapamil (10
  <span class="sup">−5</span> M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca

  <sub>ase</sub> (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin (10
  <span class="sup">−7</span> M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with phenylephrine (10
  <span class="sup">−6</span> M), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.
