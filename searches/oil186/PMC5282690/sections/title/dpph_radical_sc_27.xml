 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radical scavenging activity of AcEO against DPPH radical increased significantly in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>); the EC
  <sub>50</sub> values calculated from the graph was EC
  <sub>50</sub> = 690 μg/ml. However, the radical scavenging activity attributed to ascorbic acid seems to be more important, characterized by a linear and stable shape of the graph with a maximum of 96.23% of the antioxidant effect (AA % higher than 50%).
