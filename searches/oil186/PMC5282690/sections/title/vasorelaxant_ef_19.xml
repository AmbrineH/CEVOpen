 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant pathway was studied as described by Monteiro et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10
  <span class="sup">−4</span> M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), the NO scavenger, hydroxocobalamin (3.10
  <span class="sup">−5</span> M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10
  <span class="sup">−5</span>M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), and the competitive cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (3.10
  <span class="sup">−6</span> M; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) for 20 min prior the contraction with Phen (1 μM), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.
