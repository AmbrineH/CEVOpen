 <italic class="italic">A. campestris</italic> L. is an Asteraceae plant commonly known as field wormwood; it is a perennial undershrub (30–150 cm height), with branched and ascending brownish-red stems. Leaves are green, the basal are 2–3 pinnatisects, the upper are simple. Inflorescence is an ovoid, heterogamous yellowish capitulum, with an involucral bracts; ray flowers are female, pistillate and fertile, while the disk flowers are sterile, and functionally male [

 <italic class="italic">A.campestris</italic> L. extract induced antihypertensive effect on envenomed hypertensive rats, and provoked 10% to 30% of hypertension drop, while the pretreatment with the herb extract prevented the rise of hypertension [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, no in-vitro study has been elaborated to evaluate the antihypertensive potential of this plant. In the aim to highlight the importance of this plant in the cardiovascular therapy, this study was performed to analyze the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">A. campestris</italic> L. (AcEO) growing in oriental Morocco, to investigate its vasorelaxant and subsequent mechanism of action and to determine its antiplatelet and antioxidant effects.
