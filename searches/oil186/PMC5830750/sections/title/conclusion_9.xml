 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study is the first report involving an effective comparison of two different methods for extraction of oil compositions and volatile fractions from flowers, leaves and roots of 
  <span class="italic">E. ilicifolius</span> including HD and HS-SPME combined with GC and GC-MS analysis. In all cases, the variety of volatile compounds in distillation was more than HS-SPME. Distillation extract from flowers and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">E. ilicifolius</span> showed a higher percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes and a lower percentage of hydrocarbon monoterpenes than HS-SPME. Also, high molecular weight compounds were not identified in the headspace due to low volatility such as fatty acids and sesquiterpenes; therefore, HS-SPME is an easy, simple, inexpensive and solvent-free preparation technique to identify lighter compounds. Also, this work indicates that the essential oils of flower, leaf and root of 
  <span class="italic">E. ilicifolius</span> have antimicrobial activities against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, further studies on quantitative and qualitative extraction of volatile compounds from other plants using different methods and comparing them, and also evaluation of the antibacterial activities of the essential oils obtained from these plants are underway.
