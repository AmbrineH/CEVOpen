<p>Like many other representatives of the family Compositae, 
 <italic>Echinops</italic> species produce essential oils and volatile components, but in spite of the large size of this genus, the composition of the volatile constituents is known only for a small number of species [

 <xref rid="RSOS171424C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171424C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSOS171424C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; therefore, developing different techniques can be used for the extraction of volatile organic components from plants. Hydrodistillation (HD) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) are common extraction methods.
