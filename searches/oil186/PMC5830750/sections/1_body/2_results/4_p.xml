<p>The antimicrobial activities of flower, leaf and root oils of 
 <italic>E. ilicifolius</italic> were assayed against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and results are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS171424TB2">tableÂ 2</xref>. The flower, root and leaf oils have significant activity against all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> were the more susceptible to flower oil than other bacteria. Leaf oil showed a stronger antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and a moderate activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, while the antibacterial effect was higher against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> than 
 <italic>S. epidermidis, P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in root oil. The present study shows that there is positive correlation between the chemical content of the oil and their antibacterial activities.
