<p>Although hydrodistillation is the most popular, widespread and an effective conventional method for the extraction of essential oils from plants, it has some weaknesses. This method is a time-consuming and laborious process, and requires a large amount of sample. Also because of the presence of water and long heating time, it could be concluded that the essential oil has a higher percentage of sesquiterpenes. However, monoterpenes may be susceptible to chemical changes, and even some of the highly volatile constituents, such as
