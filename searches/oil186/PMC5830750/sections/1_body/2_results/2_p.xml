<p>The chemical analysis results obtained by HD and HS-SPME methods from 
 <italic>E. ilicifolius</italic> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS171424TB1">table 1</xref>. In the hydrodistilled oils of the flower and leaf were identified 33 components representing 99.7% and 43 constituents representing 99.5%, respectively. The major components in the hydrodistilled oil from the flowers were linalool (58.6%), geraniol (17.4%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-dodecane (10.9%) and nerol (5.4%), and in the leaf oil of the plant, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid (32.3%), linalool (16.4%) and geraniol (8.3%) were the predominant compounds. HS-SPME analysis of flowers and leaves led to identification of nine and 16 components accounting for 100.0% and 99.9%, respectively. The main components from the dried flowers of aerial parts were 
 <italic>n</italic>-octane (34.0%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-decane (25.1%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (11.1%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (5.3%) and 1,8-cineole (5.1%), and the major components identified in the HS-SPME extract of leaves were 
 <italic>n</italic>-decane (32.6%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (14.0%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-octane (10.3%), limonene (9.2%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (9.1%), 1,8-cineole (7.9%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (5.9%). The hydrodistilled oils of the flowers and leaves were rich in regard to oxygenated monoterpenes (82.1% and 35.1%, respectively) and nonterpene hydrocarbons (17.0% and 63.1%, respectively), whereas the headspace extract contained mainly monoterpene hydrocarbons (25.0% and 44.5%, respectively) and nonterpene hydrocarbons (59.2% and 44.0%, respectively). Twenty-three components comprising 91.2% of the HD method were identified in the root. The main compounds in the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. ilicifolius</italic> were 
 <italic>n</italic>-decane (23.1%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-dodecane (14.5%), silphiperfol-4,7(14)-diene (11.1%), selin-11-en-4-a-ol (9.5%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid (7.8%) and 
 <italic>n</italic>-tetradecane (5.3%), whereas 1,8-cineole (29.0%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-decane (12.6%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-octane (12.6%), camphor (12.0%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9.6%) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (5.9%) were reported as the main compounds among the 12 constituents identified in the HS-SPME extract, representing 99.8% of the total components detected. The dominant compounds in the hydrodistilled oil of the leaves were nonterpene hydrocarbons (73.7%), whereas chemical compositions of the HS-SPME method comprised mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (47.3%), nonterpene hydrocarbons (28.1%) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (24.5%).
