<p>The antibacterial activities of the essential oils of 
 <italic>E. ilicifolius</italic> were determined by measuring the growth inhibitory zones against three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacteria. The Gram-positive bacteria included 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC 29212), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC 12228) and Gram-negative bacteria included 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (ATCC 43071), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853). The bacteria were obtained from the Research Center of Science and Industry, Tehran, Iran. The microorganisms (obtained from enrichment culture with a bacterial concentration 1.8 × 10
