 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota is important for the development of the systemic and gut immune response [
  <a rid="B27-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijms-18-02645">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijms-18-02645">28</a>]. Studies on germ-free mice have shown that the lack of intestinal microbiota leads to the reduced development of the intestinal immune system and oral tolerance [
  <a rid="B29-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijms-18-02645">29</a>]. Another role for the gut microbiota is the continuous stimulation of resident macrophages to release large amounts of IL-10 that promote the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) and prevent excessive development of T helper 17 (Th17) cells [
  <a rid="B30-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijms-18-02645">30</a>]. Symbiotic intestinal bacteria are essential for the development and function of specific lymphocyte subsets. Early exposure to microbes in the intestine could be a critical factor modulating the original Th2-biased immune response, to subsequently induce the differentiation of other Th cell lineages, such as Th1, Th17, and Treg cells [
  <a rid="B31-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijms-18-02645">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gut microbiota produces many immunogenicity endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In some cases, LPS pass through the intestinal wall, especially when the barrier is destroyed, causing further damage. Even minute quantities of LPS in the systemic circulation, on the picogram scale, have the potential to elicit an inflammatory response in humans. LPS is thought to enter the circulation by transportation across the intestinal epithelium either via the para-cellular pathway through the openings of intestinal tight-junctions between two epithelial cells, or through a trans-cellular pathway [
  <a rid="B32-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijms-18-02645">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inflammation plays a role in the insurgence of various diseases and recent findings have suggested that an altered gut microbiota, in particular a reduction of health-promoting gut bacteria such as 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacilli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacteria</span>, has been linked to metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases [
  <a rid="B33-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijms-18-02645">33</a>], cystic fibrosis [
  <a rid="B34-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijms-18-02645">34</a>], neurological diseases (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis) [
  <a rid="B35-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijms-18-02645">35</a>], as well as musculoskeletal conditions such as frailty, osteoporosis, and gout [
  <a rid="B36-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijms-18-02645">36</a>,
  <a rid="B37-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijms-18-02645">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned above, diet is one of the strongest selective pressures for microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-02645-t002" href="#ijms-18-02645-t002">Table 2</a> summarizes the studies that have investigated the role of PUFAs on microbiota. Several studies have demonstrated that feeding a high-fat diet (i.e., 45–60% kcal from fat) influences the types and amounts of gut microbes and adversely affects intestinal health. In particular, a high-fat diet is implicated in dysbiosis, including a decrease in 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> and an increase in both 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Proteobacteria</span> in the murine model [
  <a rid="B38-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijms-18-02645">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijms-18-02645">39</a>], a reduction of microbiota richness in terms of the number of species per sample [
  <a rid="B40-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijms-18-02645">40</a>,
  <a rid="B41-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijms-18-02645">41</a>], as well as an increase in LPS-producing bacteria such as 
  <span class="italic">Enterobactericeae</span> and/or a decrease in LPS-suppressing bacteria (those which can lower the numbers of LPS-producing bacteria, such as 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacterium</span>). Moreover, a high-fat diet results in epithelial alterations, such as intestinal barrier dysfunction [
  <a rid="B42-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijms-18-02645">42</a>]; a higher intestinal permeability [
  <a rid="B43-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijms-18-02645">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijms-18-02645">44</a>]; and an increased LPS translocation that can diffuse from the gut to the bloodstream, either by direct diffusion mediated by para-cellular permeability or through absorption by enterocytes during chylomicron secretion [
  <a rid="B45-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijms-18-02645">45</a>]. Current evidence suggests that dietary fat augments the circulating LPS concentrations. The resultant postprandial endotoxemia leads to low-grade systemic inflammation, which has been implicated in the development of several metabolic diseases, insulin resistance, adipocyte hyperplasia and reduction of pancreatic β-cell function [
  <a rid="B46-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijms-18-02645">46</a>], and impaired glucose metabolism [
  <a rid="B47-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijms-18-02645">47</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies have shown that different types of dietary fat, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and PUFAs, and their abundance in the diet, could change gut microbiota composition [
  <a rid="B48-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijms-18-02645">48</a>]. In particular, omega-3 PUFAs share the important immune system activation/inhibition pathway with gut microbes modulating pro-inflammatory profiles [
  <a rid="B49-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijms-18-02645">49</a>]. For example, supplementation with an equal mixture of EPA and DHA decreased intestinal barrier dysfunction and decreased PPAR-γ levels caused by ischemia and reperfusion intestinal injury in a Sprague Dawley rat model [
  <a rid="B50-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijms-18-02645">50</a>]. Several types of fatty acids have an antimicrobial activity, and this activity occurs after the complete enzymatic hydrolysis of fat by the gut microbiota in the lower gastrointestinal tract [
  <a rid="B51-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijms-18-02645">51</a>]. The antimicrobial activity of fatty acids depends on the length of their carbon chain and on the presence, number, position, and orientation of double bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids tend to have greater activity than saturated fatty acids with the same length carbon chain [
  <a rid="B51-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijms-18-02645">51</a>]. The antimicrobial activity of PUFAs increases in the direction of the number of double bonds in their carbon chain; the cis-orientation seems to have more activity than the trans-orientation. Some studies have shown that omega-3 PUFAs can modify the intestinal microbiota composition [
  <a rid="B52-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijms-18-02645">52</a>] by increasing the number of 
  <span class="italic">Bifidobacteria</span> that decrease gut permeability [
  <a rid="B53-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijms-18-02645">53</a>], and increase the number of 
  <span class="italic">Enterobacteria</span> that increase intestinal permeability [
  <a rid="B54-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijms-18-02645">54</a>], allowing increased systemic concentration of LPS and endotoxemia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies on the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on microbiota have mainly focused on the major bacterial phyla 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> in animal models. Omega-3 PUFAs from flaxseed seem to decrease the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> [
  <a rid="B55-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijms-18-02645">55</a>], and those from fish oil appear to lower the population of 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> [
  <a rid="B56-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijms-18-02645">56</a>]. An increase in the 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>/
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> ratio has been linked to weight gain and other metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, in part by the synthesis of SCFAs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caesar and colleagues [
  <a rid="B57-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijms-18-02645">57</a>] showed that the type of dietary fat is a major driver of community structure, affecting both the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. The authors fed two different groups of rats either a fish-oil diet or a lard diet. The results showed that mice fed fish oil had higher levels of 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Akkermansia muciniphila</span> than mice fed with lard, in which 
  <span class="italic">Bilophila</span> was abundant. The increase of 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span> is associated with reduced inflammation in several inflammatory bowel diseases. The increase of 
  <span class="italic">Akkermansia muciniphila</span> improves the barrier function and glucose metabolism, and also decreases macrophage infiltration in the white adipose tissue (WAT) [
  <a rid="B58-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijms-18-02645">58</a>]. In a study comparing different types of high-fat diets on the profile of gut bacteria in a mouse model, Liu and co-workers [
  <a rid="B55-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijms-18-02645">55</a>] observed that consumption of an SFA-rich diet resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span> compared to either omega-3 PUFA-rich or omega-6 PUFA-rich diets. A mouse study [
  <a rid="B59-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijms-18-02645">59</a>] reported that a diet supplemented with EPA and DHA significantly increased the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span> and reduced the percentage of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroidetes</span>, compared with a diet supplemented with oleic acid. As for human studies [
  <a rid="B16-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijms-18-02645">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijms-18-02645">17</a>], the changes in metabolic parameters after DHA intake in mice could be the result of interactions between gut microbiota and DHA metabolites, potentially through the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts [
  <a rid="B17-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijms-18-02645">17</a>]. Myles et al. [
  <a rid="B60-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijms-18-02645">60</a>] indicated that omega-3 PUFA intake in pregnant mice could influence offspring microbiota and immune response through the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs. These findings suggest that the administration of omega-3 PUFAs during embryonic development is important for the proper development of the microbiota and immune system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies on mice-transplanted faeces showed that the omega-3 PUFAs can modify the microbiota through the production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), leading to a reduction in the number of LPS-producing bacteria, thus reducing metabolic endotoxemia [
  <a rid="B52-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijms-18-02645">52</a>]. Mujico et al. [
  <a rid="B59-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijms-18-02645">59</a>] showed that, in diet-induced obese mice, supplementation with a combination of EPA and DHA significantly increased the quantities of 
  <span class="italic">Firmicutes</span>, and especially the 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span> taxa. Evidence suggests that some physiological effects of the microbiota could be associated with the interactions between dietary PUFAs. Dietary PUFAs have been suggested to affect the attachment sites for the gastrointestinal microbiota, possibly by modifying the fatty acid composition of the intestinal wall [
  <a rid="B61-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijms-18-02645">61</a>]. Data from animal models indicates that fish oil in particular has effects on shaping the microbiome. Ghosh et al. [
  <a rid="B62-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijms-18-02645">62</a>] found that mice fed a diet supplemented with fish oil had a reduced abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Clostridia</span> species compared with mice fed a diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of omega-3 on microbiota composition and diversity has not yet been thoroughly explored in human cohorts in comparison to animal models. As described above, increased intestinal permeability is involved in several disorders associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, including obesity, obesity-associated insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and IBD. The integrity of the intestinal epithelium is created by the tight junctions. Tight junctions are composed of multiple proteins, including cytosolic zonula occludin. Zonulin, a detectable protein in human serum [
  <a rid="B63-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijms-18-02645">63</a>], has been shown to reflect intestinal permeability [
  <a rid="B64-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijms-18-02645">64</a>,
  <a rid="B65-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijms-18-02645">65</a>]. Serum zonulin has been used as a serum marker for intestinal permeability in several studies [
  <a rid="B66-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijms-18-02645">66</a>,
  <a rid="B67-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijms-18-02645">67</a>,
  <a rid="B68-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijms-18-02645">68</a>]. Increased serum concentrations have been detected in a range of metabolic conditions associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. This marker was used by Mokkala and co-workers [
  <a rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijms-18-02645">69</a>] to analyze intestinal permeability in pregnant women. Numerous metabolic alterations accompany pregnancy that support foetal growth and development. Initial results suggested that healthy pregnant women exhibited an increase in intestinal permeability compared with non-pregnant women [
  <a rid="B70-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijms-18-02645">70</a>]. However, little is known about the effects of pregnancy on intestinal permeability and whether this could lead to subsequent health consequences.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mokkala et al. [
  <a rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijms-18-02645">69</a>] showed that gut microbiota composition, including both microbiota richness and the abundance of specific taxa, and dietary intakes of omega-3 PUFAs, fibers, and certain vitamins and minerals, are linked to concentrations of serum zonulin. The gut microbiota richness differed between the high and low zonulin groups, as exhibited by higher microbiota richness in the low zonulin group. Mokkala et al. [
  <a rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijms-18-02645">69</a>] found that a higher total intake of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with lower serum zonulin concentrations. This was the first study to suggest that gut microbiota richness is associated with intestinal permeability in humans in vivo. This study on pregnant women showed a higher abundance of 
  <span class="italic">F. prausnitzii</span> together with a lower abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroides</span> in the low zonulin group, indicating that these bacteria may play a role in intestinal epithelial integrity. In a previous study [
  <a rid="B71-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijms-18-02645">71</a>], bacterial diversity was associated with intestinal barrier function in patients with ulcerative colitis. This observation may be important for human health because a high amount of pro-inflammatory species, such as 
  <span class="italic">Bacteroides</span>, in relation to potentially anti-inflammatory species, such as 
  <span class="italic">F. prausnitzii</span>, has been associated with adverse metabolic outcomes, such as insulin resistance. Instead, a higher abundance of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Blautia</span> has been associated with glucose intolerance [
  <a rid="B72-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-ijms-18-02645">72</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity, PUFAs influence the inflammatory status of the gut by serving as precursors to anti-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis, or enhance intestinal integrity by regulating the tight junction functions [

Based on the analyzed studies, omega-3 PUFAs may be a useful tool in the prevention of diseases associated with dysbiosis. Future studies with clinical trials are needed to analyze the relationship between omega-3 PUFAs and microbiota.
