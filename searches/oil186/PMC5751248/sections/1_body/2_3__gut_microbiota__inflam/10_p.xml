<p class="p">Mokkala et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] showed that gut microbiota composition, including both microbiota richness and the abundance of specific taxa, and dietary intakes of omega-3 PUFAs, fibers, and certain vitamins and minerals, are linked to concentrations of serum zonulin. The gut microbiota richness differed between the high and low zonulin groups, as exhibited by higher microbiota richness in the low zonulin group. Mokkala et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] found that a higher total intake of omega-3 PUFAs was associated with lower serum zonulin concentrations. This was the first study to suggest that gut microbiota richness is associated with intestinal permeability in humans in vivo. This study on pregnant women showed a higher abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">F. prausnitzii</italic> together with a lower abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> in the low zonulin group, indicating that these bacteria may play a role in intestinal epithelial integrity. In a previous study [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], bacterial diversity was associated with intestinal barrier function in patients with ulcerative colitis. This observation may be important for human health because a high amount of pro-inflammatory species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic>, in relation to potentially anti-inflammatory species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">F. prausnitzii</italic>, has been associated with adverse metabolic outcomes, such as insulin resistance. Instead, a higher abundance of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Blautia</italic> has been associated with glucose intolerance [
