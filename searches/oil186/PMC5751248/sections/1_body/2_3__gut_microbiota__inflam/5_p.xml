<p>Studies have shown that different types of dietary fat, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and PUFAs, and their abundance in the diet, could change gut microbiota composition [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In particular, omega-3 PUFAs share the important immune system activation/inhibition pathway with gut microbes modulating pro-inflammatory profiles [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For example, supplementation with an equal mixture of EPA and DHA decreased intestinal barrier dysfunction and decreased PPAR-Î³ levels caused by ischemia and reperfusion intestinal injury in a Sprague Dawley rat model [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Several types of fatty acids have an antimicrobial activity, and this activity occurs after the complete enzymatic hydrolysis of fat by the gut microbiota in the lower gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of fatty acids depends on the length of their carbon chain and on the presence, number, position, and orientation of double bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids tend to have greater activity than saturated fatty acids with the same length carbon chain [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of PUFAs increases in the direction of the number of double bonds in their carbon chain; the cis-orientation seems to have more activity than the trans-orientation. Some studies have shown that omega-3 PUFAs can modify the intestinal microbiota composition [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] by increasing the number of 
 <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> that decrease gut permeability [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and increase the number of 
 <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> that increase intestinal permeability [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], allowing increased systemic concentration of LPS and endotoxemia.
