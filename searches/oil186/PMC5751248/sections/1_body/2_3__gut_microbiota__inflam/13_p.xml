 <italic class="italic">F. prausnitzii</italic> is a butyrate-producing bacterium; its decline leads to a decrease in SCFA production in IBD, whereas an increase was noted in sulfate-reducing bacteria that induce mucosal inflammation [

 <xref rid="B80-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Omega-3 PUFAs inhibit the NF-κB pathway through resolvins and protectins. Based on the analyzed studies, omega-3 PUFAs may be a useful tool in the prevention of diseases associated with dysbiosis. Future studies with clinical trials are needed to analyze the relationship between omega-3 PUFAs and microbiota.
