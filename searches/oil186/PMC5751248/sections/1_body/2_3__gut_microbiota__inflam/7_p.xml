<p>Caesar and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] showed that the type of dietary fat is a major driver of community structure, affecting both the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. The authors fed two different groups of rats either a fish-oil diet or a lard diet. The results showed that mice fed fish oil had higher levels of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> than mice fed with lard, in which 
 <italic>Bilophila</italic> was abundant. The increase of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> is associated with reduced inflammation in several inflammatory bowel diseases. The increase of 
 <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> improves the barrier function and glucose metabolism, and also decreases macrophage infiltration in the white adipose tissue (WAT) [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In a study comparing different types of high-fat diets on the profile of gut bacteria in a mouse model, Liu and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] observed that consumption of an SFA-rich diet resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance of 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> compared to either omega-3 PUFA-rich or omega-6 PUFA-rich diets. A mouse study [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] reported that a diet supplemented with EPA and DHA significantly increased the abundance of 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and reduced the percentage of 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, compared with a diet supplemented with oleic acid. As for human studies [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the changes in metabolic parameters after DHA intake in mice could be the result of interactions between gut microbiota and DHA metabolites, potentially through the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Myles et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] indicated that omega-3 PUFA intake in pregnant mice could influence offspring microbiota and immune response through the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs. These findings suggest that the administration of omega-3 PUFAs during embryonic development is important for the proper development of the microbiota and immune system.
