<p class="p">Several studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota is important for the development of the systemic and gut immune response [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Studies on germ-free mice have shown that the lack of intestinal microbiota leads to the reduced development of the intestinal immune system and oral tolerance [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Another role for the gut microbiota is the continuous stimulation of resident macrophages to release large amounts of IL-10 that promote the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) and prevent excessive development of T helper 17 (Th17) cells [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Symbiotic intestinal bacteria are essential for the development and function of specific lymphocyte subsets. Early exposure to microbes in the intestine could be a critical factor modulating the original Th2-biased immune response, to subsequently induce the differentiation of other Th cell lineages, such as Th1, Th17, and Treg cells [
