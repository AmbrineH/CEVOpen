<p>The role of omega-3 on microbiota composition and diversity has not yet been thoroughly explored in human cohorts in comparison to animal models. As described above, increased intestinal permeability is involved in several disorders associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, including obesity, obesity-associated insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and IBD. The integrity of the intestinal epithelium is created by the tight junctions. Tight junctions are composed of multiple proteins, including cytosolic zonula occludin. Zonulin, a detectable protein in human serum [

 <xref rid="B65-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Serum zonulin has been used as a serum marker for intestinal permeability in several studies [

 <xref rid="B67-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Increased serum concentrations have been detected in a range of metabolic conditions associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. This marker was used by Mokkala and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] to analyze intestinal permeability in pregnant women. Numerous metabolic alterations accompany pregnancy that support foetal growth and development. Initial results suggested that healthy pregnant women exhibited an increase in intestinal permeability compared with non-pregnant women [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, little is known about the effects of pregnancy on intestinal permeability and whether this could lead to subsequent health consequences.
