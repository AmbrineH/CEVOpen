<p class="p">Both MDD and ASD are characterized by similar alterations in gut microbiota composition associated with a pro-inflammatory microbial profile [

 <xref rid="B87-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Since gut microbiota can modulate neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and mammalian behavior, and since dysbiosis is linked to inflammation, neurodevelopmental, and behavioral disorders, correct microbiota development appears to be fundamental to guaranteeing proper brain function and avoiding behavioral and social impairments later in life. Various environmental factors that impair gut microbiota composition may impact neurodevelopment and increase the risk of behavioral disorders. With respect to this, omega-3 PUFAs, and in particular EPA and DHA, are essential nutrients for brain development and health as they play a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>], dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], and HPA axis activity [
 <xref rid="B91-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. An omega-3 PUFA deficiency, especially during intrauterine and early life, is associated with impaired psychomotor development, and issues with attention, cognition, and visual acuity [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Moreover, a substantial decrease in plasma and brain omega-3 PUFAs levels, for DHA in particular, was found in patients with ASD [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]; it is also correlated with mood and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression later in life [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Conversely, DHA supplementation has been shown to improve the symptoms of these conditions [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. These omega-3 PUFA benefits on the brain may be due to their ability to modulate gut microbiota composition.
