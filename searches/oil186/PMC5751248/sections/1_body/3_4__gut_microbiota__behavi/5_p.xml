<p class="p">Outcomes from another study by Davis et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] on the stress-induced adult mouse model through social isolation demonstrated that environmental stress can cause significant changes in the adult gut microbiota, and these changes may be countered with the introduction of DHA into the diet, providing evidence of the ability of omega-3 PUFAs to positively modulate gut microbiota composition. In this survey, a sexual dimorphism was found in response to stress and to DHA treatment, with adult males being more sensitive than females. Gut microbiota changes appearing in males after isolation are linked with depressive-like behavior and showed a decrease in bacteria implicated in SCFA production, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Allobaculum</italic>, and an increase in those involved in tryptophan metabolism, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus</italic> species. Of note, this bacterial genus was also found in high levels in ASD children [
 <xref rid="B104-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] and may lead to an increase in tryptophan biosynthesis that has been found to be higher in males. Enrichment of tryptophan biosynthesis supposedly leads to an increase in the concentration of quinolinic acid, a neuroactive compound able to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier that has been correlated with anxiety behavior.
