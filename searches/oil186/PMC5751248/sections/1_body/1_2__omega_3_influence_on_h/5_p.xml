<p>The recent study of Menni and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] correlated DHA circulating levels with DHA dietary intake, determined by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The association with major taxa was determined in the largest population studied to date in this topic, with 876 participants, based on a cohort of middle-aged and elderly women (mean age = 64.98 years old). They found that a DHA intake of 350 mg/day resulted in a serum DHA concentration of 0.14 mmol/L, and was significantly associated with 36 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Of these, 21 OTUs (58%) belonged to 
 <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, 7 to 
 <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> (19%), and 5 to 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (14%). In this study, a correlation between serum DHA and faecal metabolites was evaluated, and a positive correlation with 
 <italic>N</italic>-carbamylglutamate was found. Even in this analysis, a positive correlation between omega-3 PUFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria (
 <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family) was highlighted. The authors hypothesized that the levels of 
 <italic>N</italic>-carbamylglutamate present in the gut lumen may mediate the association between the found taxa and serum DHA [
