<p>Another dietary intervention was the Pilchardus Study, a multicentre randomized trial in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin level between 6.0% and 8.0%) and not subjected to insulin treatment or antidiabetic drugs [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, the participants followed a six-month dietary intervention of either a standard diet for diabetes, control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15), or a standard diet supplemented with 100 g of sardines five days a week (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17), which provided approximately 3 g of EPA and DHA. The analysis of the abundance of the target bacteria by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed a significant decrease in 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum in both experimental groups, with the 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic>/
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio decreasing in the omega-3 group. Moreover, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> concentrations increased in both groups and the proportions of 
 <italic>Bacteroides-Prevotella</italic> increased in the sardine-fed group [
