<p>These studies have highlighted some common changes in gut microbiota after omega-3 supplementation. In particular, a decrease in 
 <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, often associated with an increase in the 
 <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>Roseburia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, has been observed. In a cross-sectional study, the gut microbiota composition of IBD-affected individuals was identified [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Notably, in the IBD group, the authors found an increase in 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>, 
 <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sutterella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic> genera, whereas 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavobacterium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Oscillospira</italic> genera decreased [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, omega-3 PUFAs could improve IBD patientsâ€™ condition by reverting the microbiota to a healthier composition. Moreover, omega-3 PUFAs can trigger a healthy chain reaction, increasing SCFA amounts; their anti-inflammatory action can help improve this pathology. However, further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.
