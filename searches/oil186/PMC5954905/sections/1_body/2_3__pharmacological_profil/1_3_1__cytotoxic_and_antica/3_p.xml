 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> was shown to possess antimetastasis activities in 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assays. A study by Park et al. evaluated the antimetastatic effect of flavonoids, isolated from Korean 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> in mice models. Flavonoids were shown to prevent cancer cell infiltration and localization to the lungs. Moreover, through the regulation of caspase-3 and phospho-p53, the flavonoids induced cancer cell apoptosis. 
 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> tests demonstrated that flavonoids inhibited A549 cells metastasis and induced apoptosis and downregulation of the Ddx3x and ANP43B proteins, supporting the use of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> flavonoids in human lung cancer treatment. According to the bioactivity assays conducted on the major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">amara</italic>, namely, 5-hydroxy-6,7,30,40-tetramethoxyflavone (HTF) and limonexic acid (LA), both compounds showed remarkable antioxidant effects and notable inhibitory action on the B16 and SMCC-7721 cell lines, at a concentration between 6.25 and 50
