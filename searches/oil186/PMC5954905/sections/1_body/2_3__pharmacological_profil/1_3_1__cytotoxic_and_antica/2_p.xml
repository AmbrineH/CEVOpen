<p>Protective activity of the extract obtained from the peels of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> against apoptosis in cholestatic liver fibrosis-induced mice was investigated. As part of the experiment, cholestatic liver injury was induced by bile duct ligation and the mice were treated with 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> peel extract. According to the histopathological analysis, the administration of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> peel extract significantly decreased liver fibrosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that the extract reduced the concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), suggesting 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> can efficiently regulate bile duct ligation-induced liver injury by displaying antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects [
