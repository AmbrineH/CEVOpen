<p>Miyazawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] isolated three polymethoxy flavonoid-type compounds, namely, tetra-
 <italic>O</italic>-methylscutellarein, sinensetin, and nobiletin from 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic>. These compounds caused marked downstream regulation of a variety of gene expressions and thus showed strong antimutagenic activity. Wang and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] summarized the anticancer effects of polymethoxyflavones with detailed molecular mechanisms. The various amines and flavonoids have been quantitatively analyzed in 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> using liquid chromatography [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hesperidin has been isolated from 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It displayed a significant apoptotic effect against liver cell lines, HepG2 cells, by mediating through the upstream regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
