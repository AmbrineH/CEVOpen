<p>The anxiolytic and sedative effects of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> light-dark box and the marble-burying assays were evaluated
 <italic>. C. aurantium</italic> essential oil enhanced the period the mice spent in the light chamber, as well as the number of transitions between the two compartments in the light-dark box test [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, single and repeated treatments with the essential oil were reported to suppress marble-burying behavior [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The anxiolytic activity of the blossom of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> was also evaluated clinically on 60 patients undergoing minor surgical operation with no organic pathology. Two hours before the anesthesia induction, two groups consisting of 30 patients were administered at 1â€‰mL/kg of either 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> distillate or saline solution. Anxiety was assessed by using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory, the Amsterdamd preoperative anxiety, and information scale. The outcome of this study revealed that 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> could be active by reducing preoperative anxiety before minor operation [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
