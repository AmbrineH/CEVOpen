<p>Wolfenbuttel et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] investigated the influence of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> essential oil on melatonin and corticosterone in mice after inhalation for 30â€‰min. Melatonin provides protective effects on neuronal cells and acts as an antidepressant by restoration of corticosterone levels. After treatment, the hormone levels did not present variation, whereas behavioral tests showed that the inhalation of 10% essential oil causes an anxiolytic-like and sedative effect. From these data, 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> essential oil represents a valuable tool for the treatment of the anxiety disturbs, apparently without interference with melatonin and corticosterone physiological levels [
