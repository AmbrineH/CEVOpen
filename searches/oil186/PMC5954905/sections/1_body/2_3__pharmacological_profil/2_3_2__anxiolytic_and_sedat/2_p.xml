 <italic>in vivo</italic> antidepressant activity of ZZHPD in rats, by using coat state test, sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and open-field test. The effects of ZZHPD on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were determined by measuring the hormone levels. The results showed that ZZHPD improved depressive behaviors and normalized the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels, by restoring the function of HPA axis, and increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in hippocampus and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis [
