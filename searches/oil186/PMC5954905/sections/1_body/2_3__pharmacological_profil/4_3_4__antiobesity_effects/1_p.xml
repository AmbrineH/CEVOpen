<p>Besides its scientifically proven antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anxiolytic, and antidiabetic effects, 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract has been commonly utilized for the weight loss and as sports performance enhancer, in dietary supplements [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, the use of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract and its constituent 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine (C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>13</sub>NO
 <sub>2</sub>), for the treatment of obesity in 360 subjects, was reviewed. More than 50% of the subjects involved in these clinical studies were overweight, and approximately two-thirds of them consumed caffeine (132–528 mg/day) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine (10–53 mg/day). Approximately 44% of the subjects used a 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic>/
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine product, while the remaining consumed a combination product containing multiple ingredients with 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine. The results showed that 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract alone or in combination with other ingredients did not cause significant adverse effects including an increase in heart rate or blood pressure or change in electrocardiographic data, serum chemistry, blood cell counts, or urinalysis. 
 <italic>p-</italic>Synephrine, alone or in combination products, was demonstrated to enhance metabolic rate and energy expenditure and to promote weight loss when given for six to 12 weeks [
