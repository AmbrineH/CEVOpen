<p>The study by Verpeut et al. [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] investigated the effect of the combination of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> (standardized to 6% 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine) and 
 <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> L. (golden root) (standardized to 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside) on diet-induced obesity in Sprague-Dawley rats. Acute administration of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> (1–10 mg/kg) or 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> (2–20 mg/kg) alone did not decrease food intake in normal weight animals; however, the combination of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> (5.6 mg/kg) and 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> (20 mg/kg) provided a 10.5% feeding suppression. On the other hand, 10 days of treatment with 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> (5.6 mg/kg) or 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> (20 mg/kg) alone, or in combination, to the animals fed on a high-fat diet (60% fat) during the 13-week period led to a 30% decline in visceral fat weight, compared with other treatments. Coadministration of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> and 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> also resulted in an elevation in hypothalamic norepinephrine and frontal cortex dopamine, indicating the beneficial role of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> and 
 <italic>R. rosea</italic> in the treatment of obesity [
