<p class="p">Previous 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> investigations on the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> peels and its isolated component limonene have demonstrated their pest fumigant activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</italic> (silverleaf whitefly). In 24 h exposure, insect mortality between 41.00 and 47.67% was determined at 2.5 and 20.0
