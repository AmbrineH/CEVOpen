<p class="p">Antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> was investigated by using several 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assays [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>–
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. For instance, Karabıyıklı et al. [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] explored the antimicrobial action of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> juice against 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes.</italic> For this purpose, both neutralized and unneutralized juice samples with various concentrations were tested for the inoculation of the microorganisms at 4°C and 37°C temperatures, during a period of seven days. The results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> not only survived but also grown for two days in neutralized juice at 37°C. On the other hand, on day 7, none of them survived. The results also revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was less resistant than 
 <italic class="italic">S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium. The low pH of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> juice was suggested to be responsible for its antimicrobial potential along with the duration of the incubation period as well as the temperature [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In another research, the antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> was investigated, and high antimicrobial activity was recorded against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (among 12 microorganisms tested), with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 2.7 mg/mL and 4.8 mg/mL. Moderate effects were detected against 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mucor ramannianus</italic> with the values of 9.2 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL, respectively. In the same study, radical scavenging and antibacterial effects of the essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> were evaluated. Weak antioxidant effect was detected against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) radicals [
