<p>This review concluded that 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract and 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine are safe for use in dietary supplements and foods at commonly used doses. Also, other authors reported similar conclusions [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. While 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine alone seems to have low toxicity, when it is formulated in combination with other ingredients such as caffeine (
 <italic>Paullinia cupana</italic>, 
 <italic>Cola nitida</italic>, 
 <italic>Cola acuminata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>), salicin (
 <italic>Salix</italic> sp.), and ephedrine (ma huang, 
 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ephedra</italic> sp.) in weight loss products, the mixture could induce some cardiovascular effects. However, the study did not demonstrate that 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine contributed to cardiovascular effects.
