<p class="p">In order to assess the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> essential oil and its main compound limonene on gastric mucosa, Moraes et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] conducted a study 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. The essential oil and its compound limonene were found to possess protective activity in the gastrointestinal system against lesions, which were induced by ethanol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in rats, at doses of 250 mg/kg and 245 mg/kg, respectively. The essential oil and limonene increased the production of gastric mucus. The findings revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> essential oil and its main compound limonene can be used as a promising target for the development of a novel gastroprotective drug [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In another study, the gastroprotective effect of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene, a monoterpene-type compound of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic>, was evaluated. Experimental models of ulcer, induced by ethanol, NSAID stress, 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic>, ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R), and cysteamine (a drug used to treat cystinosis) was used to assess the ameliorative activity. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Myrcene was administered at dose of 7.5 mg/kg. The results showed a potential role for 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene against peptic ulcer disease. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Myrcene contributed to the maintenance of integrity of the gastric mucosa with a significant decrease of ulcerative lesions, attenuating lipid peroxidative damage and preventing depletion of GSH, GR, and GPx [
