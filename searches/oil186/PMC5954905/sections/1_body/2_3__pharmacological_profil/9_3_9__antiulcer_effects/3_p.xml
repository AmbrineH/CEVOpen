<p class="p">On the other hand, Hamdan et al. assessed the effects of hesperidin and neohesperidin, important flavonoid-type components of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic>. For this purpose, indomethacin-induced ulcer models of rats were used. Omeprazole was administered as a reference standard for the comparison. The parameters analyzed in the present study were ulcer index, gastric cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>, MDA, and GSH levels. Histopathalogical analysis was also performed. The findings of the study revealed that hesperidin and neohesperidin notably aggravated indomethacin-induced gastric damage as evidenced by increased ulcer index and histopathological alteration [

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>] observed the potent anticancer effects of limonene in hepatocellular carcinoma and HepG2, and the cell line caused the modulation of cancer-inducing genes. These data confirmed the antioxidant and prooxidant behavior of flavonoids showing the potential benefits and adverse effects of these opposing events.
