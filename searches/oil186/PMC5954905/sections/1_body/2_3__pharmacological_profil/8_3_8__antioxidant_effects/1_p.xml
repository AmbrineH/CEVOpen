<p>DPPH, ABTS, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays were used for the determination of the antioxidant potential of the macerate of the albedo layers of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> fruits obtained by protopectinase-SE (produced by 
 <italic>Geotrichum klebahnii</italic> and hydrolyzed selectively the intercellular protopectin of plant tissues). Moreover, the levels of total phenols, reducing sugars, vitamin C, total flavonones, naringin, and galacturonic acid and total acidity were detected. Antioxidant activity, vitamin C, and total flavonone levels were found to be the highest with the greatest degree of tissue maceration [

 <italic>In vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities of polysaccharide fractions from 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> were evaluated. The most active fraction was subjected to ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatography to obtain four purified polysaccharides. Upon the evaluation of their antioxidant effect, it was found that 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> can be utilized as an antioxidant in the food and medical industries [
