<p>Flavonoids are mainly present in 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> fruits as glycosyl derivatives. Aglycones are mainly present in specific parts of the fruit as peel and seeds, owing to their lipophilic nature and consequently their low solubility in water [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For glycoside forms, O-glycosides, C-glycosides, rutinosides, glucosides, and neohesperidosides are common [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The presence of a relatively large number of glycosylated flavonoids in 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> is a result of many different combinations possible between polyhydroxylated aglycones and a limited number of mono- and disaccharides [
