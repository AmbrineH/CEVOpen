<p>Flavanones are the main flavonoids contained in 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The most abundant detected free flavanones are hesperetin (4′-methoxy-3′,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone) and naringenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hesperetin and naringenin present a common skeleton: two hydroxyl group in positions C-5 and C-7, respectively, and they can be found as aglycone and/or as glycosides [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The most widely distributed glycosides of hesperetin are hesperidin and neohesperidin, which are conjugates with rutinose and neohesperidose, respectively, while, for naringenin, the most abundant glycosyl derivatives are naringin (naringenin-7-neohesperidoside) and narirutin (naringenin-7-rutinoside) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
