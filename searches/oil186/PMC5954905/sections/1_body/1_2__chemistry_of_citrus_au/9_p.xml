<p class="p">Zarrad and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] explored the chemical composition of Tunisian 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> fruits using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). 25 compounds were identified in 97.696% exploration, but the most prominent one was limonene with 85.52%, followed by linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene with 3.365% and 1.628%, respectively. The remaining compounds were in traces. Earlier, Villafane et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] reported the presence of D-limonene and nootkatone in the essential oil of the plant. Similarly, Sanei-Dehkordi et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] identified 21 compounds in peel essential oil of the plant. Of the total explored 98.62% composition, the quantity of limonene was 94.81% while the LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> was 31.20 ppm against 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi.</italic> However, the concentration of limonene was only 0.5–2.5% in 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> from Algeria and linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol were 18.6% and 15.1%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Thus, overall considerable variation was observed in the concentration of these major components in 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> grown in different parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Carvalho-Freitas and Costa observed strong anxiolytic and sedative-like effects of the essential oil derived from 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>].
