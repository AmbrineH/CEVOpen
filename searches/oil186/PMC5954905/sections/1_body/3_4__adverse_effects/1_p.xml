<p>Because of the possible adverse effects of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> in the cardiovascular system, the use of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic>-containing products has been questioned mainly due to the 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine content [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. As a fat decreasing agent, it was used in traditional medications, but it has been banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), due to its risks such as cardiovascular hazards and alkaloid toxicity [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. However, the cardiovascular effects of 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine have been opposed by several studies [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>–
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The study by Rodrigues et al. [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] was designed to investigate the herb-drug interactions between a standardized extract of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> and amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication, in rats. In the first step of the study, a single-dose of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> and amiodarone was administered orally to the rats at 164 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses, respectively. In the second step, the rats were pretreated with 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> for 14 days, and on the 15th day, the amiodarone was administered at the same dose. On the other hand, the control group rats received vehicle only. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement of the peak plasma concentration of amiodarone in rats pretreated with 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract, indicating a potential herb-drug interaction between 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract and amiodarone [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Most recent clinical studies on 16 individuals have indicated that 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> extract and its principal alkaloid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine, had no adverse effects on the cardiovascular system after 15 days of treatment [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, Stohs et al. [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] reported approximately 30 human studies indicating that 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine and bitter orange extracts do not result in cardiovascular effects; the effects in rodents cannot be directly extrapolated to humans at commonly used doses.
