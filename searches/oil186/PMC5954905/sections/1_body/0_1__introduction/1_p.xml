 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as bitter orange, is usually utilized as a flavoring and acidifying agent for food [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides the essential oil and its components [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the fruits of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> are sources of flavonoid-type compounds with diverse biological effects [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, it was reported that flavonoid glycosides were isolated from the plant [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the biogenic amine and flavanone contents have been determined [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to the abundance of health-giving secondary metabolites, 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> is also used for the treatment of several ailments such as anxiety [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], lung and prostate cancers [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and gastrointestinal disorders and obesity [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to the prohibition of 
 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic> Stapf. in Farw.-containing weight loss products in the market, 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> has found an important place as a preferable agent to replace ephedra, as it contains 
 <italic>p</italic>-synephrine, a phenylethanolamine type alkaloid, which is chemically similar to adrenergic agents, as appetite suppressants [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, several scientific studies investigating the potential effects of various parts (including flowers, fruits, and essential oils) of 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> have been conducted [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
