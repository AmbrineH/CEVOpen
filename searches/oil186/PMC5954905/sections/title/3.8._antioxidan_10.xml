 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DPPH, ABTS, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays were used for the determination of the antioxidant potential of the macerate of the albedo layers of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> fruits obtained by protopectinase-SE (produced by 
  <span class="italic">Geotrichum klebahnii</span> and hydrolyzed selectively the intercellular protopectin of plant tissues). Moreover, the levels of total phenols, reducing sugars, vitamin C, total flavonones, naringin, and galacturonic acid and total acidity were detected. Antioxidant activity, vitamin C, and total flavonone levels were found to be the highest with the greatest degree of tissue maceration [
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">78</a>–
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">In vivo</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> antioxidant activities of polysaccharide fractions from 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> were evaluated. The most active fraction was subjected to ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatography to obtain four purified polysaccharides. Upon the evaluation of their antioxidant effect, it was found that 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> can be utilized as an antioxidant in the food and medical industries [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study by Lagha-Benamrouche et al. [
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">84</a>], the antioxidant potentials of the peels and leaves of seven orange varieties obtained from Algeria were investigated by linoleic acid and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene oxidation assays. The presence of phenolic compounds was also investigated. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> cv. Bigarade was found to have the highest phenol level. The antioxidant activity assay was in accordance with the phytochemical findings. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> displayed the highest action on slowing down the rate of linoleic acid and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene oxidation [
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">84</a>, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">85</a>]. An antioxidant study was performed on the 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> fruits on different ripening stages. According to the outcome obtained from DPPH free radical-scavenging and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene/linoleic acid systems, the antioxidant activity was found to be varied related to the amount of the phenolic components [
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86</a>]. Another antioxidant activity study revealed that during dehydration, different air-drying temperature affected the antioxidant effect of the 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> by-products, including peel and pulp remaining after juice extraction [
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">79</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peel and juice were suggested as a new potential source of natural antioxidants; although, they were found to be less effective than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and ascorbic acid, used as antioxidant standards [
  <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">87</a>, 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">88</a>]. Anti-inflammatory activity of the flavonoid-type compounds of Korean 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>, namely, nobiletin, naringin, and hesperidin was investigated. Inhibition of proinflammatory mediators by blocking nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ƘB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages was assessed [
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">89</a>]. The flavonoids were found to have the capacity to suppress the mRNA and protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS, by clarifying their anti-inflammatory action [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. A polymethoxy flavonoid-rich 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract was shown to have a protective effect on alcohol-induced liver injury in an animal study via AMPK and Nrf2-related signal regulation [
