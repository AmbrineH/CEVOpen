 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The anticancer activity of the plant has been reported in literature [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>, 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>]. Cytotoxic properties of the polysaccharides obtained from 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> were examined. Cytotoxic activity on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and lung cancer cells (HCC827) and immune-enhancement effect were examined. The results indicated that 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">amara</span> polysaccharides displayed good immune-enhancement activity by stimulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-
  <span class="italic">α</span> (TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span>) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in RAW264.7 cells and by promoting the mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span>, interleukin-1
  <span class="italic">β</span> (IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span>), and IL-6. Moreover, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated p38, and phosphorylated p65 were significantly enhanced in 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> var 
  <span class="italic">amara</span> polysaccharides-treated RAW264.7 cells [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>]. Isolimonic acid and ichanexic acid from ethyl acetate extract of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> were isolated by using chromatographic methods. The compounds for their inhibitory action on human colon cancer cells (HT-29) proliferation, apoptosis, and on noncancerous (COS-1 fibroblast) cells were investigated. The compounds displayed an increment in the cell counts in G2/M stage, demonstrating a potential effect in the cell-cycle arrest [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Protective activity of the extract obtained from the peels of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> against apoptosis in cholestatic liver fibrosis-induced mice was investigated. As part of the experiment, cholestatic liver injury was induced by bile duct ligation and the mice were treated with 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peel extract. According to the histopathological analysis, the administration of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> peel extract significantly decreased liver fibrosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that the extract reduced the concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), suggesting 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> can efficiently regulate bile duct ligation-induced liver injury by displaying antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects [

  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> was shown to possess antimetastasis activities in 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> assays. A study by Park et al. evaluated the antimetastatic effect of flavonoids, isolated from Korean 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> in mice models. Flavonoids were shown to prevent cancer cell infiltration and localization to the lungs. Moreover, through the regulation of caspase-3 and phospho-p53, the flavonoids induced cancer cell apoptosis. 
  <span class="italic">In vitro</span> tests demonstrated that flavonoids inhibited A549 cells metastasis and induced apoptosis and downregulation of the Ddx3x and ANP43B proteins, supporting the use of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> flavonoids in human lung cancer treatment. According to the bioactivity assays conducted on the major compounds of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">amara</span>, namely, 5-hydroxy-6,7,30,40-tetramethoxyflavone (HTF) and limonexic acid (LA), both compounds showed remarkable antioxidant effects and notable inhibitory action on the B16 and SMCC-7721 cell lines, at a concentration between 6.25 and 50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL and between 12.5 and 200 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL, respectively [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Miyazawa et al. [
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>] isolated three polymethoxy flavonoid-type compounds, namely, tetra-
  <span class="italic">O</span>-methylscutellarein, sinensetin, and nobiletin from 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>. These compounds caused marked downstream regulation of a variety of gene expressions and thus showed strong antimutagenic activity. Wang and coworkers [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>] summarized the anticancer effects of polymethoxyflavones with detailed molecular mechanisms. The various amines and flavonoids have been quantitatively analyzed in

  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>]. It displayed a significant apoptotic effect against liver cell lines, HepG2 cells, by mediating through the upstream regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 [
