 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cardiovascular toxicity of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extracts with different concentrations of protoalkaloid 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine (4 and 6%) was reported by Calapai et al. in 1999 in rats. Authors showed an antiobesity effect by the administration of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> but also possible cardiovascular toxicity. The cardiovascular effects have not been confirmed by studies using much higher doses of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine [
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another study was carried out to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of different doses of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> and pure 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine in rats. 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract and pure 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine enhanced the heart rate and blood pressure. Higher activities were obtained with 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract than 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine, suggesting that other compounds in the extract can alter physiological parameters [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. The effect of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine on heart rate and blood pressure in female Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed. During 28 days, two types of extracts, one of which contained 6% and other 95% 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine, were administered daily by gavage at 10 or 50 mg/kg, doses for a 60 kg human equal to 600 and 3000 mg/kg. The outcome of the study showed that both 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine and 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract resulted in clinically insignificant increases in heart rate and blood pressure at doses many times greater than used in humans. 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-Synephrine and bitter orange extract exhibited little or no effect on the cardiovascular effects of caffeine [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Safety of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine was investigated by Ratamess et al. [
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>] on humans, animals, and 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span>. Authors reported over 30 human studies indicating that the cardiovascular effects of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine and bitter orange extracts are clinically insignificant. 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-Synephrine showed a greater ability to bind adrenergic receptors in rodents than in humans, and the data in literature on its effects on animals cannot be indicative for men at commonly used doses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review concluded that 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> extract and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine are safe for use in dietary supplements and foods at commonly used doses. Also, other authors reported similar conclusions [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>]. While 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine alone seems to have low toxicity, when it is formulated in combination with other ingredients such as caffeine (
  <span class="italic">Paullinia cupana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cola nitida</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cola acuminata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Camellia sinensis</span>), salicin (
  <span class="italic">Salix</span> sp.), and ephedrine (ma huang, 
  <span class="italic">Ephedra sinica</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Ephedra</span> sp.) in weight loss products, the mixture could induce some cardiovascular effects. However, the study did not demonstrate that 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine contributed to cardiovascular effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Schmitt et al. [
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">69</a>] reported clear signs of toxicity of this mixture in mice of both sexes as reduction in locomotor activity, ptosis, seizures, salivation, agitation, piloerection, and deaths after acute oral administration of 300, 350, and 400 mg/kg total of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-synephrine, ephedrine, salicin, plus caffeine in a 10 : 4 : 6 : 80 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span> ratio.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volatile oil obtained from the flowers of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">amara</span>, namely, neroli oil, is used to reduce heart rate and palpitations, to encourage sleep, and to soothe the digestive tract. Kang et al. [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>] investigated the activity mechanism of neroli in mouse aorta. Neroli was found to exert vasodilator activity in mice precontracted with prostaglandin (PG)-F2
  <span class="italic">α</span>. Nevertheless, the relaxation was reduced in the endothelium-denuded ring or preincubation with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor by neroli treatment. Moreover, the relaxation induced by neroli was partially reversed by soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Neroli also inhibited extracellular Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>-dependent and depolarization-induced contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Nonselective cation channel blocker, Ni
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, decreased neroli-induced relaxation. On the other hand, a K
  <span class="sup">+</span> channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride, did not alter the relaxation. In order to prevent Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> influx through the smooth muscle voltage-gated Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> channels, verapamil was added. In this case, the ryanodine (a class of intracellular calcium channels) receptor inhibitor reduced neroli-induced relaxation. All these data indicated that neroli-induced relaxation might be partly mediated by the nitric oxide-soluble guanylyl cyclase, and ryanodine receptor signaling pathway [
