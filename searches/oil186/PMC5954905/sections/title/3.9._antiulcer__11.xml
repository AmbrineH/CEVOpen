 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the effect of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil and its main compound limonene on gastric mucosa, Moraes et al. [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>] conducted a study 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. The essential oil and its compound limonene were found to possess protective activity in the gastrointestinal system against lesions, which were induced by ethanol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in rats, at doses of 250 mg/kg and 245 mg/kg, respectively. The essential oil and limonene increased the production of gastric mucus. The findings revealed that 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil and its main compound limonene can be used as a promising target for the development of a novel gastroprotective drug [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. In another study, the gastroprotective effect of 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-myrcene, a monoterpene-type compound of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>, was evaluated. Experimental models of ulcer, induced by ethanol, NSAID stress, 
  <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span>, ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R), and cysteamine (a drug used to treat cystinosis) was used to assess the ameliorative activity. 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-Myrcene was administered at dose of 7.5 mg/kg. The results showed a potential role for 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-myrcene against peptic ulcer disease. 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-Myrcene contributed to the maintenance of integrity of the gastric mucosa with a significant decrease of ulcerative lesions, attenuating lipid peroxidative damage and preventing depletion of GSH, GR, and GPx [
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">91</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polo et al. confirmed the healing properties of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span> essential oil on gastric ulcers after treatment in middle-aged Wistar rats. They showed a significant reduction of the lesion area (76%) within the gastric mucosa that appears regenerated (59%) when compared to the negative control group [
  <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">92</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, Hamdan et al. assessed the effects of hesperidin and neohesperidin, important flavonoid-type components of 
  <span class="italic">C. aurantium</span>. For this purpose, indomethacin-induced ulcer models of rats were used. Omeprazole was administered as a reference standard for the comparison. The parameters analyzed in the present study were ulcer index, gastric cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression, TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span>, MDA, and GSH levels. Histopathalogical analysis was also performed. The findings of the study revealed that hesperidin and neohesperidin notably aggravated indomethacin-induced gastric damage as evidenced by increased ulcer index and histopathological alteration [
  <a rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93">93</a>]. Recently, hesperidin showed strong inhibition against ovarian cancer cell viability and caused apoptosis mediated through endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways [
  <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">94</a>]. Hafidh et al. [
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">95</a>] observed the potent anticancer effects of limonene in hepatocellular carcinoma and HepG2, and the cell line caused the modulation of cancer-inducing genes. These data confirmed the antioxidant and prooxidant behavior of flavonoids showing the potential benefits and adverse effects of these opposing events.
