<p>Stabilized liver tissue samples (20 mg) were extracted for total cellular RNA using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was examined spectrophotometrically using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to estimate the RNA concentration and purity. Total RNA was used as a template for one-step PCR using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). The RT-PCR mixtures contained 5 μL of 2x QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Mastermix, 0.4 μL of QuantiTect RT Mix (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), 0.3 μL of each forward and reverse primer (0.3 μM), and 1 μL of RNA template. The total RNA was diluted one hundred-fold to reduce possible inhibitory effects, and each reaction contained approximately 10–20 ng of RNA. The total volume was brought to 10 μL per reaction with an appropriate amount of RNase-free distilled water. The QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit contained ROX as a passive reference dye. Real-time PCR and data analysis were performed on 384-well plates using a 7900HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50°C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 15 min and 40 PCR cycles with denaturing at 94°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72°C for 15 seconds. Each sample was measured in triplicate. After PCR amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed. The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used: beta actin (BACT, used as an internal control in all reactions,

(Hradec Králové, Czech Republic), and the QuantiTect Primer Assays were purchased from Dynex Ltd. (Buštěhrad, Czech Republic). The 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method was used for the quantification of all gene expression relative to internal control levels.
