<p>The experiment was conducted on 240-day-old Ross 308 cockerels. The chickens were randomly allocated to four groups of 60 birds each and housed in pens (2 x 1.1 m) on wood shavings, with 20 chickens per pen. The experimental room was provided with gas heating and ventilation with a temperature-controlled fan. Each pen was equipped with 7 nipple drinkers, 3 pan feeders and a feed hopper. The temperature in the room at arrival was 32°C and gradually decreased to 20°C as the birds reached 28 days of age. The light cycle consisted of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness. In the 1
 <sup>st</sup> group (control), the fat supplement was substituted with wheat starch. The following fat sources were used: rapeseed oil (2
 <sup>nd</sup> group), lard (3
 <sup>rd</sup> group), and palm oil (4
 <sup>th</sup> group). Rapeseed oil and refined palm oil were supplied by Fabio Produkt, Ltd. (Jičín, Czech Republic), and lard was purchased from a local shop. All supplements were added at 60 g/kg diet. Chromic oxide was mixed with the diets at 3.0 g/kg and used to measure the ileal digestibility of fatty acids. The chickens were fed one type of diet from the start to the end of the experiment (days 1–28 of age); the diets differed in the source of fat.

 <sup>st</sup> to 28
 <sup>th</sup> day of chicken life.
