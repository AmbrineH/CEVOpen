<p>The breast meat of chickens fed a diet supplemented with starch contained significantly less dry matter and crude protein than the meat of broilers fed diets supplemented with lard and palm oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196035.t005">Table 5</xref>). The concentration of fat in the breast meat of chickens was not significantly influenced by the composition of the diet. The profiles of FAs in the breast meat were different in all treatment groups of chickens. The highest content of unsaturated FAs was present in the meat of chickens fed rapeseed oil, whereas the highest content of SFAs was in the meat of chickens fed a diet supplemented with palm oil. Palmitic acid was the most abundant FA in the meat of chickens fed diets supplemented with lard and palm oil. In the breast meat of chickens fed rapeseed oil, oleic acid was the predominant FA. Rapeseed oil significantly increased the content of FAs containing 20 carbon atoms in the chain, i.e., arachidic, eicosenoic, eicosadienic and arachidonic acids. Oleic acid was the most abundant FA in the abdominal fat of all chickens (
