<p>The ileal digestibility of fat in chickens fed a diet supplemented with wheat starch was significantly lower than that in chickens fed diets supplemented with rapeseed oil, lard and palm oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196035.t004">Table 4</xref>). The highest ileal digestibility of all FAs (except stearic acid), SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs was observed in chickens fed lard. Among the individual FAs, very high ileal digestibilities (&gt;90%) were found for linoleic, Î±-linolenic and eicosadienic acid in chickens fed lard. The ileal digestibilities of lauric, palmitic, arachidic and arachidonic acid were not significantly different.
