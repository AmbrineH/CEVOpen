<p class="p">The source of fat in the diet did not influence the performance characteristics of the chickens. The average weight of the chickens in each group at the end of the experiment ranged from 1859 to 1895 g, and the average feed intake per chicken per day ranged from 88.5 to 91.7 g. The FA profiles of rapeseed oil, lard and palm oil are shown in

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196035.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> presents the FA concentrations in the chicken diets. The highest concentrations of unsaturated FAs (both MUFAs and PUFAs) were present in the diet supplemented with rapeseed oil. In contrast, the highest concentration of SFAs was present in the diet supplemented with palm oil.
