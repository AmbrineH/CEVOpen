<p class="p">Supplemental fats are often used to increase dietary energy density to meet the requirements of fast-growing broiler chickens. Different fats and oils are usable in poultry nutrition: tallow, lard, palm fats and oils, vegetable oils, by-products of oil refining, and recovered frying oils [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Fats and oils contain fat-soluble vitamins, supply essential fatty acids, improve the palatability of feed, and reduce friction in feed mills. The major component of fats and oils is fatty acids (FAs). Fats and oils vary in their FA composition. The metabolism of fats depends primarily on the fatty acid (FA) profile. Tancharoenrat et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] showed that unsaturated FAs were well digested in the lower ileum irrespective of the source of fat. The digestibility of saturated FAs (palmitic and stearic) was higher in a diet containing soybean oil (50 g/kg) than in a diet containing tallow (50 g/kg). A significant proportion of synthesized and absorbed saturated FAs (SFAs) are desaturated in tissues by desaturases to monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs). Fatty acid synthase produces saturated fatty acids (palmitate, stearate). Fatty acids are elongated and desaturated by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. For example, the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleyl-CoA is catalysed by a complex of three membrane-bound proteins:

 </disp-formula> A variety of unsaturated fatty acids can be formed from oleate by a combination of elongation and desaturation reactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Kouba and Mourot (1998) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] showed that polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in the diet inhibited stearoyl-Δ9-desaturase in the liver, resulting in reduced conversion of SFAs to MUFAs. Increasing the content of linoleic acid (C 18:2) in the diet and in the hepatic tissue of broiler chickens decreased the desaturation of SFAs to MUFAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The FA profile of different tissues reflects the dietary FA profile [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Moreover, the partitioning of absorbed FAs is different in MUFAs and PUFAs. In chickens fed diets supplemented with four types of fat, MUFAs were higher in abdominal fat, whereas PUFAs were higher in muscle lipids [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Crespo and Esteve-Garcia (2002) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] reported that broilers fed diets enriched with PUFAs deposited less abdominal and body fat than those fed SFAs or MUFAs, mainly due to the higher oxidation rate of PUFAs. The metabolism of FAs in birds and mammals is different. In mammals, most 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesis of FAs occurs in adipose tissue, whereas in birds, most of the fat that is deposited in adipose tissue originates from lipid synthesis in the liver [
