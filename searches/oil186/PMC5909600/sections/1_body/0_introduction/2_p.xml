<p>Rapeseed oil, animal fat, and palm fat are commonly added to feed mixtures for poultry. The public consumer is increasingly protesting against palm fat addition. The reasons are both ecological, in relation to the decline of forests, and nutritional, due to the high content of saturated fatty acids in palm fat. Pork lard also has a higher content of saturated fatty acids such as palm fat. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to compare the effect of different sources of fat on 1) the apparent ileal digestibility of fat and FAs, 2) the FA profiles of lipids in breast muscle and abdominal fat, 3) the mRNA expression of several lipid-related hepatic genes in broiler chickens.</p>
