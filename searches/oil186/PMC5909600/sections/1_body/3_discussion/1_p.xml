<p>The ileal digestibility of fat was low in chickens fed a diet without fat supplements. The reason for this low digestibility may be the low fat content in this diet. Because, the level of fat in the diet could be in proportion to the secretion of bile, which is involved in fat digestion. Tancharoenrat et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that unsaturated FAs were well digested irrespective of the source of fat. These authors found that the ileal digestibility of palmitic and stearic acids was higher in a diet containing soybean oil than in a diet containing tallow. In the present experiment, the ileal digestibility of all FAs (except stearic acid) was higher in chickens fed a diet enriched with lard than in chickens fed rapeseed or palm oil. The lowest ileal digestibilities of SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, and ten out of twelve FAs were found in chickens fed a diet supplemented with palm oil, which is consistent with the results of Tancharoenrat et al. (2014) [
