<p>Carnitine palmitoyltransferase is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the transfer of activated FAs inside the mitochondria for Î²-oxidation. Literature data regarding the dietary effects on carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity are ambiguous. Smink et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that the hepatic activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase were similar in chickens fed diets supplemented with sunflower oil or palm oil. Sanz et al. (2000) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however, found that the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase was higher in heart extracts of chickens fed a diet enriched with sunflower oil than in chickens fed a diet containing tallow. Preferential oxidation of PUFAs over SFAs in chickens was reported by Newman et al. (2002) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study, the mRNA expression of this enzyme was low in the livers of chickens fed a diet supplemented with lard and high in the livers of chickens fed diets supplemented with rapeseed oil or palm oil.
