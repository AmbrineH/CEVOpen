<p>Evaluating the relationship between biochemical parameters and mRNA levels is one way to evaluate the relevance of gene expression data. Musa et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] noticed that mRNA levels do not always correlate with the amount of functional protein produced. In our study, the high content of SFAs in palm oil was consistent with the high expression of mRNA from all hepatic desaturases. Delta-9 desaturase converts stearic acid to oleic acid, which is required for the synthesis of cell membranes [

 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Delta-5 and Î”-6 desaturases are the rate-limiting enzymes and are crucial in PUFA-related pathways [
