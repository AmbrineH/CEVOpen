<p>Sanz et al. (2000) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that the activity of FA synthase in the liver of chickens fed a sunflower oil-enriched diet was lower than the same activity in chickens fed a tallow-enriched diet. Dietary PUFAs apparently inhibit 
 <italic>de novo</italic> FA synthesis. This is consistent with the results obtained in our experiment. The expression of FA synthase mRNA was higher in chickens fed palm oil or lard than in those fed rapeseed oil. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Its expression was higher in chickens fed a diet supplemented with palm oil or lard. This observation is consistent with the finding that the substitution of rapeseed oil for lard significantly decreased the cholesterol concentration in chicken breast muscle [
