 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ileal digestibility of fat was low in chickens fed a diet without fat supplements. The reason for this low digestibility may be the low fat content in this diet. Because, the level of fat in the diet could be in proportion to the secretion of bile, which is involved in fat digestion. Tancharoenrat et al. (2014) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref002">2</a>] reported that unsaturated FAs were well digested irrespective of the source of fat. These authors found that the ileal digestibility of palmitic and stearic acids was higher in a diet containing soybean oil than in a diet containing tallow. In the present experiment, the ileal digestibility of all FAs (except stearic acid) was higher in chickens fed a diet enriched with lard than in chickens fed rapeseed or palm oil. The lowest ileal digestibilities of SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, and ten out of twelve FAs were found in chickens fed a diet supplemented with palm oil, which is consistent with the results of Tancharoenrat et al. (2014) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no direct relationship between the FA digestibility and FA profile in tissues. The FA profile in breast meat was primarily affected by the FA profile of the feed. In abdominal fat, MUFAs dominated in all groups of chickens. This dominance may be related to the difference between structural and depot lipids [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref018">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both breast meat and abdominal fat are edible parts of the chicken body. Information on the effects of FAs on human health is extensive [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref021">21</a>]. Numerous studies have shown that dietary FAs strongly influence the tissue FA composition [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref018">18</a>]. As expected, the FA profiles in the breast meat and abdominal fat reflected the FA composition of the fat supplement. The effect of rapeseed oil, which is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, on the content of unsaturated FAs in the breast meat was more pronounced than that of lard and palm oil. The concentrations of linoleic and arachidonic acids were highly correlated (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.908; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a significant conversion of linoleic acid by Δ6-desaturase. This result also suggests a significant activity of FA elongase because the addition of two carbons was also necessary.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In chickens fed lard or palm oil, the relative proportions of PUFAs were 15–16% of the total FAs, which was less than that in the respective diets (24 and 22%). Oleic acid dominated the lipids deposited in the bodies of all chickens. This dominance may be related to the fact that the oleic acid content in tissue lipids depends not only on the oleic acid intake but also on 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> synthesis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating the relationship between biochemical parameters and mRNA levels is one way to evaluate the relevance of gene expression data. Musa et al. (2007) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref022">22</a>] noticed that mRNA levels do not always correlate with the amount of functional protein produced. In our study, the high content of SFAs in palm oil was consistent with the high expression of mRNA from all hepatic desaturases. Delta-9 desaturase converts stearic acid to oleic acid, which is required for the synthesis of cell membranes [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref003">3</a>]. Chickens desaturate SFAs to prevent a decrease in the unsaturated FA/SFA ratio below a certain level [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref023">23</a>]. Delta-5 and Δ-6 desaturases are the rate-limiting enzymes and are crucial in PUFA-related pathways [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref024">24</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sanz et al. (2000) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref025">25</a>] reported that the activity of FA synthase in the liver of chickens fed a sunflower oil-enriched diet was lower than the same activity in chickens fed a tallow-enriched diet. Dietary PUFAs apparently inhibit 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> FA synthesis. This is consistent with the results obtained in our experiment. The expression of FA synthase mRNA was higher in chickens fed palm oil or lard than in those fed rapeseed oil. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Its expression was higher in chickens fed a diet supplemented with palm oil or lard. This observation is consistent with the finding that the substitution of rapeseed oil for lard significantly decreased the cholesterol concentration in chicken breast muscle [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carnitine palmitoyltransferase is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the transfer of activated FAs inside the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Literature data regarding the dietary effects on carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity are ambiguous. Smink et al. (2010) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref005">5</a>] reported that the hepatic activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase were similar in chickens fed diets supplemented with sunflower oil or palm oil. Sanz et al. (2000) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref025">25</a>], however, found that the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase was higher in heart extracts of chickens fed a diet enriched with sunflower oil than in chickens fed a diet containing tallow. Preferential oxidation of PUFAs over SFAs in chickens was reported by Newman et al. (2002) [
  <a rid="pone.0196035.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196035.ref026">26</a>]. In our study, the mRNA expression of this enzyme was low in the livers of chickens fed a diet supplemented with lard and high in the livers of chickens fed diets supplemented with rapeseed oil or palm oil.
