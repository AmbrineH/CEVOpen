 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we investigated the effect of OEO against CUS-induced depression, using FST and SPT. The CUS animal model has good validity and seems to represent unpredictable pressure faced by people every day. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposing rodents to unpredictable stress procedures that use different stressors, 1-2 times a day for 7-54 days leads to a behavioral model of long-term human stress exposure (

  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>). The current study found that after exposure to 10 days of unpredictable stress, the animals develop variety of symptoms similar to symptoms of human suffering from depression. According to these data, CUS induced depression like behavior as it is evident from increased immobility time in the FST and significant drop of sucrose preference and weight loss. The FST and SPT have widely been utilized to assess depression-like behavior (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our results, 24 days chronic unpredictable stress exposure up regulates TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA expression levels both at the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the male rats. Although there is some positive correlation between mRNA and protein expression, a combination of genomic and proteomic experiments leads to definite results. There is increasing attention to TLRS due to their potential role in neuropsychiatric disease.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibility that TLR is also involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders is supported by the results of recent studies (
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>). The findings of the present study support evidence of the important role of TLR4 in stress-induced depression. To our knowledge, direct evaluation of TLR-expression changes have been done by a few studies in the context of depression. In animal studies, lack of TLR4 is associated with the reduction of alcohol withdrawal-related anxiety behaviors (
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>). However, further investigations are still needed, to provide more evidence on the association between TLR gene expression and chronic stress induced disorders. Recently several studies have focused trying to link TLR with neuropathology. McKernan, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. demonstrated that there are specific alterations in TLR2 and TLR4 activation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>). In a recent report by Wu, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., it was suggested that anxiety has a significant association with peripheral TLR4 mRNA expression (
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>). Preclinical studies also indicate that TLR4 expression has witnessed a rise in the prefrontal cortex in a stress-based model of depression (
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a>). Besides alterations in the central nervous system expression, changed peripheral expression of TLRs appears to be closely connected with depression and is perhaps responsible for the heightened inflammatory state (
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altogether, the findings of our study suggest that the OEO possesses an antidepressant-like activity and reversed behavioral alterations observed in the CUS model. A previous study has demonstrated that the oregano extract inhibits the reuptake and degradation of the monoamine neuro-transmitters in a dose-dependent manner (
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a>). In the present study, we attempted to find out whether OEO can reduce the stress-induced expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In spite of the antidepressant-like activity, stress-induced TLR- 2/4 upregulation is not prevented by the chronic OEO treatments. We did not find any remarkable effect of oregano on the stress up regulated TLR2/4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of oregano on the chronic stress induced TLR gene expression in the nervous system. However, further investigations needed to provide more evidence on the mechanism of OEO effect on stress induced depressive like behavior and neuroinflammation.
