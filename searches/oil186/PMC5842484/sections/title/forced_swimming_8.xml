 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The method described by Porsolt, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. was used in our study (
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>). Briefly, rats were forced to swim individually in a cylindrical glass container (70 cm height, 30 cm diameter), which contained tap water (25 ± 1 °C) to a depth 30 cm. The animals were individually allowed to swim for 15 min in the swim tank and after the test; rats were dried with a towel and returned to their home cages. After 24 h, same procedure was followed to conduct the test swim session for 5 min. The test sessions were recorded and scored by an observer who was blind to the groups of animals. The total duration of immobility during the first 5 min of the swimming session was recorded at 1, 10, and 25 days. The rat was judged to be immobile when it made only the necessary movements to keep its head above water level.
