 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>, the mean of baseline sucrose preference index was 76.2 %. Chronic unpredictable stress procedure caused a significant drop of sucrose preference. During the CUS procedure, significant decrease was observed on day 10 compared to the baseline (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). After the administration of OEO for two weeks, the sucrose preferences of the CUS + OEO group was significantly higher than those of the CUS group (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, treatment with fluoxetine and diazepam also significantly increased the percentage of sucrose consumption as compared to the CUS group (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Treatment with saline for two weeks did not affect sucrose preference index. In CUS + saline group the sucrose preference was significantly lower than the baseline (
