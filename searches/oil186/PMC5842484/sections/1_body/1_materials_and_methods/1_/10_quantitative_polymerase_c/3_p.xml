 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The amount of PCR products were normalized with HKG primers in separate reactions. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Linearity and efficiency of PCR amplification were assessed using standard curves generated by decreasing amount of cDNA, using five points, diluted over a twofold range. In qPCR, the relative mRNA levels were calculated by the expression 2-ΔΔCT (
