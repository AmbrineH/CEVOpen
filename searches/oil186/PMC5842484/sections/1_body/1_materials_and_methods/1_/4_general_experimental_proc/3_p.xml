<p class="p">Chronic unpredictable stress has influence on animal behavior. Here, we examined the depressive like behavior using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in rat CUS model. Before the start of the CUS protocol the animals were tested with the FST and SPT to determine the animalsâ€™ depressive state (baseline, 1 day). In the period of CUS exposure (10 days) depressive like behavior was evaluated using SPT and FST as well. At the end of treatments (25 days), anti-depressive effects of different drugs were evaluated using SPT and FST. The weights of rats were determined in parallel with behavioral tests at 1, 10, and 25 days.</p>
