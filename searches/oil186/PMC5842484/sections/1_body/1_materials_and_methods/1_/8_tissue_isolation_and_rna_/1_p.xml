<p>The animals were decapitated 24 h after the last treatment. Their hippocampus and prefrontal were quickly removed and were frozen on dry ice. They were kept at -80 °C until the use. Total RNA was extracted from prefrontal cortex and hippocampus tissues (6 brain tissue samples from each group, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) by the Trizol method total RNA was treated with DNase (RNase-free DNase, Roche, Manheim, Germany). The purification of RNA (A260/A280 ratio was ≥ 1.9) was determined according to OD 260/280 ratio by a spectro-photometer (Sigma, Germany). The integrity of RNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (Sigma, Germany). Total RNA was stored at -80 °C until further analysis.
