<p>The rats were individually housed in a cage and given two bottles of 1% w/v sucrose solution 72 h before the test. After 24 h, 1% sucrose in one bottle was replaced with tap water for next 24 h. After adaptation period, the animals were deprived from food and water for 24 h and sucrose preference was determined by 1 h exposure to two identical bottles filled with either sucrose solution or water. Sucrose preference was defined as the ratio of the volume of sucrose
