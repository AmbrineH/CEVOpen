<p class="p">Altogether, the findings of our study suggest that the OEO possesses an antidepressant-like activity and reversed behavioral alterations observed in the CUS model. A previous study has demonstrated that the oregano extract inhibits the reuptake and degradation of the monoamine neuro-transmitters in a dose-dependent manner (

In the present study, we attempted to find out whether OEO can reduce the stress-induced expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In spite of the antidepressant-like activity, stress-induced TLR- 2/4 upregulation is not prevented by the chronic OEO treatments. We did not find any remarkable effect of oregano on the stress up regulated TLR2/4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of oregano on the chronic stress induced TLR gene expression in the nervous system. However, further investigations needed to provide more evidence on the mechanism of OEO effect on stress induced depressive like behavior and neuroinflammation.
