<p>In this study, we investigated the effect of OEO against CUS-induced depression, using FST and SPT. The CUS animal model has good validity and seems to represent unpredictable pressure faced by people every day. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposing rodents to unpredictable stress procedures that use different stressors, 1-2 times a day for 7-54 days leads to a behavioral model of long-term human stress exposure (

The current study found that after exposure to 10 days of unpredictable stress, the animals develop variety of symptoms similar to symptoms of human suffering from depression. According to these data, CUS induced depression like behavior as it is evident from increased immobility time in the FST and significant drop of sucrose preference and weight loss. The FST and SPT have widely been utilized to assess depression-like behavior (
