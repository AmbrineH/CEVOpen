<p>The possibility that TLR is also involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders is supported by the results of recent studies (

To our knowledge, direct evaluation of TLR-expression changes have been done by a few studies in the context of depression. In animal studies, lack of TLR4 is associated with the reduction of alcohol withdrawal-related anxiety behaviors (

 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that there are specific alterations in TLR2 and TLR4 activation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (

 <italic>et al</italic>., it was suggested that anxiety has a significant association with peripheral TLR4 mRNA expression (
