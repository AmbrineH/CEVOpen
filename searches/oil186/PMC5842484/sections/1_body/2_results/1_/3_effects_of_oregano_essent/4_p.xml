<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, the mean of baseline sucrose preference index was 76.2 %. Chronic unpredictable stress procedure caused a significant drop of sucrose preference. During the CUS procedure, significant decrease was observed on day 10 compared to the baseline (
