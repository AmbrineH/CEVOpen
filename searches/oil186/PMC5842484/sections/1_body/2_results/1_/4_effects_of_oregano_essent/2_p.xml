<p>As it is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> a higher levels of TLR2 mRNA was seen in the CUS group compared to control rats in the prefrontal and hippocampus (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the hippocampus and prefrontal, the chronic stress induced increases in the TLR2 mRNA levels were not reversed by administration of OEO. Thus, there was no difference in the TLR2 mRNA expression levels between rats treated with CUS + OEO and the CUS group. A significant difference was observed between CUS + OEO group compared to control group in hippocampus (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and in prefrontal cortex (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
