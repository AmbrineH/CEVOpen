<p>TLR2, TLR4, and GAPDH mRNA amplified and quantitatively detected by the SYBR green I real-time PCR. Melting curve analysis demonstrated that each primer pairs amplified a single product with a distinct melting temperature as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. Also, all primer pairs produced a single band of the expected size on agarose gel electrophoresis including TLR2, 182; TLR4, 419 and 392 bp for GAPDH; as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>. There were no significant differences between molecular data in saline (control) and intact animal groups (data not shown). Therefore, the data from these two groups were averaged and used as the control (saline) group.
