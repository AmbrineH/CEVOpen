<p>The identification of active components such as thymol and carvacrol from oregano that have been shown to induce anti-anxiety effects and other bioactive polyphenols, prompted us to assess the antidepressant potential of oregano essential oil. To the best of our knowledge, the antidepressant effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) have not been fully investigated. In this present study, the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to further elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of oregano. In the (CUS) model (

Furthermore, since the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are critical for stress (
