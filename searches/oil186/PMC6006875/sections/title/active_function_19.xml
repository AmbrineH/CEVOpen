 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herbal antifungal agents have been shown to contain active phytochemicals that are responsible for their activity against fungal pathogens. We analyzed our experimental herb 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> using IR spectroscopy to identify the active functional group present in it. It was observed that 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> contained a compound which had a similar chemical structure like carvacrol (C
  <sub>6</sub>H
  <sub>3</sub> CH
  <sub>3</sub> (OH) (C
  <sub>3</sub>H
  <sub>7</sub>)). The peaks in the spectrum showed OH, CH, and C = C groups indicating carvacrol[
