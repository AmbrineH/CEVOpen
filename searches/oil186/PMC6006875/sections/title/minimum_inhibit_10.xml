 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A pure culture of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp. was grown in Sabouraud Dextrose Broth. The optical density of planktonic suspension of each culture was adjusted to 1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/ml (McFarland 0.5 standard). A known concentration of the essential oil was serially diluted to two folds in sterile test tubes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the experimental agent was diluted, a volume of the standardized inoculum equal to the volume of the diluted antimicrobial agent was added to each dilution tube, bringing the microbial concentration to approximately 500,000 cells/ml. Two control tubes were also included, one tube containing only the candidal culture which served as the positive control and other tube containing undiluted oil and the fungal culture which served as the negative control.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inoculated, serially diluted extract was incubated aerobically for 37°C for 18 h.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After incubation, the series of dilution tubes were observed for microbial growth, indicated by turbidity and/or a pellet of microorganisms in the bottom of the vessel. The last tube in the dilution series that did not demonstrate growth corresponds with the MIC of the antimicrobial agent. The MIC endpoint is the lowest concentration of the oil at which there is no visible growth in the tubes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The test tubes demonstrating no visible turbidity were subcultured to solid agar plates and MFC was determined by comparing the growth with the positive control. The MFC endpoint is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that kills &gt;99.9% of the initial fungal population where no visible growth of the fungi was observed on the SDA plates. The tests were repeated in triplicates.</p>
