 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antifungal activity of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was determined by agar diffusion test. Modified Kirby–Baeur method was used. SDA plates were prepared according to the CLSI guidelines.[
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] These plates were then inoculated within 15 min of the preparation of the suspension so that the density does not change. The medium was inoculated by even streaking with the help of a sterile cotton wool swab.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six-millimeter wells were punched out on agar. These wells were then inoculated with 20 μl of the test material. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C aerobically. After the incubation period, plates were removed and zones of inhibition were recorded.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diameter of zone of inhibition was measured to the nearest millimeter with a thin transparent millimeter scale. Nystatin (HiMedia, Mumbai), a proven antifungal agent, was taken as the control for the test material.</p>
