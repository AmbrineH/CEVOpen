 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agar well diffusion method was used to confirm the antifungal activity of the experimental herb. Authenticity of the test material was confirmed, as zone of inhibition was found to be 30 mm as compared to 22 mm of presently known antifungal agent nystatin.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results were tabulated and statistically analyzed using analysis of variance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of the extracts from maceration technique showed zone of inhibition equivalent to zone of inhibition obtained through essential oil from hydrodistillation method (&gt;30 mm). However, ethanol extract was the nearest and was efficient against only two species of 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span>, that is, 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, (10 mm) and 
  <span class="italic">C. tropicalis</span> (14 mm). Ether (8 mm) and chloroform (10 mm) were effective only against 
  <span class="italic">C. tropicalis</span>. n-butanol and methanol extracts were not effective against any 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> spp.
