 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity of the experimental herb 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was confirmed by comparing it with the known antifungal agent like nystatin. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out using agar well diffusion method. Antifungal activity showed zone of inhibition as 30 mm for 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> as compared to 22 mm for nystatin. This observation proved that the experimental herb 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> is antifungal in nature and also it is superior in its activity when compared to nystatin. This result is in accordance with a similar study carried out by Stiles 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>] where they observed a zone of inhibition for nystatin as 22–25 mm and that for 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was 40–45 mm. However, their study was on 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> isolates that were obtained from human stools. Cleff 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>] studied the effect of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> against reference strains of Candida and found that all were susceptible to the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span>. Rosato 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a>] and Souza 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">26</a>] evaluated and observed that the essential oil 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> appeared to be effective, inhibiting all the 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species in their study.
