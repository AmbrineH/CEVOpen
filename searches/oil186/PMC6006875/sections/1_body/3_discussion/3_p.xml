<p>CADS is a form of oral candidiasis and a chronic inflammatory reaction of the oral mucosa in a denture-wearing patient. It is usually characterized by erythema and edema of the palatal area localized to denture bearing tissues causing discomfort in wearing prosthesis. Localized trauma from a poorly maintained, ill-fitting denture and/or allergy to the material used for the prosthesis are the most common reasons for the causation of CADS.[
