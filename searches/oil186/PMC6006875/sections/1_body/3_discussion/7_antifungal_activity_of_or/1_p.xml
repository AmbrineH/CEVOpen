<p>The antifungal activity of the experimental herb 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was confirmed by comparing it with the known antifungal agent like nystatin. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out using agar well diffusion method. Antifungal activity showed zone of inhibition as 30 mm for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> as compared to 22 mm for nystatin. This observation proved that the experimental herb 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> is antifungal in nature and also it is superior in its activity when compared to nystatin. This result is in accordance with a similar study carried out by Stiles 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] where they observed a zone of inhibition for nystatin as 22–25 mm and that for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was 40–45 mm. However, their study was on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> isolates that were obtained from human stools. Cleff 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studied the effect of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> against reference strains of Candida and found that all were susceptible to the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>. Rosato

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> appeared to be effective, inhibiting all the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species in their study.
