<p class="p">The antifungal activity of the experimental herb 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> was confirmed by comparing it with the known antifungal agent like nystatin. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out using agar well diffusion method. Antifungal activity showed zone of inhibition as 30 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> as compared to 22 mm for nystatin. This observation proved that the experimental herb 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> is antifungal in nature and also it is superior in its activity when compared to nystatin. This result is in accordance with a similar study carried out by Stiles 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.[

 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> was 40–45 mm. However, their study was on 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> isolates that were obtained from human stools. Cleff

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] studied the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> against reference strains of Candida and found that all were susceptible to the essential oil of
