<p class="p">We compared the MIC/MFC of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> with existing value for fluconazole (0.25%)[
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and it was observed that the MIC/MFC of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> (0.024% and 0.097%) was much lower. The MIC of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> (0.024%) which was determined in our study is in par with a study carried out by Hammer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,[
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] wherein it was found to be 0.03% against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. In a study by Xu 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,[
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] MIC of fluconazole was found to be 125 times more in azole-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> than in susceptible 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. The present experimental herb 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> showed much lesser MIC/MFC as compared to fluconazole indicating that the herb can be effective even in a lower dose of MIC/MFC. In a comparative study by Lambert 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,[
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] they also observed that 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> had a total inhibitory effect on the pathogens involved. However, their study was against bacteria and not the fungi affecting human beings.
