<p>After the antifungal action the essential oil was established, the research was continued to determine the MIC/MFC using serial dilution method. Serial dilution method for determination of MIC and MFC of the herbal oils have been implemented by Chitwood[
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Johnson (2008)[
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and it was found to be satisfactory to use in laboratories. Furthermore, according to the NCCLS standards, it is an efficient method to evaluate MIC/MFC of the antifungal agents.[
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In the present study, the MIC of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was found to be 0.024% and MFC was observed as 0.097% [

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the authors showed that 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> can be fungicidal on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> from mice with a MIC of 0.125% and MFC of 0.25%. In their study, they also observed that a daily dose of 1.0 Î¼l of
