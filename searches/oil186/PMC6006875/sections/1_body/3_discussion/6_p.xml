<p class="p">The herb 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> is rich in its antifungal activity which has been tried against clinical isolates from systemic diseases but never in oral isolates of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> from denture wearers. Hence, it is justified to explore its possible antifungal activities against the microorganisms causing the disease in the denture wearing section of the population. It is a novel study of its kind in the literature. In this study, the antifungal effects of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> were assessed and efficacy of different extraction procedures was compared. The MIC and MFC of the herb were determined and the active functional component present in it also was identified.
