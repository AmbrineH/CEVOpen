<p>Hence, in the present study, the hydrodistillation method was proved to be better than maceration method for this novel herb. The hydrodistillation method for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> has been found to affect the quantity and quality of the essential oil obtained.[

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> from hydrodistillation process showed better efficacy than extracts from maceration among 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species.
