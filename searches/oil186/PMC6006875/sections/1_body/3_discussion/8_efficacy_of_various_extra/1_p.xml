<p class="p">We compared essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> obtained through hydrodistillation and the various extracts obtained through maceration method. It was observed that the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation method was higher against the 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species included in this study (zone of inhibition 30 ± 6 mm) [
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>]. The extracts obtained through maceration technique did not show significant activity as compared to the essential oil. Among extracts, isolate of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> showed susceptibility to only chloroform extract (10 mm). 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> showed mild susceptibility to petrol ether (7–8 mm), ethanol (12–14 mm), and chloroform (9–10 mm). 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> did not show susceptibility to any of the extracts but was susceptible to the essential oil (36 ± 2 mm) [
