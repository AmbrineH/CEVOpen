<p>Speciation of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> from the clinical samples was done, and they were further subcultured on Sauboraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) twice to confirm pure isolation of the yeast. The different species of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> were first identified by Gram staining and later on confirmed by germ tube test, corn meal agar for chlamydospore formation and Chromagar, and other biochemical tests. Chrome 
 <italic>Candida</italic> differentiation agar was used to differentiate 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Chromagar for differentiation of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (Himedia, Mumbai, India) was prepared following manufacturer's instructions. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was differentiated as the colony exhibited light green color. Along with colonies of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, steel-/blue-colored colonies of 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> and light pink-colored colonies of 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> were observed and identified [
