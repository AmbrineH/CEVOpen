<p>The extract (70 g) was suspended in distilled water (1500 ml) and then extracted successively with petroleum ether (60°C–80°C, 8 × 500 ml), chloroform (8 × 500 ml), ethyl acetate (8 × 500 ml), n-butanol (8 × 500 ml), and methanol (8 × 500 ml). All the fractions were then washed with distilled water (30 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and freed of solvent by distillation. The ethanolic extract was thus fractionated into petroleum ether soluble extract (13 g), chloroform soluble extract (10 g), ethyl acetate soluble extract (7 g), n-butanol soluble extract (6 g), and methanol soluble extract (23 g).</p>
