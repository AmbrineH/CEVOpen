<p class="p">The shade-dried powdered leaves (1 kg) of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> were soaked in ethanol (95%) for 4 days. After 4 days, the ethanolic layer was decanted off. The process was repeated for four times. The solvent from the total extract was distilled off, and the concentrate was evaporated on a water bath to a syrupy consistency and then evaporated to dryness.
