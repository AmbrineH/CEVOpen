<p>IR spectroscopy method was used to identify the active functional group using Bruker Fourier transform infrared alpha model, Germany [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. The transmitted light frequencies were recorded to obtain IR spectrum [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>], and it was later compared with existing database for the presence of active groups.
