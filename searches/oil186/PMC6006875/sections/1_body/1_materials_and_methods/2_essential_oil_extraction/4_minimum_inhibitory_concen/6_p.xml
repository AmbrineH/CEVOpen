<p>The test tubes demonstrating no visible turbidity were subcultured to solid agar plates and MFC was determined by comparing the growth with the positive control. The MFC endpoint is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that kills &gt;99.9% of the initial fungal population where no visible growth of the fungi was observed on the SDA plates. The tests were repeated in triplicates.</p>
