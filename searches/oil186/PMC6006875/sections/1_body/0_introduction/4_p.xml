 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> is an herbal plant that has been used as food flavoring agent in many countries [

 <italic>Candida</italic>. Its antifungal actions have been found to be similar to nystatin and amphotericin B. A study in mice has shown to cure systemic candidiasis on a daily oral administration of 1.0 Î¼l of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil for 30 days.[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In human beings, the antifungal activities of
