<p>Hence, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was chosen to characterize its antifungal effects on oral isolates of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> from a denture wearer with CADS. The organisms were collected from the patients affected with CADS. The essential oil was extracted from the leaves of the plant, and the antifungal activity was confirmed using well diffusion method against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. The efficacy of two extraction methods, hydrodistillation and maceration, was compared. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the herb were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The active functional group in the experimental herb was identified as a compound similar to carvacrol through infrared (IR) spectroscopy method.
