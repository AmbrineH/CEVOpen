  <span class="bold">Background:</span>
  <span class="italic">Aframomum danielli</span> is used in ethno-medicine for the treatment of several ailments and as a traditional food spice. 
  <span class="bold">Methods:</span> The hydro-distilled leaf, stem, seed, rhizome and pod volatile oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Free radical scavenging capacity of the volatile oils was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. 
  <span class="bold">Results:</span> Thirty-nine (39) volatile compounds were identified in the oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>, accounting for 85.33 to 96.03% of the total oil composition. The leaf, stem, rhizome and pod volatile oils were dominant in β-pinene (30.94–47.55%), while the seed oil contained a high amount of 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (53.44%). The seed oil showed higher radical inhibitory activity in the DPPH assay (IC
  <sub>50</sub> value, 45.5 µg/mL) and the rhizome oil was the most effective in the FRAP assay. 
  <span class="bold">Conclusions:</span> The characterization of the leaf, stem, rhizome and pod volatile oils of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> is reported for the first time. 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> seed and rhizome oils elicit promise as potential plant resource and warrant further biological exploitation.
