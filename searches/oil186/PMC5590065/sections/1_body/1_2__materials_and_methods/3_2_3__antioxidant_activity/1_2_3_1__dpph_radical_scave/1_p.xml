<p class="p">The DPPH free radical scavenging of the 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic> essential oils and ascorbic acid prepared in methanol at various concentrations (20–100 µg/mL) were evaluated according to the method of Shekhar and Anju [
 <xref rid="B19-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. One millilitre of 0.1 mM DPPH solution in methanol was added to 3 mL the solutions prepared with the oils and standard, and stirred for 1 min. Each mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm. The assays were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation. Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical activity. Percentage scavenging activity was calculated using the expression:
