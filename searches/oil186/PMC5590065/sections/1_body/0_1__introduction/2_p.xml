<p class="p">Some biological activities such as antiprotozoal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have been documented for a number of

 <xref rid="B16-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of data on the volatile oil composition of other aromatic parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Aframomum danielli</italic>, other than the seed oils earlier reported. Moreover, there is an upsurge in the search for natural antioxidants especially of plant origin to protect the human body from free radicals, as well as to hinder the progress of many chronic diseases and of rancidity in food. This work was therefore carried out to determine the composition and antioxidant activity of volatile oils from the seed, leaf, rhizome, stem and pod of 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic>.
