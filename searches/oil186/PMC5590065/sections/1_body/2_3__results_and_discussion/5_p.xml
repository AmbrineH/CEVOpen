<p>The concentration-dependent, ferric-reducing potential of 
 <italic>A. danielli</italic> oils and ascorbic acid (as a function of absorbance at 700 nm) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00029-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The reducing capacity of the volatile oils and standard compound increased with a corresponding increase in concentration. The FRAP assay indicated the higher reduction ability of the rhizome oil, followed by the seed and leaf oils (1.454, 1.376 and 1.305, respectively, at 100 µg/mL). This is an indication of the 
 <italic>A. danielli</italic> oil constituents’ ability to reduce the (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) by electron transfer. The ferric ion reduction ability of ascorbic acid in the assay (100 µg/mL, 1.995) was relatively higher than the absorbance values for the volatile oils. The relatively moderate oxygenated proportion of the 
 <italic>A. danielli</italic> rhizome oil may have afforded the observed antioxidant potency in the FRAP assay.
