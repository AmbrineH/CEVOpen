<p class="p">The leaf, seeds and rhizome of 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic> are the most frequently used plant portions and are implicated in folkloric claims. Therefore, the antioxidant assays were carried out on these targeted plant parts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00029-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> is a presentation of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic> leaf, seed and rhizome essential oils compared with the standard compound, ascorbic acid. The plot indicates the scavenging ability of the oils as a percent inhibition at various concentrations; the scavenging effect was concentration dependent. This was demonstrated by the volatile oils’ ability to act as a hydrogen atoms or electrons donor in the conversion of DPPH radical to DPPH-H. The seed oil exhibited the highest percent inhibition in the assay (77.96%, 100 µg/mL) compared with the leaf and rhizome oils (67.59% and 62.11%, respectively, 100 µg/mL), while ascorbic acid showed 91.00% inhibition. DPPH radical activity is usually presented with an IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> value. The IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> values for leaf, seed and rhizome oils were 58.5 µg/mL, 45.5 µg/mL and 72.0 µg/mL, respectively, while ascorbic acid showed a value of 20.5 µg/mL.
