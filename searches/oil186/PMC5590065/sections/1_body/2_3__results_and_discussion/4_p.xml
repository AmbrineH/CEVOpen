<p class="p">Interestingly, the seed oil is shown to be dominant in oxygenated components, such as 1,8-cineole (53.44%) and α-terpineol (12.23%), as compared to the leaf and rhizome oils (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). It is suggestive that 1,8-cinoeole and other oxygenated components of the seed oil may be responsible for the prominent radical scavenging effect; as a consequence, the antioxidant activity depends on individual oil composition. Similarly, α-terpineol, one of the constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus teretecornis</italic> leaf volatile oil, was shown to be responsible for the observed antioxidant effect, though 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and β-pinene occurred as major constituents [
