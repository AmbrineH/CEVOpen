One millilitre of 0.1 mM DPPH solution in methanol was added to 3 mL the solutions prepared with the oils and standard, and stirred for 1 min. Each mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm. The assays were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation. Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical activity. Percentage scavenging activity was calculated using the expression:

The experiment was performed in triplicate and the average absorbance was noted for each measurement. Higher absorbance indicated higher reducing power. The ferric-reducing capacity of the essential oils and standard compound were expressed graphically by plotting the absorbance against concentration.
