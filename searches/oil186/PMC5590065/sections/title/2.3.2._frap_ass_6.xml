 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reducing power of the essential oils was determined according to the method of Oyaizu [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00029" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00029">20</a>]. Various concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 µg/mL) of essential oils and ascorbic acid were mixed with phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, 0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 1% (

  <span class="italic">v</span>) of potassium ferricyanide water solution (2.5 mL). The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of trichloroacetic acid (2.5 mL, 10%, aqueous solution (

  <span class="italic">v</span>)) were added to the mixture and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (2.5 mL) was mixed with distilled water (2.5 mL) and a freshly prepared ferric chloride solution (0.5 mL, 0.1% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>)). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 700 nm. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the average absorbance was noted for each measurement. Higher absorbance indicated higher reducing power. The ferric-reducing capacity of the essential oils and standard compound were expressed graphically by plotting the absorbance against concentration.
