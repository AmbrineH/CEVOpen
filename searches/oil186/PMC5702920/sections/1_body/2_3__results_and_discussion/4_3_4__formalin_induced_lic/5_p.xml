<p>In addition to antinociceptive properties, these monoterpenes present anti-inflammatory activity. Limonene, for example, in addition to being the major component of essential oils from
 <italic> Citrus</italic> species with anti-inflammatory activity when administered orally also had the same effect when tested alone [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Bergamot essential oil is rich in limonene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, which are mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of Bergamot in the carrageenan test [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Pinene is also a major component in
 <italic> Chenopodium album </italic>L. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and
 <italic> Ugni myricoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] leaf essential oils, which have anti-inflammatory properties against TPA and carrageenan, respectively. This monoterpene is involved in immunologic activation and inflammatory intermediate synthesis inhibition, which are important for the pharmacological properties of many essential oils [
