<p>The activity shown by formulations B, D, and E is related to their essential oil compositions since the compressed air (control group), vehicle (vehicle group), and Formulations A and C did not present a decrease in the licking time in either phase. Thus, the predominant presence of monoterpenes (
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene,
 <italic> p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene, limonene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene) in the fraction of nebulized and inhaled air of Formulations B, D, and E (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>) may be related to the antinociceptive activity. In addition, the fraction of nebulized and inhaled air of Formulation E also had a high concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), a potent analgesic that acts on both central and peripheral pain [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interesting results regarding the antinociceptive activity of these monoterpenes administered by different pathways can be found in the literature. When administered intraperitoneally in mice, limonene presents antinociceptive activity in acetic acid and formalin (mainly in the second phase) tests without sedative properties [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally,
 <italic> p</italic>-cymene injected intraperitoneally in mice presented orofacial antinociceptive activity in formalin, capsaicin, and glutamate tests, without sedative properties [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] also showed antinociceptive properties in different models. These data suggest that the combination of these components in the formulations is a crucial factor in the observed antinociceptive activity.
