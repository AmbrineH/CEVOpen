<p class="p">Because the pain mechanisms assessed using the hot plate and formalin tests are different, it is common for substances to be active in only one of the models. This was observed with the oral administration of
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> essential oil, which resulted in antinociceptive activity in both the capsaicin and formalin (only in the second phase) tests and none in the hot plate test [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This was also observed in the present study, as well as in others [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The active substances present in all of these studies probably do not have affinity with opioid receptors, as they are inactive in the hot plate test.
