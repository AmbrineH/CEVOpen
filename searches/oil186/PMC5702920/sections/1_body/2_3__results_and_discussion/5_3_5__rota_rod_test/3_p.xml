<p>None of the formulations with essential oils presented sedative or motor coordination depressant effects after nebulization and inhalation since the number of animal falls was quite reduced (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). However, it should be taken into account that the
 <italic> breu</italic> formulations evaluated in the present study only contained the volatile fractions (essential oils) and that
 <italic> breu</italic> was not submitted to combustion. Burning of an oleoresin, as is usually done in the traditional use, may induce changes in the chemical composition, as pyrolysis may occur. This effect was not evaluated here. However, during the traditional mode of use, burning occurs slowly and at least some of the volatile compounds pass to the vapor phase by evaporation due to the heating flux, before pyrolysis, similar to cigarette burning, for example. Therefore, both the original compounds and pyrolysis products might be present in the smoke inhaled during traditional use. Nevertheless, the absence of sedative or motor coordination depressant effect is a satisfactory result since it demonstrates that any of the observed anti-inflammatory or antinociceptive effects are associated with a depressor effect above the central nervous system. Other essential oils, such as

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and
 <italic> Croton sanderianus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], also have antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity without sedative properties. Myrcene and linalool, which are components of the
 <italic> breu</italic> essential oil, have sedative and motor system depressant activities at high concentrations [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, it appears that their concentrations in the nebulized and inhaled air fractions were not enough to trigger such effects.
