<p>The hot plate test was employed to assess antinociceptive activity. In the hot plate test, the response to pain stimuli is relayed to the supraspinal reflex mediated by

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and O'Callaghan and Holtzman [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In all of these cases, antinociceptive activity is characterized by an increased tolerance to pain by the animal when in contact with a heated plate.
