<p>Glycoalcoholic solutions containing 0.1 g/mL
 <italic> breu</italic> essential oil, 10% (w/v) propylene glycol, and ethanol were prepared according to the popular use by the
 <italic> Quilombola</italic> Communities of Oriximiná (Pará, Brazil) [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. According to
 <italic> quilombola</italic> knowledge, it is standard practice to burn and inhale approximately 20 g of
 <italic> breu</italic> oleoresin, with an average yield of 2.5% (w/w) of essential oil, which represents approximately 0.5 g of essential oil/20 g of oleoresin [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, a dose of 0.5 g of essential oil per 5 mL of the formulation was chosen (0.1 g/mL). The final formulation is described below, and it was prepared as follows: first, propylene glycol was homogenized with part of the ethanol, and, subsequently, essential oil was added under stirring. Finally, ethanol was added until the final volume (5 mL) was reached, and the solution was homogenized and stored in amber glass bottles under refrigeration (−4°C). Based on previous chemical characterization [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], essential oils from 10 different
 <italic> breu</italic> samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) were mixed in equal parts for pharmacological tests, according to the similarity of their chemical compositions (major compounds) as follows: Formulation “
 <bold>A</bold>”, prepared with 0.125 g of BBIM, BBPIR, BBIR
 <sub>1</sub>, and BBIR
 <sub>2</sub> essential oils, with 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene as the major compound; Formulation “
 <bold>B</bold>”, prepared with 0.25 g of BBIR
 <sub>3</sub> and WBB1 essential oils, with
 <italic> p</italic>-cymene as the major compound; Formulation “
 <bold>C</bold>”, prepared with 0.25 g of BBTF1 and BBTF2 essential oils, with
 <italic> p</italic>-cymene as the major compound with high concentrations of sesquiterpenes; Formulation “
 <bold>D</bold>”, prepared with 0.5 g of WBB
 <sub>2</sub> essential oil
 <sub>,</sub> with limonene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol as the major compounds; and Formulation “
 <bold>E</bold>”, prepared with 0.5 g of WBIG essential oil, with 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene as the major compound.
