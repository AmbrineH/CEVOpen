<p class="p">Glycoalcoholic solutions containing 0.1 g/mL
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> essential oil, 10% (w/v) propylene glycol, and ethanol were prepared according to the popular use by the
 <italic class="italic"> Quilombola</italic> Communities of Oriximiná (Pará, Brazil) [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. According to
 <italic class="italic"> quilombola</italic> knowledge, it is standard practice to burn and inhale approximately 20 g of
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> oleoresin, with an average yield of 2.5% (w/w) of essential oil, which represents approximately 0.5 g of essential oil/20 g of oleoresin [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Therefore, a dose of 0.5 g of essential oil per 5 mL of the formulation was chosen (0.1 g/mL). The final formulation is described below, and it was prepared as follows: first, propylene glycol was homogenized with part of the ethanol, and, subsequently, essential oil was added under stirring. Finally, ethanol was added until the final volume (5 mL) was reached, and the solution was homogenized and stored in amber glass bottles under refrigeration (−4°C). Based on previous chemical characterization [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], essential oils from 10 different
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were mixed in equal parts for pharmacological tests, according to the similarity of their chemical compositions (major compounds) as follows: Formulation “
 <bold class="bold">A</bold>”, prepared with 0.125 g of BBIM, BBPIR, BBIR
