 <italic> Webster</italic> mice (20–25 g), donated by the Instituto Vital Brazil (Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), were used in this study. Animals were maintained under standard housing conditions (room with a light-dark cycle of 12 h, 22 ± 2°C, 60% to 80% humidity, and food/water provided ad libitum). Animals were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for at least 1 h before the onset of each test and were used only once throughout the experiments. Research was conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as found in the European Community guidelines (EEC Directive of 1986; 86/609/EEC) and the US guidelines (NIH publication #85-23, revised in 1985). All protocols followed the principles and guidelines adopted by the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA), were approved by the Biomedical Sciences Institute/UFRJ, Ethical Committee for Animal Research, and received the number DFBCICB015–04/16. All experimental protocols were performed during the light phase. Animal numbers per group were kept at a minimum. At the end of each experiment, mice were euthanized by ketamine/xylazine overdose.
