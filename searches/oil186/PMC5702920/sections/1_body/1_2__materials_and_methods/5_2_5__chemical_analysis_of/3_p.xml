<p>Linear retention indices were calculated by injection of a series of
 <italic> n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>7</sub>â€“C
 <sub>26</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] using the same column and conditions as described above for GC analyses. Peak identification was performed by comparison with chromatograms and retention times obtained previously by our group [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
