<p class="p">Linear retention indices were calculated by injection of a series of

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">26</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] using the same column and conditions as described above for GC analyses. Peak identification was performed by comparison with chromatograms and retention times obtained previously by our group [
