<p>Since The Malungo Expedition [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], our group has been interested in evaluating the traditional uses of
 <italic> breu</italic> resins as a remedy for headaches and migraines by inhalation of the smoke produced during its combustion, but a literature search for pharmacological animals models resulted in no validated studies. Several pharmacological models of pain involve inflammatory mediators. We selected the formalin-induced licking model to evaluate inflammatory pain. This model also involves direct activation of nociceptors (via C-fibers). According to the
 <italic> quilombola</italic> tradition, the
 <italic> breu</italic> oleoresin is burned to generate smoke, which is inhaled. In this procedure, some of the original
 <italic> breu</italic> compounds may undergo pyrolysis reactions and some are simply transferred to the vapor phase and therefore inhaled without a chemical change. In the inhalation model developed for this study, we only tested the volatile fractions of the oleoresins because they had been fully characterized in previous work from our group. The present study was designed to explore the form of administration performed by the
 <italic> quilombolas</italic> and to investigate whether the compounds in
 <italic> breu</italic> essential oils, when included in an inhalation formulation, could produce a pharmacological response in
 <italic> in vivo</italic> antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory models. In addition, the sedative activity of these formulations was also evaluated to exclude a possible relationship with the observed pharmacological effects.
