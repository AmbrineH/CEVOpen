<p>Species belonging to the
 <italic> Protium</italic> genus (Burseraceae) produce a characteristic fragrant oleoresin with economic, medicinal, and cultural values [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the Brazilian Amazon region, these oleoresins are known as
 <italic> breu, breu-branco</italic> (white-tar), and
 <italic> breu-preto</italic> (black-tar) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
 <italic> Breu</italic> oleoresins are a combination of two fractions—a volatile fraction that is mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes and a solid nonvolatile fraction that is mainly composed of triterpenes—and have a complex chemical composition with varying concentrations of each component responsible for
 <italic> breu</italic> therapeutic activities [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite traditional communities' belief that there is a difference between white and black
 <italic> breu</italic>, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to establish this nomenclature based on chemical, botanical, or regional names [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This traditional classification is probably associated with the darkening of the oleoresin caused by volatilization of select components and/or oxidation of others [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among the mono and sesquiterpenes that characterize the volatile
 <italic> breu</italic> fractions, some present antimicrobial, antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], analgesic [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], anti-inflammatory, and antitumor [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] activities. Because of its high sensorial quality,
 <italic> breu</italic> essential oil is also used as a fragrance in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
