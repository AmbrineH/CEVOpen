 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Glycoalcoholic solutions containing 0.1 g/mL
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oil, 10% (w/v) propylene glycol, and ethanol were prepared according to the popular use by the
  <span class="italic"> Quilombola</span> Communities of Oriximiná (Pará, Brazil) [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. According to
  <span class="italic"> quilombola</span> knowledge, it is standard practice to burn and inhale approximately 20 g of
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> oleoresin, with an average yield of 2.5% (w/w) of essential oil, which represents approximately 0.5 g of essential oil/20 g of oleoresin [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Therefore, a dose of 0.5 g of essential oil per 5 mL of the formulation was chosen (0.1 g/mL). The final formulation is described below, and it was prepared as follows: first, propylene glycol was homogenized with part of the ethanol, and, subsequently, essential oil was added under stirring. Finally, ethanol was added until the final volume (5 mL) was reached, and the solution was homogenized and stored in amber glass bottles under refrigeration (−4°C). Based on previous chemical characterization [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>], essential oils from 10 different
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> samples (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>) were mixed in equal parts for pharmacological tests, according to the similarity of their chemical compositions (major compounds) as follows: Formulation “
  <span class="bold">A</span>”, prepared with 0.125 g of BBIM, BBPIR, BBIR
  <sub>1</sub>, and BBIR
  <sub>2</sub> essential oils, with 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>-3-carene as the major compound; Formulation “
  <span class="bold">B</span>”, prepared with 0.25 g of BBIR
  <sub>3</sub> and WBB1 essential oils, with
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene as the major compound; Formulation “
  <span class="bold">C</span>”, prepared with 0.25 g of BBTF1 and BBTF2 essential oils, with
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene as the major compound with high concentrations of sesquiterpenes; Formulation “
  <span class="bold">D</span>”, prepared with 0.5 g of WBB
  <sub>2</sub> essential oil
  <sub>,</sub> with limonene and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol as the major compounds; and Formulation “
  <span class="bold">E</span>”, prepared with 0.5 g of WBIG essential oil, with 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene as the major compound.
