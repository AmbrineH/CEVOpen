Animals were maintained under standard housing conditions (room with a light-dark cycle of 12 h, 22 ± 2°C, 60% to 80% humidity, and food/water provided ad libitum). Animals were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for at least 1 h before the onset of each test and were used only once throughout the experiments. Research was conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as found in the European Community guidelines (EEC Directive of 1986; 86/609/EEC) and the US guidelines (NIH publication #85-23, revised in 1985). All protocols followed the principles and guidelines adopted by the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA), were approved by the Biomedical Sciences Institute/UFRJ, Ethical Committee for Animal Research, and received the number DFBCICB015–04/16. All experimental protocols were performed during the light phase. Animal numbers per group were kept at a minimum. At the end of each experiment, mice were euthanized by ketamine/xylazine overdose.

The final formulation is described below, and it was prepared as follows: first, propylene glycol was homogenized with part of the ethanol, and, subsequently, essential oil was added under stirring. Finally, ethanol was added until the final volume (5 mL) was reached, and the solution was homogenized and stored in amber glass bottles under refrigeration (−4°C).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each pharmacological test, seven groups containing five mice each were assembled. Each group was represented by mice that inhaled the following: nebulized air only (control group); the formulation vehicle without essential oil (vehicle group); and one of the formulations (A–E). The inhalation process was carried out in a chamber that was previously developed by our group (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) [
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. The chamber contains a central structure connected to five animal holders (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>, 2), and nebulized air passes directly and continuously through these animal holders. The central chamber (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>, 3) has an outlet for air collection, known as a sampling port (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>, 9), which has a threaded plastic cap with a septum to avoid air loss during
   <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> tests. First, this chamber was assembled and coupled to the nebulizer cup by means of a silicone hose. Then, 5 mL of the test formulation, prepared as described above, was dispersed in a sufficient volume of purified water to a final volume of 15 mL and placed in the nebulizer cup. Animals were placed into the animal holders; the nebulizer was turned on and the formulation was nebulized into the inhalation chamber and each of the five animal holders simultaneously. The nebulized air was blown into the chamber from the head (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>, 4) to the bottom by a central tube, generating a vortex that optimizes saturation and allows more uniform air distribution to the animals [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical analysis of the nebulized air inside of the inhalation chamber was performed to assess the chemical composition of the volatiles inhaled by the animals. For analysis, the formulations were prepared as described above. The air inside of the chamber was collected (100

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nebulized air relative compositions were obtained using gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) using two Agilent 7890 gas chromatographs. Separation was accomplished with a HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>m phase thickness). The operating conditions were as follows: split ratio 1 : 10; injector temperature 250°C; carrier gas: hydrogen, 1.5 mL/min, constant flow; column temperature, 60°C (no hold), 3°C per min to 240°C; and detector temperature: 280°C.

   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Initially, all mice were evaluated for the determination of their individual baselines. Mice were placed over the stainless-steel heating plate that was at a temperature of 55 ± 0.1°C, and the time that it took for each mouse to remove one hind paw from the surface of the plate was timed. These verifications were taken 60 and 30 minutes before mice underwent inhalation. The baseline of each animal was calculated as the mean of the timed trials. The dwell limit time for each mouse was set at three times the baseline value. Baseline determinations were performed 2 days before the pharmacological test. After 2 days, mice were subjected to inhalation. Five and 30 minutes after the end of the inhalation test, mice were placed on the hot plate under same experimental conditions described above. The time that each mouse took to lift a hind paw was timed and scored for final analysis.
