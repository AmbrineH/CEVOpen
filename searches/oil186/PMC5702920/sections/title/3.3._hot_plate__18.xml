 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hot plate test was employed to assess antinociceptive activity. In the hot plate test, the response to pain stimuli is relayed to the supraspinal reflex mediated by 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>
  <sub>1</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>
  <sub>2</sub> opioid receptors [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. This test was developed by Woolfe &amp; Macdonald in 1944 [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>] and improved by many other researchers, such as Eddy et al. [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>] and O'Callaghan and Holtzman [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. In all of these cases, antinociceptive activity is characterized by an increased tolerance to pain by the animal when in contact with a heated plate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of the mice that inhaled any of the tested formulations showed a significant increase in response time compared to animals that inhaled compressed air or vehicle, indicating the absence of antinociceptive activity (

  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). This result is in accordance with previous work from Rao and coworkers [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], who reported that oral administration of
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oil obtained from
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span> did not result in antinociceptive activity in the hot plate test.
