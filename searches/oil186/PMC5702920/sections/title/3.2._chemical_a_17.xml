 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the volatiles produced during operation of the nebulizing chamber was analyzed by static head space sampling of the chamber air by a sampling port. In this chamber, the animal holders have an air output (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1(a)</a>, 10) that can be sealed by a plastic screw cap. These outputs are opened during the tests, forcing the intake air to leave the chamber thought them since they are the only exits from the chamber [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. The main components in each essential oil formulation,
  <span class="bold"> A</span>–
  <span class="bold">E,</span> were quantified in the nebulized air and are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. The chemical composition of each
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oil present in the formulations is described in Da Silva et al. [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Compared to the individual composition of the essential oils observed in a previous study [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>], the composition of each nebulized formulation was quite similar to that of the original essential oils. In all formulations, the major components were present and at higher concentrations than the other components. A mixture of 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>-3-carene/isosylvestrene was the major component of the head space air from Formulation “
  <span class="bold">A</span>” (58.96% in the first minute and 56.4% after 15 min), which was prepared with the BBIM, BBPIR, BBIR
  <sub>1</sub>, and BBIR
  <sub>2</sub> essential oils (61.45% mean in the original oils);
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene was found at 20.6% (first minute) and 22.5% (after 15 min) in the head space air of Formulation “
  <span class="bold">B</span>”, prepared with the BBIR
  <sub>3</sub> and WBB1 essential oils (32.7% mean in the original oils);
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene (27.9% in the first minute and 23.4% after 15 min) and a high concentration of sesquiterpenes were the major compounds in the nebulized air from Formulation “
  <span class="bold">C</span>”, prepared with the BBTF1 and BBTF2 essential oils (11.45% mean of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene in the original essential oils); a mixture of limonene/
  <span class="italic">β</span>-phellandrene (33.4% in the first minute and 6.4% after 15 min) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol (15.4% in the first minute and 68.9% after 15 min) was detected as the major component in the head space air of Formulation “
  <span class="bold">D</span>”, prepared with the WBB
  <sub>2</sub> essential oil (41.1% limonene/
  <span class="italic">β</span>-phellandrene mix and 30.9%  
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol in the original essential oil). Finally, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene was found at 68.8% (first minute) and 49.2% (after 15 min) in the head space of Formulation “
  <span class="bold">E</span>”, prepared with the WBIG essential oil, which contained 57.7%  
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene in its original composition. From 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, it can be seen that, in the first minute, lower molecular weight components (monoterpene hydrocarbons) were detected at higher relative percent concentrations, as expected. This is why 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene was detected at a higher relative percentage in Formulation E in the first minute (68.8%) than in the original essential oil (57.7%). By the fifteenth minute, the relative percent concentrations of the monoterpene hydrocarbons decayed while concentrations of the oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes increased. This suggests that initially mice receive a dose that is rich in monoterpenes, which are lighter and probably more easily dispersed in the nebulized droplets. As the formulation is depleted, it is heavier and more difficult to disperse components that are nebulized, increasing their concentration inside the chamber. This is clearly seen in Formulation
  <span class="bold"> D</span>, in which the major compounds in the first minute are a mixture of 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-phellandrene-limonene (monoterpene hydrocarbons), which are replaced by 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol (oxygenated monoterpene) as the major volatile compound of the air sample collected at the second time point (15 min).
