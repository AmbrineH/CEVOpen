 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraplantar administration of formalin produces nociception, which is characterized by two distinct phases [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. The early phase (neurogenic phase) occurs in the first five minutes and is associated with direct chemical stimulus of the afferent fibers, mainly C-fibers [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>], with activation of TRPA1 channels [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>], and reflects centrally mediated pain. The late phase (inflammatory phase) occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after formalin injection and is mediated by the release of a combination of inflammatory mediators and sensitization of central nociceptive neurons [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>]. It is well-known that centrally acting drugs, such as opioids, inhibit nociception in both phases, while peripheral-acting drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid, inhibit only the second phase [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]. In addition, the activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also observed in the second phase [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>, 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>].

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a> show the results of the five formulations on the formalin test. The vehicle did not produce significant inhibition of the licking response in the early or the late phase. The results obtained from inhalation of the nebulized formulations were compared with those obtained from inhalation of the vehicle. Formulation B reduced the licking time significantly only in the early phase (36.9%), suggesting possible central pain inhibition. Formulation D suppressed the licking time significantly only in the late phase (37.9%), indicating possible peripheral antinociception by decreasing tonic inflammatory pain. Only Formulation E significantly suppressed the licking time in both the early phase (46.8%) and late phase (60.2%), indicating that it is effective on both tonic inflammatory and central pain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the pain mechanisms assessed using the hot plate and formalin tests are different, it is common for substances to be active in only one of the models. This was observed with the oral administration of
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> essential oil, which resulted in antinociceptive activity in both the capsaicin and formalin (only in the second phase) tests and none in the hot plate test [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. This was also observed in the present study, as well as in others [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>]. The active substances present in all of these studies probably do not have affinity with opioid receptors, as they are inactive in the hot plate test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activity shown by formulations B, D, and E is related to their essential oil compositions since the compressed air (control group), vehicle (vehicle group), and Formulations A and C did not present a decrease in the licking time in either phase. Thus, the predominant presence of monoterpenes (
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene,
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-phellandrene, limonene, and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene) in the fraction of nebulized and inhaled air of Formulations B, D, and E (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>) may be related to the antinociceptive activity. In addition, the fraction of nebulized and inhaled air of Formulation E also had a high concentration of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), a potent analgesic that acts on both central and peripheral pain [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>]. Interesting results regarding the antinociceptive activity of these monoterpenes administered by different pathways can be found in the literature. When administered intraperitoneally in mice, limonene presents antinociceptive activity in acetic acid and formalin (mainly in the second phase) tests without sedative properties [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. Additionally,
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene injected intraperitoneally in mice presented orofacial antinociceptive activity in formalin, capsaicin, and glutamate tests, without sedative properties [
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>]. Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-phellandrene [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene [
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>] also showed antinociceptive properties in different models. These data suggest that the combination of these components in the formulations is a crucial factor in the observed antinociceptive activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to antinociceptive properties, these monoterpenes present anti-inflammatory activity. Limonene, for example, in addition to being the major component of essential oils from
  <span class="italic"> Citrus</span> species with anti-inflammatory activity when administered orally also had the same effect when tested alone [
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>]. Bergamot essential oil is rich in limonene and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, which are mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of Bergamot in the carrageenan test [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-Pinene is also a major component in
  <span class="italic"> Chenopodium album </span>L. [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>] and
  <span class="italic"> Ugni myricoides</span> [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>] leaf essential oils, which have anti-inflammatory properties against TPA and carrageenan, respectively. This monoterpene is involved in immunologic activation and inflammatory intermediate synthesis inhibition, which are important for the pharmacological properties of many essential oils [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different tested
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> formulations significantly decreased the duration of the licking time in both phases of pain responses in the formalin-induced licking model. One possible explanation for this effect is that
  <span class="italic"> breu</span> may act by decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators or exert direct effects on different receptors present in the paw, such as bradykinin, serotonin, or opioid receptors, thus reducing the licking response.
