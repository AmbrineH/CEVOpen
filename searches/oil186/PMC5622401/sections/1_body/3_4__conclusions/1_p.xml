<p>The chemical composition of essential oils from the stems, leaves, and fruits of 
 <italic>Commiphora gileadensis</italic> have been shown to be rich in monoterpenoids, but a dearth of sesquiterpenoids, in contrast to previous reports of 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> essential oils; there is apparently wide variation in 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> volatiles. The enantiomeric distribution of monoterpenoids showed little variation between the different essential oil samples of 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic>, contrasted markedly from 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> spp. essential oils.
