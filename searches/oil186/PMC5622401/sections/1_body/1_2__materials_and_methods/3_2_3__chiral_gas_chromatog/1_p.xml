<p>Chiral analysis of the essential oils of wild and commercial 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV) with a scan range of 40–400 amu and a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s The GC was equipped with a Restek B-Dex 325 capillary column (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film). The oven temperature began at 50 °C, and was then gradually raised to 120 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min. After reaching 120 °C, the oven temperature was increased to 200 °C at 2 °C/min intervals and kept at this temperature for 5 min. Helium was the carrier gas, and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min. Samples were diluted to 3%

 <sub>2</sub>, and a 0.1 µL sample was injected in a split mode at a split ratio of 1:45. The monoterpenoid enantiomers were identified by comparison of retention times with authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Relative enantiomer percentages were determined based on peak areas.
