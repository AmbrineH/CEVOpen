<p>Although 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> has been an important medicinal plant throughout history, information about the essential oil composition of wild 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> is lacking. Therefore, in this work, the essential oil compositions attained from the stem bark, leaves, and fruits of wild 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> collected in Ein Gedi, Israel were determined and compared to the composition of commercially used 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> oil. In addition, to further characterize the essential oils, the enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> essential oils were determined.
