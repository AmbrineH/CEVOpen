<p class="p">The essential oil compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> are compiled in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00066-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The essential oils were dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons, followed by oxygenated monoterpenoids. The major components in 
 <italic class="italic">C. gileadensis</italic> oils were the monoterpenes α-pinene (11.1–18.4%), sabinene (15.8–35.9%), β-pinene (5.8–18.0%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (4.8–8.4%), limonene (1.3–6.2%), γ-terpinene (0.7–8.1%), and terpinen-4-ol (5.3–18.5%). Sesquiterpenoid concentrations were very low in these samples, and constituted only 0.8%, 10.6%, and 2.4% in the stem, leaf, and fruit oils, respectively. A representative gas chromatogram is shown in
