<p>A preponderance of sesquiterpenoids over monoterpenoids in members of 
 <italic>Commiphora</italic> has been previously shown for 
 <italic>C. kua</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 
 <italic>C. habessinica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], where monoterpenoids have not been detected); and for 
 <italic>C. parvifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenoids were present at a level of 16%. On the other hand, 
 <italic>C. tenuis</italic> from Ethiopia was rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons with 60.8% α-pinene, 8.8% β-pinene, 8.9% α-thujene, 6.3% sabinene, and 5.5% limonene, but had only trace amounts of sesquiterpenoids [
