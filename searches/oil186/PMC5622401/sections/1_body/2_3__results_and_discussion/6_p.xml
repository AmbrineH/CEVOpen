<p>The enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in 
 <italic>C. gileadensis</italic> essential oils are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00066-t002">Table 2</xref>. The (−)-enantiomers predominated in α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol. Borneol and bornyl acetate showed exclusively the (−)-enantiomers, but (+)-linalool and (+)-linalyl acetate predominated over the (−)-enantiomers. The chiral gas chromatogram of the leaf oil is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00066-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Currently, there is little information about the enantiomeric distribution of terpenoids in members of the Burseraceae, and apparently none regarding 
 <italic>Commiphora</italic> spp. However, 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species have been examined (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00066-t002">Table 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>Boswellia carterii</italic> essential oil from Somalia also showed predominantly the (−)-enantiomers in α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, and limonene [
 <xref rid="B35-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Basar and co-workers found that (+)-α-thujene dominates in 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> from Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, the (+)-enantiomers dominated in α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, and β-pinene in 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> essential oil from Oman [
 <xref rid="B35-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the other hand, analysis of a 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> sp. from Somalia showed (−)-α-thujene, (+)-α-pinene, (+)-sabinene, (+)-limonene, and (+)-terpinen-4-ol predominating [
 <xref rid="B36-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. (−)-Bornyl acetate was observed in the 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> sample from Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
