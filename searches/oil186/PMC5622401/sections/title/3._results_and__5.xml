 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil compositions of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> are compiled in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00066-t001" href="#medicines-04-00066-t001">Table 1</a>. The essential oils were dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons, followed by oxygenated monoterpenoids. The major components in 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> oils were the monoterpenes α-pinene (11.1–18.4%), sabinene (15.8–35.9%), β-pinene (5.8–18.0%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (4.8–8.4%), limonene (1.3–6.2%), γ-terpinene (0.7–8.1%), and terpinen-4-ol (5.3–18.5%). Sesquiterpenoid concentrations were very low in these samples, and constituted only 0.8%, 10.6%, and 2.4% in the stem, leaf, and fruit oils, respectively. A representative gas chromatogram is shown in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A previous examination of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> oils from aerial parts and flowering tops collected in Makkah, Saudi Arabia showed a complete absence of monoterpene hydrocarbons, but there were high concentrations of terpinen-4-ol (8.5% and 9.8%), and of sesquiterpenoids: δ-cadinene (5.0% and 4.8%), α-calacorene (9.4% and 3.8%), viridiflorol (4.6% and 4.4%), τ-muurolol (4.5% and 3.5%), and cadalene (4.3% and 5.4%) [
  <a rid="B20-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-medicines-04-00066">20</a>]. Another investigation of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> oil from leaves and fruits from Ein Gedi, Israel showed high concentrations of α-pinene (7.2%) and sabinene (21.1%), and richness in sesquiterpenes (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (20.1%) and germacrene D (19.6%) [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00066">18</a>]. The high concentrations of sesquiterpenes in these earlier studies are in marked contrast to the 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> oils examined in the present study, suggesting a wide variation of essential oil compositions within the population of this plant species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> essential oils are summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00066-t002" href="#medicines-04-00066-t002">Table 2</a>. The (−)-enantiomers predominated in α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol. Borneol and bornyl acetate showed exclusively the (−)-enantiomers, but (+)-linalool and (+)-linalyl acetate predominated over the (−)-enantiomers. The chiral gas chromatogram of the leaf oil is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00066-f002" href="#medicines-04-00066-f002">Figure 2</a>. Currently, there is little information about the enantiomeric distribution of terpenoids in members of the Burseraceae, and apparently none regarding 
  <span class="italic">Commiphora</span> spp. However, 
  <span class="italic">Boswellia</span> species have been examined (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chiral gas chromatography has been used as an analytical technique to detect outliers from authenticated oils and the possible adulteration of commercially important essential oils [

  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> essential oils. In addition, this work provides a comparison between 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> and other members of the Burseraceae (
