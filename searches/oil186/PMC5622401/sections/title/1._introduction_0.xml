  <span class="italic">Commiphora gileadensis</span> (L.) C. Chr. (syn. 
  <span class="italic">C. opobalsamum</span> (L.) Engl.) is an medium-sized aromatic shrub native to the Red Sea area, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Kenya [
  <a rid="B1-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-medicines-04-00066">1</a>]. In 1763, the renowned scholar and botanist Carl Linnaeus received a specimen collected in Yemen from his student Peter Forsskål, and identified it as the Biblical “Balm of Gilead” [
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00066">2</a>,

  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00066">4</a>]. Today, there is widespread agreement among scholars that 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> is one of the myrrh species of the Burseraceae and the source of the legendary “Balm of Judea” (“Balsam”) perfume.

  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> is also known in Hebrew as “apharsemon” (5). The plant is indigenous to the land of Israel and emits a thick aromatic sap, from which the renowned perfume was made. Various historical sources point out that apharsemon was cultivated intensively in the Jordan Valley and Ein Gedi, in the western Dead Sea basin as a crop, and its perfume was admired and traded at a high price during Biblical times, during the time of the Second Jewish Temple, and during the Roman and Byzantine eras [

  <a rid="B7-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-medicines-04-00066">7</a>]. Archeological excavations around the Ein Gedi oasis in Israel, on the north-west shore of the Dead Sea, unraveled furnace-like structures, jars, and other objects dating from the sixth century B.C.E. that were comparable with those found in perfume-making workshops. This supports the historical references. In the 1990s, 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> was reintroduced to Israel and is currently cultivated in Ein Gedi, near the Dead Sea [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00066">8</a>], renewing a long lost part of Jewish history in the land of Israel.

  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> has been used historically to treat a wide array of ailments [

  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00066">13</a>], and is used today in the traditional medicine practices of some cultures in the Middle East. In Yemen and Oman, the bark exudate is used externally to treat skin disorders such as burns, wounds, and infections [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00066">6</a>,

  <a rid="B15-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-medicines-04-00066">15</a>]. Among the Arab populations in the Middle East, a decoction of the aerial parts of the plant is administered as a pain reliever, a diuretic, and a laxative [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00066">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00066">17</a>]. In 2010, Iluz et al. [
  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00066">6</a>] investigated the medicinal properties of 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> and demonstrated that its sap had an inhibitory effect against 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> and was capable of blocking lectins of 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. This confirms the historical sources that indicated the antiseptic properties of the balsam’s sap. In 2012, Amiel et al. [
  <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00066" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00066">18</a>] further supported this finding by showing that (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene was a key component in 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> essential oil, that the balsam’s stem extracts acted against cancerous tumor cells, and had apoptosis-inducing properties that acted selectively, eradicating tumor cells, but not healthy cells.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> has been an important medicinal plant throughout history, information about the essential oil composition of wild 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> is lacking. Therefore, in this work, the essential oil compositions attained from the stem bark, leaves, and fruits of wild 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> collected in Ein Gedi, Israel were determined and compared to the composition of commercially used 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> oil. In addition, to further characterize the essential oils, the enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in 
  <span class="italic">C. gileadensis</span> essential oils were determined.
