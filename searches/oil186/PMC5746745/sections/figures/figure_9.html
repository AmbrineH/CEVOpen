Excess values of M+2 and M+3 isotopomeres obtained from GC/MS analysis from spike lavender leaf essential oil (chloroform-d extracts) labelled with 13CO 2 for 5 h. ( A) Ratios of M+2 and M+3 calculated for 8 HMGR5 transgenic plants and 4 wild type (WT) plants. ( B) Mean ± SD values of the M+2/M+3 ratios for all HMGR5 plants and all WT plants. ( C) Mean ± SD values of the M+2/M+3 ratios for all HMGR5 plants harvested 4 and 10 days after labelling and all WT plants harvested 11 days after labelling. </p>)
