 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples analyzed showed a quite stable M+2/M+3 ratio of 1.2 ± 0.3 for camphor and 1.2 ± 0.3 for cineole. Also, the M+2/(M+2 + M+3) ratio was very stable (0.5 ± 0.1 for camphor and 0.5 ± 0.1 for cineole). If both monoterpenes are produced exclusively through the MEP pathway the expected values for their ratios would be 1 and 0.5 respectively. If the MVA pathway is involved, the ratios would rise above those numbers, because of the presence of more M+2 coming from IPP from the cytosolic space. The observed values are therefore in the range of those expected for monoterpene biosynthesis mainly via the MEP pathway in
