  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of camphor, the ten C atoms from the monoterpene can be undoubtedly distinguished in the spectrum (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t004" href="#metabolites-07-00065-t004">Table 4</a>). Coupling constants of satellite pairs C1–C10, C9–C7, C8–C5, C3–C2 and C4–C8 can be clearly attributed (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f005" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f005">Figure 5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f006" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f006">Figure 6</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t004" href="#metabolites-07-00065-t004">Table 4</a>). The signal for carbon atom C5 shows a satellite pair caused by coupling to C4 (32.2 Hz) and an additional coupling to C8 (2.5 Hz), reflected by a splitting of the satellite pair. Only the long-range coupling of the carbonyl-C2 to C6 cannot be resolved in detail. These results were confirmed by the INADEQUATE experiment, which is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f006" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f006">Figure 6</a>. Clearly, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f006" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f006">Figure 6</a> shows all the couplings already described in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f005" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f005">Figure 5</a>. The long-range coupling of the carbonyl-C2 to C6 cannot be resolved in the INADEQUATE spectrum as well.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding cineole, the 10 C atoms were also determined; as expected, satellite pairs C3–C5, C9–C10, and C2–C6 are indistinguishable from each other because of the circular symmetric structure of the monoterpene. Coupling constants of satellite pairs caused by C3–C4, C7–C1, C10–C8, C9–C4, and C10/C9 can be clearly attributed (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f007" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f007">Figure 7</a>). A long-range coupling caused by C9 to C3 is also detected. It is possible that the signal of C3/C5 overlays with a α-pinene signal. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All camphor coupling constants are in concordance with the addition of a labelled IPP derived from G3P into the molecule through the MEP terpene synthesis pathway and not through IPP produced by the MVA pathway. The analysis of cineole provides enough evidence to also support the hypothesis that the MEP pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of 1,8-cineole due to the C9–C3 long-range coupling detected; this triple is only expected for a moiety where G3P serves as a precursor.</p>

The percentages of the five main components of the leaf essential oil (the monoterpenes cineole, camphor, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene) were considered in relation to the 15 main peaks of each sample and are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t005" href="#metabolites-07-00065-t005">Table 5</a>. These five molecules accounted for almost 88% of the 15 peaks in the HMGR5 plants and 78% for the WT plants, revealing that apparently the HMGR5 plants had a higher proportion of monoterpenes in their essential oil. Coumarine was also detected in most samples (

The main compounds in all samples were camphor and 1,8-cineole that accounted for a total of 79% in the case of HMGR5 plants and less than 67% in the case of WT plants. These results are in accordance with those previously described by our group, with HMGR overexpressing plants that accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as compared to controls. Enhanced expression of HMGR1S also increased the amount of the end-product sterols, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, but did not affect the accumulation of carotenoids or chlorophylls [
