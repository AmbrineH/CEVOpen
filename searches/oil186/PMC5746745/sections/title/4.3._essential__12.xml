 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the analytical method (GC/MS or 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR), two different extraction protocols were employed. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples for GC/MS analysis were extracted as follows: leaf samples (100–200 mg) were introduced into 10 mL glass tubes and 2 mL of chloroform-d (CDCl
  <sub>3</sub>) was added. After a gentle shake, the tubes were maintained for 15 min at room temperature; subsequently, a spatula of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added and tubes were left for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, 1000 μL of chloroform-extract were placed into a 1.5 mL autosampler vial suitable for GC/MS measurements.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR analyses, the plant material (600–1000 mg) was split into 3 different 10 mL glass tubes. Then, 2 mL of chloroform-d was added to the first tube, shacked gently and left at room temperature for 15 min. The chloroform was then transferred into the second tube and the whole process repeated. This procedure was also performed for the third tube. After drying with magnesium sulphate, finally 600 μL of the chloroform extract were placed in a NMR tube for 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C analyses.
