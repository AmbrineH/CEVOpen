 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Labelling experiments were performed with controls and transgenic HMGR5 plants. For 
  <span class="sup">13</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> feeding, three or four potted plants were simultaneously placed in a closed gas incubation chamber (Biobox; GWS, Berlin, Germany) at 25 Â°C and illuminated with white light (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f010" href="#metabolites-07-00065-f010">Figure 10</a>). Prior to the labelling period (pulse phase), the chamber was flushed with synthetic air containing oxygen and nitrogen until CO
  <sub>2</sub> was fully removed. The plants were then fed with synthetic air containing 700 ppm of 
  <span class="sup">13</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub>. During this pulse period, the concentration of 
  <span class="sup">13</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> and 
  <span class="sup">12</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> was typically detected at a ratio of 9:1. Subsequently, the plants were transferred to the laboratory.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In preliminary experiments, performed with 5-month-old WT plants, pulse and chase periods adequate to produce detectable 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C enrichments were determined. To this end, pots were feed for six different pulse periods beginning with 1.0 h up to 8.8 h. Chase periods varied from 0 to 264 h. The time settings for each experiment are listed in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-07-00065" href="#app1-metabolites-07-00065">Table S1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Labelling experiments with transgenic HMGR5 plants and their respective controls were performed with 5 h pulse period and chase periods for 96, 168, 240 and 264 h.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, leaf essential oils were extracted and the samples were analysed to detect the labelling pattern of camphor and cineole using NMR and/or GC/MS techniques, as described below. Samples indicated with the same lower-case letter belonged to the same plant. </p>
