 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial plant material used in this work consisted of 
  <span class="italic">Lavandula latifolia</span> Med (spike lavender) mature seeds, provided by Intersemillas SA (Valencia, Spain) and in vitro grown transgenic HMGR5 plants overexpressing the HMG1 cDNA, encoding the catalytic domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR1S) previously obtained in our group [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seeds were sterilized and germinated in vitro as previously described [
  <a rid="B59-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-metabolites-07-00065">59</a>]. After germination, seedlings were first transferred to pot-trays with a mixture of peat moss and perlite (7:3) and after 30 days, plantlets were transferred to pots (15 cm) and kept in the greenhouse for 4 months.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in vitro HMGR5 and no transgenic wild type (WT) control plants were acclimatized to ex vitro conditions and planted in pots (15 cm) with peat moss and perlite (1:1) as substrate and maintained in a culture chamber for 2 months until used.</p>
