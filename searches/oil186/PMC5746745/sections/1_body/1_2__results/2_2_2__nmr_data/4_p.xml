<p>Regarding cineole, the 10 C atoms were also determined; as expected, satellite pairs C3–C5, C9–C10, and C2–C6 are indistinguishable from each other because of the circular symmetric structure of the monoterpene. Coupling constants of satellite pairs caused by C3–C4, C7–C1, C10–C8, C9–C4, and C10/C9 can be clearly attributed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f007">Figure 7</xref>). A long-range coupling caused by C9 to C3 is also detected. It is possible that the signal of C3/C5 overlays with a α-pinene signal.
