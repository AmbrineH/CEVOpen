The signal for carbon atom C5 shows a satellite pair caused by coupling to C4 (32.2 Hz) and an additional coupling to C8 (2.5 Hz), reflected by a splitting of the satellite pair. Only the long-range coupling of the carbonyl-C2 to C6 cannot be resolved in detail. These results were confirmed by the INADEQUATE experiment, which is shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. The long-range coupling of the carbonyl-C2 to C6 cannot be resolved in the INADEQUATE spectrum as well.
