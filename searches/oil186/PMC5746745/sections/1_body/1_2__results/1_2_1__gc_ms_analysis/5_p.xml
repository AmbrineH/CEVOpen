<p class="p">To interpret the data in more detail, samples 48, 49, 50, 55, 31, 32, 43, 42 and 30, all of them with isotopologue excess values over 2.5% were chosen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Values for the isotopomers M+2 and M+3 and their ratios for both camphor and cineole are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. In all of these samples, the M+1 to M+3 fraction ranged from 25â€“73% of total labelled excess isotopologues.
