<p>More specifically, the labelling profiles shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-07-00065">Figures S1 and S2</xref> indicated that a pulse period below five hours did not lead to significant 
 <sup>13</sup>C enrichments in both camphor and 1,8-cineol. However, 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> pulses of five hours and more resulted in 
 <sup>13</sup>C-enrichments of &gt;2% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Some of the samples showed 
 <sup>13</sup>C enrichments of more than 10% (up to 25% in some cineole and camphor samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Even experiments with a given pulse period (i.e., the said 5 h) showed considerable differences of labelling profiles that can be explained, in part, on the basis of different chase periods. Generally, it appeared that the 
 <sup>13</sup>C enrichments increase with higher chase periods (
