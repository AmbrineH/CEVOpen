Three HMGR5 plants were harvested 96 h after the pulse time, two after 168 h and three after 240 h. The WT plants were harvested after 96 h (one plant) and 264 h (three plants). Only harvested plants showing an excess of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>A. Mean results for cineole revealed that HMGR5 and WT plants have very similar M+2/M+3 ratios (1.7 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.1, respectively) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>B). In contrast, HMGR5 plants showed a high deviation in the M+2/M+3 ratio within the same chase group (mean value for the ratios were 2.0 ± 0.4 and 1.8 ± 0.4 for 4 and 10 days chase periods, respectively;
