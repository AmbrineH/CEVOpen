<p>The use of 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> as a tracer is a powerful tool, since this strategy represents the possibility of studying metabolic pathways in plants by mimicking, as much as possible, their physiological growth conditions [

 <xref rid="B41-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The labelling period (pulse) is followed by a chase period in which the plants grow under normal conditions and natural 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> abundance for several hours/days. During that time, unlabeled products and intermediates are produced, that also are used in the production of the final metabolites. Therefore, complex patterns of [
 <sup>12</sup>C]- and [
 <sup>13</sup>C]-isotopologues are expected to be found in the final natural products. The analysis of complex isotopologue mixtures in 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub>-labelled natural products became possible recently, because of the remarkable improvement made in NMR and mass spectrometry techniques [

 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> feeding has also been used to measure plastidic DMAPP concentrations and to quantify the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> production of volatile and nonvolatile isoprenoids in some species [
 <xref rid="B47-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this paper, we describe the 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> labelling conditions necessary to study the incorporation of 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> into cineole and camphor in wild type (WT) and HMGR5 transgenic spike lavender plants. The results are aimed to clarify the possible contribution of the MVA pathway to the biosynthesis of both monoterpenes in the species.
