<p>In preliminary experiments, performed with 5-month-old WT plants, pulse and chase periods adequate to produce detectable 
 <sup>13</sup>C enrichments were determined. To this end, pots were feed for six different pulse periods beginning with 1.0 h up to 8.8 h. Chase periods varied from 0 to 264 h. The time settings for each experiment are listed in
