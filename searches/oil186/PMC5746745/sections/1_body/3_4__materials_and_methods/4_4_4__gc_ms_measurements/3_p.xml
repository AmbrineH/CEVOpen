<p>Each sample was analyzed three times in SIM (single ion monitoring) mode. The relative intensities of the standards (camphor and 1,8-cineole) and the samples obtained from GC/MS analysis (peak integration) were processed according to previous publications [
 <xref rid="B60-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This evaluation results in the molar excess of carbon isotopologues of the main components camphor and 1,8-cineole only due to the enrichments from the 
 <sup>13</sup>C precursor.
