<p>The measurements were performed as follows: the injector and interface temperature were 230 °C and 250 °C respectively. The temperature settings of the oven were: 70 °C for 2 min, then 70–90 °C with 2 °C/min, then 90–130 °C with 5 °C/min and finally 250 °C for 1 min. The pressure program started at 76.1 kPa with a linear velocity of 40.0 cm/s. The flow control was set to linear velocity. The total flow was 16.1 mL/min while the column flow stayed at 1.19 mL/min. The split ratio was 1:10. The detector volts were approx. 0.8 keV (according to the last tuning result of the MS). The solvent cut was adjusted at 4 min and the sampling rate at 0.15 s. The micro scan width was fixed at 0.1 u.</p>
