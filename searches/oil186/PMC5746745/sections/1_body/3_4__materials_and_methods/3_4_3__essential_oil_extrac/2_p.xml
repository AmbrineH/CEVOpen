<p>Samples for GC/MS analysis were extracted as follows: leaf samples (100–200 mg) were introduced into 10 mL glass tubes and 2 mL of chloroform-d (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>) was added. After a gentle shake, the tubes were maintained for 15 min at room temperature; subsequently, a spatula of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added and tubes were left for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, 1000 μL of chloroform-extract were placed into a 1.5 mL autosampler vial suitable for GC/MS measurements.
