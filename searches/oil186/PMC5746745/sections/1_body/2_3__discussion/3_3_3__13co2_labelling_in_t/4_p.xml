<p class="p">Results herein do not clearly support that the increased monoterpene production in HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants are due to a transport of MVA-derived units from the cytoplasm to plastids. It is true that analysis of metabolic flux based on

 <xref rid="B13-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]; therefore, the increased monoterpene production in HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants could also be explained by feedback MEP pathway gene-regulation in response to HMGR overexpression. As an example, MVA-derived prenylated proteins were shown to regulate the expression of genes in the early steps of monoterpenoid biosynthesis in
