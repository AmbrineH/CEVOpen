<p>HMGR in plants is considered the most important enzyme for regulating the MVA pathway; it is regulated at the levels of transcription, post-transcription, translation and post-translation [
 <xref rid="B36-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As expected, overexpression of HMGR enzyme in tobacco, spike lavender, tomato, 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and ginseng has been reported to increase sterol content [
 <xref rid="B36-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the case of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> it was also reported an increase in artemisinin production [
 <xref rid="B54-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> total tanshinone production was enhanced [
 <xref rid="B55-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; and in 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> triterpene saponin production increased [
 <xref rid="B56-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, spike lavender is the only plant model were an increase of non-mevalonate metabolites is noted after overexpression of the HMGR enzyme [
