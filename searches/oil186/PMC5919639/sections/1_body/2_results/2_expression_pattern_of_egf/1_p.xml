<p class="p">The transcript levels of 
 <italic class="italic">EgFAD8</italic> in leaf and mesocarp at five different developmental stages were determined by RT-qPCR using 
 <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-actin as an internal control. The results showed that the transcript level of 
 <italic class="italic">EgFAD8</italic> in mesocarp was quite flat during ripening with a slight increase at the beginning (from P1 to P2, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly, the expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">EgFAD8</italic> in mature leaves was at least twice that in mescoarp (
