<p class="p">Promoter prediction analysis suggested that the 
 <italic class="italic">EgFAD8</italic> promoter contained some stress-responsive elements, including light-responsive elements. Therefore, further work was carried out to investigate whether it was induced under various stress conditions, such as cold and dark. The 
 <italic class="italic">ProEgFAD8</italic>::
 <italic class="italic">GUS</italic> transgenic Arabidopsis T3 lines were cultivated at 15Â°C and in the dark, respectively, with other conditions are the same with the control. The GUS activity of transgenic plants under the darkness or low temperature treatment was no obvious difference with that of the control after 24 hours treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). However, 48 hours treatment later, the GUS activity of the transgenic plants under the darkness treatment showed obvious increase by 26% when compared with that of the control, and the transgenic plants under the low temperature treatment exhibited the extraordinarily significant increase of GUS activity by about 14-fold comparing with the control (
