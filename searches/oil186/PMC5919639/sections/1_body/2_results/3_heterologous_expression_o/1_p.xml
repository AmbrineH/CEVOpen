<p>The activity of EgFAD8 was determined by heterologous expression in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic> supplemented with linoleic acid as substrate, which is absent in yeast. Yeast transformed with empty vector (pYES2) was used as negative control. The total fatty acid composition of yeast transformed with 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> or pYES2 was detected and analyzed. The result showed that yeast transformed with 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> produced a new fatty acid species 18:3 Ï‰-3 (about 0.27 mol%) in yeast, but not presented in the negative control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Meanwhile, there was no obvious difference in the levels of other fatty acids between yeast transformed with 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> and the negative control pYES2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, the expression of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> in yeast could produce 18:3 using the supplemented 18:2.
