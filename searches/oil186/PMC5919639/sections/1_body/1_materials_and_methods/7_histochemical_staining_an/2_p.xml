<p class="p">Quantitative analysis of GUS activity in transgenic Arabidopsis was determined according to Jefferson [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The protein concentrations of plant extracts were measured as descried by Bradford [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. GUS activity was calculated as pmol 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) per min per microgram protein. Three replicates were performed for each sample.
