<p class="p">Total RNA from mesocarp was extracted by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) based method as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using FastQuant RT Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and was used for gene cloning and expression analysis. The coding sequence of EgFAD8 was amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using primers EgFAD8-pYES2 F and R with restriction site

 <italic class="italic">Xba</italic>I, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196693.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30s, 30 cycles at of 98 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 30s, 72 °C for 60 s and a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pEASY-Blunt vector (Transgen biotech, Beijing, China) and sequenced. The cloning of
