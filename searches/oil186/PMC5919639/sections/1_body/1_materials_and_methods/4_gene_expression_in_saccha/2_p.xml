<p>Precultures were made in 2 mL SC-U medium with 2% (w/v) raffinose and 1% (w/v) tergitol NP-40 (Sigma, USA), and were grown overnight at 30°C. For induction gene expression, appropriate amount of precultures were inoculated into 20 mL SC-U medium containing 2% (w/v) galactose and 50 μM linoleic acid at an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.1. Yeast cultures were incubated for three days at 30°C under continuous agitation (250 rpm). Then the cells were harvested and washed twice with sterile deionized water before used for fatty acid analysis.
