<p class="p">In order to generate a yeast expression construct, 
 <italic class="italic">EgFAD8</italic> fragments were digested with 
 <italic class="italic">Kpn</italic>I and 
 <italic class="italic">Xba</italic>I from pEASY vector, and subcloned into pYES2 vector. The construct EgFAD8-pYES2 and the control pYES2 were separately transformed into INVSc1 cells using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method [

 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-U) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. Three independent positive clones of each transformation were used for further expression studies.
