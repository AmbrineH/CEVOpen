<p>Oil palm fruits were collected from the Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Agricultural Academy of Tropical Crops, Wenchang, Hainan, China. Fruits at five developmental stages (30–60 days after pollination (DAP), 60–100 DAP, 100-12- DAP, 120–140 DAP, and 140–160 DAP) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. Wild-type
