<p>Oil palm (
 <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> Jacq.) is the most productive oil-bearing crop in the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There are two major economic productions from oil palm fruits: palm oil extracted from the mesocarp and palm kernel oil from the endosperm [

 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Palm oil contains oleate (18:1; 45%), linoleate (18:2; 8%), and 47% saturated fatty acid (43% of 16:0 and 4% of 18:0). Therefore, much effort has been made to understand the oil synthesis in oil palm fruits and improve the fatty acid composition of palm oil since the high content of saturated fatty acid has been thought to be unhealthy to human [
