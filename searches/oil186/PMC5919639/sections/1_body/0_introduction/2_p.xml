<p class="p">In higher plants, fatty acids are synthesized 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> in the stroma of plastids through a complex series of condensation reactions to produce either C16 or C18 fatty acids. These fatty acids are then incorporated into the two glycerolipid synthetic pathways: the prokaryotic pathway and eukaryotic pathway [
