<p>In the present work, a chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic>) and its promoter from oil palm has been isolated and characterized. The expression pattern of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> in leaves and mesocarp at five developmental stages has been detected by Real-time quantitative PCR. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> function of EgFAD8 has been verified by overexpression in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (INVSc1) with exogenous linoleic acid (18:2). To detect whether it could be induced by low temperature or the change of environment, we detected the efficiency of the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively. These results revealed the function of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> and the feature of its promoter from high plants, which will be useful for understanding the role of ω-3 fatty acid desaturases from fruits grown in the tropical areas.
