<p>In order to study the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> function of EgFAD8, it has been successfully expressed in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. However, there is no linoleic acid (18:2) produced in yeast. So the exogenous supply of 18:2 is needed for studying the activity of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase. The result from GC analysis indicated that the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> transformed yeast cells could produce slight amounts of 18:3 using the exogenous 18:2. At least, this result confirmed the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase encoded by 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> from oil palm. While, the amount of 18:3 produced by the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> transformed yeast is very limited. There might be three possible reasons as follows: first, the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> gene is likely to encode a chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, rather than the ER-localized desaturase; thus it could not participate in the synthesis of storage oil in oil palm mesocarp. Likewise, when expressed in yeast cells, EgFAD8 might just be involved in the desaturation of galactolipids in the plastid. Second, EgFAD8 has been predicted to be temperature-sensitive desaturase by bioinformatic analysis. The yeast growth condition at 30 °C might not intrigue the large expression of transformed gene 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic>. Third, the exogenous supply of 18:2 might be a bit unhealthy or toxic for yeast cell. So, the coexpression of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase with ω-6 fatty acid desaturase in yeast might be a better solution than feeding with 18:2 in the yeast culture. However, the 
 <italic>JcFAD7</italic> from 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> also showed the similar result when expressed in yeast, producing about 2.5% of 18:3 in transformed cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> gene from oil palm encodes a ω-3 fatty acid desaturase.
