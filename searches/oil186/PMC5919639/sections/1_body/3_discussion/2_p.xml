<p>Furthermore, the expression pattern in oil palm mesocarp at five developmental stages and leaves was also detected to see whether the expression level of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> is correlated with oil deposition in oil palm mesocarp. While, we can see 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> was predominately expressed in leaves, at least twice-fold as that of mesocarp. Moreover, the expression level of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> remains still during fruit ripening with a slight increase at the beginning. The majority of oil deposition in oil palm mesocarp occurs at the late stages (from phase 3 to phase 5) [

 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, the expression of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> is not correlated with oil accumulation in mesocarp. Similar patterns have been seen in the expression of 
 <italic>FAD8</italic> in other plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The 
 <italic>GmFAD8</italic> genes from soybean were constitutively expressed in all vegetative tissues (roots, stems, mature leaves and flowers) analyzed at optimal growth temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Like 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic>, the plastidial 
 <italic>PfrFAD7</italic> genes from 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens var</italic>. 
 <italic>frutescens</italic> were expressed at low levels during all developmental stages of seeds, when compared with expression levels in leaves [
 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, this result is also another proof to support 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> encodes a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, rather than the microsomal ω-3 fatty acid desaturase.
