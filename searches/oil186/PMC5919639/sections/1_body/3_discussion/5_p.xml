<p>In conclusion, we have isolated and identified a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic>) from oil palm. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> function of EgFAD8 has been confirmed by heterologously expression in yeast, with showing the conversion of linoleic to linolenic acid. Moreover, the expression profile of 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> also revealed that it mainly involved in the synthesis of chloroplast membrane, unlike ER-localized ω-3 fatty acids that is tightly correlated with the oil accumulation in seeds or fruits [

 <xref rid="pone.0196693.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the characterization of the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> promoter indicated that the 
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> gene could be induced by low temperature and darkness. Overall, these results will be helpful for understanding the function and regulation of plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in higher plants.
