<p>In this study, we identified and characterized the first chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (
 <italic>EgFAD8</italic>) from oil palm. It exhibited the capability of synthesizing 18:3 ω-3 when heterologously expressed in yeast with the exogenous supply of linoleic acid. However, there are three ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in Arabidopsis: the ER-localized FAD3 and two chloroplastic FAD7 and FAD8. When compared with fatty acid desaturases from Arabidopsis, EgFAD8 showed the highest similarity with the temperature-sensitive chloroplastic ω-3 fatty acid desaturase and AtFAD8 (data not shown). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of EgFAD8 revealed that it is grouped with AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 from Arabidopsis, but with more close relation with AtFAD8 (

 <italic>EgFAD8</italic> gene might encode a plastidial FAD8, which could be induced by low temperature [
