 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we identified and characterized the first chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>) from oil palm. It exhibited the capability of synthesizing 18:3 ω-3 when heterologously expressed in yeast with the exogenous supply of linoleic acid. However, there are three ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in Arabidopsis: the ER-localized FAD3 and two chloroplastic FAD7 and FAD8. When compared with fatty acid desaturases from Arabidopsis, EgFAD8 showed the highest similarity with the temperature-sensitive chloroplastic ω-3 fatty acid desaturase and AtFAD8 (data not shown). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of EgFAD8 revealed that it is grouped with AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 from Arabidopsis, but with more close relation with AtFAD8 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g001" href="#pone.0196693.g001">Fig 1</a>). Therefore, the bioinformatic analysis of EgFAD8 indicated that the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> gene might encode a plastidial FAD8, which could be induced by low temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref016">16</a>]. Nevertheless, more experimental evidence should be shown to support the results from sequence analysis although FAD8 sequences are highly conserved in plants [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the expression pattern in oil palm mesocarp at five developmental stages and leaves was also detected to see whether the expression level of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> is correlated with oil deposition in oil palm mesocarp. While, we can see 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> was predominately expressed in leaves, at least twice-fold as that of mesocarp. Moreover, the expression level of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> remains still during fruit ripening with a slight increase at the beginning. The majority of oil deposition in oil palm mesocarp occurs at the late stages (from phase 3 to phase 5) [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref032">32</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref035">35</a>]. Thus, the expression of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> is not correlated with oil accumulation in mesocarp. Similar patterns have been seen in the expression of 
  <span class="italic">FAD8</span> in other plant species [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref017">17</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">GmFAD8</span> genes from soybean were constitutively expressed in all vegetative tissues (roots, stems, mature leaves and flowers) analyzed at optimal growth temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref013">13</a>]. Like 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>, the plastidial 
  <span class="italic">PfrFAD7</span> genes from 
  <span class="italic">Perilla frutescens var</span>. 
  <span class="italic">frutescens</span> were expressed at low levels during all developmental stages of seeds, when compared with expression levels in leaves [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref017">17</a>]. Therefore, this result is also another proof to support 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> encodes a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, rather than the microsomal ω-3 fatty acid desaturase.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to study the 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> function of EgFAD8, it has been successfully expressed in 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">cerevisiae</span>. However, there is no linoleic acid (18:2) produced in yeast. So the exogenous supply of 18:2 is needed for studying the activity of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase. The result from GC analysis indicated that the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> transformed yeast cells could produce slight amounts of 18:3 using the exogenous 18:2. At least, this result confirmed the 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> activity of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase encoded by 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> from oil palm. While, the amount of 18:3 produced by the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> transformed yeast is very limited. There might be three possible reasons as follows: first, the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> gene is likely to encode a chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, rather than the ER-localized desaturase; thus it could not participate in the synthesis of storage oil in oil palm mesocarp. Likewise, when expressed in yeast cells, EgFAD8 might just be involved in the desaturation of galactolipids in the plastid. Second, EgFAD8 has been predicted to be temperature-sensitive desaturase by bioinformatic analysis. The yeast growth condition at 30 °C might not intrigue the large expression of transformed gene 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>. Third, the exogenous supply of 18:2 might be a bit unhealthy or toxic for yeast cell. So, the coexpression of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase with ω-6 fatty acid desaturase in yeast might be a better solution than feeding with 18:2 in the yeast culture. However, the 
  <span class="italic">JcFAD7</span> from 
  <span class="italic">Jatropha curcas</span> also showed the similar result when expressed in yeast, producing about 2.5% of 18:3 in transformed cells [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref024">24</a>]. Therefore, the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> gene from oil palm encodes a ω-3 fatty acid desaturase.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, in order to elucidate the physiological role of EgFAD8, we also detected whether the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> promoter could be affected by the environmental stress including low-temperature and darkness treatments. In our previous study, the activity of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis has been characterized (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196693.s001" href="#pone.0196693.s001">S1 Fig</a>) [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref044">44</a>]. The GUS staining results indicated that the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> promoter has the expected capability to drive transgene expression in all tissues tested, except with very weak expression in roots (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196693.s001" href="#pone.0196693.s001">S1 Fig</a>). Thus, we used the 
  <span class="italic">ProEgFAD8</span>::
  <span class="italic">GUS</span> transgenic plants for the stress treatment analysis, since the EgFAD8 promoter is constitutively active in transgenic Arabidopsis. The results revealed that the GUS activity of the transgenic plants under the darkness and low temperature treatment was increased by 26% and 14-folds after 48-hour treatment when compared with that of the control, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196693.g004" href="#pone.0196693.g004">Fig 4</a>). So the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> gene from oil palm could be significantly induced by low temperature and slightly induced by darkness. This is consistent with the induction expression of 
  <span class="italic">AtFAD8</span> from Arabidopsis when treated at 4 °C [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref050">50</a>]. Similarly, the 
  <span class="italic">PoleFAD8</span> transcript level of 
  <span class="italic">Portulaca oleracea</span> L. also increased significantly after treatment at 5 °C [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref051">51</a>]. As expected, this result also evidenced that the chloroplastic 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> from oil palm is cold-inducible. On the other hand, lots of light regulatory elements were predicted in the promoter of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> by PlantCARE [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref044">44</a>]. The result of the darkness treatment on transgenic plants is also consistent with the bioinformatic prediction. The darkness could slightly induce the expression of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>. While, the mechanism that the light regulates the expression of 
  <span class="italic">FAD8</span> still remains obscure. Our hypothesis is that more chloroplasts are needed for fatty acid synthesis in the dark than in the light, since the rate of fatty acid synthesis in leaves is six-fold higher in the light than in the dark [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref002">2</a>]. Thus, to maintain the constitutive function, more chloroplasts are synthesized in the leave cells, and the expression level of genes encoding the corresponding enzymes involved in the synthesis of chloroplast might be up-regulated. FAD8 is responsible for the polyunsaturated components of chloroplast membranes [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref016">16</a>]. However, the related mechanism needs to be elucidated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have isolated and identified a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span>) from oil palm. The 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> function of EgFAD8 has been confirmed by heterologously expression in yeast, with showing the conversion of linoleic to linolenic acid. Moreover, the expression profile of 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> also revealed that it mainly involved in the synthesis of chloroplast membrane, unlike ER-localized ω-3 fatty acids that is tightly correlated with the oil accumulation in seeds or fruits [
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0196693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196693.ref025">25</a>]. Furthermore, the characterization of the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> promoter indicated that the 
  <span class="italic">EgFAD8</span> gene could be induced by low temperature and darkness. Overall, these results will be helpful for understanding the function and regulation of plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in higher plants.
