 <p>In higher plants, ω-3 fatty acid desaturases are the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3), which plays key roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of both storage and membrane lipids. Here, the first ω-3 fatty acid desaturase gene was identified and characterized from oil palm. The bioinformatic analysis indicated it encodes a temperature-sensitive chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, designated as 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic>. The expression analysis revealed that 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic> is highly expressed in the oil palm leaves, when compared with the expression in the mesocarp. The heterologous expression of 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic> in yeast resulted in the production of a novel fatty acid 18:3 (about 0.27%), when fed with 18:2 in the induction culture. Furthermore, to detect whether 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic> could be induced by the environment stress, we detected the expression efficiency of the 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic> promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively. The results indicated that the promoter of 
  <italic>EgFAD8</italic> gene could be significantly induced by low temperature and slightly induced by darkness. These results reveal the function of EgFAD8 and the feature of its promoter from oil palm fruits, which will be useful for understanding the fuction and regulation of plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in higher plants.
