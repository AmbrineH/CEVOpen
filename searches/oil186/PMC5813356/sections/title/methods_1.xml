  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> leaves, stems and aerial parts (leaves+stems) collected in two different periods, 2013 and 2015, and their components by GC/FID and GC/MS analyses were investigated. Those collected in 2013 were also re-analyzed two years later. The extracted oils were screened in vitro for anti-leishmanial activity on 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania mexicana mexicana</span> (
  <span class="italic">L.m.m.</span>) promastigotes and cytotoxicity on the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Limonene (1.5 â€“ 8%), its isomers (
