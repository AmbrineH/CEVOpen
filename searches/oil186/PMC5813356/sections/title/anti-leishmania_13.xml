 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in vitro anti-leishmanial effects of essential oils from the leaves (LEO), stems (SEO) and the aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">H. tuberculatum</span> (LSEO) were investigated on 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania mexicana mexicana</span> (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. The solutions were prepared in DMSO at 20 mg/ml. Parasites in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 96-well culture plates. Essential oils and compounds were tested in eight serial threefold dilutions (0.05-100 μg/ml, 2 wells/concentration). Amphotericin B was used as positive control with an initial concentration of 1μg/ml. The plate was kept at 28°C and after 72 h of incubation, 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> viability was calculated by quantification of Alamar Blue fluorescence (10 μl diluted two times in PBS/well incubated 4h), using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission one of 590 nm on a SpectraMax M2e (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer. Assays were performed in triplicate to calculate IC
