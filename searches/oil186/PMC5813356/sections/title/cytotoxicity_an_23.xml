 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cytotoxicity of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>-(+)-limonene was a little higher than that described by Kpoviessi et al. (2014) but the difference (factor less than 2) may be explained by the general biological variability of cells in culture. Moreover, our study showed that 1-octanol and linalool (CC

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies showed that promastigotes cultures are a validated model for primary screening. Promastigotes are known to be less sensitive than amastigotes to drugs and allow a restricted selection of the most active samples before performing an intracellular amastigotes test [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. However, as shown by the present results, the EOs have high cytotoxicity and the selectivity indices are not encouraging enough to proceed to the intracellular tests.
