<p id="Par39">Among the pure compounds, 
 <italic>R</italic>-(+)-limonene was the most active one (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.59 μg/ml) compared to inactive 
 <italic>S</italic>-(-)-limonene, linalool and 1-octanol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100μg/ml). It can explain a part of the anti-leishmanial activity but other active compounds still remain to be identified. Kpadonou Kpoviessi et al., 2014 also, showed that 
 <italic>R</italic>-(+)-limonene had an antitrypanosomal effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=4.24 ±2.27 μg/mL on 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> bloodstream forms [

 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes and amastigotes with LD
