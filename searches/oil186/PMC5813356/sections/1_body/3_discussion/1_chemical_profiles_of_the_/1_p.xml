<p id="Par35" class="p">Literature review showed variation between chemical compositions, depending on the location and stages of development of 
 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic>. Reports from Oman [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], Iran [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] and the United Arab Emirates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] showed a difference between the major compounds. The comparison of the chemical composition from the different parts of our 
 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> with that of 
 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> from Oman showed that the main compounds varied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Indeed, the main compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> from Oman were beta-phellandrene (23.3%), limonene (12.6%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (12.3%), beta-caryophyllene (11.6%), myrcene (11.3%), and alpha-phellandrene (10.9%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Another study showed that the main constituents of the EO from the aerial parts were limonene (27.3%) and Î±-pinene (21.9%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the composition of the EO varied also according to the collecting season.
