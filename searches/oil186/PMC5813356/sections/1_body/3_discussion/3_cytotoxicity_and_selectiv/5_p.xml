<p id="Par45">No cytotoxicity was observed for 1-octanol. Published data on the cytotoxicity of other 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic> components showed a great activity variability according to used cell types. Alpha-pinene was cytotoxic on K562 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=117.3μM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], HL-60 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=2.5 μg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], A-549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=183.2 μg/mL), HeLa (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=172.7 μg/mL), but not on Vero, macrophages and HT-29 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Sabinene (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=23.6 μg/mL) and α-phellandrene (IC
 <sub>50</sub>= 26.9μg/mL) were cytotoxic on HL-60, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The cytotoxicity of β-pinene was studied on CHO and WI38 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;50 μg/mL), HL-60 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=29.6μg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and K562 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=157.4μM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Myrcene showed an activity on HepG2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>= 9.23μg/ml), B16-F12 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=12.27μg/ml) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], but not on Vera, macrophages, A 549, HT 29, CHO, PBMC and WI38 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. 
 <italic>p</italic>-Cymene exhibited a cytotoxic effect on B16-F12 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=20.06 μg/mL) but not on CHO, WI38 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], HepG2 and on PBMC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. 4-Terpineol demonstrated an effect on HL-60 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=20.5μg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and on AE17 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.02%; 0.01%), B16 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>= 0.05%; 0.04%), HF32 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.1%; 0.1%) after 24 and 48h, respectively [
