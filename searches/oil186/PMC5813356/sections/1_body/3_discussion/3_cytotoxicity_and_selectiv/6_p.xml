 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> organic extracts possess a high cytotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. This cytotoxicity may be explained by the cytotoxic lignans already identified in this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. However, it cannot explain cytotoxicity of its essential oils which should not contain these lignans.
