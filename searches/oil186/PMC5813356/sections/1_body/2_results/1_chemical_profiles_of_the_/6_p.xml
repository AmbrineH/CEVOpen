<p id="Par29">Dissimilarity was noted in the Anlz2 and Anlz3. Eight compounds were detected in the Anlz3 but not in Anlz2: ethyl isovalerate, α-phellandrene, α-thujene, 
 <italic>(E)</italic>-β-ocimene, 2-methylbutyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl benzoate, germacrene D, α-zingiberene. However, octanal, α-terpinene, 1-octanol, 2-nonanone, pinocarvone, 1-nonanol, 1-dodecene, 3-methyl-3-hexen-1-yl butanoate, 
 <italic>(Z)</italic>-3-hexenyl isovalerate, hexyl isovalerate, cumin aldehyde, 
 <italic>(Z)</italic>-3-tridecene, 2-undecanol,

 <italic>p</italic>-menth-1-en-7-al, geranyl acetate, 1-decanol acetate, 2-phenylethyl isovalerate, kessane, γ-dodecalactone, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-14-
 <italic>nor</italic>-muurol-5-en-4-one were not identified in the Anlz3. The monoterpene hydrocarbons increased in the EO of all parts, from 6.3% to 8.8%; from 10.2 to 23.2% and from 17.2 to 33.8% for LEO, SEO and LSEO respectively. Moreover, the oxygenated monoterpenes increased from 64.8% to 65.6% for LEO, decreased from 56.7% to 54.3% and from 51.4% to 46.0% for SEO and LSEO respectively. However, the non-terpene derivatives decreased in all the oils. They were ranging from 23.4% to 21.4%, from 22.8% to 18.6 and from 27.2%to 19.0% for for LEO, SEO and LSEO respectively. In general, 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic> EO were characterized by high percentages of oxygenated monoterpenes followed by hydrocarbon monoterpenes and non-terpene derivatives.
