<p id="Par34">The selectivity index (SI) for LEO extracted in 2013 and 2015 and LSEO 2013 were 4.86, 4.15 and 4.29, respectively, showing that they were less toxic on CHO cells than 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. However, in all cases, they are lower than 10, the minimum value defined for the selection of an anti-parasitic hit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus these oils could perhaps be used safely at therapeutic concentration in short term treatments but 
 <italic>R</italic>- (+)-limonene (SI=1.79) cannot be considered as a drug candidate for the development of anti-leishmanial agents.
