Essential oils and compounds were tested in eight serial threefold dilutions (0.05-100 μg/ml, 2 wells/concentration). Amphotericin B was used as positive control with an initial concentration of 1μg/ml. The plate was kept at 28°C and after 72 h of incubation, 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> viability was calculated by quantification of Alamar Blue fluorescence (10 μl diluted two times in PBS/well incubated 4h), using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission one of 590 nm on a SpectraMax M2e (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer. Assays were performed in triplicate to calculate IC
