<p id="Par14" class="p">The main aim of the present study is to analyze the volatile oils of different 
 <italic class="italic">H. tuberculatum</italic> parts collected during two different seasons, to evaluate their anti-leishmanial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">L. mexicana mexicana</italic> promastigote forms and their cytotoxic activities against CHO cells in an in vitro model. In order to relate the oils bioactivities to pure components ones, a major compound, limonene, and two minor ones, octanol and linalool, were tested in vitro. The other identified major compounds, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-p-menth-2-en-1-ol, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-p-menth-2-en-1-ol, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-piperitol are not commercially available.
