Juss) species was collected at the end of December 2012 and May 2015 from Beni Ghzayel, Medenine, an arid region in Tunisia (33°21′17″ North 10°30′19″ East). The herbarium specimens were authenticated with their morphological and anatomical features in the Botany Department, Faculty of Pharmacy Monastir Tunisia and Botany Department of Faculty of Sciences Sfax Tunisia, according to the flora of Tunisia [

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About 100 g of fresh plant parts (leaves and/or stems or roots) was subjected to a 3 h hydrodistillation with 500 ml of distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus (Clevenger, 1928). The leaves (L), stems (S), and leaves+stems (LS) essential oils (EO) obtained were separated from the distilled water and dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate. No oil was obtained from the roots part. The volatile extracts were stored in sealed glass vials at 4-5 °C.</p>

Analyze 1 (Anlz1) referred to the oils extracted in 2013 and analyzed in 2014. The oils samples were re-analyzed in 2016, mentioned as Analyze 2 (Anlz2), in order to study the stability of the components.
