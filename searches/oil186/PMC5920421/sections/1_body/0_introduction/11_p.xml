<p>Others two papers are related to the effect of thyme and savory EOs on specific foods: Santoro et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported the effect on the control of postharvest diseases and quality of peaches and nectarines, while Banani et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported its efficacy on apples. In the first work the authors concluded that both EOs favor a reduction of brown rot incidence (caused by 
 <italic>Monilinia fructicola</italic>) but increased gray mold (caused by 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>). Respect to the overall quality of the fruits, both EOs showed a positive effect in reducing weight loos and in maintaining ascorbic acid and carotenoid content. Regarding the second study, apples treated with these EOs showed lower gray mold severity and incidence and the authors reported that the PR-8 gene of apple may play a key role in the mechanism implicated in this inhibition.
