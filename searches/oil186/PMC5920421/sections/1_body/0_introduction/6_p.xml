 <xref rid="B6-foods-07-00056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] the authors focused their interest in EOs from some officinal plants from the Abruzzo territory (Italy), assessing the whole chemical characterization of their volatile fraction and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. All these analyses allow establishing which of them could be better candidates for their potential application as biopreservatives depending on the type of food to be incorporated. In addition, the characterization of EOs autochthonous from a specific region will allow their application by local industries contributing to their development.
