 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the light stability tests we exposed the samples to a UV-A lamp (Spectroline EA-160), while for the heat stability we placed the samples in an oven at 60 ± 3 °C. In the combined light and heat stability tests we placed the oil containing vials at the bottom of a thermic bath (ISOTEMP 205) at 60 ± 3 °C surmounted with the UV-A lamp.</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied ASTM-D5768 to measure the iodine value of the essential oil, which represents the degree of unsaturation: the iodine reacts with the double bonds, also known as the Wijs procedure.</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We reported the acid value as g of KOH required to neutralize 100 g of sample.</p>
