NPL is susceptible to degradation due to UV, heat and oxygen, which requires additional packaging to reduce light exposure. Average temperatures in north Africa hover well over 30 °C while the average temperature in the central Burundian plateau is 20 °C

  </span>. Sun radiation heats surface temperatures of inanimate objects well above 50 °C but plant transpiration through stomatal apertures maintains leaves and the trichomes at a lower temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). NPL degradation will be most prevalent after the extraction process.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature, light, and oxygen deteriorate essential oils’ integrity and lower the active component concentration. As a bicyclic, monounsaturated terpenoid, nepetalactone undergoes primary oxidation to unstable products, i.e. hydroperoxides, which then convert into stable secondary oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, epoxides, peroxides, but especially acids
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Heat and light promote the cleavage of the unique double bond in nepetalactone by epoxidation or allylic oxidation into alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Many of these constituents may be skin irritants, which would reduce their desirability as a topical treatment.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water is an inexpensive solvent to dilute the active ingredients for cutaneous applications; however, NPL is poorly soluble in water. Blending it with vegetable oil or another solvent increases the overall cost of the lotion. An alternative is to generate a Pickering emulsion stabilized with silica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. This may also reduce NPL’s volatility and thereby increase the effectiveness of a single application. We tested nepetalactone stability with respect to temperature at 60 °C and to light with a UV-A lamp at 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> = 365 nm (Spectroline EA-160) for both pure 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> oil (7 d) and a 10% 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> essential oil emulsion over 140 d and measured their iodine and acid values.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Iodine value (IV) measures the number of unsaturations, i.e. both the tendency of a substance to oxidize, as well as the number of unsaturations loss from oxidation, thus being an indirect measure of the essential oil light and heat stability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. The IV does not differentiate between primary and secondary oxidation. The IV of the reference oil, preserved from heat and light, was 59 g I
  <sub>2</sub>/100 g oil. The IV of the 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> Pickering emulsion before heat and/or light exposure was 2.7 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Besides the obvious decrease of the IV because of dilution, moisture may saturate double bonds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. The IV of the 10% 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> Pickering emulsion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> decreased by 68% in 140 days, whereas the IV of the emulsion exposed to heat and-or light decreased by over 90% in 7 days, indicating a more severe oxidation of the double bonds (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The acid value (AV) of pure 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> oil reaches 4% in 7 days, while it increases much slower for the emulsion. The AV of the 
  <span class="italic">N. cataria</span> Pickering emulsion increases the most in the presence of both light and heat. The AV of the reference sample rises 4-fold in 140 days (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). It increases 6-fold in 140 days for the emulsion exposed to either heat or light and 9-fold in 3 weeks for the sample exposed to light and heat. For an ester terpenoid such as nepetalactone, organic acids are either the products of ester hydrolysis, or the secondary oxidation products. Rajeswara Rao 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> did not report significant physicochemical changes in essential oils stored in water, even at 20% (v/v). Therefore, double bond oxidation is the most probable pathway to organic acids, confirmed by a concomitant decrease in the IV.
