Tests with ultrasound at temperatures from ambient to 60 °C with water and ethanol extracted chlorophyll together with some oil but yields were low. Furthermore, sonication at 20 W (frequency of 20 kHz) destroyed the leaf, which indicates that too much power was applied and that it is not selectively activating the trichomes. Therefore, here we extracted the essential oil with steam distillation.

As a bicyclic, monounsaturated terpenoid, nepetalactone undergoes primary oxidation to unstable products, i.e. hydroperoxides, which then convert into stable secondary oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, epoxides, peroxides, but especially acids

   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). It increases 6-fold in 140 days for the emulsion exposed to either heat or light and 9-fold in 3 weeks for the sample exposed to light and heat. For an ester terpenoid such as nepetalactone, organic acids are either the products of ester hydrolysis, or the secondary oxidation products. Rajeswara Rao

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During a one-month trial, the majority of the participants (52/60) applied the lotion correctly while 7 individuals applied the lotion sporadically: 5 individuals applied the lotion 3 times before sleeping, 40 applied it 2 times and 15 applied it only once. In general, most of the individuals (91.6%) apply lotions after a shower to keep skin hydrated while 5 men do not routinely apply lotions. Among the adolescents and adults (31 participants), most found the odor tolerable while 10 stated that it was strong smelling (pungent). The side effects (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) included sneezing, feeling nauseous, and vomiting, but only 6 individuals reported these effects.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost everyone agreed that the lotion reduced how often they were bitten. Only one individual said that it was ineffective and that they were bitten as often with the repellent; 55 individuals said that they were not bitten after applying the lotion (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Here we assign a value of 2 to individuals finding the essential oil effect effective and 1 to those who did not. Assuming the responses are normally distributed, the p-value was 0.001 for a null hypothesis that the essential oil was ineffective, which allows us to conclude that it was effective.
