<p id="Par17">Almost everyone agreed that the lotion reduced how often they were bitten. Only one individual said that it was ineffective and that they were bitten as often with the repellent; 55 individuals said that they were not bitten after applying the lotion (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Here we assign a value of 2 to individuals finding the essential oil effect effective and 1 to those who did not. Assuming the responses are normally distributed, the p-value was 0.001 for a null hypothesis that the essential oil was ineffective, which allows us to conclude that it was effective.
