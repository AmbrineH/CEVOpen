<p id="Par11" class="p">Producing mosquito repellents locally minimizes transportation, distribution, and storage costs. NPL is susceptible to degradation due to UV, heat and oxygen, which requires additional packaging to reduce light exposure. Average temperatures in north Africa hover well over 30 °C while the average temperature in the central Burundian plateau is 20 °C

 </sup>. Sun radiation heats surface temperatures of inanimate objects well above 50 °C but plant transpiration through stomatal apertures maintains leaves and the trichomes at a lower temperature (Fig.
