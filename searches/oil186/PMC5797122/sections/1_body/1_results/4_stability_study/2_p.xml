<p id="Par12">Temperature, light, and oxygen deteriorate essential oilsâ€™ integrity and lower the active component concentration. As a bicyclic, monounsaturated terpenoid, nepetalactone undergoes primary oxidation to unstable products, i.e. hydroperoxides, which then convert into stable secondary oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, epoxides, peroxides, but especially acids
