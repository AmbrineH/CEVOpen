<p id="Par15">The acid value (AV) of pure 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic> oil reaches 4% in 7 days, while it increases much slower for the emulsion. The AV of the 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic> Pickering emulsion increases the most in the presence of both light and heat. The AV of the reference sample rises 4-fold in 140 days (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). It increases 6-fold in 140 days for the emulsion exposed to either heat or light and 9-fold in 3 weeks for the sample exposed to light and heat. For an ester terpenoid such as nepetalactone, organic acids are either the products of ester hydrolysis, or the secondary oxidation products. Rajeswara Rao

 </sup> did not report significant physicochemical changes in essential oils stored in water, even at 20% (v/v). Therefore, double bond oxidation is the most probable pathway to organic acids, confirmed by a concomitant decrease in the IV.
