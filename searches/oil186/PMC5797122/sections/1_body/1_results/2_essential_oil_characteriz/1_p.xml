<p id="Par8">The three principal compounds extracted from 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic> in Burundi were 4a
 <italic>α</italic>,7α,7aβ-nepetalactone (72%), β-caryophyllene (10%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-ocimene (4%). The data from this study compare well with other published results describing the composition of catnip oil from various geographical regions around the world. Asgarpanah 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup> isolated the essential oils of the 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> genus and found that 34% of the species contained 4aα,7α,7aα-nepetalactone while 20% (including 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic>) contained the epimer 4aα,7α,7aβ-nepetalactone and 10 plants of 41 contained 4aβ,7α,7aβ-nepetalactone. A GC-MS measured the composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic> grown in Burundi (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, supplementary material). Chalchat and Lamy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> did not find nepetalactone in the essential oil isolated from wild catnip 
 <italic>N. cataria L. cv. citriodora</italic> grown in the Drôme region: the major constituents were nerol, geraniol and citronellol. Gilani 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup> reported 1,8-cineole, α-humulene (14%) and α-pinene as the 3 major constituents in commercial catnip oil. Other compounds found at relatively higher concentration included α-pinene, limonene and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-ocimene. The differences in catnip oil composition (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are due to extraction techniques, and environmental and agricultural factors like chemotype, soil, growing region, meteorology, pests, drying and extraction methods, etc.
