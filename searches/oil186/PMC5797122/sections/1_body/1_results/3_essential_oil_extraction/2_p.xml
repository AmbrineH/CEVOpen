<p id="Par10">Much of the forests in Burundi, for example, have disappeared as the rural population relies on wood to cook. Alternative energy sources to extract oil include coffee husks (Fig.

 </sup> to increase their energy density. Micro-wave and ultrasound are alternatives to steam distillation with solar energy as the vector to produce electricity. Tests with ultrasound at temperatures from ambient to 60 °C with water and ethanol extracted chlorophyll together with some oil but yields were low. Furthermore, sonication at 20 W (frequency of 20 kHz) destroyed the leaf, which indicates that too much power was applied and that it is not selectively activating the trichomes. Therefore, here we extracted the essential oil with steam distillation.
