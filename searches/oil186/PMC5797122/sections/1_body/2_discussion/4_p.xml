<p id="Par21">Mosquitos are developing resistance to insecticide treated nets and they are changing their feeding habits to adapt to the reduced availability of their prey during the night. These adaptations by the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito requires new strategies to ensure that the world malaria death rates continue to decline. We recommend that local populations grow and produce their own mosquito repellent with sustainable resources like coffee husks, bagasse, or other waste lignocellulosic feeds stocks. More work is required to identify alternative energy sources and extraction technologies that are more efficient to isolate the essential oil. Furthermore, we recognize that mosquitos may also develop a tolerance for any repellent and therefore, we must continue to develop other agriculturally based compounds to protect vulnerable populations, particularly children and pregnant women.
