 <italic>Plectranthus marrubioides (Lamiaceae)</italic>, 
 <italic>Lippia javanica (Verbenaceae)</italic>, 
 <italic>Tetradenia riparia (Lamiaceae)</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>Tarchonanthus camphoratus (Asteraceae)</italic>. The oils, under their experimental conditions (3 min, forearm exposure), repelled mosquitoes better than DEET. 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic>, commonly known as catnip or catmint, is a species of the Lamiaceae family. It is native to temperate and tropical zones in Asia and in Europe and is widely cultivated
