 </sup> estimated that 212 million cases of malaria occurred, leading to 419 000 deaths – 82% of casualties are in sub-Saharan Africa. Children under the age of 5 account for 64% of victims. Malaria’s mortality rate dropped by 31% between 2010 and 2015 in Africa and the life expectancy of children under 5 increased by 1.2 years. However, in 80% of malaria endemic countries, mosquitos developed resistance to at least one insecticide. Furthermore, in Burundi, deaths have increased by 13% in the last year
