<p id="Par6" class="p">Introducing plant based mosquito repellents to vulnerable populations faces economic challenges but also societal and governmental hurdles. Furthermore, they must be nontoxic with respect to dermal and eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation. Unlike synthetic repellents, the chemical composition of essential oils, like 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic>, contain dozens of compounds (Supplemental information S1). The active ingredient must demonstrate its efficacy versus alternatives but they must also be stable with respect to UV exposure, oxidation and high temperature (&gt;40 °C). Moreover, to achieve the largest possible distribution at the lowest cost, local populations must grow, harvest and extract the active ingredients. Birkett and Pickett discovered the efficacy of nepetolactone and nepetolactol in repelling aphids. They distilled the catnip with steam and cyclohexane vapors then reduced the oil with NaBH

 </sup>. Here we address the challenges of cultivating 
 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic> in Burundi and developing a topical mosquito repellent. We compare the composition of the essential oil versus those cultivated throughout the world and measure the thermal stability and its stability versus UV. Finally, we demonstrate that the population is ready to test the mosquito repellents formulated with vegetable oil or as Pickering emulsions based on an acceptability study we conducted in a rural and urban region of the country.
