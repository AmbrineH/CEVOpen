<p id="Par29">After meeting with presidential staff and ministers of health and agriculture, students in the faculty of medicine developed a strategy to assess the population’s acceptability of applying mosquito repellents daily. We produced a lotion that contained a mixture of 5% nepetalactone in vegetable oil, almond oil and citronella. In 2011 from March 3
 <sup>rd</sup> to April 3
 <sup>rd</sup>, the students followed 8 families in Kamenge (an urban neighborhood of Bujumbura) as selected by the non-governmental agency ALUMA respecting pre-established selection criteria and 4 families in the rural community of Cibitoke (selected by the local hospital). Both were hyper endemic malaria regions. Each family received 2 bottles with 100 mL of the lotion. The volunteers included one pregnant woman, 10 children younger than 5 y, 19 children from 5 to 11 y, 11 adolescents from 12 to 20 y, and 20 adults older than 20 y of which most of these were farmers (17). There were 32 males and 28 females in the study. Most individuals (45%) were in bed under impregnated mosquito nets by 21h00, while 32% were in bed by 22h00, and 10 children were in bed before 20h00.
