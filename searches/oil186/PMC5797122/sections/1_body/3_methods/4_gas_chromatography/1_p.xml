 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic> oil is a clear pale yellow liquid, with a refraction index of 1.4882 ± 0.0005 (23 °C). We diluted the samples in HPLC grade pentane (1:200). A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and another GC coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) quantified the main components of the essential oil. The GC-FID was equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while the GC-MS had a Solgel-Wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 m; SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, USA). We set both GCs injection port and detector temperature at 220 °C and 260 °C, respectively. Helium carried analytes at a flow rate of 1.4 mL/minute. Temperature remained at 40 °C for 2 minutes, then increased to 210 °C at a rate of 2 °C/minute. The split ratio was 50:1 and the injection volume was 3 microlites. The mass spectrometer operated in electron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, with a scan range of 40–550 amu and a scan speed of 1458.6 amu/s. The temperature of the MS interface was 300 °C. We computed FID peak areas without a correction factor. The retention times of n-alkanes with an even number of hydrocarbons (C8–C24) injected using the same analytical conditions determined the retention indices of the essential oil constituents. We qualitatively identified all the compounds from the NIST library
