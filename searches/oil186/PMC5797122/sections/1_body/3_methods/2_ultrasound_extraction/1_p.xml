<p id="Par23">A Sonics Vibracell Ultrasound probe delivered 20 W (500 W nominal power) to 20 mL of water and ethanol in which we added 1 leaf (approximately 0.2 g) of catnip collected before the plant flowered. Sonication lasted 1 min. A thermocouple measured the temperature of the liquid. We collected all samples in 2 mL glass vials. The reference samples were stored in a 500 mL hermetically sealed dark brown glass bottle that we covered in aluminum foil and stored in a chemical cabinet maintained at ambient temperature.</p>
