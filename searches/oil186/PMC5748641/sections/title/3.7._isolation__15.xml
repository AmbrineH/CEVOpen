 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">N. dissecta</span> (5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over a silica gel G60 column, applying an oil/silica weight ratio of 1:200, with a mixture of Hex:AcOEt 90:10 (isocratic elution), obtaining a total of five fractions and affording acorenone B as a pure compound (1.48 g). The identification was performed by spectroscopic techniques such as EI-MS, 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H, and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR. 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR spectra were acquired using a VARIAN NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H and 100 MHz for 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C), tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard, and chemical shifts are given in Î´ (ppm).
