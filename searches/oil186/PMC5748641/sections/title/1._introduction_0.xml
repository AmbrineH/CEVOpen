 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medicinal plants have been used for a long time as sources of new pharmaceuticals due to the presence of bioactive compounds [
  <a rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">1</a>]. Plants are rich in structurally diverse secondary metabolites displaying a wide range of biological activities, including possible leads for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [

  <a rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">3</a>]. Natural products have contributed greatly as sources for drug discovery for Alzheimer’s disease [
  <a rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">4</a>]. Earlier studies have shown that the maintenance of correct levels of acetylcholinesterases is directly related to different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia [
  <a rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">5</a>]. There are two distinct basic types of cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The main physiological function of AChE is the splitting of acetylcholine (ACh), a mediator of cholinergic synapses, during the transduction of nerve impulses [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AD is a prevalent disease that affects more than 26 million people globally, and is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide [
  <a rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">7</a>]. AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) have medical applications and are particularly important for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [
  <a rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">8</a>]. The butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) is synthesized in the liver and its main function is to hydrolyze hydrophobic and hydrophilic carboxylic or phosphoric acid ester containing compounds. Its toxicological and pharmacological importance becomes clear when an individual is exposured to poisonous compounds targeting the acetylcholine binding sites. When there is a hepatic alteration, its concentration decreases in direct relation with the altered hepatocytes [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The anti-AChE activity of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Eryngium campestre</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Eryngium amethystine,</span> two species of the Apiaceae family, is described in the work conducted by Cianfaglione et al. [
  <a rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">11</a>], showing that the inhibitory activity is very low (10.5% at 19.5 mg/mL) compared to the commercial inhibitor galanthamine. The activity was expressed as galanthamine equivalent inhibitory activity and the dose tested is similar to an inhibition exerted by 3 μg/mL of the positive control galanthamine. Likewise, the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Daucus aristidis</span> (Apiaceae) tested against AChE and BChE enzymes, by the Ellman method, at a concentration of 100 μg/mL appeared to have a moderate level of inhibitory effect (between 13% to 50%) against both enzymes as compared to that of galanthamine. The moderate AChE inhibitory activity of 
  <span class="italic">Daucus aristidis</span> essential oil could be explained by the highest concentration of its individual components, α- and β-pinene (over 70%) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species belonging to the Apiaceae family such as cumin, coriander, carrot, celery, and parsley are considered foods or spices; however, some of them contain highly toxic substances [

  <a rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">14</a>], and is widely distributed in the provinces of Loja, Azuay, Cañar, Carchi, Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Morona Santiago, Napo, Pichincha, and Zamora-Chinchipe. Traditionally, it is believed to have medicinal properties and it is used for the treatment of diarrhea, vomiting, inflammation of the belly, colds, and rheumatism [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of the present study is to assess the potential antimicrobial, antifungal, and anticholinesterase (AChE and BChE) activity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Niphogeton dissecta</span>, as well as to determine its chemical and physical properties. In addition, the phytochemical study of the essential oil led to the isolation and characterization of the known sesquiterpene acorenone B.
