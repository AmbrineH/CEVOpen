 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative analysis of the essential oil was performed on an Agilent Technologies gas chromatograph (model 6890N) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) and using a 7683 series autoinjector (Agilent, Little Falls, DE, USA). The percentage composition of the oil was determined by correlating GC peak areas to the total chromatogram, without applying any correction factor, but normalizing values with nonane as an internal standard. The qualitative analysis is expressed as the mean values of four injections and standard deviations. The analytical parameters were the same as the GC-MS analysis.</p>
