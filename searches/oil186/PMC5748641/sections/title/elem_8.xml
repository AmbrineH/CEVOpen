MIC values were determined by the micro-dilution broth method, using a final concentration of 5/105 CFU/mL. DMSO solutions of the sample were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Assays were carried out in 96-well plates and a two-fold serial dilution was used to obtain decreasing concentrations from 1000 to 0.024 mg/mL. The incubation was performed at 37 °C for 24 h.

ChEs efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine (ATCh), the sulfur analog of the natural substrate of these enzymes. Upon hydrolysis, this substrate analog produces acetate ion and thiocholine. Thiocholine, in the presence of the highly reactive dithiobisnitrobenzoate (DTNB) ion, generates a yellow color, which can be quantitatively monitored by spectrophotometric absorption at 412 nm. All reagents were obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich trading house. A typical 200 μL inhibition assay volume contained phosphate buffered saline solution (pH 7.4), DTNB (1.5 mM), test sample in DMSO (1%
