  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t002" href="#pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t002">Table 2</a>) of some chiral metabolites were determined on a cyclodextrine-based chiral stationary phase (MEGA-DEX-DET), comparing the retention time of separated enantiomers with enantiomerically pure standards. Two couples of chiral monoterpenoids were detected. The enantiomeric excesses of (+)-β-pinene and (+)-sabinene were quite considerable. These results further confirm that plants can also contain both enantiomers in the essential oil (
