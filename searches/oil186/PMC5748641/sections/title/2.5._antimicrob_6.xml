  <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</span> and

  <a rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-pharmaceuticals-10-00084">36</a>], an antibacterial activity is considered good when the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value is less than 100 Î¼g/mL, demonstrating that both the essential oil and acorenone B do not show inhibitory activity against the evaluated strains.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weak antimicrobial activity can be explained by the abundance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes in the investigated essential oil. In fact, hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes [
