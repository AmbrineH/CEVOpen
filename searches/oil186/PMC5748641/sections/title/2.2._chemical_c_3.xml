  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t001" href="#pharmaceuticals-10-00084-t001">Table 1</a> presents the components of the essential oil determined by GC-MS and quantified by GC-FID. Forty-one compounds were separated, which represented 96.46% of the total essential oil. The major compounds were acorenone B (41.01%), (E)-β-ocimene (29.64%), (3E)-butylidene phthalide (5.54%), and α-pinene (3.94%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes (42.31%) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (37.97%) were the most representative groups. This is the first report on the characterization of the essential oil distilled from
