 <p class="p">This study investigated the chemical composition, physical proprieties, biological activity, and enantiomeric analysis of the essential oil from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Niphogeton dissecta</italic> (culantrillo del cerro) from Ecuador, obtained by steam distillation. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the essential oil was realized by gas chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (GC-MS and GC-FID). Acorenone B was identified by GC-MS and NMR experiments. The enantiomeric distribution of some constituents has been assessed by enantio-GC through the use of a chiral cyclodextrin-based capillary column. We identified 41 components that accounted for 96.46% of the total analyzed, the major components were acorenone B (41.01%) and (E)-β-ocimene (29.64%). The enantiomeric ratio of (+)/(−)-β-pinene was 86.9:13.1, while the one of (+)/(−)-sabinene was 80.9:19.1. The essential oil showed a weak inhibitory activity, expressed as Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), against 
  <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC 10 mg/mL) and 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC 5 mg/mL). Furthermore, it inhibited butyrylcholinesterase with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 11.5 μg/mL. Pure acorenone B showed inhibitory activity against both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 40.8 μg/mL and 10.9 μg/mL, respectively.
