<p>The occurrence of acorenone B in 
 <italic>N. dissecta</italic> oil appears somewhat unusual because of the diversity of the sesquiterpenoid skeleton involved. According to Zalkow et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the proposed structure of acorenone B is considered to be derived from 
 <italic>trans</italic>–
 <italic>cis</italic>-farnesol via the β-bisabolyl cation.
