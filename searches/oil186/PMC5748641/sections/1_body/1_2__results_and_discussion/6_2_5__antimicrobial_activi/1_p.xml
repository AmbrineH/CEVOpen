 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], an antibacterial activity is considered good when the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value is less than 100 Î¼g/mL, demonstrating that both the essential oil and acorenone B do not show inhibitory activity against the evaluated strains.
