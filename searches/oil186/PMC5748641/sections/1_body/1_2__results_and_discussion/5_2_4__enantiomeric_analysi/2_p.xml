<p>It has been documented that sometimes different enantiomers may present dissimilar biological activities [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our essential oil, the enantiomeric excess of (+)-β-pinene was 73.8% with respect to (–)-β-pinene. Some studies have shown that the positive enantiomer has antimicrobial activity against
