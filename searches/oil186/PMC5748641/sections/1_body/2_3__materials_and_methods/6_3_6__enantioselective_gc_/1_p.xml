<p>Enantioselective GC-MS analysis was performed with the same Agilent Technologies instrument previously described. The mass spectrometer operated in electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV, with a mass range of

 <italic>z</italic> 40–350 full scan mode. The ion source temperature was set at 220 °C. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injector was operated in split mode (1:40) at 200 °C, with the transfer line at 230 °C. The oven thermal program was as follows: 60 °C for 2 min, then the temperature was raised to 220 °C with a gradient rate of 2 °C/min and held at 220 °C for 2 min. A chiral capillary column based on diethyl tertbutylsilyl-BETA-cyclodextrin (25m × 0.25mm × film thickness 0.25 μm) from Mega (Legnano, MI, Italy) was used. The essential oil was diluted 5:100 (
