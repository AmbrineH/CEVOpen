<p>Five pathogenic bacteria (ATCC): 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> ATCC 29212, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> ATCC 8427, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 9997 were included in the investigation. For all bacteria, except for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, a heart-heart infusion broth (BHI-DIFCO, DIFCO, Sparks, MD, USA) was used. All the strains were maintained at −80 °C until use, when they were withdrawn to prepare overnight cultures at 37 °C for 16 h. MIC values were determined by the micro-dilution broth method, using a final concentration of 5/105 CFU/mL. DMSO solutions of the sample were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Assays were carried out in 96-well plates and a two-fold serial dilution was used to obtain decreasing concentrations from 1000 to 0.024 mg/mL. The incubation was performed at 37 °C for 24 h. Gentamicin was used a positive control with an MIC value of 0.40 mg/mL, except for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> where ampicillin (MIC 1.56 mg/mL) was used.
