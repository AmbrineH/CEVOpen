 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Earlier studies have shown that the maintenance of correct levels of acetylcholinesterases is directly related to different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-10-00084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. There are two distinct basic types of cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The main physiological function of AChE is the splitting of acetylcholine (ACh), a mediator of cholinergic synapses, during the transduction of nerve impulses [
