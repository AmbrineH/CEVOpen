The activity was expressed as galanthamine equivalent inhibitory activity and the dose tested is similar to an inhibition exerted by 3 μg/mL of the positive control galanthamine. Likewise, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus aristidis</italic> (Apiaceae) tested against AChE and BChE enzymes, by the Ellman method, at a concentration of 100 μg/mL appeared to have a moderate level of inhibitory effect (between 13% to 50%) against both enzymes as compared to that of galanthamine. The moderate AChE inhibitory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus aristidis</italic> essential oil could be explained by the highest concentration of its individual components, α- and β-pinene (over 70%) [
