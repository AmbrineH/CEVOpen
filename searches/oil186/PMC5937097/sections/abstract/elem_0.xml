 <p>With the increase of neglected diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, there was a need for the search for new therapeutic alternatives that reduce the harm caused by medicine available for treatment. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the antiparasitic activity of the essential oil from the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Piper tuberculatum</span> Jacq, against lines of 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania braziliensis</span> (MHOM/CO/88/UA301), 
  <span class="italic">Leishmania infantum</span> (MHOM/ES/92/BCN83) and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma cruzi</span> (LC-B5 clone). Before running protocols, an analysis of the chemical composition of essential oil was conducted, which presented monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. As major constituents, β-pinene and α-pinene were identified. Regarding to antiparasitic activity, the essential oil had an EC
  <sub>50 </sub>values of 133.97 µg/mL and 143.59 µg/mL against variations promastigotes of 
  <span class="italic">L. infantum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L. braziliensis</span>, respectively. As for trypanocidal activity, the oil showed EC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 140.31 µg/mL against epimastigote form of 
  <span class="italic">T. cruzi</span>. Moreover, it showed moderate cytotoxicity in fibroblasts with LC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 204.71 µg/mL. The observed effect may be related to the presence of terpenes contained in the essential oil, since it has its antiparasitic activity proven in the literature.
