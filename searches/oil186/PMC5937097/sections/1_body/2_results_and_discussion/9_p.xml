<p class="p">Such compounds may be associated with the effects observed in this study, since the main constituent of α-pinene of

 <italic class="italic">P. cf. divaricatum</italic>, same genus species of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tuberculatum</italic> Jacq, was considered responsible for the effect against epimastigotes and amastigotes of
