<p>Such compounds may be associated with the effects observed in this study, since the main constituent of α-pinene of 
 <italic>P. bredermeyeri</italic> and 
 <italic>P. cf. divaricatum</italic>, same genus species of 
 <italic>P. tuberculatum</italic> Jacq, was considered responsible for the effect against epimastigotes and amastigotes of 
 <italic>T. Cruzi</italic> and promastigotes of
 <italic> L. infantum</italic>. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Other studies that have investigated this monoterpene alone showed significant results, justifying the effect obtained when using EOPT rich in α pinene. In the study of Sobral-Souza 
 <italic>et al</italic>., (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) the α-pinene in the concentration of 100 µg/mL was effective against strains of the parasite 
 <italic>L. braziliensis,</italic> corroborating the results found in this article.
