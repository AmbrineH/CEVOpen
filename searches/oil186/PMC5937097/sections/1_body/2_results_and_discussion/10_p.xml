<p class="p">Other compounds in EOPT were also tested against 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> spp. strains. Limonene also present in EOPT showed an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 252.6 µM/mL against epimastigote and promastigote of 
 <italic class="italic">L. braziliensis</italic> variations (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). In addition, Myrcene obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic> showed an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 164 µg/mL against cultures of promastigotes of 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Izumi (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>) noted that β-caryophyllene was effective against species of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania </italic>spp. showing a synergy when combined with copalic acid present in the essential oil of copaiba. This study helps to prove that the terpenes may have synergistic anti-parasitic activity, a finding that is quoted on some articles, though not proven.
