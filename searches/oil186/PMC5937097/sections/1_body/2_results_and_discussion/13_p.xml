<p>Some compounds derived from essential oils showed different mechanism of action. Î²-caryophyllene produced disorganization of kinetoplast, forming concentric membranous vacuoles, lipid peroxidation, and changes in cell membrane integrity (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This same compound is present in EOPT, suggesting that these EOPT may also have mechanisms of action. Other terpenes such as citral, presented antiparasitic activity against promastigotes of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> species by modifying the morphology and ultrastructure of the parasite, producing mitochondrial swelling, two flagella and exocytic projections of the flagellar bag (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The linalool also present in terpenes class produced significant changes of mitochondrial cristae parasites (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).
