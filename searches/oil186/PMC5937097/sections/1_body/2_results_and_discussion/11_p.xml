<p>Limonene in its isomeric forms was effective to reduce the number of strains of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigote where the R-limonene showed a lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> than S-limonene, showing greater efficiency (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The caryophyllene obtained an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 30 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL against epimastigote and promastigotes variations of 
 <italic>T. cruzi </italic>and 
 <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).
