 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. followed procedures described by Roldos 
 <italic>et al</italic>., (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The inhibitory action of these promastigotes forms were performed using the 
 <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> (MHOM / CO / 88 / UA301) and 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> lines (MHOM/ES/92/BCN83), cultured at 22 °C in Schneider’s Drosophila supplemented with 20% FBS.
