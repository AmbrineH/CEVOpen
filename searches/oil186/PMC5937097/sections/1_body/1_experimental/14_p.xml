<p class="p">The test was performed in microplates with 96 cavities with cultures in exponential phase, as described by Vega 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). The epimastigotes were inoculated at a concentration of 1 x 105 mL-1 in 200 μL of tryptose liver broth. The plates were then incubated with the drugs at concentrations of 100 and 500 μg/mL at 28 °C for 72 h. After this time, 50 μL of CPRG solution was added to achieve a final concentration of 200 μM. The plates were incubated for an additional period of 6 h at 37 °C and were subjected for visualization under 595 nm. Each experiment was carried out twice and independently, with each concentration triplicate tested in each experiment. The efficiency of each compound was estimated by calculating the percentage of anti-epimastigotes activity (EA%).
