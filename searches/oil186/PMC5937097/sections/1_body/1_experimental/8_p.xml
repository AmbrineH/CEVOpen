<p>For the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> tests for 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, CL-B5 clone was used (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The parasites stably transected with the gene for β-galactosidase of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (
 <italic>lacZ</italic>) were provided by Dr. F. Buckner through Commemorative Gorgas Institute (Panama). Epimastigotes forms were cultured at 28 °C in 
 <italic>Liver Infusion Tryptose Broth</italic> (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin (Ern, SA, Barcelona, Spain) and streptomycin (Reig Jofr SA, Barcelona, Spain) as described by Le Senne 
 <italic>et al</italic>., (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The cells were collected for testing in the exponential phase of growth.
