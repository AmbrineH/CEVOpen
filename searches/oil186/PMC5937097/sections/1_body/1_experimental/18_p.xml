<p>NCTC929 fibroblasts were plated in microdilution plates of 96 cavities at a final concentration of 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/cavity. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After that, the culture medium was removed and the compounds were added 200 μL, being carried out a new culture for 24 h. After this incubation, 20 μL of a 2 mM solution of Resazurin was added to each cavity. The plates were incubated for 3 h and the reduction of resazurin was determined by absorbance at dual wavelengths of 490 and 595 nm. The control value (blank) was subtracted.
