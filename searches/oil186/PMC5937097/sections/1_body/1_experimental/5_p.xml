<p class="p">Analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oil was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometer (CG/EM Shimadzu model QP5050A) and provided with a capillary column DB-5HT of fused silica with 30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and film of 0.25 μm, with helium as carrier gas and flow 0.8 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and the detector temperature (or interface) was 200 °C. The column temperature was programmed from 35 °C to 180 °C at 4 °C/min and then 180 °C to 250 °C at 10 °C/min. The mass spectra were recorded from 30-450
