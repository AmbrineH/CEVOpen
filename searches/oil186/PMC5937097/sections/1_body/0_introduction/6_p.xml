<p>In popular medicine, some species of the 
 <italic>Piper</italic> genus showed antiparasitic activity; therefore may be required for employment as an alternative therapy (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In developed studies, many compounds derived from 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species have proven their parasitic activities (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The 
 <italic>Piper betle</italic> extract showed activity against promastigotes of 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), 
 <italic>Piper chaba</italic> was effective against promastigotes of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> varieties (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), 
 <italic>Piper hispidum</italic> was effective against amastigote form of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and the extracts and fractions of 
 <italic>Piper ovatum</italic> showed activity against the promastigote and amastigote varieties of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Extracts and fractions of 
 <italic>Piper reginelli</italic> (Mic) DC. var pallescens (C. DC.) Yunck were effective against promastigote form of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
