<p>All essential oils showed antifungal activity. The concentration range at which the essential oils were active was close to that reported for the essential oil of 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> leaves against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The mechanisms of antifungal activity of essential oils seem to involve the disruption of cell membrane structure causing leakage and cell death, blocking of membrane synthesis, and cellular respiration as well as inhibition of the spore germination [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An essential oil from 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> leaves, containing the mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons decanal, trans-2-decenal, 2-decen-1-ol, and cyclodecane as major compounds, was active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> probably by binding to the membrane ergosterol, by increasing ionic permeability, and by decreasing proteolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The authors also demonstrated that this oil did not interfere with cell wall biosynthesis pathways and was most active than isolated fractions, which suggest a synergistic effect between the oil components.
