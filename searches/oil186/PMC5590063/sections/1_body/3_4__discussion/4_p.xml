<p>Antifungal activity has been also reported for oils containing other compounds found in the oils analyzed here. Spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene (both found in 
 <italic>M. peruiferum</italic> oil) were the main constituents of the essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>Croton argyrophylloides</italic>, which was active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. An essential oil from the rhizome of 
 <italic>Ferula hermonis</italic> containing mainly α-pinene (also present in 
 <italic>M. peruiferum</italic> oil) was active against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida lactis-condensi</italic>, 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>,

 <italic>Penicillium purpurogenum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors also reported that the compounds α-pinene and spathulenol were active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> when tested separately.
