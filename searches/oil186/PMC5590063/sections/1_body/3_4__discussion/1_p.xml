<p class="p">As mentioned before, mono and sesquiterpenes were the main compounds identified in the materials used in the present work, which is commonly reported for essential oils [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] evaluated an essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. peruiferum</italic> bark and found a chemical composition highly distinct from that found for the leaf oil. None of the majoritary compounds of the leaf oil was present in the bark oil, and two of the major compounds of the bark oil (α-copaene and δ-Cadinene) were detected in the leaf oil but in small concentrations. A similar situation is observed when comparing the composition of an essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">H. courbaril</italic> ripe fruit peel [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], and the leaf oil of 
 <italic class="italic">H. courbaril</italic> var. courbaril that we described. The main components of the fruit oil were α-copaene, spathulenol, and β-selinene (11.1%, 10.1%, and 8.2%, respectively), which were only present in small concentrations in the leaf oil (0.41%–1.99%).
