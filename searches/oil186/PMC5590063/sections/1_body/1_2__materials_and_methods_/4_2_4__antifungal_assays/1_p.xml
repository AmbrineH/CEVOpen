 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (URM-6557), and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (URM-6393) were obtained from the University Recife Mycologia (URM) from the 
 <italic>Departamento de Micologia</italic> of 
 <italic>Universidade Federal de Pernambuco</italic>. The yeasts were grown overnight at 30 Â°C in Petri plates containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and inocula for use in the assays were prepared by diluting scraped cell mass in 0.85% NaCl, adjusting to 0.5 in McFarland. Cell suspensions were finally diluted to 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL for use in the assays.
