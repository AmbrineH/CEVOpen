<p>All tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species were sensitive to the essential oils and MIC values ranged from 0.625 to 1.25 Î¼L/mL (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00027-t002">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> were more sensitive to the 
 <italic>V. guianensis</italic> oil, while 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> were more sensitive to the 
 <italic>H. courbaril</italic> oil. All the oils showed fungicidal activity and all 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains were sensitive to the positive control fluconazole (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00027-t002">Table 2</xref>). According to MFC/MIC ratios, the effect of all oils on the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species can be considered fungicidal.
