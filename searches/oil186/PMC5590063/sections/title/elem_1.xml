  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of 
   <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> were collected in December 2012, at the nature reserve of Camaçari (8°16′23′′ S, 34°57′45′′ W) at Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Pernambuco, Brazil, at an Atlantic Forest region. Leaves of 
   <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> var. 
   <span class="italic">courbaril</span> and 
   <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span> were collected in March 2013 at the Vale do Catimbau National Park (08°30′02.3′′ S, 37°20′31′′ W) in Pernambuco, Brazil, at a Caatinga region. For each plant, leaves were collected from at least 15 individuals and pooled for oil extraction. Plant collection was performed with authorization (number 16806) of the 
   <span class="italic">Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade</span> (ICMBio). Voucher specimens of 
   <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> var. 
   <span class="italic">courbaril</span> (number 84888), 
   <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span> (number 84110), and 
   <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> (number 90471) are deposited in the herbarium “Dárdano de Andrade Lima” from the 
   <span class="italic">Instituto Agronômico de Pernambuco</span>, Recife, Brazil. The leaves were dried at 28 °C, milled to a fine powder, and used immediately for the extraction of oils.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The powders of leaves were separately submitted to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 4 h. The essential oils obtained were then dried over an anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in sealed vials protected from the light at −20 °C. The essential oil emulsions used in antifungal assays were prepared as follows: 400 µL of essential oil plus 40 µL of Tween 80 and 4.56 mL of sterile distilled water were combined and shaken for 5 min using a vortex, obtaining emulsions with a final concentration of 80 μL/mL. </p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Chromatography Analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed in order to determine the relative proportions of the components of the oils. GC analyses were carried on a Thermo TraceGC Ultra (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) and a VB-5 fused silica capillary column (ValcoBond 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 mm) (Valco Instruments Company Inc. , Houston, TX, USA). Nitrogen was employed as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min and 30 psi inlet pressure. The oven temperature program was initially 40 °C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 °C at 4 °C/min, and was then held for 5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The sample (1 µL; 2 mg/mL in n-hexane) was injected splitless. The relative amount of each component was estimated from the corresponding peak area and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the chromatogram. Analyses were carried out in triplicate.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identification of the compounds present in the oils was performed by GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses were carried out using an Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) quadrupole instrument equipped with an Agilent J&amp;W non-polar DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 μm) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For each sample, 1 μL was injected in split mode (50:1) with the injector temperature set to 250 °C. GC oven temperature was set to 40 °C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 °C at 4 °C/min, and was then held for 5 min. Helium (He) was used as a carrier gas at a flow of 1 mL/min, maintained at a constant pressure of 7.0 psi. MS Source and quadrupole temperatures were set to 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV (in EI mode) with a scanning speed of 1.0 scans from 
   <span class="italic">m</span>/
   <span class="italic">z</span> 35–350. The identification of the individual components was carried out by comparison with previously reported values of retention indices, obtained by co-injection of oil samples and a set of C
   <sub>9</sub>–C
   <sub>30</sub> linear hydrocarbons, and calculated according to the equation of Van den Dool and Kratz [
   <a rid="B18-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-medicines-04-00027">18</a>]. Subsequently, the MS data acquired for each component were matched with the data available in the mass spectral library of the GC-MS system (MassFinder 4, Dr. Hochmuth scientific consulting, Hamburg, Germany); NIST08 Mass Spectral Library (ChemSW Inc. Fairfield, CA, USA); Wiley Registry™ of Mass Spectral Data 9th Edition (Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA) and with other published mass spectral data [
   <a rid="B19-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-medicines-04-00027">19</a>]. Analyses were carried out in triplicate.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strains of 
   <span class="italic">C. tropicalis</span> (URM-6741), 
   <span class="italic">C. krusei</span> (URM-6391), 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> (URM-6543), 
   <span class="italic">C. parapsilosis</span> (URM-6557), and 
   <span class="italic">C. glabrata</span> (URM-6393) were obtained from the University Recife Mycologia (URM) from the 
   <span class="italic">Departamento de Micologia</span> of 
   <span class="italic">Universidade Federal de Pernambuco</span>. The yeasts were grown overnight at 30 °C in Petri plates containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and inocula for use in the assays were prepared by diluting scraped cell mass in 0.85% NaCl, adjusting to 0.5 in McFarland. Cell suspensions were finally diluted to 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/mL for use in the assays. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the essential oils were determined through the microdilution technique. Firstly, 100 µL of Sabouraud dextrose broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were taken into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The first well of each row was used as a sterility control and contained only culture medium. Next, 100 µL of the emulsion of oil emulsion (80 μL/mL) were placed in the second well of a row and two-fold serial dilution was then performed until a concentration of 0.04 μL/mL was reached. In each well, aliquots of 10 µL of the microorganism inoculum were dispensed. In parallel, a negative control containing only microorganism and medium was run to assure the viability of the yeast strains. It was also performed a positive control using the antifungal fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Assays were performed in triplicate and plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After this period, 10 µL of the dye 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (0.5%, 
   <span class="italic">w</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span>) was added in each well to detect bacterial growth. The MIC was defined as the lowest oil concentration that promoted inhibition of yeast growth. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the determination of the MIC, aliquots from the wells where there was growth inhibition, as well as from positive and negative controls, were subcultured on Petri plates containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck). After 24 h at 30 °C, the microbial growth was observed and the number of CFU was counted. The minimal fungicide concentration (MFC) was defined as the lowest oil concentration that reduced the number of CFU in 99.9% in comparison with the initial inoculum. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the MFC/MIC ratio, the antifungal activity was classified as follows: if MFC/MIC = 1 or 2, the effect was considered fungicidal; if MFC/MIC ≥ 4, the effect was defined as fungistatic.</p>
