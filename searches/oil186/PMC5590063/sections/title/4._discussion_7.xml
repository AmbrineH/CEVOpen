 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned before, mono and sesquiterpenes were the main compounds identified in the materials used in the present work, which is commonly reported for essential oils [
  <a rid="B21-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-medicines-04-00027">21</a>]. Andrade et al. [
  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00027">22</a>] evaluated an essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span> bark and found a chemical composition highly distinct from that found for the leaf oil. None of the majoritary compounds of the leaf oil was present in the bark oil, and two of the major compounds of the bark oil (α-copaene and δ-Cadinene) were detected in the leaf oil but in small concentrations. A similar situation is observed when comparing the composition of an essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> ripe fruit peel [
  <a rid="B23-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-medicines-04-00027">23</a>], and the leaf oil of 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> var. courbaril that we described. The main components of the fruit oil were α-copaene, spathulenol, and β-selinene (11.1%, 10.1%, and 8.2%, respectively), which were only present in small concentrations in the leaf oil (0.41%–1.99%). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All essential oils showed antifungal activity. The concentration range at which the essential oils were active was close to that reported for the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Myrtus communis</span> leaves against 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00027">24</a>]. The mechanisms of antifungal activity of essential oils seem to involve the disruption of cell membrane structure causing leakage and cell death, blocking of membrane synthesis, and cellular respiration as well as inhibition of the spore germination [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00027">25</a>]. An essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</span> leaves, containing the mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons decanal, trans-2-decenal, 2-decen-1-ol, and cyclodecane as major compounds, was active against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> probably by binding to the membrane ergosterol, by increasing ionic permeability, and by decreasing proteolytic activity [
  <a rid="B26-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-medicines-04-00027">26</a>]. The authors also demonstrated that this oil did not interfere with cell wall biosynthesis pathways and was most active than isolated fractions, which suggest a synergistic effect between the oil components.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity of 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> var. courbaril, 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> oils can be linked to the major compounds caryophyllene oxide and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene. Caryophyllene oxide was proven to be an antifungal agent against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> [
  <a rid="B27-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-medicines-04-00027">27</a>], and Vieira et al. [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00027">28</a>] showed that essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">Piper diospyrifolium</span>, rich in 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene, was active against clinical isolates of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. parapsilosis</span>. Caryophyllene oxide also showed antifungal activity against dermatophytes compared to ciclopirox olamine and sulconazole [
  <a rid="B29-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-medicines-04-00027">29</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antifungal activity has been also reported for oils containing other compounds found in the oils analyzed here. Spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene (both found in 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span> oil) were the main constituents of the essential oil from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Croton argyrophylloides</span>, which was active against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Candida tropicalis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Microsporum canis</span> [
  <a rid="B30-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-medicines-04-00027">30</a>]. An essential oil from the rhizome of 
  <span class="italic">Ferula hermonis</span> containing mainly α-pinene (also present in 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span> oil) was active against 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Candida lactis-condensi</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Tricophyton mentagrophytes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Microsporum gypseum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus fumigates</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium purpurogenum</span> [
  <a rid="B31-medicines-04-00027" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-medicines-04-00027">31</a>]. The authors also reported that the compounds α-pinene and spathulenol were active against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> when tested separately.
