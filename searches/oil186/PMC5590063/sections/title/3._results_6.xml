 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yields of oil extraction were 0.975%, 0.276%, and 0.306% for 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span>, 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span>, respectively. The chemical composition of the essential oils can be seen in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00027-t001" href="#medicines-04-00027-t001">Table 1</a>. A total of 62 compounds were identified in the essential oils. The oils of the species 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span>, 
  <span class="italic">M. peruiferum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> were rich in mono and sesquiterpenes. The 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene and caryophyllene oxide were present in all the three oils.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All tested 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species were sensitive to the essential oils and MIC values ranged from 0.625 to 1.25 μL/mL (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00027-t002" href="#medicines-04-00027-t002">Table 2</a>). 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. krusei</span> were more sensitive to the 
  <span class="italic">V. guianensis</span> oil, while 
  <span class="italic">C. glabrata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. parapsilosis</span> were more sensitive to the 
  <span class="italic">H. courbaril</span> oil. All the oils showed fungicidal activity and all 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> strains were sensitive to the positive control fluconazole (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00027-t002" href="#medicines-04-00027-t002">Table 2</a>). According to MFC/MIC ratios, the effect of all oils on the 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> species can be considered fungicidal.
