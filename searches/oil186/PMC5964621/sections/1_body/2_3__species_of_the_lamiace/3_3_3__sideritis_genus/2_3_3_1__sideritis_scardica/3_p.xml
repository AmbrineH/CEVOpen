<p>Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated that the composition of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> oil samples, however, varies from region to region. In the oil from Macedonia, for example, 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-cadinol is predominant as compared to the Bulgarian version of the same plant oil which contains mostly diterpenic compounds and octadecenol. Interestingly, none contained menthol, nerol, or geraniol, which are the major components in the 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> oil from Yugoslavia [
