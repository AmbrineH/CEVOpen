<p>The pharmacological activity of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> is attributed to the high content of flavonoid and phenolic compounds. Studies have demonstrated that plants from the 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> genus have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, diuretic, antibacterial, analgesic, and antifungal effects [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In experimental ex vivo models, 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> showed a capacity to inhibit human serotonin transporter (hSERT) greater than in rat models [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Accordingly, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> test in rats showed that 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> extract administered orally has been associated with psychostimulant and antidepressive effects, being classified as perhaps a substitute for adaptogens and thus useful for other pathologies correlated with depressive or altered mental status like sleep apnea or increased cardiovascular risks [
