 <italic>Sideritis stricta</italic> Benth. is listed as an endangered plant and is being used as an aromatic and medicinal plant containing essential oils with antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiviral, and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The diterpenes composition was identified as sideroxol, 7-acetyl sideroxol, 7-epicandicandiol, linearol (5), ent-7
 <italic>α</italic>,15
 <italic>β</italic>,18-trihydroxy-kaur-16-ene, ent-7
 <italic>α</italic>-acetyl,15,18-dihydroxy-kaur-16-ene, foliol, sideridiol, siderol, and the recently identified ent-1
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxy-7
 <italic>α</italic>-acetyl-15
 <italic>β</italic>,16
 <italic>β</italic>-epoxykaurane [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] together with two flavonoid glycosides and a phenolic fraction by means of spectroscopic evidence [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Although phenolic compounds did not manifest anti-inflammatory proprieties, the flavonoid glycosides show both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive capabilities when combined [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Similarly to 
 <italic>S. lotsyi</italic>, the acetone extract of 
 <italic>S. stricta</italic> showed lower antimicrobial activity as compared to gentamicin [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], and no extensive data with the implications of 
 <italic>S. stricta</italic> over pain are published.
