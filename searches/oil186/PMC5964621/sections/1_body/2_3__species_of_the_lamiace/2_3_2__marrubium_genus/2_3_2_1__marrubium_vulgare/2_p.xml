<p>Phytochemical investigations on different parts of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> have reported the presence of alkaloids, lactones, steroids, tannins, a series of phenylpropanoid esters, diterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], together with their derivatives. Marrubiin, a furano labdane diterpenoid, was found to be the major chemotaxonomic marker isolated from leaves of the plant and exhibits potent antinociceptive properties and vasorelaxant activity [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].
