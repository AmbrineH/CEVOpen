<p>The composition of 
 <italic>Z. tenuior</italic> essential oil may therefore vary with plant genetics, environmental conditions, extraction methods, and geographic origin, including climate, soil, elevation, and topography. The main components of 
 <italic>Z. tenuior</italic>, which are identified by GC/MS analysis of the extracts, are 53.977% of 
 <italic>p</italic>-menth-3-en-8-ol, 38.481% of pulegone, and 1.651% of 
 <italic>p</italic>-menth-3,8-diene. The essential oil also contained smaller percentages of 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene; 4a
 <italic>α-</italic>, 7
 <italic>α-</italic>, and 7a
 <italic>α</italic>-nepetalactone; 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujene; caryophyllene oxide; limonene; E-caryophyllene; and terpinolene. 
 <italic>p</italic>-Menth-3-en-8-ol and pulegone are the main components of 
 <italic>Z. tenuior</italic>, and they are responsible for the antimicrobial activities of the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>]. Essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. tenuior</italic> aerial parts were characterized by high levels of oxygenated monoterpenes, especially pulegone [
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>].
