 <italic>Mentha</italic> is a genus of plants in the Lamiaceae family, with an estimated number of 13 to 18 species, lacking the exact distinction between them [
 <xref rid="B301" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>]. Hybridization between some of the species occurs naturally. The genus has a wide distribution across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America. While the 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species can be found in many environments, most grow best in wet surroundings and moist soils. The mint stems grow 10–120 cm tall and tend to spread uncontrollably over an indeterminate area; hence, they are sometimes considered invasive. The most common and popular mints for commercial cultivation are 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha gracilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mentha suaveolens</italic>. Mint was originally used as a medicinal herb to relieve stomachache and chest pains [
