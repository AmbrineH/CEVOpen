<p class="p">The antinociceptive activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> aqueous extract has been investigated by Yousef A. Taher using 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> tests on mice [
 <xref rid="B336" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">336</xref>]. According to these studies, the plant extract showed inhibition of acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions in mice at both 200 and 400â€‰mg/kg doses. The hot-plate test has shown that administration of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> aqueous extract (using the same abovementioned doses) caused a significant latency of the response to thermal stimulation. The carrageenan-induced paw edema test disclosed an increase in paw thickness; hence, it is assumed that the aqueous extract has a noninflammatory pain reliever activity, in contrast with previous research when the phytochemical compounds were obtained by the ethanolic extraction [
 <xref rid="B335" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">335</xref>]. On the other hand, the methanolic extract of different 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species displayed different analgesic effects, indicating that these effects are species- and extract-form dependent [
 <xref rid="B337" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">337</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B338" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">338</xref>]. These findings indicate that the phytochemicals present in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> extract exhibit analgesic effect arising from both CNS and peripheral actions since the response appears to both thermal and chemical pain stimuli. A similar efficacy is characteristic of central analgesics, such as morphine, which inhibits equally inflammatory and noninflammatory pains. The results concerning analgesic effects produced by 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> strongly recommend this plant as pain reducing and encourage further studies for a better understanding of the nociception mechanism in order to find new options in pain therapy, with less side effects.
