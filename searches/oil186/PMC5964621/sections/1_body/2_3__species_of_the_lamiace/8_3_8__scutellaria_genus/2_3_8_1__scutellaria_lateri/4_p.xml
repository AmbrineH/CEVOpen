<p>Baicalein can be extracted from 
 <italic>S. lateriflora</italic> through alkali solution and acid isolation methods; for a high-purity extract (99.35%), hydrolysis of baicalin and column chromatography purification can be used [
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. As an isolated compound, baicalein has shown not only antioxidant activity but also significant anti-inflammatory activity in several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models, which has made it an interesting drug to be screened as an analgesic.
