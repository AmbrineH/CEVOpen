<p>One study used several extracts from a plant of the 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> genus and found that baicalein has a significant analgesic effect in the carrageenan-induced rat paw inflammatory model [
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Similarly, baicalein was found to significantly decrease pain-related behavior and c-fos expression (a surrogate marker for pain intensity) in the spinal dorsal horn of animals exposed to painful stimuli [
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. A combination of baicalin and catechins was assessed in three widely used animal pain models and was found to have analgesic effects in visceral, nociceptive, and inflammatory pain [
