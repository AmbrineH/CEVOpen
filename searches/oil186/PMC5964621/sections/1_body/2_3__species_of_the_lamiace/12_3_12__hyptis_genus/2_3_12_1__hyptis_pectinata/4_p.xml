<p>The antinociceptive effects of 
 <italic>H. pectinata</italic> can be seen in the volatile oil [
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. The major constituents of oil are 1,8-cineole (12.46%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (20.51%), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (13.54%). 
 <italic>β</italic>-Pinene may be considered a partial agonist of 
 <italic>μ</italic>-opioid receptors [
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. Franco et al. [
 <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] suggested that the essential oils have both peripheral and central analgesic actions without opioid system influence, although the central activity was more discrete. GC-MS analysis showed that 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (40.90%) and caryophyllene oxides (30.05%) were the main compounds present in the oil.
