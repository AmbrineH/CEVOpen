<p class="p"> Another screening study assessed potential anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of different 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium</italic> species and concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">Lamium garganicum</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic> L. extracts are as effective as indomethacin, a reference anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, all extracts were prepared by methanolic extraction of air-dried and powdered aerial plant parts (25 g plant in 250 mL methanol), which was then concentrated to dryness, suspended in water, partitioned, and lyophilized. The study showed that 200 mg/kg body weight 
 <italic class="italic">of L. garganicum</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">L. purpureum</italic> methanolic extracts alleviate inflammatory pain in a model of ear edema and in carrageenan-induced and prostaglandin E2-induced hind paw edema [
