<p>There are no reported side effects following 
 <italic>G. hederacea</italic> administration. However, one 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that 
 <italic>G. hederacea</italic> ethanol extract concentrations exceeding 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/dl are cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], and several studies now focus on the plant's ability to kill different types of cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Due to its ability to target and kill cancerous cells, those extracts should also be included in preclinical screenings addressing pediatric cancerous cells (e.g., insulinomas being one of the most frequently encountered types of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors [
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]).
