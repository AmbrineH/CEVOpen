<p class="p">Previous studies have revealed that the rosemary extract may have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>–
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Therefore, data have shown that the ethanolic extract of rosemary inhibited acetic acid-induced pain in mice with an ED50 of 108.84 mg/kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the extract inhibited the time mice spent licking and shaking induced by formalin injections. Nevertheless, the extract did not display any anti-inflammatory activity as evaluated by uric acid induced-hind limb edema in rats [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In an experiment conducted by Emami et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> extract and its major constituent, carnosol, on plasma corticosterone levels and activity of the enzymes cyclooxygenase types 1 and 2 (COX1 and COX2) reduced pain in phase 2 of the formalin test, which was not inhibited by naloxone and/or memantine. In addition, pretreatment of the animals with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> extract and/or carnosol reduced the formalin-induced inflammation. Moreover, the extract and carnosol did not affect plasma corticosterone levels compared with the control group. Interestingly, both the extract and carnosol inhibited COX1 and COX2 activities. Going one step further, one can conclude that 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> extract and carnosol suppress pain and inflammation induced by formalin injection, which may be due to inhibition of the activity of COX1 and COX2 enzymes.
