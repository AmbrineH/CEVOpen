 <xref rid="B299" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>]. The findings obtained by Rezaee-Asl and coworkers, using the 
 <italic>formalin</italic>, 
 <italic>tail flick</italic>, and 
 <italic>hot-plate</italic> tests, assess that central and peripheral mechanisms are involved in the antinociceptive activity of the motherwort extract. According to the tail flick test of this study, 
 <italic>L. cardiaca</italic> extract only at the maximum dose (500 mg/kg) could alleviate the pain in all times of tail flick test, whereas the lower doses (125 and 250 mg/kg) reduced only late pain. The formalin test showed that the 
 <italic>L. cardiaca</italic> extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg was more effective in the first and second phases, suggesting peripheral and central antinociceptive mechanism. The second phase of the formalin test is related to a peripheral inflammatory process [
