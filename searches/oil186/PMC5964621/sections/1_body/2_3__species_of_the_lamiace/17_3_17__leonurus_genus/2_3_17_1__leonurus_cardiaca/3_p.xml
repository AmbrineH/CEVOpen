<p>In the aerial parts of 
 <italic>L. cardiaca</italic>, many compounds were identified: terpene compounds: monoterpenes (iridoids: leonuride, ajugoside, galiridoside, and reptoside) [
 <xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>], diterpenes (of clerodane, furanolabdane, and labdane types) [
 <xref rid="B286" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>], triterpenes (ursolic acid, oleanolic acids, corosolic acid, euscaphic acid, and ilelatifol D) [
 <xref rid="B287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>], nitrogen-containing compounds (leonurine, stachydrine, and amine choline), and phenylpropanoids (lavandulifolioside), as well as flavonoids, phenolic acids, volatile oils, sterols (
 <italic>β</italic>-sitosterol and stigmasterol), and tannins. The phenolic compounds comprise phenylpropanoid glycosides such as lavandulifolioside (arabinoside) [
 <xref rid="B288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>], phenolic acids such as chlorogenic, rosmarinic, caffeic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and ferulic acids, and phenolic glycoside [
 <xref rid="B289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>]. The volatile oils mainly contain sesquiterpenes such as germacrene D, epicedrol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene, and spathulenol and monoterpenes such as 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and dehydro-1,8 cineole [
 <xref rid="B290" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B291" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. Of these, ursolic acid proved a stronger anti-inflammatory activity than indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid, and furanolabdane-type diterpenes inhibited abdominal cramps more effectively than the parallel-given aspirin or acetaminophen.
