<p class="p">A hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys inflata</italic> Benth., one of the 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species from Iran, induced antinociception and anti-inflammatory effects in two well-characterized inflammatory models in rats: carrageenan-induced paw edema and formalin-induced paw licking [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Intraperitoneal injection of the hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial parts from nonflowering stems of 
 <italic class="italic">S. inflata</italic>, 60 min before induction of inflammation, was capable of attenuating both early and delayed phases of carrageenan-induced inflammation with a dose-related inhibition over the dose range of 50–200 mg/kg. Compared to a standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. inflata</italic> inhibited the inflammation more effectively than indomethacin. Moreover, all three doses of the extract significantly inhibited the pain associated with the second phase (inflammatory component) of the formalin test, but with no effect against the first phase (0–5 min).
