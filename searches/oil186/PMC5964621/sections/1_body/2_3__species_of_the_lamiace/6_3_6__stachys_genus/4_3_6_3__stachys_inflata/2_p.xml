<p>The obtained data suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>S. inflata</italic> may be related to the inhibition of the release or synthesis of cyclooxygenase products and polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulation determined by myeloperoxidase activity. The effects of 
 <italic>S. inflata</italic> extracts (200â€‰mg/kg) on inflammation and myeloperoxidase activity were confirmed by histological examination where the extract considerably reduced the morphological injury and neutrophil infiltration in a carrageenan-induced model of local inflammation.
