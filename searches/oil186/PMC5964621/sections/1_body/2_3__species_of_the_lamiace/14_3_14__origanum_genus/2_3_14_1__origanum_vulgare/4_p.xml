<p>The major compound of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> oil is terpinen-4-ol (26%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene (13.3%), 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene (9.3%), g-terpinen (5.8%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinene (5.7%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-menth-1-en-8-ol (5.1%), b-thujene (4.9%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinen (3.5%). The extracts obtained by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> presented higher concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes, without significant differences between fractions 1 and 2. A study from Iran shows that the composition of essential oils in 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was dominant in 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate [
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Another study from Italy shows that the main components of essential oil in the 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, thymol, terpinen-4-ol, and 
 <italic>p-</italic>cymene [
 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>]. Biochemical compounds of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> are the essential oil and tannins. The difference between the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> is in quantity (0.67% and 1.5%) [
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. The maximum quantity was obtained in the full flowering stage. The major component is germacrene D for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and terpinen-4-ol for 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>].
