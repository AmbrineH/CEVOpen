<p>Regarding its effect on other pain models, there are several studies that have demonstrated that 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> extracts alleviate neuropathic pain. The method of preparation was similar in most study designs: dried tulsi leaves were reduced to coarse powder and then extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (3 : 1) [
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] in order to obtain an oral preparation. 50 mg/kg b.w. of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> extract attenuated sciatic nerve transection-induced axonal degeneration, reduction of nociceptive threshold, and motor in-coordination [
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Kaur et al. orally administered 100 mg/kg b.w. or 200 mg/kg b.w. of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> to rats that underwent chronic constriction injury in the sciatic nerve and found that the extract alleviated cold-induced hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and paw-heat hyperalgesia [
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In another study, a 200 mg/kg b.w. dose of the extract was used, and the authors concluded that it is effective in preventing vincristine-induced neuropathic pain in rats [
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. The same dose of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> extract was administered in rats with surgically induced focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and was shown to reduce both neurological deficit and oxidative damage [
