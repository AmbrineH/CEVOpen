 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> L. is widely found in several geographical regions in South America and Africa [
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>] and still used as a medicinal plant with analgesic activity [
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. It contains several proanthocyanidins, which have been shown to exhibit significant antioxidant activity, and tannins, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, and cardiac glycosides [
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. 
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> essential oil was orally administered to mice with chronic constriction injury and effectively alleviated neuropathic pain most likely due to eugenol's antihyperalgesic activity [
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. The same group demonstrated the efficacy of the aforementioned essential oil for increasing paw withdrawal latency in the hot-plate test and for decreasing formalin-induced hind paw inflammation and pain-evoked behaviors [
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Another team used the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> in a model of visceral pain (the writhing test) and in the formalin test with equally favorable results [
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Similar analgesic activity was demonstrated by 
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts in two animal pain models: the acetic acid writhing test and the hot-plate test [
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>], indicating that it is efficient in nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory pain.
