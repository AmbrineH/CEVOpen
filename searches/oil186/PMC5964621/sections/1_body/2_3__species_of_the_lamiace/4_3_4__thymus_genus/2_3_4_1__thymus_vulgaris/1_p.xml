<p>GC-MS and GC-FID analyses revealed that the main active components in one type of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. essential oil are thymol (41.0%), geraniol (26.4%), thujanol (42.2% 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate and 7.3% 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate), and linalool (72.5%) [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and others also contain borneol and carvacrol. The chemotypes of thyme are determined based on oil compositions. Geographical provenience and weather influence the chemotype and composition [

 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate) [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].
