<p>In 2013, the analgesic activity of the aqueous extracts obtained from leaves (AEL) and stems (AES) of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, as well as its isolated compound—rosmarinic acid (RA)—were analyzed by Lucarini et al. [
 <xref rid="B379" ref-type="bibr">379</xref>]. The analysis is based upon abdominal constriction and formalin tests in mice. The extracts were used at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the compounds were tested at 10, 20, and 40 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. Orally administered AEL, AES, and RA were not significantly active at any of the doses tested during the abdominal constriction test; the acetyl ester derivative of RA presented significant analgesic activity. These data recommend that the analgesic effects of the acetyl derivative of RA function through a peripheral-mediated mechanism. The acetyl ester derivative of RA is theoretically applicable as a new lead compound for the management of pain.
