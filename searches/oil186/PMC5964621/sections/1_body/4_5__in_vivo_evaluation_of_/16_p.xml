<p class="p">These findings suggest that EOM and PO are acting by peripheral mechanisms. In addition, EOM caused a reduction in the paw licking time for the second phase of the formalin test, when administered at higher doses (100 and 200 mg/kg). At 100 and 200 mg/kg, PO reduced this second phase to 8.3 ± 2.7 s (

 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10), respectively. The antinociceptive activity induced by EOM and PO in the writhing and formalin tests was not altered by naloxone, demonstrating that their actions do not depend on opioid receptors [

Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that EOM and PO have an analgesic activity, which is probably indirect and attributed to the anti-inflammatory activity, which does not involve the central nervous system [
