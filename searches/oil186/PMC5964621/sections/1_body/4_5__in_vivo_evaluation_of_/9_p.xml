<p class="p">Moreover, the REO inhibited licking and shaking induced by formalin injections. Instead, at doses of 70, 125, and 250 mg/kg, REO displayed a substantial antinociceptive effect in the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test compared with control animals. The results suggest that REO possesses peripheral antinociceptive activity. Similarly, Martinez et al. [
 <xref rid="B363" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">363</xref>] described the antinociceptive effect of this essential oil using a rat model of arthritic pain. The essential oil with intraperitoneal administration in doses of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg determined a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect, manifested as a remarkable reduction of the dysfunction in the pain-induced functional impairment model in the rat, mostly at high doses. Emami et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] indicate that rosemary essential oil can inhibit carrageenan-induced paw edema tests in rats and acetic acid-induced writhing model of visceral pain and hot-plate tests in mice, suggesting that rosemary essential oil possesses anti-inflammatory and peripheral antinociceptive activity [
