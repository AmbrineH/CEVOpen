 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] investigated the antinociceptive effects of rosemary essential oil (REO) using the acetic acid-induced writhing and hot-plate tests in mice. REO is very common in folk medicine because of its antispasmodic, analgesic, antirheumatic, and carminative effects. In the hot-plate test, the administration of REO in doses of 125, 250, and 500â€‰mg/kg revealed unremarkable effects on response latency, whereas control injection of meperidine induced significant antinociceptive effects.
