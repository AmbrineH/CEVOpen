<p>Marrubiinic acid, given orally, at a dose of 50 mg/kg, produced a marked analgesic effect, reducing 76 ± 0.9% of the number of abdominal constrictions induced by acetic acid, which may recommend that it can be well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. However, it was not effective in abolishing pain in a nonopioid way, showing the lack of antinociceptive effects in the hot-plate test [
