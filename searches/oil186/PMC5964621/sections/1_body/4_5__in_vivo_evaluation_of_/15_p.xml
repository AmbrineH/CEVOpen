<p>The antinociceptive and analgesic effects of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> spp. (EOM) leaves and its major constituent, piperitenone oxide (PO), were investigated in mice [
 <xref rid="B390" ref-type="bibr">390</xref>]. After an oral administration of 200â€‰mg/kg of EOM and PO, the antinociceptive activity was demonstrated by an important reduction in the acetic acid-induced number of writhings and the second phase of the formalin test, while in the similar range of doses, they did not interfere with the nociception associated with the hot-plate and tail immersion tests. The hot-plate and tail immersion tests are reported to be useful tests in discriminating analgesic agents acting primarily at the spinal medulla level and at higher central nervous system levels (positive results) from those acting through peripheral mechanisms (negative results) [
