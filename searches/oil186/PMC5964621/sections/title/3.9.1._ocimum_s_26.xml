  <span class="italic">Ocimum sanctum</span> Linn., also known as tulsi, is an indigenous plant commonly found in India [
  <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>]. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used in the form of a fresh leaf extract or a decoction with hot water to alleviate muscular pain, joint pain, and severe headache [
  <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>]. It contains (−)-linalool (30–40%), eugenol (8–30%), and methyl chavicol (15–27%). Minor constituents are (+)-delta-cadinene, 3-carene, 
  <span class="italic">α-</span>humulene, citral, and (−)-
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene [
  <a rid="B191" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191">191</a>]. In recent years, the interest for evaluating the potential benefits of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts in several conditions has significantly increased, especially in the anticancer, antimicrobial, and neurobiology fields. A double-blind clinical trial assessed the effects of oral ethanolic extract of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> on healthy volunteers and concluded that the drug has immunomodulatory effects and can be given for a period of four weeks without any significant side effects [
  <a rid="B192" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192">192</a>]. Although less numerous, there are some studies that have assessed the effect of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts on different types of pain, most often inflammatory or neuropathic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">In vitro</span>, 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> leaf extracts exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells, reducing cytokine production and decreasing TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span> secretion [
  <a rid="B193" ref-type="bibr" href="#B193">193</a>]. Different types of dried leaf extracts were also shown to be effective in reducing carrageenan-induced and leukotriene-induced paw edema [
  <a rid="B194" ref-type="bibr" href="#B194">194</a>]. More recently, a triple-blind randomized clinical study compared an ethanolic extract of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> with chlorhexidine mouthwash in regards to their effect on dental plaque and gingival inflammation and found that the two are equivalent. Additionally, the 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract was better tolerated and had no side effects [
  <a rid="B195" ref-type="bibr" href="#B195">195</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding its effect on other pain models, there are several studies that have demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts alleviate neuropathic pain. The method of preparation was similar in most study designs: dried tulsi leaves were reduced to coarse powder and then extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (3 : 1) [
  <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>, 
  <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>] in order to obtain an oral preparation. 50 mg/kg b.w. of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract attenuated sciatic nerve transection-induced axonal degeneration, reduction of nociceptive threshold, and motor in-coordination [
  <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>]. Kaur et al. orally administered 100 mg/kg b.w. or 200 mg/kg b.w. of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> to rats that underwent chronic constriction injury in the sciatic nerve and found that the extract alleviated cold-induced hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and paw-heat hyperalgesia [
  <a rid="B196" ref-type="bibr" href="#B196">196</a>]. In another study, a 200 mg/kg b.w. dose of the extract was used, and the authors concluded that it is effective in preventing vincristine-induced neuropathic pain in rats [
  <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>]. The same dose of 
  <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract was administered in rats with surgically induced focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and was shown to reduce both neurological deficit and oxidative damage [
  <a rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" href="#B197">197</a>].
