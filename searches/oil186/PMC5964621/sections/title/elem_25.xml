  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> genus species are amongst the best-known medicinal plants, with historical reports of their antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, antistress, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, chemoprotective, antihyperlipidemic, cardioprotective, antioxidant, antitussive, radioprotective, memory enhancing, antiarthritic, antifertility, antihypertensive, anticoagulant, anticataract, anthelmintic, and antinociceptive activity [
  <a rid="B188" ref-type="bibr" href="#B188">188</a>]. As such, several members of the genus such as 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum sanctum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum gratissimum</span>, or 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> have played a significant part in different traditional medicines and are currently considered as potential sources for innovative drugs.

   <span class="italic">Ocimum sanctum</span> Linn., also known as tulsi, is an indigenous plant commonly found in India [
   <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>]. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used in the form of a fresh leaf extract or a decoction with hot water to alleviate muscular pain, joint pain, and severe headache [
   <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>]. It contains (−)-linalool (30–40%), eugenol (8–30%), and methyl chavicol (15–27%). Minor constituents are (+)-delta-cadinene, 3-carene, 
   <span class="italic">α-</span>humulene, citral, and (−)-
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene [
   <a rid="B191" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191">191</a>]. In recent years, the interest for evaluating the potential benefits of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts in several conditions has significantly increased, especially in the anticancer, antimicrobial, and neurobiology fields. A double-blind clinical trial assessed the effects of oral ethanolic extract of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> on healthy volunteers and concluded that the drug has immunomodulatory effects and can be given for a period of four weeks without any significant side effects [
   <a rid="B192" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192">192</a>]. Although less numerous, there are some studies that have assessed the effect of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts on different types of pain, most often inflammatory or neuropathic.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">In vitro</span>, 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> leaf extracts exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells, reducing cytokine production and decreasing TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span> secretion [
   <a rid="B193" ref-type="bibr" href="#B193">193</a>]. Different types of dried leaf extracts were also shown to be effective in reducing carrageenan-induced and leukotriene-induced paw edema [
   <a rid="B194" ref-type="bibr" href="#B194">194</a>]. More recently, a triple-blind randomized clinical study compared an ethanolic extract of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> with chlorhexidine mouthwash in regards to their effect on dental plaque and gingival inflammation and found that the two are equivalent. Additionally, the 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract was better tolerated and had no side effects [
   <a rid="B195" ref-type="bibr" href="#B195">195</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding its effect on other pain models, there are several studies that have demonstrated that 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extracts alleviate neuropathic pain. The method of preparation was similar in most study designs: dried tulsi leaves were reduced to coarse powder and then extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (3 : 1) [
   <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>, 
   <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>] in order to obtain an oral preparation. 50 mg/kg b.w. of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract attenuated sciatic nerve transection-induced axonal degeneration, reduction of nociceptive threshold, and motor in-coordination [
   <a rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190">190</a>]. Kaur et al. orally administered 100 mg/kg b.w. or 200 mg/kg b.w. of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> to rats that underwent chronic constriction injury in the sciatic nerve and found that the extract alleviated cold-induced hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and paw-heat hyperalgesia [
   <a rid="B196" ref-type="bibr" href="#B196">196</a>]. In another study, a 200 mg/kg b.w. dose of the extract was used, and the authors concluded that it is effective in preventing vincristine-induced neuropathic pain in rats [
   <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>]. The same dose of 
   <span class="italic">O. sanctum</span> extract was administered in rats with surgically induced focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and was shown to reduce both neurological deficit and oxidative damage [

   <a rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198">198</a>]. It contains several proanthocyanidins, which have been shown to exhibit significant antioxidant activity, and tannins, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, and cardiac glycosides [
   <a rid="B200" ref-type="bibr" href="#B200">200</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> essential oil was orally administered to mice with chronic constriction injury and effectively alleviated neuropathic pain most likely due to eugenol's antihyperalgesic activity [
   <a rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199">199</a>]. The same group demonstrated the efficacy of the aforementioned essential oil for increasing paw withdrawal latency in the hot-plate test and for decreasing formalin-induced hind paw inflammation and pain-evoked behaviors [
   <a rid="B201" ref-type="bibr" href="#B201">201</a>]. Another team used the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> in a model of visceral pain (the writhing test) and in the formalin test with equally favorable results [
   <a rid="B202" ref-type="bibr" href="#B202">202</a>]. Similar analgesic activity was demonstrated by 
   <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts in two animal pain models: the acetic acid writhing test and the hot-plate test [
   <a rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198">198</a>], indicating that it is efficient in nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory pain.

   <span class="italic">trans</span>-Caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene from 
   <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span>, was shown to have dose-dependent analgesic effects in several experimental models of acute and chronic pain such as the formalin test, chronic constriction injury, and the hot-plate test. The authors evaluated the potential mechanisms responsible for the substance's properties and found that the analgesic effect was reversed by several types of antagonists [
   <a rid="B203" ref-type="bibr" href="#B203">203</a>], thus indicating the involvement of both the opioid and endocannabinoid system [

   <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> Willd. or

   <a rid="B205" ref-type="bibr" href="#B205">205</a>]. The difference in efficacy between plants is most likely due to their different compositions that additionally vary according to the geographical area. While some authors believe that the saponins these plants contain are responsible for their effect on pain [
   <a rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189">189</a>], others have suggested that the volatile oil eugenol is in fact the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound [
