  <span class="italic">Sideritis stricta</span> Benth. is listed as an endangered plant and is being used as an aromatic and medicinal plant containing essential oils with antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiviral, and antioxidant properties [
  <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">98</a>]. The diterpenes composition was identified as sideroxol, 7-acetyl sideroxol, 7-epicandicandiol, linearol (5), ent-7

  <span class="italic">β</span>-epoxykaurane [

  <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">100</a>]. Although phenolic compounds did not manifest anti-inflammatory proprieties, the flavonoid glycosides show both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive capabilities when combined [

  <span class="italic">S. lotsyi</span>, the acetone extract of 
  <span class="italic">S. stricta</span> showed lower antimicrobial activity as compared to gentamicin [
  <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">99</a>], and no extensive data with the implications of 
  <span class="italic">S. stricta</span> over pain are published.
