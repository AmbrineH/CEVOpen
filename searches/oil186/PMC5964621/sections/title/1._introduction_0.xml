 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pain comes in many forms: acute, chronic, visceral, inflammatory, or neuropathic [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. It is not simply a result of tissue damage but also reflects the influence of many psychological variables such as attention, anxiety, stress [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>], suggestion, or previous experiences and may have a significant genetic contribution [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. Pain accompanies most pathologies present in current medical practice, and 25% percent of Americans, for example, experience pain on a daily basis. Having the numbers on its side, pain became a global public health problem and a leading cause of disability all over the world [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As life expectancy is rising and chronical pathologies along with it, the prevalence of accompanying pain is expected to increase yearly, with higher prevalence in elderly patients, where the treatment is also more sensitive [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Considering the above, new therapeutic agents with increased efficacy, less side effects, and lower costs and leading to an improved quality of life [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>–
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>] should become one of the primary objectives in modern medical research, together with constant monitoring [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>] of the previous mentioned aspects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The medicinal use of plants as analgesic drugs in folk medicine is an ancient tradition, far older than the current sciences of medicine in developing countries [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>, 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. According to estimations, up to 70,000 plant species are used ethnomedicinally worldwide. Effects of herbal extracts have been studied by different pain tests including writhing test, light tail flick test, tail immersion test, hot-plate test, and formalin test [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exploration for new analgesic combinations from the enormous arrays of medicinal plant resources is growing. This is because such information holds guarantees for the finding of new therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting, decreasing, or relieving pain [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>–
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Plants characterize a vast natural supply of appreciated compounds that might achieve primary importance for the expansion of novel drugs [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. The survey of the effectiveness of plant-based remedies used in the folk medicine has given great reflections because they are cheap and have reduced side effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80% of the world population still relies mainly on plant-based drugs [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>], thus lowering at the same time the impact of self-medication side effects [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. The data in biomedical literature presenting plants with medicinal capabilities are very similar to the array of publications depicting the modulatory effects certain ones have over pain perception.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Lamiaceae family, one of the most important herbal families, incorporates a wide variety of plants with biological and medical applications. The most known members of this family are a variety of aromatic spices like thyme, mint, oregano, basil, sage, savory, rosemary, self-heal, hyssop, lemon balm, and some others with more limited use [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main objective was to perform a review of this literature for the specific implications of Lamiaceae family plants in pain modulation and thus aid the constant search for new potential agents of natural origin with analgesic effects.</p>
