  <span class="italic">Ocimum gratissimum</span> L. is widely found in several geographical regions in South America and Africa [
  <a rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198">198</a>, 
  <a rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199">199</a>] and still used as a medicinal plant with analgesic activity [
  <a rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198">198</a>]. It contains several proanthocyanidins, which have been shown to exhibit significant antioxidant activity, and tannins, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, and cardiac glycosides [
  <a rid="B200" ref-type="bibr" href="#B200">200</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> essential oil was orally administered to mice with chronic constriction injury and effectively alleviated neuropathic pain most likely due to eugenol's antihyperalgesic activity [
  <a rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199">199</a>]. The same group demonstrated the efficacy of the aforementioned essential oil for increasing paw withdrawal latency in the hot-plate test and for decreasing formalin-induced hind paw inflammation and pain-evoked behaviors [
  <a rid="B201" ref-type="bibr" href="#B201">201</a>]. Another team used the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> in a model of visceral pain (the writhing test) and in the formalin test with equally favorable results [
  <a rid="B202" ref-type="bibr" href="#B202">202</a>]. Similar analgesic activity was demonstrated by 
  <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span> aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts in two animal pain models: the acetic acid writhing test and the hot-plate test [
  <a rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198">198</a>], indicating that it is efficient in nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory pain.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-Caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene from 
  <span class="italic">O. gratissimum</span>, was shown to have dose-dependent analgesic effects in several experimental models of acute and chronic pain such as the formalin test, chronic constriction injury, and the hot-plate test. The authors evaluated the potential mechanisms responsible for the substance's properties and found that the analgesic effect was reversed by several types of antagonists [
  <a rid="B203" ref-type="bibr" href="#B203">203</a>], thus indicating the involvement of both the opioid and endocannabinoid system [
  <a rid="B204" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204">204</a>].
