 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Khanavi et al. [
  <a rid="B152" ref-type="bibr" href="#B152">152</a>] proved that acetone and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">S. byzantina</span> K. Koch, a species of 
  <span class="italic">Stachys</span>, native to Turkey, Armenia, and Iran, play a significant role in the inhibition of pain and inflammatory processes by using two inflammatory models, namely, formalin test and carrageenan-induced paw edema.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dried and finely powdered aerial parts were extracted with acetone at room temperature for 2 weeks in order to isolate and identify an acyclic diterpene ester (phytyl nonadecanoate), two normal alkanes (tritriacontane and hentriacontane), one fatty acid (oleic acid), and two sterols (stigmasterol and lawsaritol). Structures were established by conventional methods of analysis and confirmed by 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H, 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR, and mass spectral analysis. All three doses of acetone/methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">Stachys byzantina</span> (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), administered by intraperitoneal injections, significantly inhibited the pain associated with the second phase (inflammatory component) of the formalin test, and the effect of the low dose was predominant. Compared to indomethacin (high dose of 5 mg/kg) as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the extracts decreased licking response in the late phase significantly, with the maximum inhibitory response obtained with 50 mg/kg of the extract.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors assumed that the analgesic effects of the extracts are probably mediated by interactions with inflammatory mediators (arachidonic acid metabolites), since the antinociceptive activities were observed in late phase (20 min after formalin injection). In the carrageenan-induced paw edema, both extracts revealed dose-related inhibitory effects, in both early and delayed phases, over the dose range 50–200 mg/kg, similar to a high dose of indomethacin (5 mg/kg). The present data demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activity of acetone and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">S. byzantina</span> is probably related to the inhibition of the synthesis or release of COX2 products.
