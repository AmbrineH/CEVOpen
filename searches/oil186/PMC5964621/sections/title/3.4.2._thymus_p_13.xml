  <span class="italic">Thymus pulegioides</span> L. belongs to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Thymus</span>, and together with three other species, it has a different phenolic content than 
  <span class="italic">T. vulgaris</span> [
  <a rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121">121</a>]. It grows on the European continent, and it is used as an antiseptic in local regions of Portugal [
  <a rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122">122</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In phytochemical analysis, 
  <span class="italic">Thymus pulegioides</span> was found to have a high flavonoid content, tannins, and hydroxycinnamic acids. The 
  <span class="italic">T. pulegioides</span> oil, in one analysiss, was characterized by the presence of high amounts of thymol and carvacrol [
  <a rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122">122</a>]. The dose-dependent scavenging effect and the chelating activity of 
  <span class="italic">T. pulegioides</span> are moderate to high, with an increased acetylcholinesterase inhibition [
  <a rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114">114</a>]. A study in Italy places 
  <span class="italic">T. pulegioides</span> among the first medicinal plants in traditional medicine and the second most relevant in respiratory pathologies usage [
  <a rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123">123</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has an important antioxidant role [
  <a rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124">124</a>], but as an anti-inflammatory agent, it elicits cell-type-dependent response [
  <a rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125">125</a>]. Another consideration that increases the medicinal importance of 
  <span class="italic">T. pulegioides</span> is that it has demonstrated considerable antifungal capacities [
  <a rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122">122</a>]; however, more data are required to quantify its effect in pain modulation.
