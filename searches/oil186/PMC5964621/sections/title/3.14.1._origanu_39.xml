  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> is an aromatic, woody-based perennial, native to the stony slopes and rocky mountain areas at a wide range of altitudes in the Mediterranean area (Portugal and Andalusia), Europe (including the British Isles), and south and central Asia [
  <a rid="B249" ref-type="bibr" href="#B249">249</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between these two plants is almost indistinguishable (taste aside) to the amateur gardener. In technical terms, the difference between marjoram and oregano is based on the shape of the calyx and not the leaves, how hairy they are, or the growth habit.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a lot of information about 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span>. So, Hippocrates used 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> as an antiseptic agent. The ancient Greeks consider 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> as a symbol of love, honour, and happiness. Aristotle declares that 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> is an antipoison. The people from old Egypt used 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> to disinfect and preserve food [
  <a rid="B250" ref-type="bibr" href="#B250">250</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major compound of 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> oil is terpinen-4-ol (26%), 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-sabinene (13.3%), 
  <span class="italic">o</span>-cymene (9.3%), g-terpinen (5.8%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-sabinene (5.7%), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-menth-1-en-8-ol (5.1%), b-thujene (4.9%), and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpinen (3.5%). The extracts obtained by supercritical CO
  <sub>2</sub> presented higher concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes, without significant differences between fractions 1 and 2. A study from Iran shows that the composition of essential oils in 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> was dominant in 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-sabinene hydrate [
  <a rid="B251" ref-type="bibr" href="#B251">251</a>]. Another study from Italy shows that the main components of essential oil in the 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> ssp. 
  <span class="italic">vulgare</span> were 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, thymol, terpinen-4-ol, and 
  <span class="italic">p-</span>cymene [
  <a rid="B252" ref-type="bibr" href="#B252">252</a>]. Biochemical compounds of 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> are the essential oil and tannins. The difference between the essential oil obtained from 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> is in quantity (0.67% and 1.5%) [
  <a rid="B253" ref-type="bibr" href="#B253">253</a>]. The maximum quantity was obtained in the full flowering stage. The major component is germacrene D for 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> and terpinen-4-ol for 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> [
  <a rid="B254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B254">254</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the folk medicine, 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> was used to treat several illnesses such as spasmodic, antimicrobial, digestive, expectorant, and aromatic for the whooping and convulsive coughs [
  <a rid="B255" ref-type="bibr" href="#B255">255</a>, 
  <a rid="B256" ref-type="bibr" href="#B256">256</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">O. vulgare</span> (oregano) and 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> (marjoram) inhibit the growth of the bacteria and fungus (inhibited the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span>) [
  <a rid="B257" ref-type="bibr" href="#B257">257</a>] and the synthesis of the microbial metabolites [
  <a rid="B258" ref-type="bibr" href="#B258">258</a>, 
  <a rid="B259" ref-type="bibr" href="#B259">259</a>]. The leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> were used to cure diabetes, insomnia, catarrh, and asthma [
  <a rid="B260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B260">260</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> has stimulatory properties and vasodilatatory activity [
  <a rid="B261" ref-type="bibr" href="#B261">261</a>]. By acting also on cardiovascular system and being used as an adjuvant for diabetes control, 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> subsp. could both prevent and treat more complex diseases associative developed as: atrial fibrillation development [
