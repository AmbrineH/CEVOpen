   <span class="italic">Teucrium polium</span> L. is a perennial wild-growing plant, widely spread in several regions such as South-Western Asia, Europe, and North Africa [
   <a rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" href="#B208">208</a>], and has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammations, rheumatism, diabetes, and ulcers. Two major components of the dried leaf plant extract are flavons and flavonoids [
   <a rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" href="#B209">209</a>]; the essential oil contains 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (25.769%) and myrcene (12.507), and the methanolic extract contains sinapic acid (15.553 mg/g) and eugenol (6.805 mg/g) [
   <a rid="B210" ref-type="bibr" href="#B210">210</a>]. A preclinical study showed that intraperitoneal administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg b.w. per day for two weeks reduced pain-related behavior in the diabetic rat formalin test [
   <a rid="B211" ref-type="bibr" href="#B211">211</a>]. A larger dose of 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanolic extract of 
   <span class="italic">T. polium</span> inhibited carrageenan-induced inflammation and reduced granuloma formation [
   <a rid="B212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B212">212</a>]. Another study compared the effect of morphine and 
   <span class="italic">T. polium</span> extract on the tail flick latency and found the two to be comparable in efficacy [
   <a rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" href="#B213">213</a>]. Both the total extract and the essential oil of the plant exhibited analgesic effects on the acetic acid-induced writhing test, thus suggesting it might be effective in visceral pain [
   <a rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" href="#B214">214</a>]. Subsequently, a triple-blind, randomized, clinical trial was designed in order to assess the plant's effects on dysmenorrhea. Seventy female students were randomly assigned to receive either 
   <span class="italic">T. polium</span> powder every six hours for the first three days of their menstrual cycle or 250 mg mefenamic acid. Study results indicated that the two are equally effective, thus concluding that 
   <span class="italic">T. polium</span> is effective in this type of pain [

   <span class="italic">Teucrium hyrcanicum</span> L., also known as “Purple Tails” is a plant native to Iran, which has been also shown to exhibit analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in carrageenan-induced paw edema, acetic acid-induced writhing, tail flick, and formalin pain tests [
   <a rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" href="#B215">215</a>]. A recent study used a methanolic extract of dried aerial parts of 
   <span class="italic">T. hycranicum</span> and observed that the high flavonoid content of the plant has significant antioxidant effects [

   <span class="italic">Teucrium chamaedrys</span> L., also known as “The wall germander,” is an evergreen subshrub native to the Mediterranean region of Europe and North Africa, and to the Middle East. It has been used in traditional English medicine as part of the Portland Powder for treating rheumatism and gout [
   <a rid="B217" ref-type="bibr" href="#B217">217</a>]. A preclinical study identified teucrioside as the main active ingredient of the plant and concluded that it is effective in inhibiting calcineurin, thus potentially playing a role in reducing inflammatory states [
