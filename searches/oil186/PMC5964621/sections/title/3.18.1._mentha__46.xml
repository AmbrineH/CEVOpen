  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span> L. (peppermint) is a hybrid of 
  <span class="italic">M. spicata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. aquatica</span>. This plant was cultivated since the time of ancient Egyptians and established in the Icelandic Pharmacopoeia of the thirteenth century. The list of benefits and uses of peppermint as a folk remedy or alternative medical therapy include biliary maladies, dyspepsia, enteritis, flatulence, gastritis, intestinal colic, and spasms of the bile duct, gallbladder, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antinociceptive activity of

  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> aqueous extract (using the same abovementioned doses) caused a significant latency of the response to thermal stimulation. The carrageenan-induced paw edema test disclosed an increase in paw thickness; hence, it is assumed that the aqueous extract has a noninflammatory pain reliever activity, in contrast with previous research when the phytochemical compounds were obtained by the ethanolic extraction [

  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> extract exhibit analgesic effect arising from both CNS and peripheral actions since the response appears to both thermal and chemical pain stimuli. A similar efficacy is characteristic of central analgesics, such as morphine, which inhibits equally inflammatory and noninflammatory pains. The results concerning analgesic effects produced by 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> strongly recommend this plant as pain reducing and encourage further studies for a better understanding of the nociception mechanism in order to find new options in pain therapy, with less side effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toxicology studies of peppermint oil and its components completed in animals have shown no adverse effects or histopathological modifications. There are no chronic toxicity studies of peppermint in humans, although the use of peppermint oil has been reported as contraindicated in patients with bile duct, gallbladder, and liver disorders. The use of peppermint oil capsules in patients with GI reflux, hiatal hernia, or kidney stones needs also caution [
