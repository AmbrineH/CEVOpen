  <span class="italic">Glechoma hederacea</span> L., more commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herb with creeping stem that can be found throughout Northern Europe and the neighboring regions of Asia. The aerial parts of the plant (consumed as salad or tea) have been used in both Asian and European traditional medicine as a remedy for several digestive, pulmonary, skeletal, and inflammatory conditions [
  <a rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153">153</a>]. Active components include several polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, genistin, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, or genistein [
  <a rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153">153</a>] and triterpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanoic acid [
  <a rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154">154</a>, 
  <a rid="B155" ref-type="bibr" href="#B155">155</a>]. Additionally, studies report that 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> leaves contain polyunsaturated fatty acids [
  <a rid="B156" ref-type="bibr" href="#B156">156</a>] and a type of insecticidal lectin called Gleheda [
  <a rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" href="#B157">157</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current preclinical data indicate that 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> has several pharmacological effects. As such, hot water extracts of ground ivy have been shown to exhibit antibacterial, anticancer, insecticidal, and platelet-stimulating activity [
  <a rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" href="#B157">157</a>, 
  <a rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" href="#B158">158</a>]. Currently, there are no studies specifically addressing ground ivy's effect on pain. However, existing data point out that the plant has potent anti-inflammatory effects. An 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> study revealed that incubating activated macrophages with a ground ivy decoction (3 h in boiling distilled water) led to a significant decrease in nitric oxide production. Furthermore, the authors noted that the expression of some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p70 and TNFα was significantly decreased [
  <a rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" href="#B159">159</a>]. Similarly, Kim et al. demonstrated that several compounds found in 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> inhibit NF-κB production [
  <a rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" href="#B154">154</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">In vivo</span>, hot water 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> extract was shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in a rat model of hepatic inflammation: rats that received 0.5 g/kg 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> extract daily for four weeks were shown to have significantly lower levels of inflammatory cell infiltration/activation in the liver [
  <a rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" href="#B153">153</a>]. Additionally, several inflammatory markers, such as NF-κB, TNF-
  <span class="italic">α</span>, IL-1
  <span class="italic">β</span>, and IL-6, were decreased in these animals when compared with the control group.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other possible mechanisms that make ground ivy a potential candidate as coanalgesic include its effects on extracellular calcium (Ca) levels [
  <a rid="B160" ref-type="bibr" href="#B160">160</a>] and on oxidation. Purified ethyl acetate extracts of ground ivy showed a strong antioxidant activity when used as a food additive in two different types of food (pork lard and sunflower oil) [
  <a rid="B161" ref-type="bibr" href="#B161">161</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are no reported side effects following 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> administration. However, one 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> study showed that 
  <span class="italic">G. hederacea</span> ethanol extract concentrations exceeding 100 
  <span class="italic">µ</span>g/dl are cytotoxic [
  <a rid="B160" ref-type="bibr" href="#B160">160</a>], and several studies now focus on the plant's ability to kill different types of cancer cells [
  <a rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B162">162</a>]. Due to its ability to target and kill cancerous cells, those extracts should also be included in preclinical screenings addressing pediatric cancerous cells (e.g., insulinomas being one of the most frequently encountered types of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors [
  <a rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" href="#B163">163</a>]).
