  <span class="italic">S. lotsyi</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">mascaensis</span> extracts were studied in a comprehensive analysis for the antimicrobial activity, toxicity, and anti-inflammatory and analgesic proprieties.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A dose of 2 g/kg body weight 
  <span class="italic">S. lotsyi</span> extracts administered orally in mice did not show any toxic effects; however, a dose of only 250 mg/kg ethanol extract administered orally has shown analgesic proprieties on the visceral pain produced during the writhing test, and the chloroform fraction demonstrated antinociceptive effect. The same extracts manifested anti-inflammatory effect on the early, histamin-mediated, phase of paw inflammation, but much more significant effects were observed in ear inflammation with topical administration. Contrary to 
  <span class="italic">S. scardica</span>, no antimicrobial effect was noted [
