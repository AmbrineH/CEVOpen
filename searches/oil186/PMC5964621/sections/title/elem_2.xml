   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> L., commonly called rosemary, is a Mediterranean shrubby herb and widely spread in European, American, and Asian countries. It is a common spice used worldwide for culinary, medicinal, and commercial uses, including the fragrance and food industries [
    <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. The leaves of rosemary (fresh or dries) are used for their characteristic aroma in cooking or consumed in small amounts as herbal tea, while rosemary extracts are regularly used for their natural antioxidant active proprieties to improve the shelf life of perishable foods. Recently, rosemary extracts (E392) have been approved as a safe and effective natural antioxidant for food preservation by the European Union [
    <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytochemical studies have revealed that leaves contain 0.5% to 2.5% volatile oil. The major components of rosemary oil include monoterpene hydrocarbons (alpha and beta-pinene), camphene, limonene, camphor (10% to 20%), borneol, cineole, linalool, and verbinol. Rosemary contains a widespread variety of volatile and aromatic components. Flavonoids in the plant consist of diosmetin, diosmin, genkwanin, luteolin, hispidulin, and apigenin [
    <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>–
    <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>]. Additionally, terpenoid components from rosemary consist of the triterpenes oleanolic and ursolic acid and the diterpene carnosol. Phenols in rosemary comprise caffeic, chlorogenic, labiatic, neochlorogenic, and rosmarinic acids. Rosemary covers high amounts of salicylates [
    <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>–
    <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern pharmacological studies have indicated that rosemary and its constituents, especially caffeic acid derivatives such as rosmarinic acid, have various traditional uses in ethnomedicine including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antirheumatic, spasmolytic, antihepatotoxic, atherosclerotic, carminative, and choleretic applications [
    <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>–
    <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>], protection against UV and gamma radiation, and amelioration of stress [
    <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The powdered leaves are used as an effective natural flea and tick repellent. Activity against certain bacteria including 
    <span class="italic">Staphylcoccus aureus</span>, 
    <span class="italic">Staphylococcus albus</span>, 
    <span class="italic">Vibrio cholerae</span>, 
    <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, and 
    <span class="italic">Corynebacterium</span> has been observed. One study found that rosemary oil is most active against “meat spoiling” Gram-negative (

    <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span>) bacteria [
    <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though rosemary oil is used safely as a food flavoring spice and whole leaves are used as a potherb for seasoning, ingestion of great quantities can be associated with toxicity characterized by stomach and intestinal irritation and kidney damage. While rosemary oil is irritating to rabbit skin, it is not usually considered to be a sensitizer for human skin [
    <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, diterpenes, phenols, and triterpenes from plant sources have been traditionally extracted by a conventional solid-liquid extraction. Nevertheless, this extraction technique presents several disadvantages, mainly because it is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires a high consumption of solvents, and in some cases provides low recovery. For that reason, in last years, new promising extraction methods are arising, which introduce some form of additional energy in order to facilitate the transfer of solutes from the sample to solvent in a faster process [
    <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>]. Thus, microwave-assisted extraction [
    <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>] and/or ultrasound-assisted ethanol, acetone, or 
    <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane extraction represent alternatives to the conventional method, improving the speed and efficiency of the extraction process and reducing the consumption of solvents [
    <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have revealed that the rosemary extract may have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects [
    <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>–
    <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>]. Therefore, data have shown that the ethanolic extract of rosemary inhibited acetic acid-induced pain in mice with an ED50 of 108.84 mg/kg
    <span class="sup">−1</span> [
    <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. Furthermore, the extract inhibited the time mice spent licking and shaking induced by formalin injections. Nevertheless, the extract did not display any anti-inflammatory activity as evaluated by uric acid induced-hind limb edema in rats [
    <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. In an experiment conducted by Emami et al. [
    <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>], the effects of 
    <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> extract and its major constituent, carnosol, on plasma corticosterone levels and activity of the enzymes cyclooxygenase types 1 and 2 (COX1 and COX2) reduced pain in phase 2 of the formalin test, which was not inhibited by naloxone and/or memantine. In addition, pretreatment of the animals with 
    <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> extract and/or carnosol reduced the formalin-induced inflammation. Moreover, the extract and carnosol did not affect plasma corticosterone levels compared with the control group. Interestingly, both the extract and carnosol inhibited COX1 and COX2 activities. Going one step further, one can conclude that 
    <span class="italic">R. officinalis</span> extract and carnosol suppress pain and inflammation induced by formalin injection, which may be due to inhibition of the activity of COX1 and COX2 enzymes.

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great potencies observed in the writhing test and formalin-influenced pain test propose that marrubiin acts by some peripheral mechanism. In the hot-plate test, marrubiin did not increase the latency period of pain induced by the thermal stimuli. Reducing the lactone ring of marrubiin with the formation of marrubiinic acid and two esterified derivatives has conditioned the successful analgesic effect influencing the number of writhes in mice. Marrubiinic acid exhibited a high analgesic effect that has been long established in other experimental models of pain, suggesting the possibility to use it as a new and useful analgesic agent [

    <span class="italic">Stachys</span>, native to Turkey, Armenia, and Iran, play a significant role in the inhibition of pain and inflammatory processes by using two inflammatory models, namely, formalin test and carrageenan-induced paw edema.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dried and finely powdered aerial parts were extracted with acetone at room temperature for 2 weeks in order to isolate and identify an acyclic diterpene ester (phytyl nonadecanoate), two normal alkanes (tritriacontane and hentriacontane), one fatty acid (oleic acid), and two sterols (stigmasterol and lawsaritol). Structures were established by conventional methods of analysis and confirmed by 
    <span class="sup">1</span>H, 
    <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR, and mass spectral analysis. All three doses of acetone/methanol extracts of 
    <span class="italic">Stachys byzantina</span> (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), administered by intraperitoneal injections, significantly inhibited the pain associated with the second phase (inflammatory component) of the formalin test, and the effect of the low dose was predominant. Compared to indomethacin (high dose of 5 mg/kg) as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the extracts decreased licking response in the late phase significantly, with the maximum inhibitory response obtained with 50 mg/kg of the extract.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors assumed that the analgesic effects of the extracts are probably mediated by interactions with inflammatory mediators (arachidonic acid metabolites), since the antinociceptive activities were observed in late phase (20 min after formalin injection). In the carrageenan-induced paw edema, both extracts revealed dose-related inhibitory effects, in both early and delayed phases, over the dose range 50–200 mg/kg, similar to a high dose of indomethacin (5 mg/kg). The present data demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activity of acetone and methanol extracts of 
    <span class="italic">S. byzantina</span> is probably related to the inhibition of the synthesis or release of COX2 products.

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This compound most likely exerts its analgesic effects through modulating the inflammatory process. Baicalein's anti-inflammatory activity can partly be explained by its inhibitory effects on lipoxygenases—enzymes that play a key role in leukotriene and lipoxin synthesis, thus initiating the inflammatory response. Deschamps et al. found that baicalein inhibits both human platelet 12-lipoxygenase and human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase-1 [
    <a rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179">179</a>]. Additionally, Hsieh et al. showed that baicalein inhibits IL-1

    <a rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184">184</a>]. However, it is very likely that, taking into account the fact that baicalein is effective also in noninflammatory types of pain, it has other analgesic mechanisms as well. One hypothesis states that baicalein binds to the GABA
    <sub>A</sub> receptor, which has a modulatory effect on pain because GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. When directly injected into the central nervous system, baicalein has strong sedative and anxiolytic effects due to GABA binding [
    <a rid="B185" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185">185</a>]. Also, a recently published article indicated that through GABA modulation, baicalin could be used in orofacial pain modulation [
    <a rid="B186" ref-type="bibr" href="#B186">186</a>]. Another study also suggested that baicalein modulates both intracellular and extracellular calcium levels [

    <span class="italic">Mentha</span> species displayed different analgesic effects, indicating that these effects are species- and extract-form dependent [

    <a rid="B338" ref-type="bibr" href="#B338">338</a>]. These findings indicate that the phytochemicals present in the 
    <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> extract exhibit analgesic effect arising from both CNS and peripheral actions since the response appears to both thermal and chemical pain stimuli. A similar efficacy is characteristic of central analgesics, such as morphine, which inhibits equally inflammatory and noninflammatory pains. The results concerning analgesic effects produced by 
    <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> strongly recommend this plant as pain reducing and encourage further studies for a better understanding of the nociception mechanism in order to find new options in pain therapy, with less side effects.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toxicology studies of peppermint oil and its components completed in animals have shown no adverse effects or histopathological modifications. There are no chronic toxicity studies of peppermint in humans, although the use of peppermint oil has been reported as contraindicated in patients with bile duct, gallbladder, and liver disorders. The use of peppermint oil capsules in patients with GI reflux, hiatal hernia, or kidney stones needs also caution [

    <span class="italic">Mentha spicata</span> L., also known as spearmint, originated in Bangladesh and is traditionally used as herbal remedy for various disorders. Hajjaj Yousuf et al. have performed a study which aimed at evaluating the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects of 
    <span class="italic">M. spicata</span> on animal models, using hot-plate, acetic acid-induced writhing test, carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, and yeast-induced pyrexia methods [
    <a rid="B340" ref-type="bibr" href="#B340">340</a>]. The hot-plate results suggest a centrally antinociceptive action with a higher pain inhibition at 180 minutes after administration, being comparable to a standard drug. The acetic acid-induced writhing method evaluates the peripherally analgesic action, which took place through inhibition of local peritoneal receptors, most probably by inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. The anti-inflammatory effect was maintained at a significant level for a 6-hour period, showing efficiency in the late phase of inflammation due to the presence of certain components that interfere with the release of prostaglandins.
