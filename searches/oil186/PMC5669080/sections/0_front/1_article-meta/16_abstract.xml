  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Ferula tingitana</italic> L. (Apiaceae) has been considered to have abortive and menstruation-inducing properties. It used to treat sore throat, fever, indigestion, and pains.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st2">
  <title>Objectives:</title>
  <p>The objective of this study is to establish the chemical composition of the essential oil of flower, leaves of 
   <italic>F. tingitana</italic>, and to throw light on antimicrobial, cytotoxic activities of Libyan plant.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st3">
  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>The chemical composition of the essential oil of flower (0.06% w/v) and leaves (0.1% w/v) of 
   <italic>F. tingitana</italic> was comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using nonpolar column DB-5.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st4">
  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>A total of 28–32 components were identified, 15 being common in both samples. The main constituents of both flower- and leave-derived oil samples were α-thujene (13.5%–2.3%), elemol (8.9%–8.3%), eudesmol (0.6%–9.7%) and cadinol (2.2%–13.8%), respectively. The principle difference was a considerably more pronounced sesquiterpenes presence in the leaves-oil, amounting to 74.0%, than in the flower counterpart (39.9%). Caryophyllene (5.6%) and elemol (8.9%) were the major sesquiterpenes detected in flower-oil while leaves-oil showed less amounts of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbons (27.7%) and represented by eudesmadiene (9.0%). On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples, monoterpenoids are relatively more abundant in flower-derived oil constituting 57.7% versus 24.5% detected in leaves.</p>

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>Leaves-oil sample being mostly efficient as antibacterial against 
   <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
   <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> with potency 48.3, 41.9% compared to tetracycline standard antibacterial drug. The essential oil samples revealed marked 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity against breast (MCF7), cervical (HELA) and liver(HEPG2) carcinoma cell lines with IC50% (6.9, 4.8), (8.6, 10.9), and (4.4, 4.2) for the flower-, leaves-derived oil sample, respectively.

  <title>SUMMARY</title>
  <p>
   <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
     <p>Comparative analysis of the investigated oil samples indicates more pronounced monoterpene contents in 
      <italic>Ferula tingitana</italic> flower. The principle monoterpenoid constituents of both oils are α-thujene. Sesquiterpenes presence is considerably more pronounced in the leaves-derived oil sample
     </p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>Elemol, cadinol, α-thujene and a-terpinoline, the major components of the flower- and leaves-derived oil in the present work and were not detected in the Turkish sample. The differences may be due to climatic and other extrinsic conditions such as where and when the samples were collected</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>When screened for antimicrobial activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil of 
      <italic>F. tingitana</italic> exhibited a mild effect against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. However, not displayed growth inhibitory effect against the fungus 
      <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
      <italic>Candida albicans</italic>
     </p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>On assessing the cytotoxic activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil exhibited specific and significant effects on the viability of the selected human cell lines, viz., hormone-responsive breast carcinoma cell line (MCF7), cervical carcinoma cell line (HELA), and liver carcinoma cell line (HEPG2).</p>
