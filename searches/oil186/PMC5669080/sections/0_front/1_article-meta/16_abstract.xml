  <title class="title">Background:</title>
  <p class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Ferula tingitana</italic> L. (Apiaceae) has been considered to have abortive and menstruation-inducing properties. It used to treat sore throat, fever, indigestion, and pains.

  <title class="title">Objectives:</title>
  <p class="p">The objective of this study is to establish the chemical composition of the essential oil of flower, leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">F. tingitana</italic>, and to throw light on antimicrobial, cytotoxic activities of Libyan plant.

  <title class="title">Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">The chemical composition of the essential oil of flower (0.06% w/v) and leaves (0.1% w/v) of 
   <italic class="italic">F. tingitana</italic> was comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using nonpolar column DB-5.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st4" class="sec">
  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">A total of 28–32 components were identified, 15 being common in both samples. The main constituents of both flower- and leave-derived oil samples were α-thujene (13.5%–2.3%), elemol (8.9%–8.3%), eudesmol (0.6%–9.7%) and cadinol (2.2%–13.8%), respectively. The principle difference was a considerably more pronounced sesquiterpenes presence in the leaves-oil, amounting to 74.0%, than in the flower counterpart (39.9%). Caryophyllene (5.6%) and elemol (8.9%) were the major sesquiterpenes detected in flower-oil while leaves-oil showed less amounts of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbons (27.7%) and represented by eudesmadiene (9.0%). On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples, monoterpenoids are relatively more abundant in flower-derived oil constituting 57.7% versus 24.5% detected in leaves.</p>

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">Leaves-oil sample being mostly efficient as antibacterial against 
   <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> with potency 48.3, 41.9% compared to tetracycline standard antibacterial drug. The essential oil samples revealed marked 
   <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity against breast (MCF7), cervical (HELA) and liver(HEPG2) carcinoma cell lines with IC50% (6.9, 4.8), (8.6, 10.9), and (4.4, 4.2) for the flower-, leaves-derived oil sample, respectively.

     <p class="p">Comparative analysis of the investigated oil samples indicates more pronounced monoterpene contents in 
      <italic class="italic">Ferula tingitana</italic> flower. The principle monoterpenoid constituents of both oils are α-thujene. Sesquiterpenes presence is considerably more pronounced in the leaves-derived oil sample

     <p class="p">Elemol, cadinol, α-thujene and a-terpinoline, the major components of the flower- and leaves-derived oil in the present work and were not detected in the Turkish sample.

     <p class="p">When screened for antimicrobial activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil of
