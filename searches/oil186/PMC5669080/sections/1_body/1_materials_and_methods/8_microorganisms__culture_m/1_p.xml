<p>The antimicrobial activity was performed against a set of 8 representative Gram-positive and negative bacterial and two fungal strains of standard properties [
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. These were maintained in the Micro Analytical Center, Faculty of Science, Cairo University. The tested Gram-positive bacteria were (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6051, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 12600 and 
 <italic>Streptococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 19433). The Gram-negative bacteria included (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 10145, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 11775, and 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic> ATCC 19424), and fungi (
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 26555). The tested bacteria were grown on nutrient agar (Oxoid, England) and fungi on Sabouraud's glucose agar (Oxoid, England). Tetracycline (Oxoid, UK) and Amphotericin B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal agents.
