<p class="p">Samples of flower-, leaves-derived oil at different concentrations (0.0–50.0 μg/ml) in DMSO were tested for cytotoxicity, against the aforementioned human tumor cell lines adopting SRB stain assay. The relation between surviving fractions and oil concentration was plotted to get the survival curve of each tumor cell line after the application of the specific concentration. The results were compared to those of the standard cytotoxic drug, doxorubicin (10 mg Adriamycin hydrochloride, in 5 ml intravenous injection, Pharmacia, Italy) at the same concentrations. The dose of the test solutions which reduces survival to 50% (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated [
