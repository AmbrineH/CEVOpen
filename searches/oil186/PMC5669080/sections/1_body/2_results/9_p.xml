<p>The aforementioned cell compartmentation[
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] seems to be in accord with the postulated direct light interference with the non-MVA pathway[
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and consequently with the obviously prevalent cross-talk between the cytoplasmic and plastidial biosynthetic routes.[
