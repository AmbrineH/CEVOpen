<p>In plants, both the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways generate the five-carbon compound IPP and its isomer DMAPP. Plants have enzymes called terpene synthases, which catalyze the formation of diverse hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene, plant volatiles from DMAPP, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively.[
