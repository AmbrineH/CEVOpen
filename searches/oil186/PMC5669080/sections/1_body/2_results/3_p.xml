<p>Comparative analysis of the investigated oil samples, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, indicates more pronounced monoterpene contents in 
 <italic>F. tingitana</italic> flower reaching 57.3% while the leaf-derived oil contains 23.9%. The principle monoterpenoid constituents of both oils are α-thujene (13.5% and 2.3%, for flowers and leaves, respectively) and α-terpinolene (1.1%, 5.2%). Sesquiterpenes presence is considerably more pronounced in the leaves-derived oil sample, amounting 74.0% than in its flower counterpart containing 39.9% of C
 <sub>15</sub> terpenes. The presence of a higher concentration of sesquiterpenes in both oils can induce their usage as fixative essential oils for the formulation of fragrances. Cadinol (13.8%), elemol (8.3%) and germacreneD-4-ol (7.7%) were the major identified oxygenated sesquiterpenes in leaves-derived oil. Eudesma-3,5diene (9.0%) and Eudesmol (9.7%) prevailed in leaves-derived oil while the latter is minor quentities in flower-derived oil (0.6%).
