<p class="p">In the flower-derived oil, ten sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, amounting to 18.0%, were identified. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, showing the highest percentage (5.6%), is accompanied by minor quantities of functionalized sesquiterpenes with the same basic structure, namely, β-caryophyllene oxide (0.7%), which are detected only in the flower-derived oil. Flowers have a high risk of pathogen attack because of their rich nutrient, moisture content, and high frequency of insect visitors. (E)-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene, thus, appears to serve as a defense against pathogens that invade flower tissues.[
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] Caryophyllene and its oxide report properties of pharmacological interest as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, and antiseptic.[

 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples under investigation, monoterpenes are relatively more abundant in flower-derived oil constituting 57.3% as opposed to 23.9% detected in leaves.
