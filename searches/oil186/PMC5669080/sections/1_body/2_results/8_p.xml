<p>A plastidic prenyltransferase synthesizes GPP from the condensation of one IPP molecule and one DMAPP molecule. A second type of plastidic prenyltransferase condenses DMAPP with three IPP molecules to produce GGPP, the plastid-localized MEP pathway, is though to feed the biosynthesis of monoterpenoids and diterpenoids, which is initiated from C5-sugars. In different plant tissues, monoterpenes are biosynthesized exclusively through (MEP) pathway whereas sesquiterpenes are generated by the classical mevalonic acid pathway as well as by the MEP route.[
