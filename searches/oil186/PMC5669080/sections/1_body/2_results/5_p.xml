<p>This observation could be accounted for the formation of active isoprene units-basic C
 <sub>5</sub> terpenes building block. Isoprene itself does not undergo the building process, but rather activated forms, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP or also isopentenyl diphosphate), and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP or also dimethylallyl diphosphate), are the components proceeding through two alternative pathways.
