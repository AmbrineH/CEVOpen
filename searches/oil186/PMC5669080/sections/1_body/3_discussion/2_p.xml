<p>An alternative goal of the hereby presented study was to draw conclusion as to the presumed disparities between our observation and previously published data concerning the chemistry of 
 <italic>F. tingitana</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>F. tingitana</italic> flower and leaves growing in Libya. Nevertheless, the composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic>F. tingitana</italic>, cultivated in different regions of Turkey, was previously studied.[
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] It was rich in monoterpenes represented by Naphthalene (15%), α-Pinene (11%). Meanwhile, sesquiterpenes were predominated by Daucene (6%) (Z)-
 <italic>β</italic>-Farnesene (5%) Germacrene D (5%).[

 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, elemene, a-humulene, and eudesma − 3, 5 diene were present Libyan samples. Moreover, the hydrocarbon, α-pinene were present in both Turkish[
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and Libyan 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> in comparable amounts. α-pinene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene are reported as a major constituent of most studied 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> taxa, and considered as chemotype of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic>.[
