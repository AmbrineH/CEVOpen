 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>]. Lower effects were obtained on testing the flower-derived oil. The previous studies revealed that many essential oil components exhibited cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic effect of the leaves-derived oil could be attributed to its relatively high content of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (46.5%) including γ-cadinol (13.8%) which has been reported to exert cytotoxic activity.[
