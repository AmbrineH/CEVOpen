<p class="p">When screened for antimicrobial activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tingitana</italic> exhibited a mild effect against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms as compared to the standard antibacterial drug, tetracycline [
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>]. However, tested essential oils not displayed growth inhibitory effect against the fungus 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> as compared to the standard antifungal drug, amphotericin B. The leaves-derived oil is slightly more effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria than oil of flower. Antimicrobial activity of essential oil is difficult to correlate to a specific compound due to their complexity and variability and in general, is attributed to phenolic hydroxyl groups able to form hydrogen bonds with active site of target enzymes, although other active terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and esters can contribute to the overall antimicrobial effect of essential oil.[
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] The oil samples showed moderate antibacterial activity on 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. gonorrhoeae. B. subtilis</italic>, which are multiple antibiotic bacteria, because it is a biogenic amine procedure in food.[
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> has become an important agent of nosocomial infection.[
 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] The essential oil also inhibited the growth of multiple antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus strain, tested. The effect of essential oil on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> were high. 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is a one of the most common causes of both hospital and community-acquired infection worldwide.[
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is a major cause of cutaneous infections, furunculosis, impetigo and arthritis, and toxinoses, such as food poisoning, septic shock, scalded skin syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. The presence of antibiotic resistant Staphylococci is of concern due to the possible spread of resistance determinants among the 
 <italic class="italic">staphylococcus</italic> species.
