 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial activity was performed against a set of 8 representative Gram-positive and negative bacterial and two fungal strains of standard properties [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">Table 3</a>]. These were maintained in the Micro Analytical Center, Faculty of Science, Cairo University. The tested Gram-positive bacteria were (
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span> ATCC 6051, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 12600 and 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus faecalis</span> ATCC 19433). The Gram-negative bacteria included (
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> ATCC 10145, 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> ATCC 11775, and 
  <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhea</span> ATCC 19424), and fungi (
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> ATCC 26555). The tested bacteria were grown on nutrient agar (Oxoid, England) and fungi on Sabouraud's glucose agar (Oxoid, England). Tetracycline (Oxoid, UK) and Amphotericin B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal agents.
