 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrodistillation of the flower and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">F. tingitana</span> were yielded 0.06% w/v and 0.1% w/v, respectively of clear yellow-colored oil exhibiting a characteristic agreeable odor. The yield of leaves derived oil exceed that obtained from flower about two times as flower-oil sample as depicted in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 32 components could be identified in flower and 28 in leaves, corresponding to 97.2% and 97.9% of the oil derived from the respective organs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report dealing with the essential oil composition of Libyan 
  <span class="italic">F. tingitana</span> flower as opposed to the leaf-derived volatiles.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparative analysis of the investigated oil samples, as presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>, indicates more pronounced monoterpene contents in 
  <span class="italic">F. tingitana</span> flower reaching 57.3% while the leaf-derived oil contains 23.9%. The principle monoterpenoid constituents of both oils are α-thujene (13.5% and 2.3%, for flowers and leaves, respectively) and α-terpinolene (1.1%, 5.2%). Sesquiterpenes presence is considerably more pronounced in the leaves-derived oil sample, amounting 74.0% than in its flower counterpart containing 39.9% of C
  <sub>15</sub> terpenes. The presence of a higher concentration of sesquiterpenes in both oils can induce their usage as fixative essential oils for the formulation of fragrances. Cadinol (13.8%), elemol (8.3%) and germacreneD-4-ol (7.7%) were the major identified oxygenated sesquiterpenes in leaves-derived oil. Eudesma-3,5diene (9.0%) and Eudesmol (9.7%) prevailed in leaves-derived oil while the latter is minor quentities in flower-derived oil (0.6%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the flower-derived oil, ten sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, amounting to 18.0%, were identified. 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, showing the highest percentage (5.6%), is accompanied by minor quantities of functionalized sesquiterpenes with the same basic structure, namely, β-caryophyllene oxide (0.7%), which are detected only in the flower-derived oil. Flowers have a high risk of pathogen attack because of their rich nutrient, moisture content, and high frequency of insect visitors. (E)-
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene, thus, appears to serve as a defense against pathogens that invade flower tissues.[
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">33</a>] Caryophyllene and its oxide report properties of pharmacological interest as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, and antiseptic.[
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">34</a>
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">35</a>] On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples under investigation, monoterpenes are relatively more abundant in flower-derived oil constituting 57.3% as opposed to 23.9% detected in leaves.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This observation could be accounted for the formation of active isoprene units-basic C
  <sub>5</sub> terpenes building block. Isoprene itself does not undergo the building process, but rather activated forms, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP or also isopentenyl diphosphate), and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP or also dimethylallyl diphosphate), are the components proceeding through two alternative pathways.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In plants, both the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways generate the five-carbon compound IPP and its isomer DMAPP. Plants have enzymes called terpene synthases, which catalyze the formation of diverse hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene, plant volatiles from DMAPP, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively.[
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">36</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In cytosol, the condensation of one DMAPP molecule with two IPP molecules results in FPP, the MVA pathway[
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">37</a>] localized in the cytosol, provides the isoprene units for sesquiterpenes biosynthesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A plastidic prenyltransferase synthesizes GPP from the condensation of one IPP molecule and one DMAPP molecule. A second type of plastidic prenyltransferase condenses DMAPP with three IPP molecules to produce GGPP, the plastid-localized MEP pathway, is though to feed the biosynthesis of monoterpenoids and diterpenoids, which is initiated from C5-sugars. In different plant tissues, monoterpenes are biosynthesized exclusively through (MEP) pathway whereas sesquiterpenes are generated by the classical mevalonic acid pathway as well as by the MEP route.[
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">38</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aforementioned cell compartmentation[
  <a rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref39">39</a>] seems to be in accord with the postulated direct light interference with the non-MVA pathway[
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">40</a>] and consequently with the obviously prevalent cross-talk between the cytoplasmic and plastidial biosynthetic routes.[
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">41</a>] Hence, the significantly higher amount of C
  <sub>15</sub> terpenoids observed previously in the plant organs less photosynthetically active and less exposed to the light.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Light may directly interfere with the regulation of the MEP pathway and with the cross-talk between the cytoplasmic MVA and the plastidial MEP pathways.[
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">42</a>] Activation of the MEP pathway by light is documented by rapid emission of isoprenoids known to be derived from MEP pathway on irradiation of green tissue, isoprene, and monoterpenes.[
  <a rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref43">43</a>] Rates of biosynthesis of plant volatiles in leaf were highest when leaves are young, not fully expanded and need the most protection, which plant volatiles provide directly because of their toxicity or indirectly through the summoning of herbivores’ predators.[
  <a rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref44">44</a>
  <a rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref45">45</a>
  <a rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref46">46</a>] High rates were also observed when flowers are ready for pollination, and they decrease drastically after fertilization.[
  <a rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref45">45</a>
  <a rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref47">47</a>] Biosynthetic rates are correlated with levels of transcripts of genes encoding the final biosynthetic enzymes, or the concentration of the substrates of these enzymes, or both.[
  <a rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref45">45</a>
  <a rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref48">48</a>] In 
  <span class="italic">F. tingitana</span>, leaves–derived oil contain C
  <sub>15</sub> terpenes oxygenated in higher amount than in the counterpart its flower which may be explained by the distribution of the foliage.
