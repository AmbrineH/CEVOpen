<p class="p">The results of this study demonstrate the potential of thyme oil, clove oil, and tea tree oil for use as antifungal agents against tested fungi strains (
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> G87, 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium corylophilum</italic> CBMF1, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> ATCC 16404) and three potential pathogenic food bacteria: 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. The overall results of the MIC values show that thyme oil is the most effective with a very low concentration used against both on the three fungi and bacteria, followed by clove and tea tree oils, while the rosemary oil is less active or inactive.
