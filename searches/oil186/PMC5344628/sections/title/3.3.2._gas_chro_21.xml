 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3.2. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Detector and Flame-Ionized Detector Analysis (GC-MSD/FID)</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils were characterized by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detector (GC-MSD) for qualitative analysis and, with a flame ionized detector (GC-FID) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), quantitative analysis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC analysis was performed on a 6890 Agilent Technologies chromatograph using the following parameters: a Teknokroma TR-520232 (95% dimethyl- and 5% diphenyl-polysiloxane, crosslinked; 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm) capillary column, a 1 mL/min helium flow, an inlet at 175 °C, a 100:1 split ratio, and a temperature program starting at 60 °C, with a heating rate of 7 °C/min up to 200 °C and then 15 °C/min up to 300 °C, followed by isothermal heating at 300 °C for 3.33 min.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MS detection was performed on a 5975 Inert XL Agilent Technologies detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), at 70 eV. Identification of chromatographic peaks was made by reference to Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database, with a quality of recognition above 90%.</p>
