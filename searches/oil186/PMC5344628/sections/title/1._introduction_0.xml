 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consumers demand high quality foods with minimal changes in nutritional properties. A minimal amount of synthetic additives combined with a suitable packaging technology that retains or creates desirable food qualities or reduces undesirable changes in food due to microbial activity is therefore a goal of food manufacturers [
  <a rid="B1-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-materials-10-00045">1</a>]. New processes must be designed to meet the required food product safety or shelf-life demands, and additional hurdles for microorganisms should be introduced. World Health Organization (WHO) reports [
  <a rid="B2-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-materials-10-00045">2</a>] in recent years estimate that 30% of people in industrialized countries suffer from a food-borne disease each year. Reducing or eliminating food-borne pathogens via “green” consumerism concomitantly with low salt consumption to diminish the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is increasingly becoming a public health concern. On the other hand, antimicrobial resistance affects all areas of health, as many medicinal procedures are related to antibiotics [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, new methods and additives should be found to prolong service life and to improve the safety of foods. Recently, effective preventive measures and intelligent preservation methods have been put into place to reduce food spoilage, increase safety, and prolong food shelf-life. One of these methods is bioactive packaging by the use of natural compounds with multifunctional properties both to achieve the protection of food and to improve the health of consumers. The concern regarding safety issues of the synthetic antimicrobial agents has led to the use of essential oils (EOs), which represent eco-friendly alternatives to chemicals. Essential oils (also called volatile oils) are oily liquids obtained from plant materials (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and roots). Plant-derived essential oils are complex mixtures of natural volatile compounds resulting from the plant secondary metabolism and extracted from vegetable materials by expression (i.e., “cold pressing”), fermentation, enfleurage, or extraction, but the method of distillation with water or steam is the most commonly used for the commercial production of EOs. Essential oils contain important classes of compounds such as monoterpenes (C
  <sub>10</sub> hydrocarbons based on 2 isoprene units), phenylpropanoides (C
  <sub>6</sub> aromatic compounds with C
  <sub>3</sub> side chains), sesquiterpenes (C
  <sub>15</sub> hydrocarbons based on 3 isoprene units), diterpenes (C
  <sub>20</sub>), triterpenes (C
  <sub>30</sub>) and their oxygenated derivatives, and phenolic compounds (such as thymol and carvacrol). Due to their versatile content, essential oils constitute a rich source of biologically active compounds possessing antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiviral, antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic, antibiotic, and antiseptic properties and insecticidal activities; therefore, they are useful in a wide range of applications [
  <a rid="B4-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-materials-10-00045">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-materials-10-00045">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the above-mentioned constituents contributes to beneficial or adverse effects; therefore, it is very important to know as much as possible about the composition and properties of EOs, with each study bringing new highlights on the advantages and disadvantages they offer.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many studies on the characterization of volatile compound composition and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various selected groups of essential oils. Bozin et al. characterized Lamiaceae species and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the oils of 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</span> L., 
  <span class="italic">Origanum vulgare</span> L., and 
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span> L. [
  <a rid="B6-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-materials-10-00045">6</a>], and the chemical constituents of four populations of 
  <span class="italic">Piper aduncum</span> L. from Distrito Federal, Brazil [
  <a rid="B7-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-materials-10-00045">7</a>], were identified. Many other essential oils have been characterized, namely, sweet lime (
  <span class="italic">Citrus limetta</span> Risso) [
  <a rid="B8-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-materials-10-00045">8</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Chenopodium ambrosioides</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Philodendron bipinnatifidum</span> [
  <a rid="B9-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-materials-10-00045">9</a>], cinnamon oil, eucalyptus oil, lemongrass oil, peppermint oil, citronella oil, turpentine oil [
  <a rid="B10-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-materials-10-00045">10</a>], citronella oil [
  <a rid="B11-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-materials-10-00045">11</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Tithonia diversifolia</span> (Hemsl.) A. Gray [
  <a rid="B12-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-materials-10-00045">12</a>], 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> L. from Italy [
  <a rid="B13-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-materials-10-00045">13</a>], and Iranian geranium oil [
  <a rid="B14-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-materials-10-00045">14</a>]. The composition of two species of mint (
  <span class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</span> Ehrh. and 
  <span class="italic">Mentha rotundifolia</span>) grown in Orăştie-Romania has been comparatively examinated [
  <a rid="B15-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-materials-10-00045">15</a>]. From the 21 plant essential oils (cinnamon, clove, geranium, lemon, lime, orange and rosemary, aniseed, eucalyptus, and camphor) tested against six bacterial species four Gram-negative bacteria (
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Proteus vulgaris</span>) and two Gram-positive bacteria 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> [
  <a rid="B16-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-materials-10-00045">16</a>], 19 oils showed antibacterial activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consumers are worried about the presence of chemical preservatives, which can lead to benzoic acid by the decarboxylating action of some spoilage microorganisms, and this is considered the cause of many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes and residual toxicity. Therefore, the studies to find natural and socially acceptable preservatives receive increasing attention by screening the composition and the biological, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities of plant extracts [
  <a rid="B17-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-materials-10-00045">17</a>]. Essential oils can prevent fungal growth in food products, which may cause spoilage and result in a reduction in the quality and quantity of food (shelf-life). Most EOs applied directly onto food or in the vapor phase can reduce or stop the colony forming ability of molds. They are also regarded as safe (GRAS) and are accepted by the FDA and by consumers. By their potential antimicrobial/antifungal/antioxidant effects, EOs could be the answer to the current search for environmental solutions and to assuring the microbial safety of food products in active packaging applications [
  <a rid="B18-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-materials-10-00045">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-materials-10-00045">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, four essential oils, namely, thyme (
  <span class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</span> L.), clove (
  <span class="italic">Eugenia caryophyllus</span> from dried floral buds of 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span>), rosemary (
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> L.), and tea tree (
  <span class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia aetheroleum</span>) obtained from Romanian production (Fares Co., Orăştie, Romania) are intent to be used as components in bioactive food packaging. Therefore, as a first step, it should be worthwhile to comparatively evaluate the composition and antimicrobial/antioxidant activity of these four EOs. Antifungal and antibacterial activity against three target food spoilage fungi (
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus brasiliensis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium corylophilum</span>) and three potential pathogenic food bacteria (
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L. monocytogenes</span>) have been evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) concentration was established in each case. The antioxidant activity was determined, and the most efficient oil for each type of activity was established. Preliminary tests on the EO encapsulation into chitosan films and their antimicrobial activity against the spoilage of beef meat showed promising results, a detailed presentation for which will be provided in a future paper.
