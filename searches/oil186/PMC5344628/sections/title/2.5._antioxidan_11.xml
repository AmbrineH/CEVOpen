 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the analyzed essential oils, IC50 is in the μg/mL range assigned to a very good antioxidant activity [
  <a rid="B55-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-materials-10-00045">55</a>]. From the selected essential oils, the clove oil is by far the most radical scavenging active, with an IC50 of 8 μg/mL. The antioxidant activity was associated with the presence of phenolic compounds in the composition of essential oils, as determined by the Folin–Ciocâlteu method and the GC-FID technique and ORAC values. The antioxidant activity varies in the following order: clove oil &gt; thyme oil &gt; rosemary oil &gt;&gt; tea tree oil. Based on the radical scavenging tests, the clove oil is the most effective antioxidant is recommended for further such applications.
