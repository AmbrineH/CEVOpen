 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t004" href="#materials-10-00045-t004">Table 4</a> shows that, from all the essential oils tested in this study, rosemary oil did not show desirable results against the selected fungi.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results evidenced that the most effective essential oil from the tested oils was thyme essential oil, which displayed strong antifungal activity with MIC values between 116.27 and 174.41 ppm. MIC values of clove, rosemary, and tea tree essential oils were found within the range of 465.11â€“1395.34 ppm.</p>
