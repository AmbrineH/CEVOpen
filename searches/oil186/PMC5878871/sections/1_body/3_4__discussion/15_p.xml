<p>NO is released under basal conditions and its production can be markedly stimulated by bradykinin, acetylcholine, and particularly histamine [

 <italic> Artemisia iwayomogi</italic> extract, containing camphor and borneol (among the main constituents of LEO), inhibited compound 48/80â€“induced systemic reactions in mice and attenuated histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80 or IgE [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] demonstrated that the essential oil of lavender, applied topically, inhibits histamine release from peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48-80. Based on our results, we suggest that LEO may inhibit the release of histamine by mast cells.
