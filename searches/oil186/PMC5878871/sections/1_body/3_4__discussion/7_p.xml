<p>The croton oil is a phlogistic agent that induces an inflammatory response by activating phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> and initiating arachidonic acid metabolites involved in edema and leukocyte migration is associated with alterations in cytokine production and increased production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes [
