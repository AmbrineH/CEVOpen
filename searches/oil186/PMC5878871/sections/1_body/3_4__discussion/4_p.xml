<p>In the cell viability assay, it was found that LEO in high concentrations (30 and 90â€‰ug/ml) affected cell viability. However, at lower concentrations LEO was not proved to be cytotoxic. Confirming our results, a study reported that the essential oil of lavender has the cytotoxicity dose-dependent manner and can vary with its constituents [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a study performed by Alnamer et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] it was observed that the oral administration of extract of
 <italic> Lavandula officinalis</italic> is not toxic and does not cause significant changes in the body weight. This result indicates that the use in low concentrations can be considered safe.
