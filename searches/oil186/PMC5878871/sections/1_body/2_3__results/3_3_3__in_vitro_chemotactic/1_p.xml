<p>The present study evaluated the chemotactic effects of LEO at different concentrations (2, 15, and 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) on leukocyte chemotaxis
 <italic> in vitro</italic>. However, LEO did not increase leukocytes chemotaxis in any concentrations when compared to the vehicle (RPMI-1640). The fMLP (10
 <sup>-6 </sup>M) (positive control) induced a significant leukocyte migration (data not shown).
