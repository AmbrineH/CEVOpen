<p>Phytochemical studies revealed that the major constituents of
 <italic> Lavandula angustifolia</italic> essential oil (LEO) are 1,8-cineole, camphor, and endo-borneol. Other components can also be found in minor quantities, such as 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, camphene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, p-cymene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and cryptone [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the LEO composition may vary depending on the geographical origin of the plant material and environmental factors, such as geographical conditions, climate and seasonal variations, and the stage of the plant growth, and the extraction and detection methods also influence the LEO composition [
