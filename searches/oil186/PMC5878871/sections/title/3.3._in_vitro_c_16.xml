 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study evaluated the chemotactic effects of LEO at different concentrations (2, 15, and 150 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml) on leukocyte chemotaxis
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span>. However, LEO did not increase leukocytes chemotaxis in any concentrations when compared to the vehicle (RPMI-1640). The fMLP (10
  <span class="sup">-6 </span>M) (positive control) induced a significant leukocyte migration (data not shown).
