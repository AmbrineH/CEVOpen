 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Lamiaceae family of plants is a major source of polyphenols and pharmacological properties described in the literature. Belonging to the Lamiaceae family,
  <span class="italic"> Lavandula angustifolia</span> is indigenous to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, with many therapeutic properties and biological activities [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytochemical studies revealed that the major constituents of
  <span class="italic"> Lavandula angustifolia</span> essential oil (LEO) are 1,8-cineole, camphor, and endo-borneol. Other components can also be found in minor quantities, such as 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, camphene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene, p-cymene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and cryptone [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. However, the LEO composition may vary depending on the geographical origin of the plant material and environmental factors, such as geographical conditions, climate and seasonal variations, and the stage of the plant growth, and the extraction and detection methods also influence the LEO composition [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extracts and
  <span class="italic"> Lavandula angustifolia</span> essential oil have various pharmacological effects described in the literature, such as anticonvulsant [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>], anxiolytic [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>], antioxidant, anticholinesterase [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>], antimicrobial [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>], and antifungal activities [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. Additionally, various constituents in the oil also have valuable pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>–
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inflammation is a complex biological process involving vascular, cellular components and a variety of soluble substances, presenting as characteristic clinical signs: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and function loss [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The purpose of the inflammatory process is the elimination of the aggressive agent and consequences of tissue injury [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. The leukocytes recruitment is essential in the acute inflammatory response, where cells act as the first line of defense in the initiation of the inflammatory process, and involves the participation of several inflammatory mediators [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], produced by inflammatory cells that play an important role in maintaining the inflammatory response [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural products and their essential oils have been popularly used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies. Studies suggest that the use of natural products may be safer and more effective since they have low toxicity and few side effects [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Thus, the objective of this research was to investigate the LEO activity in acute inflammation, using different experimental models.
