 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leukocytes were obtained by the method described above. The chemotaxis assay was performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis plate (Neuro Probe), in which the chambers were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane (5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m pore size). LEO (used as chemoattractant) at concentrations of 2, 15, or 150 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL or RPMI 1640 medium (control) was placed in the lower chamber. A leukocyte suspension (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> cells/mL, in RPMI 1640 medium) was placed in the upper chamber. The chambers were incubated (37°C/CO
  <sub>2</sub> 5%) for 1 h and the membrane was stained with Instant Prov. Cells present in the membrane were counted in five random fields from each well, using light microscopy, as previously described [
