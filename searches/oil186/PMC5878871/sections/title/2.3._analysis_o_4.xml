 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LEO was analyzed using gas chromatography- (GC-) mass spectrometry (MS). GC was performed with a Thermo Electron Corporation Focus GC model under the following conditions: DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 mm); column temperature, 60°C (1 min) to 180°C at 3°C/min; injector temperature, 220°C; detector temperature, 220°C; split ratio, 1 : 10; carrier gas, He; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min. An injection volume of 1 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L was diluted in acetone (1 : 10). The retention index (RI) was calculated relative to a series of the
  <span class="italic"> n</span>-alkanes (C

  <sub>40</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on DB-5 column, using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation [
