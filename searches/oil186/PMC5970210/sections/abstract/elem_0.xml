 <p id="Par1">Toxicities and color deformation were evaluated of essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Melissa officinalis</span> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia and their constituents, along with the control efficacy of spray formulations (0.25, 0.5, and 1%) containing 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils cultivated in France and its main compound against 
  <span class="italic">Dermatophagoides farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> adults. In a contact + fumigant bioassay, 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) was more active against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>, compared to 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils (Ireland and Serbia). Interestingly, color alteration of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> was exhibited, changing from colorless to golden brown through the treatment with 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils. The acaricidal and color alteration principle of three 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils was determined to be 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers, indicating that their acaricidal route of action was largely a result of vapor action. Sprays (0.5 and 1%) containing 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and 1% spray containing 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) resulted in 100% mortality and color alteration against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>. These results indicated that 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal could be developed as a suitable acaricidal and mite indicator ingredient for the control of dust mites.
