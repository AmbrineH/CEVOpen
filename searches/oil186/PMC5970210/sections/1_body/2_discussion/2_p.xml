<p id="Par14">The three oils of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia exhibited a number of common main components in variable compositions. The oil of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> cultivated in France was rich in 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (43.37%), but the samples cultivated in Ireland and Serbia contained more β-caryophyllene (30.75 and 32.71%, respectively) than 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (26.90 and 21.88%, respectively). These changes in the compositions of the essential oils may be influenced by several environmental (climatic and seasonal variation, geographical origin) and genetic differences
