<p id="Par16">Investigations of the toxic action mechanisms of naturally occurring acaricides are of practical importance for house dust mite control, because they may provide valuable information on the most suitable formulations to be adopted for their future commercialization

 <italic>officinalis</italic> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers. These results indicate that the acaricidal route of action of these compounds was largely a result of vapor action, although the exact mechanism of the oil remains unknown. The fumigant action of

 <italic>officinalis</italic> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal described, as demonstrated through the current fumigant chamber test (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), is of practical importance, because it allows the essential oil or its main compound to reach deep refugees in blanket, pillows, carpet, and other fabric materials. This fumigant action system has advantages over the contact action system, because exposure to active constituents can be easily controlled in a closed space using suitable application methods
