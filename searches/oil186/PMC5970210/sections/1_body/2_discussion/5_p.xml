 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal, may be best used as safe control agents and mite indicators against

 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal as novel acaricides and mite indicators to proceed, further investigation is necessary on the development of formulations (aerosol, smoking agent, or fumigant) to improve acaricidal efficacy and stability.
