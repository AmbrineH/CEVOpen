 <italic>officinalis</italic> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>farinae</italic> and

 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> were investigated using the contact + fumigant bioassay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After 24 h of treatment with two-fold of the contact + fumigant LD
 <sub>90</sub> values of each sample, there was significant difference in color alteration between treated mites with each sample and untreated mites. As a result, while the untreated mites (
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>farinae</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>) were colorless (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>), the mites treated with 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia presented with color alteration to a golden brown color of their body (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b–d)</xref>), and the color alterations that were visible with the naked eye instead of light microscope were confirmed by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(e)</xref>.
