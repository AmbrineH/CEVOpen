 <sub class="sub">90</sub> values of each sample, there was significant difference in the color alteration between mites treated with 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and mites treated with caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene, geranyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal, or 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatrien. The body of the treated mites with 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal became golden brown color (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), whereas the treated mites with the others were colorless.
