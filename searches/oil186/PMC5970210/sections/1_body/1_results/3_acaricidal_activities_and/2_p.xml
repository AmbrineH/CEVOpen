 <italic>officinalis</italic> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>farinae</italic> and

 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> were investigated using the contact + fumigant bioassay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After 24 h of treatment with two-fold of the contact + fumigant LD
 <sub>90</sub> values of each sample, there was significant difference in the color alteration between mites treated with 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and mites treated with caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene, geranyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal, or 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatrien. The body of the treated mites with 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal became golden brown color (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), whereas the treated mites with the others were colorless.
