<p id="Par2">House dust mites (HDMs), such as 
 <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>, are an important source of atopic dermatitis, perennial rhinitis, and asthma, with more than a million people at risk in the world

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Changes in housing lifestyle, such as individual households in flats, together with carpets and central installed heating, have increased the conditions for the multiplication of

 <italic>farinae</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, HDM allergy is also caused by mite faecal pellets, eggs, and dead mite bodies, making it difficult to control mites from the indoor environment

 </sup>. Control of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>farinae</italic> and

 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> has been conducted by chemical or physical methods

 </sup>. Synthetic acaricides are most commonly used, and include chemical agents containing benzyl benzoate, dibutyl phthalate 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-
 <italic>m</italic>-toluamide (DEET) and pyrethroids
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Although these acaricides are effective, misuse of synthetic acaricides has led to serious drawbacks, including acaricidal resistance, toxicity of human and animals, and environmental hazards
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. In recent years, the development of natural insecticides derived from plants and microbes is required to overcome these drawbacks. Plant-derived products (e.g. 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol and geraniol) that have wide bioactivity against hygienic insect pests and harmful insects have been researched as alternatives to existing insecticides
