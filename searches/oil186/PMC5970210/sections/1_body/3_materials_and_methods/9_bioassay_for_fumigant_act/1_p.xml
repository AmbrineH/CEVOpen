 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The two plastic petri dish bottoms were separated by a 7 × 7 cm section of non-woven fabric of the three thicknesses. Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD

After drying under a fume hood for 3 min, each treated filter paper was attached with double-sided adhesive tape (3 M, South Korea) to the lid of the upper chamber. For each test, 30 adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) were introduced into the untreated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of the lower chamber. A wad of cotton saturated with distilled water (50 µL) had been introduced to the bottom of the lower chamber. The two plastic petri dish bottoms were held together, and wrapped in several layers of Parafilm
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, and the mites were held at 24 °C and 74% relative humidity for 24 h. The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (20×, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were replicated three times.
