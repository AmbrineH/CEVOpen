 </sup>. Mortality percentages were transformed to arcsine square root values for analysis of variance (ANOVA). Student’s t-test was used to test for significant differences between the closed container and open container methods. The Scheffé test was used to test for significant differences among the treatments. Means (±SE) of untransformed data were reported.
