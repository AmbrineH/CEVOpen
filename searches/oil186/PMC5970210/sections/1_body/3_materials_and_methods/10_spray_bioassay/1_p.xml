 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>. For the direct spray application method, groups of 40 adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) were placed on 5.5 cm diameter filter paper 5 min prior to spraying. Each test sample was then sprayed two times successively at 15 cm upwards onto the 5.5 cm diameter filter paper. For the indirect spray application method, each test sample was sprayed two times successively at 15 cm upwards onto the filter paper (5.5 diameter). Groups of 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) were introduced into treated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and each petri dish was sealed with lid. For comparison, DEET and permethrin (
 <italic>cis:trans</italic> 25:75) 2.5 g /L were served as the positive controls. Because permethrin (
 <italic>cis:trans</italic> 25:75) 2.5 g /L spray has been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS, South Korea), the commercial acaricide served as positive controls for spray bioassays. Ethoxylated castor oil (surfactant) + ethanol + distilled water was served as the negative control. The treated and control mites were maintained for 24 h at 24 °C and 74% relative humidity in darkness. The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (40× and 100×, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were replicated three times.
