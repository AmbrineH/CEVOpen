After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and then 80–100 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) of

 <italic class="italic">farinae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pteronyssinus</italic> were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed as stated in above (contact + fumigant mortality bioassay section). A color alteration of the mites was compared with color deformation before and after treatment and conducted using a light microscope (40× and 100×) and naked eye.
