<p id="Par21">The essential oils were analyzed on a GC-MS (HP 6890 and 5973 IV, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). The GC column was a DB-5 (0.25 mm film) fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm thickness). The GC oven temperature was programmed from 51 °C to 211 °C, then increased to 200 °C at 2 °C/min, and held at this temperature for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 0.81 mL/min for the analysis of the essential oils. The essential oil was introduced directly into the MS. Mass spectra were obtained by automatic scanning in the mass range
