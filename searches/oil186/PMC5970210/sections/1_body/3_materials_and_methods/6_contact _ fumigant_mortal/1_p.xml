 </sup> Various concentrations (104, 52, 26, 19.5, 13, 6.5, 3.25, 1.63 and 0.82 µg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) of the three 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> oils (France, Ireland, and Serbia) and all compounds were dissolved in ethanol (100 µL), and applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter paper. After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and then 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>farinae</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed. Positive control with the 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-m-toluamide, a commonly used acaricide for mite control, was similarly formulated. Negative controls received ethanol (100 µL) only.
