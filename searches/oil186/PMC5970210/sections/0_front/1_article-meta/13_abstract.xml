 <p id="Par1">Toxicities and color deformation were evaluated of essential oils of 
  <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia and their constituents, along with the control efficacy of spray formulations (0.25, 0.5, and 1%) containing 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oils cultivated in France and its main compound against 
  <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> and 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> adults. In a contact + fumigant bioassay, 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oil (France) was more active against 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>farinae</italic> and 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>, compared to 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oils (Ireland and Serbia). Interestingly, color alteration of 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>farinae</italic> and 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>pteronyssinus</italic> was exhibited, changing from colorless to golden brown through the treatment with 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oils. The acaricidal and color alteration principle of three 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oils was determined to be 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers, indicating that their acaricidal route of action was largely a result of vapor action. Sprays (0.5 and 1%) containing 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and 1% spray containing 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oil (France) resulted in 100% mortality and color alteration against 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>farinae</italic> and 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>pteronyssinus</italic>. These results indicated that 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>officinalis</italic> oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal could be developed as a suitable acaricidal and mite indicator ingredient for the control of dust mites.
