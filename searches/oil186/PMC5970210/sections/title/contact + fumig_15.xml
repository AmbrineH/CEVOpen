  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> Various concentrations (104, 52, 26, 19.5, 13, 6.5, 3.25, 1.63 and 0.82 µg/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of the three 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils (France, Ireland, and Serbia) and all compounds were dissolved in ethanol (100 µL), and applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter paper. After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and then 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed. Positive control with the 
  <span class="italic">N</span>,
  <span class="italic">N</span>-diethyl-m-toluamide, a commonly used acaricide for mite control, was similarly formulated. Negative controls received ethanol (100 µL) only.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The treated and control mites were maintained for 24 h at 24 °C and 74% relative humidity in darkness. The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (40×, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were replicated three times.</p>
