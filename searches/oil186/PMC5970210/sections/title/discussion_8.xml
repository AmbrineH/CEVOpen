 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many investigations have explored the potential plant-derived acaricides for house dust mite control, their major limitation is that allergen-containing dead mites were not removed. Hence, in the present study, we focused on developing a mite indicator to completely remove the house dust mites from the affected area. The results of this study showed variation in the acaricidal activities of the three oils of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia with respect to geographical regions. 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil from France was more active against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>, compared to 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil cultivated in Ireland and Serbia. An interesting result was the color deformation effect of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>. Our results confirm that the bodies of house dust mites were obviously changed to golden brown from colorless, after treatment with the three oils of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In addition, the color alteration of the mites treated with 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil allowed 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> to be distinguished with the naked eye. This reaction could be caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and tyrosinase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The PPO exists in propolyphenol oxidase form in both insects and house dust mites, and is involved in immunity and self-recognition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. It is thought that disease resistance occurs due to the existence of polyphenol oxidase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, tyrosinase is an oxidase that controls the production of melanin in plants and animals

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three oils of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia exhibited a number of common main components in variable compositions. The oil of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> cultivated in France was rich in 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (43.37%), but the samples cultivated in Ireland and Serbia contained more β-caryophyllene (30.75 and 32.71%, respectively) than 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (26.90 and 21.88%, respectively). These changes in the compositions of the essential oils may be influenced by several environmental (climatic and seasonal variation, geographical origin) and genetic differences
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Previous studies reported that the compositions of the essential oils were significantly dependent upon the locations, including altitude, where the plants grew
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Moreover, many researchers have reported the variation in chemical compositions of the plant essential oils with respect to geographical origin
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Consequently, acaricidal activities were dependent upon the geographical origin of the essential oils, since the main compounds of the essential oils determine their bioactivities

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The superior acaricidal and color deformation potential of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil cultivated in France could be attributed to the high amount of the main components. In our study, the acaricidal and color deformation principle of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) was identified as 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. Of the major constituents tested, high toxicity was obtained from caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal, and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal against 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span>. The acaricidal toxicity of geranyl acetate is comparable with that of DEET. On the other hand, the color alteration of mite bodies was only observed when the 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> were treated with 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. In our previous studies on benzaldehyde derivatives from 
  <span class="italic">Morinda officinalis</span>, 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was found to be toxic to 
  <span class="italic">Dermatophagoides</span> spp., and caused color alteration to a dark brown color of the body
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. The 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal have advantages over 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, because of their safety for humans. 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal are on the FDA’s generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list. Furthermore, 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal has been approved as a food additive by the European Commission (EC), because its use does not pose a risk to consumers’ health status

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, the negative effects of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) were ameliorated by acute administration of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (600 mg dose), with considerable increase in “calmness” and reduced “alertness”. Taking into account their acaricidal properties, color deformation effects, pleasant fruity scent, and safety for humans, 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal might become a suitable acaricidal and mite indicator ingredient for the control of

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investigations of the toxic action mechanisms of naturally occurring acaricides are of practical importance for house dust mite control, because they may provide valuable information on the most suitable formulations to be adopted for their future commercialization

  </span>. In the present study, 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers. These results indicate that the acaricidal route of action of these compounds was largely a result of vapor action, although the exact mechanism of the oil remains unknown. The fumigant action of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">officinalis</span> oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal described, as demonstrated through the current fumigant chamber test (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>), is of practical importance, because it allows the essential oil or its main compound to reach deep refugees in blanket, pillows, carpet, and other fabric materials. This fumigant action system has advantages over the contact action system, because exposure to active constituents can be easily controlled in a closed space using suitable application methods

  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> adults 4 h after treatment. Complete mortalities and color alteration of mites were achieved using 0.5% and 1% sprays containing 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and 1% spray containing
