  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and

  </span>. Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD
  <sub>90</sub> values of each test sample were applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter paper. After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d. × 1.5 cm deep), and then 80–100 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 8–10 days old) of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">farinae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pteronyssinus</span> were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed as stated in above (contact + fumigant mortality bioassay section). A color alteration of the mites was compared with color deformation before and after treatment and conducted using a light microscope (40× and 100×) and naked eye.
