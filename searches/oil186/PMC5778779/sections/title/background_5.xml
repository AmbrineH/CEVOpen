 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils (EOs) and their constituents have potential applications for use in food products as they have been shown to have antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. The side effects associated with synthetic antimicrobial and antioxidant products urged a global search for natural products, such as natural EOs, with multiuse options. EOs are moderate to strong antioxidants and preservatives used in food processing. They are also used as antimicrobial agents in food supplement production and the pharmaceutical industry [

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “Cypress” plants belong to the family Cupressaceae and are grown in many subtropical areas for commercial purposes, such as ornamentation, and as a source of wood-building material [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Cupressus macrocarpa</span> is an evergreen tree up to 23-m tall with horizontal branches [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Leaf EO from this plant is used against rheumatism, whooping cough, and styptic problems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Several authors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] have described the EOs of 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span>. Zavarin et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] focused on monoterpenes found in oil needles, while Cool [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], focused on the sesquiterpene compounds. A larger amount of monoterpenes, as compared to sesquiterpenes or diterpenes, was detected in the EOs of the branchlets of 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. The major compounds identified in volatile oil from the cone of 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> Hartwig from Nilgiris, India were terpinel-4-ol, dinopol, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Recently Fahed et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] reported that the EOs of 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> has strong activity against specific dermal fungi.

  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus citriodora</span> (Hook.) or 
  <span class="italic">Corymbia citriodora</span> (Hook.) K.D.Hill &amp; L.A.S. Johnson is widely used in perfumery, cosmetics, and room fresheners. For example, extracts of dried leaves resulted by hot water are traditionally used for many purposes like antipyretic remedies, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic as well as for the symptoms of respiratory infections, such as cold, and flu [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOs of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> can be used as an antibacterial, antifungal, anticandidal, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal, and also have insecticidal, acaricidal, herbicidal, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Citronellal, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-citronellol, and isopulegol are monoterpenoids reported as major components in the leaf EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> growing in Chandigarh, India [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. However, 6-octenal was reported as the major constituent in the leaf oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> from Nigeria [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]; 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene, sabinene, and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-thujene were reported to be minor constituents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. 3-Hexen-1-ol, 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-geraniol, citronellol acetate, 5-hepten-1-ol, 2,6-dimethyl, and citronellal were the major components in the leaf EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> grown in Zoological Garden in Giza-Egypt [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> (lemon-scented eucalyptus) showed a wide spectrum of antifungal activity as well as activity against various pathogenic bacteria and yeasts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] resulting in that the EOs of some plants, including 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora,</span> have significant insecticidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Sitophilus zeamais</span>, however, 50% of the efficacy was lost 8 days after treatment.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the framework of our continuing research on the EO composition and biological activities of Egyptian medicinal plants, we aimed to evaluate the biological activity of the EOs of 
  <span class="italic">Corymbia citriodora</span> leaves and 
  <span class="italic">Cupressus macrocarpa</span> “Citriodora” branchlets. For the first time full analysis of essential oils from both plants collected in Egypt was done as well as full characteristic of their antibacterial, antifungal activities against set of Gram-plus, Gram-minus as fungus was done. Additionally, antioxidant potential was evaluated.
