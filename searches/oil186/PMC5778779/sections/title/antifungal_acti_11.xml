 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activities of EOs against several fungi, including 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span> (ATCC 9643), 
  <span class="italic">A. ochraceus</span> (ATCC 12066), 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> (ATCC 6275), 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> (ATCC 12066), 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium funiculosum</span> (ATCC 56755) and 
  <span class="italic">P. ochrochloron</span> (ATCC 48663) were examined. The cultures were renewed monthly and stored at 4 °C. The microdilution method [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>], was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) using a spore suspension concentration of (1.0 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> CFU/mL) dilutions in 96-well microtiter plates. EOs were diluted to the desired concentrations in microplates containing Malt medium broth mixed with inoculum. The microplates were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h on a rotary shaker.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lowest concentration that inhibits fungi growth at the binocular microscope level was defined as the MIC. The MFC was defined as the minimum concentration showing no visible growth, which is consistent with a 99.5% killing of the original inoculum. Serial sub-cultivations (2 μL) of essential oils were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h in microtiter plates containing 100 μL of broth and inoculum were used to calculate the MIC. Ketoconazole (KTZ) (1–3500 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. The experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
