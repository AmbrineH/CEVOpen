  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves and 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets were cut into small pieces (100 g) and hydro-distillated for 3 h, in a Clevenger apparatus [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. The oil was collected and the mass of fresh weight of sample was measured (3.15 and 4.70 mL/100 g fresh weight, from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span>, respectively). The oil was kept dry in sealed Eppendorf tubes and stored at 4 °C prior for chemical analysis.
