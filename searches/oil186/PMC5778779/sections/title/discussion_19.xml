 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In agreement with our results, Jang et al. [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] found that the major monoterpenoids detected in the EO of 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> were citronellal (60.6%), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-citronellol (12.5%), and isopulegol (8.1%). In addition, citronellal and

  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. However, the major component of the leaves of

  <span class="italic">β</span>-citronellal (71.7%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In contrast, 6-octenal (77.1%) was found to be a major component in the EO of

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Hussein et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] found that α-citronellal, α-citronellol, citronellol acetate, and isopulegol were the major chemical constituents from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaf EO. 1.8-cineole and

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EO from
