 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Terpinen-4-ol (23.7%), α-phellandrene (19.2%), 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellol (17.3%), and citronellal were the major constituents of EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets, and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellal (56%), 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-citronellol (14.7%), citronellol acetate (12.3%), isopulegol, and eucalyptol were the primary constituents of EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves. Antibacterial activity with MIC values of EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> leaves was ranged from 0.06 mg/mL to 0.20 mg/mL, and MBC from 0.12 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> to 0.41 mg/mL. EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> branchlets showed less activity against bacterial strains. The MIC values against tested fungi of the EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> ranged from 0.11 to 0.52 mg/mL while for EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. macrocarpa</span> from 0.29 to 3.21 mg/mL. The MIC and MFC values of EOs against 
  <span class="italic">P. funiculosum</span> were lower than those obtained from Ketoconazole (KTZ) (0.20; 0.45; 0.29 and 0.53 mg/mL, respectively, vs 0.21 and 0.41 mg/mL. Antioxidant activity of the EO from 
  <span class="italic">C. citriodora</span> was higher than that of the positive control but lower than that of the standard butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 5.1 ± 0.1 μg/mL).
