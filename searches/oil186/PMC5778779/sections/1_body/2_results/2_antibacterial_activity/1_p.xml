<p id="Par41">The MIC values of EO from 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> leaves ranged from 0.06 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> to 0.20 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and those values were lower than the MIC values of streptomycin (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Additionally, activity of this oil was comparable or even higher than reference antibiotic in case of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> or 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>. EO from 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets showed less activity against bacterial strains. The MIC values ranged from 0.07 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> to 0.31 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The MBC values of EO from 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> ranged from 0.12 mg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> to 0.41 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas, the values were between 0.15 mg/mL (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and 0.63 mg/mL (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) using EO from 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets. The EO of 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> showed noticeable activity against phytopathogenic bacteria including 
 <italic>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. carotovorum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Dickeya solani</italic>, which causes many diseases in potato production, such as the blackleg in the field and soft rot during storage. Furthermore, all MIC values reported against the potato pathogenic bacteria were lower than those reported for the negative control, streptomycin.
