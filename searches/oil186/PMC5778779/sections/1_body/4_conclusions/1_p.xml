<p id="Par50" class="p">The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets primarily comprised terpinen-4-ol, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-phellandrene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-citronellol, and citronellal, while in 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> the oil consisted primarily of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-citronellal, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-citronellol, citronellol acetate, isopulegol, and eucalyptol. Moderate activity was found against the studied bacterial strain. However, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> leaves showed more potency than the 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets did against the studied fungi. The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> showed higher activity than the positive control did. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of tested EOs was lower than that of the standard BHT used.
