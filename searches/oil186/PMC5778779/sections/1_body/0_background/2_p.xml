 <italic>Cupressus macrocarpa</italic> is an evergreen tree up to 23-m tall with horizontal branches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Leaf EO from this plant is used against rheumatism, whooping cough, and styptic problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have described the EOs of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic>. Zavarin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] focused on monoterpenes found in oil needles, while Cool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], focused on the sesquiterpene compounds. A larger amount of monoterpenes, as compared to sesquiterpenes or diterpenes, was detected in the EOs of the branchlets of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The major compounds identified in volatile oil from the cone of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> Hartwig from Nilgiris, India were terpinel-4-ol, dinopol, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recently Fahed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] reported that the EOs of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> has strong activity against specific dermal fungi.
