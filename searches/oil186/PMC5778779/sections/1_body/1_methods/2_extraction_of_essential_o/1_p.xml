 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets were cut into small pieces (100 g) and hydro-distillated for 3 h, in a Clevenger apparatus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The oil was collected and the mass of fresh weight of sample was measured (3.15 and 4.70 mL/100 g fresh weight, from
