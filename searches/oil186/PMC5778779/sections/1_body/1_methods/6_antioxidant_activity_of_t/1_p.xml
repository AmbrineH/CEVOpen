 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (absorbance at 470 nm). A blank was prepared in the same manner as the samples and the antioxidant activities of the samples were compared with the blank and standard antioxidant, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). All experiments were repeated twice in triplicates.
