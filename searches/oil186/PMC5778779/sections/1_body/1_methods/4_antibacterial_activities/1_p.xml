<p id="Par33">Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were used for analyses. The Gram-positive bacteria included 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (clinical isolate), 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19113), 
 <italic>Micrococcus flavus</italic> (ATCC 10240) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538). The Gram-negative bacteria included 
 <italic>Dickeya solani</italic> (D s0432–1), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 35210), 
 <italic>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</italic> (ATCC 33260), 
 <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>carotovorum</italic> (ATCC 15713), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (D s0432–1). The micro-dilution method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] was used to determine the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The concentration of the bacteria was adjusted to 1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL by using sterile saline, and then stored at 4 °C. The essential oils were added to 100 μL Triptic Soy broth (TSB) containing a bacteria inoculum (1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/well) in a microtiter plate, then the MICs and MBCs were determined. The microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a rotary shaker.
