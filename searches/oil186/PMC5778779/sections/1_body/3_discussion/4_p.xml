<p id="Par47">The EO from 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> showed higher antifungal activity than the positive control. These results are consistent with those of Ramezani et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], who found that the volatile oil is more potent than the synthetic fungicide Mancozeb, and that 
 <italic>C. citriodora</italic> oil strongly inhibits radial growth of 
 <italic>Macrophomina phaseolina</italic>, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum lindemuthianum</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. 
 <italic>sp. lycopersici</italic>, 
 <italic>Helminthosporium oryzae</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternaria triticina</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani,</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic> with MICs ranging between 0.25 and 0.50Â ppm. Fahed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] reported strong antifungal activities of the EOs of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> against specific fungi such as 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> and it was associated mainly with major essential oil constitutes such as sabinene and terpinen-4-ol.
