<p id="Par44">Giatropoulos et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported that sabinene (21.8%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (19.5%), terpinen-4-ol (18.9%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (7.9%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinene (5.7%) were the major components detected in the needle EO of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> grown in Athens, Greece. In India, the major compounds identified in EO of cones of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> were terpinel-4-ol (19.4%), dinopol (15.6%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (13.5%), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (12.1%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent investigation of Fahed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found similar major essential oil constitutes such as sabinene and terpinen-4-ol. The primary compounds in the volatile oils of fresh and dried leaves of 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> (gold crest) grown at the north coast of Egypt were neral (31–35%), hydroxy citronellal (12–16%), geraniol (3–4%), piperitol (
 <italic>trans</italic>) (7–8%), isobornyl isobutyrate (0.7–6.6%), linalool (0.6–5.2%), terpinyl acetate (0.10–3.2%), myrcene (0.22–2.6%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ferruginol (0.3–2.25%), abitol (0.4–2.18%), and eugenol dihydro (0.1–1.3%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Argentina, 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> oil was found to be composed of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (20.2%), sabinene (12.0%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (7.0%), and terpinen-4-ol (29.6%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> oils are rich in sabinene (27.0, 23.3%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (22.2, 19.8%), and terpinen-4-ol (11.7, 14.7%) with moderate amounts of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (5.6, 5.1%), isophyllocladene (4.4, 4.9%), myrcene (3.6, 3.2%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (2.6, 2.0%), and phyllocladene (2.3, 2.0%) [
