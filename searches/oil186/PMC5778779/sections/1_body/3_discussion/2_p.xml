<p id="Par45" class="p">In agreement with our results, Jang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] found that the major EOs constitutes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> are α-citronellal and isopulegol. Singh et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] found that the major monoterpenoids detected in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> were citronellal (60.6%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-citronellol (12.5%), and isopulegol (8.1%). In addition, citronellal and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-citronellol were the major components in the leaf EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, the major component of the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> grown at the State of Ceará, Brazil, was 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-citronellal (71.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. In contrast, 6-octenal (77.1%) was found to be a major component in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> grown in Nigeria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (38.6%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene (25.6%), sabinene (19.6%), and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujene (11.9%) were the major compounds contained in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> leaves from Paschim Vihar (New Delhi) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Neo</italic>-isopulegol, citronellal, 
 <italic class="italic">iso</italic>-isopulegol, citronellol, citronellyl acetate, and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene were the primary components in the EO of the plant from Benin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. Hussein et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>] found that α-citronellal, α-citronellol, citronellol acetate, and isopulegol were the major chemical constituents from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> leaf EO. 1.8-cineole and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene were the primary components in the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> grown in Zerniza and Souinet Arboreta (North West and North Tunisia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Interestingly, 6-octenal was not found in our study.
