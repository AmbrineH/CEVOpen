 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span> resin by GC-MS/MS gave rise to the identification of 23 constituents, especially monoterpenes (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The constituents present in great abundance in the commercial resin were limonene, eucalyptol, and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), whereas in the natural resin, the main components were limonene, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol, with a yield of 1.38% and 0.90%, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the EOPh composition with literature data, it was noticed that, generally, phellandrenes, terpinolenes, limonenes, oxidized
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-menth-3-ene-1,2,8-triol, and aromatized
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene are major constituents of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span>, whereas 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene was also found in significant amounts of fresh resin oil in most species reported in the literal data. Aged resins of this species, as well as commercial samples (mixture), usually show a lot of phenylpropanoids in their composition. Sesquiterpenes are usually detected in traces in most parts of the reported resin oils, but this ratio was described as an inverse to
  <span class="italic"> P. decandrum</span> [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical constituents of essential oil of resin analyzed by CG-MS are mainly monoterpenes. The oil's chemical composition varies with the period of the year and the region where the material is collected. Citó et al. [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>] found that the major compounds were 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-terpinyl acetate (23.2%), limonene (18.2%), and 
  <span class="italic">o</span>-cymene (11.2%), while the oil obtained in the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul, AC, north of Brazil, presented 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (39.93%), 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-tetradecane (13.38%), and dihydro-4-carene (11.69%) as principal constituents [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A great amount of oxygenated compounds in commercial resin can be attributed to prolonged exposure to free air in the central market of Teresina, PI; however, we did not notice significant differences in composition, presented in the previous researches.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, Mobin et al. [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>] evaluated the chemical composition of
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span> resins (EOPh) over different extraction times and their antifungal activity against
  <span class="italic"> Candida</span> species, obtained from gardeners with onychomycosis. Literature review by these authors also showed that the main constituents, mainly monoterpenes, vary significantly according to the extraction period and region where the material was collected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Literature review showed that the main constituents, mainly monoterpenes, have various pharmacological properties, including antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and antispasmodic properties [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>–
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Besides the activities described above, monoterpenes also produce significant effects on the cardiovascular system, promoting, among other actions, vasorelaxation, decreased heart rate, and hypotension [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. Constituents of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</span> exhibit biological activities, as
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene presents anti-inflammatory property [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>], D-limonene presents antihyperalgesic action [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>], and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol induces gastric protection [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we decided to evaluate the vasorelaxant effect of EOPh for the following reasons: its chemical composition did not change significantly in relation to previous works [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>], there is a wide distribution of this species in our region, and it is easy to access the botanical material (resin) throughout the year in the central market of the municipality of Teresina, Piauí state.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In rat mesenteric artery rings, EOPh induced a vasorelaxant response on Phe (10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>mol/L)-induced precontractions. The vasorelaxing effect of EOPh was reduced in preparations in the presence of vascular endothelium (pD
  <sub>2</sub> = 2.50 ± 0.03
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">∗</span>
  </span>, 
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">∗</span>
  </span>
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05), in relation to rings without endothelium (pD
  <sub>2</sub> = 2.30 ± 0.03) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(a)</a>). It is known that Phe-induced contractions are linked not only to Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> voltage-sensitive channels but also to receptor-operated Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> channels [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. The vasorelaxant effect of EOPh was similar to the L-type Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> channel blocker verapamil, though not with the same pharmacological potency (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2(b)</a>). Several studies have demonstrated that vasorelaxant effect of different plants is usually due to the calcium channel block and hence inhibitors of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> channels are used as antihypertensive agents, such as the ethanol extract of
  <span class="italic"> Mimosa caesalpiifolia</span> and the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> Alpinia zerumbet</span> that induce vasorelaxation by blockade of calcium channels activated voltage, CaV-L [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. The vasorelaxant effect of EOPh is most evident in preparations without endothelium; this may be due to increased activity of the chemical constituents of the oil on calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle membrane. Therefore, EOPh may have more than one active secondary metabolite leading to a variation in pharmacological response.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 23 monoterpenes identified in this species, five of them had already been studied for their effects on the cardiovascular system:
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene, eucalyptol, linalool, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene, limonene, and 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-terpineol. The main effects observed were hypotension and bradycardia
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> to
  <span class="italic"> p</span>-cymene [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>], negative inotropic effect
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> to eucalyptol [
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>], cardiovascular system stimulation and depression
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> to linalool [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>], reduction and prevention of cardiovascular injuries caused by pulmonary hypertension
  <span class="italic"> in vivo</span> to limonene [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>], and hypotension and vasorelaxation [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] and antihypertension to terpineol [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. This paper showed that essential oils may be considered promising agents for prevention or treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system.
