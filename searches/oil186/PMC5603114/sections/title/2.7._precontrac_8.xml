 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a 60 min stabilization period, a Phe (10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>M)-induced precontraction was elicited in endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rings to promote similar magnitude contractions, and EOPh was added cumulatively (3 to 750 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) after response to Phe had stabilized, approximately 30 min later. In addition, a parallel control was also run under similar experimental conditions with verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist (0.01–3
