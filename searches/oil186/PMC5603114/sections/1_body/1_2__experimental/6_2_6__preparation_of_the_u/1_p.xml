Isometric tension was recorded by a force-displacement transducer coupled to a data acquisition system (AECAD 1604, AQCAD 2.0.5; AVS Projetos, SP). When necessary, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface of the vessels with a thin stainless wire and endothelial functionality was assessed through the ability of acetylcholine (10
