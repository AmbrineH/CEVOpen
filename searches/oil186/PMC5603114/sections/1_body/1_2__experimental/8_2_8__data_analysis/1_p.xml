<p>All values were expressed as mean ± SEM. The experimental results were expressed as percentage of decrease of the maximum contraction of phenylephrine. The potential was expressed by pD
 <sub>2</sub> (anti-log of effective concentration that promotes 50% of maximum response). Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test and posttest of Bonferroni were used in the data analysis of the results which were considered significant when
