<p>After a 60 min stabilization period, a Phe (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M)-induced precontraction was elicited in endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rings to promote similar magnitude contractions, and EOPh was added cumulatively (3 to 750 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) after response to Phe had stabilized, approximately 30 min later. In addition, a parallel control was also run under similar experimental conditions with verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist (0.01–3
