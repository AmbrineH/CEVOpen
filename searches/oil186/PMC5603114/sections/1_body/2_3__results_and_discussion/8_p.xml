<p class="p">In rat mesenteric artery rings, EOPh induced a vasorelaxant response on Phe (10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol/L)-induced precontractions. The vasorelaxing effect of EOPh was reduced in preparations in the presence of vascular endothelium (pD

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 2.30 ± 0.03) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2(a)</xref>). It is known that Phe-induced contractions are linked not only to Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> voltage-sensitive channels but also to receptor-operated Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> channels [

 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> channel blocker verapamil, though not with the same pharmacological potency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2(b)</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that vasorelaxant effect of different plants is usually due to the calcium channel block and hence inhibitors of Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> channels are used as antihypertensive agents, such as the ethanol extract of
 <italic class="italic"> Mimosa caesalpiifolia</italic> and the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Alpinia zerumbet</italic> that induce vasorelaxation by blockade of calcium channels activated voltage, CaV-L [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The vasorelaxant effect of EOPh is most evident in preparations without endothelium; this may be due to increased activity of the chemical constituents of the oil on calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle membrane. Therefore, EOPh may have more than one active secondary metabolite leading to a variation in pharmacological response.
