 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] evaluated the chemical composition of
 <italic class="italic"> P. heptaphyllum</italic> resins (EOPh) over different extraction times and their antifungal activity against
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> species, obtained from gardeners with onychomycosis. Literature review by these authors also showed that the main constituents, mainly monoterpenes, vary significantly according to the extraction period and region where the material was collected.
