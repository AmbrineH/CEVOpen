<p>Recently, Mobin et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated the chemical composition of
 <italic> P. heptaphyllum</italic> resins (EOPh) over different extraction times and their antifungal activity against
 <italic> Candida</italic> species, obtained from gardeners with onychomycosis. Literature review by these authors also showed that the main constituents, mainly monoterpenes, vary significantly according to the extraction period and region where the material was collected.
