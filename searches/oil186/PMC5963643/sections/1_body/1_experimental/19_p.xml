<p>The cells were seeded into 96-well microplates (1×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells well
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of the essential oil and linalool (5-500 μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cytotoxicity of the essential oil and linalool was assayed by CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay. The assay is based on the ability of living cells to convert a redox dye (resazurin) into a fluorescent end product (resofurin). Nonviable cells rapidly lose metabolic capacity and thus do not generate a fluorescent signal (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Following cellular reduction, fluorescence is recorded at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emissions. The data were expressed as average values obtained from eight wells for each concentration. The IC
 <sub>50 </sub>value was calculated from equation of graph. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cytotoxicity on cancer cells was measured in the same way. For measuring antioxidant effect of the essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cytotoxicity, different concentrations of the cells were preincubated (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>20</sub> and IC
 <sub>30</sub>) for 1 h, before H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2 </sub>treatment (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>70</sub>) for 24 hour. Essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool were dissolved in 0.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).
