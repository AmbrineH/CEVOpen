A stock solution of -carotene–linoleic acid mixture was prepared as following: 0.5 mg -carotene was dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform (HPLC grade), 25 μL linoleic acid and 200 mg Tween 40 was added. Chloroform was completely evaporated using a vacuum evaporator. Then 100 mL distilled water saturated with oxygen (30 min, 100 mL/min) was added with a vigorous shaking.
