<p class="p">The composition of the volatile constituents was established by GC-MS/quadruple detector analyses using a Shimadzu QP 5050 system, equipped with a chemically bonded fused silica column Cp WAX 52 CB (50 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, 1.2 m film thickness). GC analysis was employed under the following conditions: Injector temperature was 240°C. Detector temperature was 250 °C. The temperature program for the Cp WAX 52 CB column was from 60 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and than held at 220 °C for 20 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow 10 psi and injection volume of each sample was 1 mL, split ratio (1:20). The MS conditions were: ionization energy, 70 eV; mass range, 40–400 amu; scan mode, EI. The percentage composition was computed from the GC peak areas according to the 100% method without using any correction factors. The identification of the components was based on the comparison between their mass spectra and those of Wiley and Nist, Tutore Libraries. </p>
