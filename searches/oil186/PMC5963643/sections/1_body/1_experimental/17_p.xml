<p>The hepatoma G2 cells (Hep G2) line (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) was used in this study. Cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For subculturing, cells were harvested after trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment at 37°C. Cells were used when monolayer confluence had reached 75%.
