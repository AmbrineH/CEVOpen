<p>Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined after Hep G2 cells were exposed to different concentration of essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool for 24 h (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>70</sub>). For measuring membrane protective effects of the essential oil and linalool against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, the cells were preincubated with different concentrations (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>20</sub> and IC
 <sub>30</sub>) of essential oil and linalool (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>20</sub> and IC
 <sub>30</sub>) for 1 h, before H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment (IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>70</sub>) for 24 h. Essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool were dissolved in 0.5% (v/v) DMSO.
