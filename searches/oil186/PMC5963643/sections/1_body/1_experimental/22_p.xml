<p>Hep G2 cells were plated at a density 15×10
 <sup>4</sup> cell/100 mm dishes. The cells were scraped off culture plates with culture medium and were centrifuged 600×g for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed with PBS and then sonicated (3×15 sec) in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM PMSF and 1 μg/mL of leupeptin and centrifuged at 150,000×g for 45 min. The supernatant was used for the determination of malondialdehyde level.
