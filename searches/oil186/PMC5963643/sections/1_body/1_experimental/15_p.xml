<p class="p">This reaction mixture (2500 μL) was dispersed to test tubes and 350 μL portions of the essential oil prepared at 2 g/L concentrations added and also the emulsion system was incubated up to 24 h at room temperature. The same procedure was repeated with synthetic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ascorbic acid and -tocopherol as positive controls, and a blank. After this incubation period, the absorbance of the mixtures was measured at 490 nm. Antioxidative capacity of the essential oil was compared with those BHT, ascorbic acid, -tocopherol and blank. Tests were carried out in triplicate.</p>
