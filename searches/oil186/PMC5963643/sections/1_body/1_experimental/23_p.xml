<p class="p">Malondialdehyde levels in Hep G2 cells were assayed as described in the previous method (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). This fluorometric method for measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in supernatant is based on the reaction between malondialdehyde and thiobarbituric acid. The product of this reaction was extracted into butanol and measured at 525 nm (excitation) and 547 nm (emission) spectrofluorometrically.
