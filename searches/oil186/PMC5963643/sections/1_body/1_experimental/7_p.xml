<p class="p">The components were identified based on the comparison between their relative retention time as wells as mass spectra and those of standards and literature data (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). The results were also confirmed by the comparison between the compounds elution order and their relative retention indices on non-polar phases reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Theresults were reported as mean values.
