<p>Where A
 <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test compound), and A
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test compound. Essential oil and positive controls concentrations providing 50% inhibition (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated form the graphs. For the calculation of these values, Microsoft Excel software was used. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
