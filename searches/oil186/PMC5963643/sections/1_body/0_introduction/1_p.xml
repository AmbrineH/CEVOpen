<p>In all aerobic organisms, including human beings, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is balanced by antioxidant defense system. A serious imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant defense system is responsible for oxidative stress. Thus, ROS plays an important role in the etiology of many diseases and aging. Antioxidant defense system which prevents oxidative damages of ROS consist of flavanoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes (
