<p>The potential of the essential oil to inhibit lipid peroxidation was evaluated using the -carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test. The essential oil showed 40% inhibition. The essential oil’s linoleic acid oxidation inhibition capacity was found 2.37, 2.3 and 2.41 times lower than BHT, ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol respectively (

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> was more effective than 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> in linoleic acid oxidation (

 <italic>O. majorana</italic> was equal to 
 <italic>O. onites</italic> capacity (

 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated as 16.4 μg/mL in DPPH radical assay and linalool showed antioxidant activity in the -carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test (
