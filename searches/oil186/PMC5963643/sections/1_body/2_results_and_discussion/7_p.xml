<p class="p">The potential of the essential oil to inhibit lipid peroxidation was evaluated using the -carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test. The essential oil showed 40% inhibition. The essential oil’s linoleic acid oxidation inhibition capacity was found 2.37, 2.3 and 2.41 times lower than BHT, ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol respectively (
