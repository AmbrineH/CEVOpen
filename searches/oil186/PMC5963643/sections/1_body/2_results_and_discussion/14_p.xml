<p class="p">Synergistic functions of the various molecules contained in an essential oil, in comparison to the action of one or two main components of the oil, seems questionable. However, it is possible that the activity of the main components is modulated by other minor molecules (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that several components of the essential oil play a role in defining the fragrance, density, texture, colour and above all, cell penetration (

The last feature is very important because the distribution of the oil in the cell determines the different types of radical reactions produced, depending on their compartmentation in the cell.
