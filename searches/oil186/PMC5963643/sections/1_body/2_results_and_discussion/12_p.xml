<p>The effects of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oil and linalool on Hep G2 cells as assessed by CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay with different concentrations (5-500 μg/mL) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Dose and time dependent inhibition by the essential oil and linalool were observed with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 100, 80 and 63 μg/mL for essential oil and 81.5, 72.7 and 64.7 μg/mL at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The IC
 <sub>10</sub>, IC
 <sub>50 </sub>and IC
 <sub>70</sub> values of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> incubations were 79, 387 and 541 μM respectively. DMSO (0.5%, v/v) did not affect the cell growth when treated for the same time periods. Linalool had more effective cytotoxic activity than essential oil on Hep G2 cells for 24 and 48 h incubations while essential oil had more effective cytotoxic activity than linalool for 72 h incubation. Those results showed that incubation time affected the essential oil’s and linalool’s cytotoxic effects on Hep G2 cells.
