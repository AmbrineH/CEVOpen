Linalool had more effective cytotoxic activity than essential oil on Hep G2 cells for 24 and 48 h incubations while essential oil had more effective cytotoxic activity than linalool for 72 h incubation. Those results showed that incubation time affected the essential oil’s and linalool’s cytotoxic effects on Hep G2 cells.
