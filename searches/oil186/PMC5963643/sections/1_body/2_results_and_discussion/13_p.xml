 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oil and linalool induced membrane damage on Hep G2 cells are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Membrane-damaging effects of the essential oil and linalool increased with accelerating concentrations. Linalool membrane-damaging effect was found stronger than essential oil membrane-damaging effect. In one of our previous study linalool had more effective membrane damaging effect than 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oil on epirubicin-resistant H1299 cells but on parental cells, the essential oil had more effective membrane damaging effect than linalool (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Biochemical changes like membrane structure in drug resistant cells will affect the essential oil’s and linalool’s cytotoxicity. Differences between the essential oil’s and linalool’s chemical structures (as a result of they will produce different ROS and amounts) will be the reason for having different cytotoxic effects on Hep G2 cells of the essential oil and linalool.
