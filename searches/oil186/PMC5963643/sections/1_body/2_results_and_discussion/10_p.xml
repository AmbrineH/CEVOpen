<p>The essential oil and linalool significantly decreased membrane-damaging on H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2 </sub>treated Hep G2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The membrane-protective effect of linalool was found higher than essential oil. Preincubation with the IC
 <sub>10</sub> and IC
 <sub>20 </sub>essential oil concentrations did not change the MDA amounts statistically according to incubation with IC
 <sub>70</sub> H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The similar results indicated that the essential oil from 
 <italic>O. onites, </italic>carvacrol and, thymol showed membrane protective (antioxidant) effects at lower than IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations on Hep G2 cells (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the future
 <italic> O. majorana </italic>and linaloolâ€™s protective effects against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2 </sub>will be good sources for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment which need more studies about understanding of the mechanism of the protective effects of essential oil and linalool against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on Hep G2.
