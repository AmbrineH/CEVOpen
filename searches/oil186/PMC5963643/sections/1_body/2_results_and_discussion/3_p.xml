<p class="p">As far as we know, there are many researchers on the investigation of chemical composition of the oils isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). It was postulated that the oil exists in two forms. One with terpinen-4-ol and sabinene hydrate as major components (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>) as predominant compounds. The marjoram essential oil has shown that the volatile aroma composition varies according to geographic differences and by the climatic features such as temperature (
