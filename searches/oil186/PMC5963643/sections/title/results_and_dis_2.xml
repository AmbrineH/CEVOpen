 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC/MS analysis of the plant essential oil led to the identification and quantification of 5 components, which accounted for 99.9% of the total oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The major components of the oil were carvacrol (52.5%) and linalool (45.4%). The essential oil consisted mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (98.2%), whereas monoterpene hydrocarbons were weakly represented 
  <span class="bold">(</span>1.7%). A portion (0.1%) of the total composition was not identified. Terpinen-4-ol was found as a main component in
  <span class="italic"> Origanum majorana</span> essential oil which was from Kalocsa, Hungary. Linalool was also found as a component (12.1%) but carvacrol was not found (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As far as we know, there are many researchers on the investigation of chemical composition of the oils isolated from

  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>, 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>). It was postulated that the oil exists in two forms. One with terpinen-4-ol and sabinene hydrate as major components (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential of the essential oil to inhibit lipid peroxidation was evaluated using the -carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test.

  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> essential oil and linalool induced membrane damage on Hep G2 cells are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>. Membrane-damaging effects of the essential oil and linalool increased with accelerating concentrations. Linalool membrane-damaging effect was found stronger than essential oil membrane-damaging effect. In one of our previous study linalool had more effective membrane damaging effect than 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> essential oil on epirubicin-resistant H1299 cells but on parental cells, the essential oil had more effective membrane damaging effect than linalool (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>). Biochemical changes like membrane structure in drug resistant cells will affect the essential oil’s and linalool’s cytotoxicity. Differences between the essential oil’s and linalool’s chemical structures (as a result of they will produce different ROS and amounts) will be the reason for having different cytotoxic effects on Hep G2 cells of the essential oil and linalool.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Synergistic functions of the various molecules contained in an essential oil, in comparison to the action of one or two main components of the oil, seems questionable. However, it is possible that the activity of the main components is modulated by other minor molecules (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>-
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>). Moreover, it is likely that several components of the essential oil play a role in defining the fragrance, density, texture, colour and above all, cell penetration (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>), lipophilic or hydrophilic attraction as well as fixation on cell walls membranes, and cellular distribution. The last feature is very important because the distribution of the oil in the cell determines the different types of radical reactions produced, depending on their compartmentation in the cell.

  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool showed antioxidant and cytotoxic activity depending on concentrations and time manner. Those results indicate that concentrations are important in their usage.
