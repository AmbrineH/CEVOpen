 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all aerobic organisms, including human beings, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is balanced by antioxidant defense system. A serious imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant defense system is responsible for oxidative stress. Thus, ROS plays an important role in the etiology of many diseases and aging. Antioxidant defense system which prevents oxidative damages of ROS consist of flavanoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes (

  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>). Recently, there has been increasing interest in finding plants with high antioxidant capacities since they can protect human body from free radicals and retard the progression of many chronic diseases (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various medicinal properties have been ascribed to natural herbs. Medicinal plants constitute the main source of new pharmaceuticals and healthcare products. Plant products are also known to possess potential for food preservation.</p>

  <span class="italic">Origanum majorana </span>L. syn. 
  <span class="italic">Majorana hortensis</span> Moench], a member of the Lamiaceae family, is of great economic and industrial importance (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>). Lamiaceae consists of more than 150 species occurring mainly in the Mediterranean area and are used as herbal teas for their (folk) medicinal properties. 
  <span class="italic">Origanum </span>is represented in Turkey by 22 species or 32 taxa, 21 being endemic to Turkey. Out of 52 known taxa of 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span>, 60% are recorded to grow in Turkey (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>). Lamiaceae plants were widely studied as natural antioxidant sources because of their high contents of polyphenols (

  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> is one of the most important aromatic plants that contain major antioxidants such as flavonoids and triterpenoids (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>). Phenolic acids and flavonoids have been reported to play a role in the prevention of human pathologies (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>). Food and Drug Administration regard 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana </span>to be generally safe.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genus 
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> is used as anti-diabetic, carminative, tonic, digestive, stimulant, expectorant, menstrual regulator, diuretic, and for respiratory problems such as asthma. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts from marjoram played a role in preventing carcinogenesis and oncogenic mutations (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>). These extracts caused alterations in methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity which is highly expressed in human cancers. 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span>’s crude drug extracts exerted a low cytotoxicity on five human liver-cancer cell lines studied with an average of 39.1% (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>). Commercial 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> oil is used as a spice and condiment. The oil is used in perfumery for its spicy herbaceous notes (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>) and as fungicides or insecticides in pharmaceutical and industrial products (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linalool is monoterpene compound reported to be major volatile components of the essential oils of several aromatic species. Linalool (3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol) is one of the commonly used chemicals in cosmetic products and the fragrance and perfume industry. Safety evaluation studies revealed that linalool is not irritating, phototoxic or sensitizing but has a low order of acute toxicity (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepatoma G2 cells (Hep G2) are considered a good model to study 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity to the liver, since they retain many of the specialized functions which characterize normal human hepatocytes (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>). Also, Hepatoma G2 cells are a valuable model to study hepatocellular carcinoma and the liver, where drugs are metabolized (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another experiment, we studied phenolic terpenoid carvacrol’s (main component of 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana </span>essential oil) cytotoxicity, cytoprotective and membrane protective effects on Hep G2 cells (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>). Therefore, we used linalool (second main component of 
  <span class="italic">O. majorana</span> essential oil) for this experiment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of our work was to compare cytotoxic and membrane-damaging effects of
  <span class="italic"> O. majorana</span> essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep G2 and to investigate their possible protective (antioxidant) effects against H
