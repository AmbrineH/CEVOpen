  <span class="italic">O. majorana </span>was collected from Mahmutseydi Village, Alanya (730 m) in Turkey (Voucher no: TR 102 AL). The taxonomic identification of plant materials were confirmed by a plant taxonomist, Prof. Dr.

  <span class="italic">Isolation of the essential oil</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The air-dried aerial parts of plants (100 g) were powdered and subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h using the Clevenger-type apparatus (ILDAM Ltd., Ankara, Turkey) at Molecular Biology Department in Biology in Akdeniz University. The obtained essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and after filtration, stored at +4°C until tested and analysed. Linalool (purity 97%) was purchased from Aldrich.</p>

  <span class="italic">Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS)</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the volatile constituents was established by GC-MS/quadruple detector analyses using a Shimadzu QP 5050 system, equipped with a chemically bonded fused silica column Cp WAX 52 CB (50 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, 1.2 m film thickness). GC analysis was employed under the following conditions: Injector temperature was 240°C. Detector temperature was 250 °C. The temperature program for the Cp WAX 52 CB column was from 60 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and than held at 220 °C for 20 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow 10 psi and injection volume of each sample was 1 mL, split ratio (1:20). The MS conditions were: ionization energy, 70 eV; mass range, 40–400 amu; scan mode, EI. The percentage composition was computed from the GC peak areas according to the 100% method without using any correction factors. The identification of the components was based on the comparison between their mass spectra and those of Wiley and Nist, Tutore Libraries. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The components were identified based on the comparison between their relative retention time as wells as mass spectra and those of standards and literature data (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>). The results were also confirmed by the comparison between the compounds elution order and their relative retention indices on non-polar phases reported in the literature (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Theresults were reported as mean values.

  <span class="italic">DPPH assay</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydrogen atoms or electrons donation ability of the corresponding oils and some pure compounds were measured from the bleaching of purple coloured methanol solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). This spectrophotometric assay uses stable radical DPPH as a reagent (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). Various concentrations (50 µL) of the essential oil in methanol were added to 5 mL of a 0.004% (w/v) methanol solution of DPPH. After a 30 min incubation period at room temperature the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm. Inhibition free radical DPPH in percent (I%) was calculated in following way: 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I % = (A 
  <sub>control</sub> - A
  <sub> sample</sub>/A
  <sub>control</sub>) x100
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where A
  <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test compound), and A
  <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test compound. Essential oil and positive controls concentrations providing 50% inhibition (EC
  <sub>50</sub>) were calculated form the graphs. For the calculation of these values, Microsoft Excel software was used. Tests were carried out in triplicate.

  <span class="italic">-carotene–linoleic acid assay</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this assay antioxidant capacity is determined by measuring the inhibition of the volatile organic compounds and the conjugated diene hydroperoxides arising from linoleic acid oxidation (
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>). A stock solution of -carotene–linoleic acid mixture was prepared as following: 0.5 mg -carotene was dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform (HPLC grade), 25 μL linoleic acid and 200 mg Tween 40 was added. Chloroform was completely evaporated using a vacuum evaporator. Then 100 mL distilled water saturated with oxygen (30 min, 100 mL/min) was added with a vigorous shaking.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This reaction mixture (2500 μL) was dispersed to test tubes and 350 μL portions of the essential oil prepared at 2 g/L concentrations added and also the emulsion system was incubated up to 24 h at room temperature. The same procedure was repeated with synthetic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ascorbic acid and -tocopherol as positive controls, and a blank. After this incubation period, the absorbance of the mixtures was measured at 490 nm. Antioxidative capacity of the essential oil was compared with those BHT, ascorbic acid, -tocopherol and blank. Tests were carried out in triplicate.</p>

  <span class="italic">Cell lines and cell culture</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hepatoma G2 cells (Hep G2) line (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) was used in this study. Cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For subculturing, cells were harvested after trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment at 37°C. Cells were used when monolayer confluence had reached 75%.

  <span class="italic">Cytotoxicity assay</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cells were seeded into 96-well microplates (1×10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cells well
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of the essential oil and linalool (5-500 μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cytotoxicity of the essential oil and linalool was assayed by CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay. The assay is based on the ability of living cells to convert a redox dye (resazurin) into a fluorescent end product (resofurin). Nonviable cells rapidly lose metabolic capacity and thus do not generate a fluorescent signal (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>). Following cellular reduction, fluorescence is recorded at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emissions. The data were expressed as average values obtained from eight wells for each concentration. The IC
  <sub>50 </sub>value was calculated from equation of graph. H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> cytotoxicity on cancer cells was measured in the same way. For measuring antioxidant effect of the essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool against H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> cytotoxicity, different concentrations of the cells were preincubated (IC
  <sub>10</sub>, IC
  <sub>20</sub> and IC
  <sub>30</sub>) for 1 h, before H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2 </sub>treatment (IC
  <sub>10</sub>, IC
  <sub>50</sub> and IC

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined after Hep G2 cells were exposed to different concentration of essential oil and its oxygenated monoterpene component linalool for 24 h (IC

  <sub>70</sub>). For measuring membrane protective effects of the essential oil and linalool against H

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hep G2 cells were plated at a density 15×10
  <span class="sup">4</span> cell/100 mm dishes. The cells were scraped off culture plates with culture medium and were centrifuged 600×g for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed with PBS and then sonicated (3×15 sec) in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM PMSF and 1 μg/mL of leupeptin and centrifuged at 150,000×g for 45 min. The supernatant was used for the determination of malondialdehyde level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malondialdehyde levels in Hep G2 cells were assayed as described in the previous method (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>). This fluorometric method for measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in supernatant is based on the reaction between malondialdehyde and thiobarbituric acid. The product of this reaction was extracted into butanol and measured at 525 nm (excitation) and 547 nm (emission) spectrofluorometrically.
