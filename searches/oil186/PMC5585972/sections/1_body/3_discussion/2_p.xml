<p id="Par21" class="p">The mortality caused by clove essential oils was highly dosage-dependent with a higher mortality seen with the use of higher dosages. This trend was similar to another study conducted using the essential oils from

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. In spite of being dosage-dependent, the mortality of the wild collected larvae was lower than that of laboratory-reared larvae. This may be explained by the fact that wild larvae have already been exposed to different insecticides and other environmental contaminants including heavy metals, which have caused them to be tolerant to different insecticides, unlike to the laboratory colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. The mortality caused by the cinnamon essential oils had a similar trend as clove essential oils but higher mortalities, both in the laboratory and in the wild collected larvae, was observed with cinnamon essential oils.
