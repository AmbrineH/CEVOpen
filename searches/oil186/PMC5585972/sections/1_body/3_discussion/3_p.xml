<p id="Par22">The mortality of larvae caused by the two blends of cinnamon and clove in both the laboratory-reared and the wild larvae had a similar trend, with the blend having a higher proportion of cinnamon causing a higher mortality than the one with a higher proportion of clove. The high mortality with the increased proportion of cinnamon is explained by the presence of β-linalool in this essential oil. The mortality among susceptible laboratory larvae was higher than among wild-collected larvae due to the reported resistance gene dominance in wild populations [

This indicates that, if this active ingredient of cinnamon is appropriately synthesized and utilized for control purposes, it might have a great value in the existing vector control measures against insecticide tolerant vectors. In general, in agreement with the references quoted above, the effect of β-linalool component in cinnamon essential oil is definitely strongly associated with the mortality caused by this essential oil, either in the laboratory-reared or among the wild -collected larvae.
