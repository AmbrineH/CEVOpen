<p id="Par19" class="p">A total of 2400 larvae were used for testing in different concentrations. For the laboratory-based susceptible colony, 1200 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.s</italic>.) larvae were used, where 240 larvae in each of the five different concentrations were used. The similar wild population of 
 <italic class="italic">An.arabiensis</italic> larvae collected from wild was tested in the same scenario as the laboratory-based population of 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.s</italic>.). The larvicidal activity of essential oils of cloves and cinnamon against laboratory and wild collected larvae were found to be dosage-dependent with a higher mortality observed for cinnamon essential oils (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The difference in mortality between cinnamon and clove essential oils were statistically significant in each concentration for wild-collected and laboratory colonies except for the concentration of 800 μg/ml (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The lethal dose to kill 50% and 95% of larvae population increased with the time of exposure for both laboratory-reared and wild population larvae (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The larvicidal activity of essential oil blends (of cloves and cinnamon
 <italic class="italic">)</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles gambiae </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.s</italic>.) appeared to be higher in blends with higher proportions of cinnamon than clove essential oils (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The chemical ingredients and composition of clove and cinnamon essential oils were found to be varying. The main active ingredient of cinnamon essential oils were Eugenol (96.5%) and β-Linalool (3.5%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) while the main active ingredient of clove essential oils were eugenol (99.14%), phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-,acetate (0.45%), phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)- (0.17%), methyl salicylate (0.13) and bicyclo [7.2.0]undec-4-ene, 4,11,11-trimethyl-8-methylene-,[1R-(1R*,4Z, 9S*)]- (0.12%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).
