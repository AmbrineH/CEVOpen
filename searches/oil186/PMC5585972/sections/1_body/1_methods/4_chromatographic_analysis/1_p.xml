<p id="Par18" class="p">The identification of the essential oil components was carried out by high-resolution gas chromatography analysis, in the analytical laboratory, at Tropical Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI)-Arusha. The injection volume was 2 μl composed of 1.6 μl of a solution of essential oil (40 μg/ml) and 0.4 μl of a solution of hydrocarbon series of C

Helium was the carrier gas, and the column temperature program was increased by 3 °C per minute between 60 and 240 °C. The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV at a scan rate of 0.84 scans/s and at the range m/z 40–500. The retention times of sample components and a mixture of n-alkanes from C
