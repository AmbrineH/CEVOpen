<p id="Par7">Apart from essential oils, extracts prepared from Tanzanian plants have been evaluated for their larvicidal activity. For instance, extracts from 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic>, 
 <italic>Annona senegalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Annona squamosa</italic> were active against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, which demonstrated that extracts of 
 <italic>Annona</italic> species grown in Tanzania could be potential anti-mosquito agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In spite of the anti-mosquito activities of several studied species of plants, relatively little work has been done on the larvicidal activities of essential oils extracted from spices, such as clove and cinnamon. A recent study carried out in Nigeria assessed the activity of clove essential oils against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and achieved over 85% larval mortality within 24-hourspost-exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Meanwhile,Â in Thailand, lemongrass and clove essential oils were effective in causing mortality for all larval stages of 
 <italic>An. dirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
