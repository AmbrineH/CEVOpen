  <span class="italic">An. gambiae </span> (
  <span class="italic">s.l</span>.) were collected from Magu district in Mwanza Region, North-Western Tanzania. Larvae were sampled from irrigated rice fields using a standard dipper (350 ml) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] and transported to the insectary. Larvae were reared on yeast powder as a food source in the mosquito insectary unit at the Mwanza Research Centre, National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Tanzania. Colonies were maintained at 27 ± 2 °C, with a 12 h light: 12-h dark cycle.
