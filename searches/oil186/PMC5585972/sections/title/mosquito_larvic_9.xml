 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Larvicidal tests were carried out based on the WHO standardized procedures and guidelines for larvicidal test method [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. The initial screening was conducted using the selected plant extracts with different dosages ranging from 2 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml. The dosages causing mortality above 10% were selected for trial and ranged from 5 mg/ml to 80 mg/ml. Stock solutions of essential oils were prepared in acetone at an initial concentration of 160 mg in 2 ml (80 mg/ml). Then, two-fold dilutions were prepared in1ml acetone in each of the test cups to get a total of five different concentrations ranging from 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 mg/ml of the essential oils.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty third-instar larvae were placed in plastic cups containing distilled water for 1 h to reduce the stress. Thereafter 0.2 ml of each of the stock solution was added to their respective cups to make test solutions at concentrations ranging from 800, 400, 200, 100 and 50 μg/ml in their respective plastic cups containing the 20 test larvae each, which were used for the larvicidal tests. A negative control containing 19.8 ml of distilled water and 0.2 ml acetone with twenty third-instar mosquito larvae was also prepared. Each test comprised of four replicates of five concentrations (800, 400, 200, 100 and 50 μg/ml). Each sample of the essential oil was tested three times on different days in the four replicates. Acetone was used to solubilize the essential oil in the water. During the testing time, after 24 h of monitoring mosquito larvae, they were provided with yeast powder and monitored for 72 h.</p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions 25–28 °C and a photoperiod of 12 h light followed by 12 h dark (12 L: 12D) against laboratory-reared third instar larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles gambiae </span>(
  <span class="italic">s.s</span>.) and wild population of 
  <span class="italic">An. arabiensis.</span> Mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure, then larval food (yeast powder for 
  <span class="italic">An. gambiae</span>) was added for those alive after 24 h, next mortality was recorded after 48 h and 72 h.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Larvae were considered dead when they were moribund or failed to do any movement. The dead larvae were counted, and the average percentage mortality was calculated. Data were adjusted for control mortality using Abbott’s formula when mortality in the control sets between 5% and 20% [
