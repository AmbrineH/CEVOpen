 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These essential oils of clove and cinnamon have shown to have a larvicidal effect which is concentration-dependent for both the laboratory-reared and the wild collected larvae. The proportion of the active ingredients in the cinnamon and clove essential oils blends have different mortality rateS among the laboratory-reared and the wild collected larvae. The extracted compounds can be useful if observed efficacy can be extended to small-scale trials with more synthetic compounds of similar structures.</p>
