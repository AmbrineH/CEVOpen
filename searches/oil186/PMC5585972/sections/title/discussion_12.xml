 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we showed the pronounced larvicidal activity of the investigated essential oils against wild larvae of 
  <span class="italic">An.arabiensis</span> and laboratory-reared larvae of 
  <span class="italic">An. gambiae </span>(
  <span class="italic">s.s.</span>) despite their different chemical components. Clove and cinnamon essential oils under investigation were found to have one common main active ingredient, Eugenol (4-alil-2-methoxyphenol). A similar chemical composition has been described for these essential oils with different extraction techniques [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The mortality caused by cinnamon was found to be higher than that caused by the clove essential oils, which might be attributed to the presence of β-linalool, found in cinnamon essential oils although in a small proportion. In a previous study, 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum suave</span> essential oils extracts containing Eugenol as the highest occurring active ingredient had the lowest mortality in grain pests when tested in the absence of β-linalool than with β-linalool [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In previous reports, Eugenol mostly showed a high adult repellency effect rather than inducing larval mortality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mortality caused by clove essential oils was highly dosage-dependent with a higher mortality seen with the use of higher dosages. This trend was similar to another study conducted using the essential oils from 
  <span class="italic">Terebinthifolia radii</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. In spite of being dosage-dependent, the mortality of the wild collected larvae was lower than that of laboratory-reared larvae. This may be explained by the fact that wild larvae have already been exposed to different insecticides and other environmental contaminants including heavy metals, which have caused them to be tolerant to different insecticides, unlike to the laboratory colonies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The mortality caused by the cinnamon essential oils had a similar trend as clove essential oils but higher mortalities, both in the laboratory and in the wild collected larvae, was observed with cinnamon essential oils.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mortality of larvae caused by the two blends of cinnamon and clove in both the laboratory-reared and the wild larvae had a similar trend, with the blend having a higher proportion of cinnamon causing a higher mortality than the one with a higher proportion of clove. The high mortality with the increased proportion of cinnamon is explained by the presence of β-linalool in this essential oil. The mortality among susceptible laboratory larvae was higher than among wild-collected larvae due to the reported resistance gene dominance in wild populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. This indicates that, if this active ingredient of cinnamon is appropriately synthesized and utilized for control purposes, it might have a great value in the existing vector control measures against insecticide tolerant vectors. In general, in agreement with the references quoted above, the effect of β-linalool component in cinnamon essential oil is definitely strongly associated with the mortality caused by this essential oil, either in the laboratory-reared or among the wild -collected larvae.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of the great efficacy showed on mosquito larval mortality in different concentrations of tested plant-basedextracts, the main challenges remain the stability of the compounds in the natural environment. If collaboration with industries and chemists could be brought together, more stable compounds could be synthesized, such as to avoid the effect of sunlight, which causes degradation and form secondary metabolites which might be non-toxic and add no value in the fighting against malaria vectors.</p>
