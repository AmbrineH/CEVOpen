 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three test groups were run concurrently for each binary combination tested: the binary mixture and each of the pure compounds. The compounds were combined in a 1:1 ratio (doses LC
  <sub>25</sub>/LC
  <sub>25</sub>). The application method and experimental conditions were identical to the methods described previously in 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-insects-09-00025" href="#sec2dot4-insects-09-00025">Section 2.4</a>. Four replications of 25 larvae were tested per dose.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actual mortalities were compared to expected mortalities based on the formula:
