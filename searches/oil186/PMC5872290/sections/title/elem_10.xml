  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of in vitro assays demonstrated the larvicidal activity of essential oils against 
   <span class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</span> (Diptera: 
   <span class="italic">Culicidae</span>), since all oils tested were able to eliminated 100% of larvae at 75 µg/mL. The essential oils of Mexican oregano and anise display the highest larvicidal activity with LC
   <sub>50</sub> of 6.21 and 4.62 µg/mL, respectively. Pupae are more resistant than larvae, since more than 100 µg/mL of essential oil were needed to reach LC
   <sub>50</sub>; the same effect has been reported before [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As observed, 
   <span class="italic">t-</span>Anethole, which is the main compound of anise essential oil, proved to be efficient against larvae as well as pupae, with LC

   <sub>50</sub> of 23.4 µg/mL against larvae and 100.5 µg/mL against pupae. Eugenol and eucalyptol show larvicidal activity with a LC
   <sub>50</sub> of 23.04 and 24.83 µg/mL, respectively. None of the aforementioned compounds had significant activity against pupae. Percentage of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oviposition deterrent activity was evaluated for the essential oils of anise, oregano and lemon, as well as its constituents, since these three essential oils were the ones with more relevant lethal potential against 
   <span class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</span>. As shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t005" href="#insects-09-00025-t005">Table 5</a>, an almost 100% deterrence of female oviposition was observed for all essential oils tested in concentrations of 0.02% and 0.01%. Noteworthy differences were seen only with a concentration of 0.005%, where anise essential oil was again most efficient (repellency about 68%). Results demonstrate the high potential of these compounds to control mosquitoes; therefore, these essential oils can be considered as promising agents for the development of botanical larvicides.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. Effect of Dose and Time on Larvicidal Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To demonstrate the effect of essential oils and their constituents on short-term exposures, dose–response kinetics was undertaken. In the present study, cases of instantaneous death were observed within 20 min of exposure. The essential oil of anise can eliminate 100% of larvae in 120 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL, while LC
   <sub>50</sub> is 5 µg/mL; on the other hand, 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-anethole, which is the major component of anise essential oil, does not remove 100% of the larvae even at concentrations higher than its LC
   <sub>50</sub> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00025-f002" href="#insects-09-00025-f002">Figure 2</a>). Similarly, the Mexican oregano essential oil can eliminate 100% of the larvae in 20 min at a concentration of 15 µg/mL. Similar results were obtained with carvacrol, one of its major components; however, thymol, another essential oil constituent, only eliminates 36% of larvae in 120 min (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between the activities of the essential oils and the pure constituents, as well as the results of lethality kinetics, were the basis for the determination of synergistic/antagonistic effects among the compounds tested. If synergistic effects are found, the combination of the compounds involved can provide effective biological activity at lower concentrations [
