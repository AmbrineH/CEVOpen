<p>As observed, 
 <italic>t-</italic>Anethole, which is the main compound of anise essential oil, proved to be efficient against larvae as well as pupae, with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.4 and 28.6 µg/mL, respectively. Carvacrol also showed efficient activity against larvae and pupae, while thymol showed lower activity, with an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.4 µg/mL against larvae and 100.5 µg/mL against pupae. Eugenol and eucalyptol show larvicidal activity with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.04 and 24.83 µg/mL, respectively. None of the aforementioned compounds had significant activity against pupae. Percentage of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae mortality upon exposure to water contaminated by LC
 <sub>50</sub> doses is shown in
