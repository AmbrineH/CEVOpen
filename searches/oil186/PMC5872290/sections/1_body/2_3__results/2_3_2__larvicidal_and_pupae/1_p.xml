<p>The results of in vitro assays demonstrated the larvicidal activity of essential oils against 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> (Diptera: 
 <italic>Culicidae</italic>), since all oils tested were able to eliminated 100% of larvae at 75 µg/mL. The essential oils of Mexican oregano and anise display the highest larvicidal activity with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.21 and 4.62 µg/mL, respectively. Pupae are more resistant than larvae, since more than 100 µg/mL of essential oil were needed to reach LC
 <sub>50</sub>; the same effect has been reported before [
