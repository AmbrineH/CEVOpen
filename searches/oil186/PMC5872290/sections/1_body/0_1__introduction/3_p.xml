<p>On the other hand, the intensive use of synthetic insecticides in mosquito control programs has created resistance in the insect population [

 <xref rid="B8-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], vector-borne diseases are persistent due to mosquitoes resistant to traditionally used insecticides [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and lack of effective vaccines [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The resistance of mosquitoes to synthetic insecticides has led to an interest in natural products with potential insecticidal activity, especially those derived from plants, which are considered valid alternatives to conventional synthetic pesticides to control a variety of insect pests and vectors. In this context, the essential oils and their constituents have received much attention as potentially useful bioactive compounds against insects [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The complex and variable mixtures of bioactive compounds with different modes of action, offered by plants, may lessen the chance of resistance in mosquito populations [
