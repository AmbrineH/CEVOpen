<p>Results of larval mortality demonstrated that the activity of anise essential oil and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole are statistically similar to the activity of Temephos, while 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> L. essential oil and its main component (eucalyptol) were less effective. Cinnamaldehyde, the major component of cinnamon essential oil, showed higher LC
 <sub>50</sub> compared to the essential oil, suggesting that there are antagonistic effects of some components present in cinnamon essential oil. On the contrary, cuminaldehyde the major constituent of cumin essential oil, is more active than the essential oil.
