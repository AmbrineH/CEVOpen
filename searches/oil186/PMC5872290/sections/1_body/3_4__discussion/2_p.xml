<p class="p">Regarding the larvicidal activities evaluated on instar III, there were no differences among the essential oils studied, except for the cinnamon essential oil (
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> J. Presl), which has a variation on LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> and LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">90</sub> values. Results included in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> demonstrate that the essential oils tested can effectively control 
 <italic class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</italic> pupae and larvae, and the effect can be the result of the interaction of the many compounds found in each essential oil, many in small or trace quantities, or can be attributed mainly to major components. To answer the latter question, the larvicidal and pupaecidal activity of the chemical compounds reported as major constituents of the essential oils tested were analyzed, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00025-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>.
