<p>The most relevant synergistic effects are observed against larvae with the combination of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anetol and limonene and the combination of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole and β-myrcene against pupae. These effects may be responsible for the rapid larvicidal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic>. Synergistic effects are also observed when mixing carvacrol and thymol, the main constituents of 
 <italic>Lippia berlandieri</italic> essential oil. However, none of these compounds has additive effects on the activity when they are mixed with 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. The only antagonistic effect was observed with the limonene–pinene combination, which may be related to the difference in activity between 
 <italic>C.aurantifolia</italic> essential oil and limonene against pupae.
