<p>There are numerous reports on the insecticidal activity of the essential oils from 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species; major components such as carvacrol, thymol, γ- terpinene and terpinen-4-ol are reported with fumigant and repellent activity rather than contact toxicity [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Cetin and Yanikoglu determined the insecticidal activity of essential oils from two species of Origanum (
 <italic>Origanum onites L.</italic> and 
 <italic>Origanum minutiflorum</italic>) on the third and fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens L.</italic>: the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 24.8 and 73.8 µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The authors attribute the larvicidal activity to carvacrol, as also suggested in this report. However, it is important to note that other studies have reported that oregano essential oil with high levels of thymol have an effective deterrent oviposition activity against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> females [
