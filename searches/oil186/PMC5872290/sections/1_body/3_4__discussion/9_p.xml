<p>Regarding essential oils derived from plants of the genus 
 <italic>Lippia</italic>, this study is the first to report the activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Lippia berlandieri</italic> Shauer. Vera et al. evaluated the activity of 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> against larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These two essential oils contained carvone and carvacrol as major components, and presented LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of approximately 50 µg/mL. In addition, the essential oils of 
 <italic>Lippia gracilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Lippia sidoides</italic> have been evaluated against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Gleiser and Zygadlo evaluated the activity of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Lippia turbinata</italic> and 
 <italic>Lippia polystachya</italic> against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Both oils presented α-thujone as the major component and showed no relevant larvicidal activity.
