<p class="p">The larvicidal efficiency of anise essential oil as well 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole, has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Waliwitiya et al., Pavela and Sousa et al. evaluated the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole against larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles atroparvus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> respectively, finding relevant LC

 <xref rid="B47-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This study confirms the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> L. essential oil, but it shows that 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole does not eliminate the larvae as quickly as it does the essential oil, even though both have similar LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> values. This suggests that there are interactions with other components that are present in the essential oil at lower or even trace concentrations. Therefore, it is always important to analyze the activity of the complete essential oil and their major components, since the presence of compounds different than the main components, can present synergistic or antagonistic effects.
