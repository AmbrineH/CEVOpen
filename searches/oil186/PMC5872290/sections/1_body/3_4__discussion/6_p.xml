<p>Limonene has a larvicidal activity similar to the essential oil of Mexican lime against stage III larvae of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>. Its activity doubled when the molecule was evaluated as a pure compound on pupae. This suggests that other components of the essential oil have an antagonist effect with limonene or that the compound is more effective against larvae in a more mature stage. These results demonstrate the importance of studying the components of the essential oils separately, as different studies could rule out some important molecules because the oil as a whole has seemingly unimportant biological activities. Eleni et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported the larvicidal activity of limonene rich essential oil from 
 <italic>Citrus auranitium</italic> subsp. bergamia against 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>; the oil displays a LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 58.73 mg/L. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> essential oil, containing 20% limonene, has been reported as larvicidal against 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 78.28 mg/L after 48 h of exposure [
