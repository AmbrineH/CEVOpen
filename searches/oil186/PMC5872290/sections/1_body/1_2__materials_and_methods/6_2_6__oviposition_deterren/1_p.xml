<p>The oviposition deterrent test was done using the method described by Xue et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-09-00025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The percent of effective repellency for was calculated using the formula:
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>ER</italic> (%) = ((
  <italic>NC</italic> − 
  <italic>NT</italic>)/(
  <italic>NC</italic> + 
  <italic>NT</italic>) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>ER</italic> is the percent of effective repellency; 
 <italic>NC</italic> is the number of eggs in the control sample; and 
 <italic>NT</italic> is the number of eggs in treatment bowl. 
 <italic>ER</italic> was determined and transformed to arcsine square root values for analysis of variance.
