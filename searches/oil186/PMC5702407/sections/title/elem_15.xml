  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOs from the aerial parts of
   <span class="italic"> M. suaveolens</span> subsp.
   <span class="italic"> timija</span> were found to be a yellow liquid with yields ranging from 0.82 ± 0.12% to 0.90 ± 0.08% (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). These results demonstrated that cultivation of this species with N, P, and K fertilizer or VAM inoculation had no significant effect on the EO production. These findings are in line with what has been reported for other aromatic and medicinal species exposed to these treatments, such as
   <span class="italic"> Thymus maroccanus</span> and
   <span class="italic"> T. leptobotrys</span> [
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>],
   <span class="italic"> Rosmarinus officinalis</span> [
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>], and

   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical analyses data of the volatile constituents of the different mint timija EOs (percentage content of each compound, elution order, retention index, and structural subclass) are summarized in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. In total, 27 components were identified, which represented more than 99.9% of the total oils. Oxygenated monoterpenes (87.9–93.2%) constituted the principal compound class, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The predominant constituents were menthone (40.7–49.3%), followed by pulegone (31.3–36.5%), isomenthone (2.5–4.3%), 1,8-cineole (2.1–3.4%), borneol (2.3–2.7%), and
   <span class="italic"> E</span>-caryophyllene (1.6–1.9%). The results indicate that N, P, and K fertilization and VAM inoculation affected the chemical composition of mint timija EOs, especially the content of their major compounds menthone and pulegone. In fact, compared with the oil extracted from control plants, applying both treatments produced an increase in menthone content (11.1% for N, P, and K fertilization, and 21.1% for VAM inoculation), and a reduction in pulegone (14.2% for N, P, and K fertilizer, and 11.0% for VAM inoculation).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation in the content of the major compounds of the EOs in response to the application of mineral and/or biological treatments observed in this study is in agreement with what has been previously reported by many authors [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>, 
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>–
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. In fact, it has been found that the addition of these treatments improved the physical and chemical properties of the soil through increases in the contents of mineral elements and organic matter and enhanced rhizosphere activity [
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. Enhancement of edaphic conditions is likely to lead to positive effects on plant growth, metabolic reactions, and enzyme activities, such as those of the terpenes biosynthesis pathways [
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>, 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. In addition, many studies have shown that the application of mineral fertilizers and biological amendments plays a beneficial role in the tolerance of cultivated plants against many environmental stresses [
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>, 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>–
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. It has been reported that cultivation of
   <span class="italic"> M. suaveolens</span> subsp.
   <span class="italic"> timija</span> in harsh environmental conditions such as an arid climate, low soil nutrient status, and salt stress produces an increase in pulegone content and consequent decrease in menthone content, in line with their known inverse accumulation trends [
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Based on the results of the present study, it seems that the use of mineral fertilizer and VAM inoculation during cultivation of mint timija minimizes the effect of the environmental stress. This may indeed explain the observed increase in menthone content and decrease in pulegone.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Antioxidant Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant capacity of mint timija EOs was assessed by three complementary
   <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> assays. The results showed that all investigated EOs had important antioxidant properties (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The data of the analysis of variance revealed that treatments affect significantly (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) the antioxidant potency of mint timija EOs. In fact, the oils obtained from the aerial parts of mint timija cultivated with mineral fertilizer displayed the highest antioxidant activities across the three assays, with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 2.34 ± 0.03 mg/mL to 5.96 ± 0.29 mg/mL. The lowest contribution was observed for the control plants EOs with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.29 ± 0.17 mg/mL to 7.00 ± 0.48 mg/mL. The oils obtained from plants treated with VAM inoculation expressed intermediate antioxidant potencies (IC
   <sub>50</sub>: 2.86 ± 0.04 mg/mL to 6.82 ± 0.25 mg/mL). Furthermore, for all assays, mint timija EOs were less potent than the reference antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and quercetin (IC
   <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 4.21 ± 0.08 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL to 7.09 ± 0.10 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL and from 0.95 ± 0.02

   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL, resp.).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data indicate that the use of N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation had a positive influence on the antioxidant potency of
   <span class="italic"> M. suaveolens </span>subsp.
   <span class="italic"> timija</span> EOs. Similar results have been reported for other medicinal and aromatic plants [
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>, 
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]. The antioxidant activity of mint timija EOs is thought to correlate to its high levels of the oxygenated monoterpenes menthone and pulegone [
   <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>, 
   <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">40</a>]. However, it seems to be a general consensus that the antioxidant effects of the EOs cannot simply be explained by the action of their major components [
   <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">41</a>]. In the present study, increased activities observed for the oils obtained from mint timija cultivated with both treatments compared with the control plants only matched increases of one major compound (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), so that contributions of minor compounds cannot be ruled out. Indeed, the EOs are, from the chemical point of view, quite complex mixtures; synergistic and antagonistic effects associated with minor and/or major compounds should therefore also be considered [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Insecticidal Activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxicity values (LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub>) for mint timija EOs against the important stored product insect pest,
   <span class="italic"> T. confusum,</span> using contact and fumigant methods are presented in Tables 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">4</a>. Based on the calculated LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values, the tested EOs exhibited potent insecticidal activity against adult
   <span class="italic"> T. confusum</span>, confirming our previous findings [
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>, 
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values are ranged from 0.10 to 0.13 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span> and from 0.28 to 0.37 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L/cm
   <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, in contact assays as well as from 21.60 to 23.97 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air and from 38.35 to 54.38 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air, respectively, in fumigant assays. The levels of insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs registered in this work against
   <span class="italic"> T. confusum </span>appear to be linked to the major components menthone and pulegone. Indeed, the strong toxicity of these compounds against several storage pest insects has been reported in many previous studies [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">42</a>, 
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">43</a>]. In addition, it is worth noting that the application of the treatments (N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation) has no significant effect on the insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs, since no overlap between the 95% confidence limits was observed (Tables 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">4</a>). To our knowledge, there has been no previous report regarding the effect of mineral fertilizers and VAM inoculation on the insecticidal activity of plant EOs.
