 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contact insecticidal activity of EOs obtained from mint timija against
  <span class="italic"> T. confusum</span> adults was determined by assessing the toxicity using filter paper discs (Whatman number 1, 9 cm diameter) as described by Kasrati et al. [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Oils were dissolved in acetone at concentrations of 0.09, 0.16, 0.24, and 0.31

  <span class="sup">2</span>. Several preliminary tests were conducted to select the doses to be used for each EO. One mL of each solution was dispensed on the surface of the filter paper that was then placed in a glass Petri dish. Control filter papers were treated with acetone only. After 10 min, once the solvent had been evaporated, 10 unsexed adults were deposited into each dish. Each EO and control treatment was replicated three times, repeating each assay twice. Mortality was recorded after 24 hours.
