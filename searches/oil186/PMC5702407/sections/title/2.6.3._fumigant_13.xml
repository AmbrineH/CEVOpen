 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fumigant toxicity of mint timija EOs was determined using the method described by Kasrati el al. [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. 2 cm diameter filter papers (Whatman number 1) were impregnated with the different oil doses 1, 2, 3, and 4 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L. The impregnated filter papers were then attached to the screw caps of 60 mL Plexiglas bottles to give calculated fumigant concentrations of, respectively, 16.66, 33.33, 50, and 66.66 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L/L air. Caps were screwed tightly on the vials, each of which contained 10 unsexed adults. Each EO and control treatment was replicated three times, repeating each assay twice. Mortality was recorded after 24 h.
