 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our results demonstrated that mineral fertilizer and VAM inoculation have no effect on mint timija EO yield. However, the application of both treatments induced a change in EO chemical composition with an increase of menthone content and a decrease of pulegone. Mint timija EOs subjected to both treatments presented the highest antioxidant activity, while no significant effect on the toxicity against adults of
  <span class="italic"> T. confusum</span> has been observed. Data of this study suggest that cultivation of mint timija with N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation could be a promising solution to ensure the conservation of this valuable and endemic Moroccan species and also to enhance the chemical profile by reducing pulegone content, well known as toxic compound, and to preserve the antioxidant and insecticidal potencies of its valued EOs.
