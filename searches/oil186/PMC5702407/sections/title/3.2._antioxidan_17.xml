 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant capacity of mint timija EOs was assessed by three complementary
  <span class="italic"> in vitro</span> assays. The results showed that all investigated EOs had important antioxidant properties (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The data of the analysis of variance revealed that treatments affect significantly (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) the antioxidant potency of mint timija EOs. In fact, the oils obtained from the aerial parts of mint timija cultivated with mineral fertilizer displayed the highest antioxidant activities across the three assays, with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 2.34 ± 0.03 mg/mL to 5.96 ± 0.29 mg/mL. The lowest contribution was observed for the control plants EOs with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.29 ± 0.17 mg/mL to 7.00 ± 0.48 mg/mL. The oils obtained from plants treated with VAM inoculation expressed intermediate antioxidant potencies (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 2.86 ± 0.04 mg/mL to 6.82 ± 0.25 mg/mL). Furthermore, for all assays, mint timija EOs were less potent than the reference antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and quercetin (IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 4.21 ± 0.08 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL to 7.09 ± 0.10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL and from 0.95 ± 0.02 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL to 2.29 ± 0.10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL, resp.).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data indicate that the use of N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation had a positive influence on the antioxidant potency of
  <span class="italic"> M. suaveolens </span>subsp.
  <span class="italic"> timija</span> EOs. Similar results have been reported for other medicinal and aromatic plants [

  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]. The antioxidant activity of mint timija EOs is thought to correlate to its high levels of the oxygenated monoterpenes menthone and pulegone [

  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">40</a>]. However, it seems to be a general consensus that the antioxidant effects of the EOs cannot simply be explained by the action of their major components [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">41</a>]. In the present study, increased activities observed for the oils obtained from mint timija cultivated with both treatments compared with the control plants only matched increases of one major compound (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), so that contributions of minor compounds cannot be ruled out. Indeed, the EOs are, from the chemical point of view, quite complex mixtures; synergistic and antagonistic effects associated with minor and/or major compounds should therefore also be considered [
