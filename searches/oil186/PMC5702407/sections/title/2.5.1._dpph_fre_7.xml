 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of EOs to scavenge the 2,2â€²-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured using the method described by Sahin et al. [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. The sample concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by plotting the inhibition percentages against the concentrations of the sample.
