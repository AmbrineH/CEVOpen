<p>Several studies have shown that the application of mineral fertilizers and biological agents, such as vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), can influence the yield, composition, and biological properties of many medicinal and aromatic plants EOs, such as

 <italic> Mentha viridis</italic>,
 <italic> Mentha arvensis</italic>,
 <italic> Artemisia annua</italic>,
 <italic> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>,

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, no information is available on the influence of these treatments on the quality and quantity of EO in mint timija plants. Thus, the objective of the study described herein was to determine for the first time the possible effect of complete (N, P, and K) fertilizer and VAM inoculation on the chemical profile, and consequently on the insecticidal and antioxidant activities of EOs extracted from this Moroccan endemic plant.
