<p>The ability of EOs to scavenge the 2,2â€²-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured using the method described by Sahin et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The sample concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by plotting the inhibition percentages against the concentrations of the sample.
