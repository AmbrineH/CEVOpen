<p class="p">The GC/MS analysis of EOs was performed in an Agilent GC-MSD system (Agilent Technologies 6890/5973) with helium (high purity) as the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 37 cm/s. The transfer, source, and quadrupole temperatures were 280°C, 230°C, and 150°C, respectively, operating at 70 eV ionisation energy and scanning the
