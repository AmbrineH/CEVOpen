<p>For the EO extraction, we followed the methods described by Kasrati et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The collected material was air-dried at room temperature (≈25°C) in the shade and subjected to hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h until total recovery of oil. The extraction was performed on three different samples and the obtained oils were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, weighed, and stored at 4°C until use.
