<p>The toxicity values (LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub>) for mint timija EOs against the important stored product insect pest,
 <italic> T. confusum,</italic> using contact and fumigant methods are presented in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">4</xref>. Based on the calculated LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values, the tested EOs exhibited potent insecticidal activity against adult
 <italic> T. confusum</italic>, confirming our previous findings [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values are ranged from 0.10 to 0.13 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and from 0.28 to 0.37 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively, in contact assays as well as from 21.60 to 23.97 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/L air and from 38.35 to 54.38 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/L air, respectively, in fumigant assays. The levels of insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs registered in this work against
 <italic> T. confusum </italic>appear to be linked to the major components menthone and pulegone. Indeed, the strong toxicity of these compounds against several storage pest insects has been reported in many previous studies [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, it is worth noting that the application of the treatments (N, P, and K fertilizer and VAM inoculation) has no significant effect on the insecticidal activity of mint timija EOs, since no overlap between the 95% confidence limits was observed (Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">4</xref>). To our knowledge, there has been no previous report regarding the effect of mineral fertilizers and VAM inoculation on the insecticidal activity of plant EOs.
