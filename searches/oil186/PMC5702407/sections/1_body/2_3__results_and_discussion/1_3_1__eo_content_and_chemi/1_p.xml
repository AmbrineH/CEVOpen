<p>The EOs from the aerial parts of
 <italic> M. suaveolens</italic> subsp.
 <italic> timija</italic> were found to be a yellow liquid with yields ranging from 0.82 ± 0.12% to 0.90 ± 0.08% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrated that cultivation of this species with N, P, and K fertilizer or VAM inoculation had no significant effect on the EO production. These findings are in line with what has been reported for other aromatic and medicinal species exposed to these treatments, such as
 <italic> Thymus maroccanus</italic> and
 <italic> T. leptobotrys</italic> [

 <italic> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> [
