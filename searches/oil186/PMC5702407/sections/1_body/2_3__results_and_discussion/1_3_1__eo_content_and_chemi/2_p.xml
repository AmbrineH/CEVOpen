<p>Chemical analyses data of the volatile constituents of the different mint timija EOs (percentage content of each compound, elution order, retention index, and structural subclass) are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. In total, 27 components were identified, which represented more than 99.9% of the total oils. Oxygenated monoterpenes (87.9–93.2%) constituted the principal compound class, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The predominant constituents were menthone (40.7–49.3%), followed by pulegone (31.3–36.5%), isomenthone (2.5–4.3%), 1,8-cineole (2.1–3.4%), borneol (2.3–2.7%), and
 <italic> E</italic>-caryophyllene (1.6–1.9%). The results indicate that N, P, and K fertilization and VAM inoculation affected the chemical composition of mint timija EOs, especially the content of their major compounds menthone and pulegone. In fact, compared with the oil extracted from control plants, applying both treatments produced an increase in menthone content (11.1% for N, P, and K fertilization, and 21.1% for VAM inoculation), and a reduction in pulegone (14.2% for N, P, and K fertilizer, and 11.0% for VAM inoculation).
