<p>The variation in the content of the major compounds of the EOs in response to the application of mineral and/or biological treatments observed in this study is in agreement with what has been previously reported by many authors [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In fact, it has been found that the addition of these treatments improved the physical and chemical properties of the soil through increases in the contents of mineral elements and organic matter and enhanced rhizosphere activity [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Enhancement of edaphic conditions is likely to lead to positive effects on plant growth, metabolic reactions, and enzyme activities, such as those of the terpenes biosynthesis pathways [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, many studies have shown that the application of mineral fertilizers and biological amendments plays a beneficial role in the tolerance of cultivated plants against many environmental stresses [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It has been reported that cultivation of
 <italic> M. suaveolens</italic> subsp.
 <italic> timija</italic> in harsh environmental conditions such as an arid climate, low soil nutrient status, and salt stress produces an increase in pulegone content and consequent decrease in menthone content, in line with their known inverse accumulation trends [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Based on the results of the present study, it seems that the use of mineral fertilizer and VAM inoculation during cultivation of mint timija minimizes the effect of the environmental stress. This may indeed explain the observed increase in menthone content and decrease in pulegone.
