  <p>Taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome in Atlantic cod. Relative abundance of (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) bacterial phyla and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) OTUs. Colors represent the 11 phyla (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) or the 20 most abundant OTUs (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) in cod. Unclassified sequences (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and remaining OTUs (
