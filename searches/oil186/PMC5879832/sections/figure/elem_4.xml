  <p>Log abundance of bacterial orders in two exposure groups of Atlantic cod. Black asterisks denote statistical significance as determined by MetaStats (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). The grey asterisks represent orders that in a Wilcoxon rank-sum test have a 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt; 0.05 but is still above the Bonferroni corrected 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value (0.0045). Numbers in parentheses denote the number of OTUs in the corresponding order. All samples have been normalized to the same number of reads by common scaling
