<p id="Par45">A common scaling procedure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] normalized the OTU count in a given library with a factor corresponding to the ratio of the smallest library size in the dataset to the library size of the OTU in question. This replaces rarefying (i.e. random sub-sampling to the lowest number of reads) as it effectively results in the library scaling one would achieve by averaging an infinite number of repeated sub-samplings. We then excluded all OTUs present in only one sample from the dataset. Next, rarefaction curves were calculated on the observed number of reads to confirm a sufficient sequencing effort using an R script from the Phyloseq repository website [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Finally, alpha diversity measures and ordination distances for non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were calculated in Phyloseq. Distances were calculated based on OTUs with more than 10 reads (&gt;â€‰99% of total number of reads).
