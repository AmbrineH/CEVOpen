<p id="Par46" class="p">Differences in within-sample (fish specimen) diversity (alpha diversity) were tested using both analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Further, differences in bacterial community composition (beta diversity) between the exposure groups were assessed using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) using the “adonis” function in the R package “Vegan” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. The test was run with 20,000 permutations, applying both OTU-based (Bray-Curtis/Jaccard) and phylogeny-based (weighted and unweighted UniFrac) measures. PERMANOVA was also applied to test for differences in PAH metabolites between the exposure groups. PERMANOVA assumes the multivariate dispersion in the compared groups to be homogeneous; this was verified using the “betadisper” function in “Vegan”. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) procedure implemented in “Vegan” was used to quantify the contribution of individual OTUs to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the groups. “MetaStats” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] was used to test for OTUs and orders with statistically significant differential abundances between the exposure groups. Only OTUs containing more than 0.1% of the total number of reads in the normalized and filtered dataset were used in this analysis. Finally, a correspondence analysis (CA) (“
 <italic class="italic">cca</italic>” in Vegan) was performed to explore the gut microbial community structure. Environmental parameters (order abundances) that significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) correlated with the ordination were fitted onto the CA plot using the “
 <italic class="italic">envfit</italic>” command in Vegan.
