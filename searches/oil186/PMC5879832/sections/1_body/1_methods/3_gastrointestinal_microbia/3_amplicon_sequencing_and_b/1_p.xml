<p id="Par43">Amplicon libraries were prepared using BioScientific’s NEXTflex V4 library preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. All DNA samples were diluted 10 times prior to first PCR step. Primer and barcode sequences are shown as additional file [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>]. Instead of the recommended 10 cycles, 25 cycles were used during the first PCR reaction in order to obtain sufficient amount of products. PCR clean-up was then performed using MinElute Column Clean-up kit (Qiagen) and cleaned reaction mixes were diluted. The second PCR step was performed using 25 cycles as well. Approximately 40 μL of PCR products were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, bands corresponding to expected product size were excised and the second cleanup step was performed with MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Quiagen). DNA concentration was then measured with a NanoVue instrument (GE Healthcare). Products from three repeated library preparation rounds were pooled together prior to amplicon sequencing. Finally, the amplicons were sequenced by the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC) using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) V3 chemistry reagents (600 cycle, paired end). PhiX was blended in at 30% and a maximum of 1 bp mismatch was allowed during demultiplexing. All sequences have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), acc. nr. PRJEB21667.
