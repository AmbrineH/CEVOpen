<p id="Par41">The GI tract of three fishes from each exposure group were used for microbial community composition analysis. After thawing on ice, each GI tract sample was cut into small pieces using sterile scissors and tweezer and placed in 15 mL sterile tubes with 3 mL ATL lysis buffer (Qiagen). Samples were vortexed vigorously several times and kept at room temperature (approx. 22 °C), then centrifuged briefly at 10,000 rpm. The liquid phase was decanted into a fresh 15 mL tube and contents were lysed overnight at 55 °C. Following this overnight incubation, a 30 min RNA digestion was carried out at 37 °C by adding 20 μL RNAse A solution (100 mg/mL, Qiagen) to each sample. DNA was then purified using phenol:chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (PCI, 25:24:1, Sigma) extraction and ethanol precipitation. Briefly, to each lysate (approx. 3 mL), 5 mL of PCI was added and mixed vigorously. Samples were kept on ice followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min. The supernatant was pipetted into a new tube before the extraction was repeated one more time with PCI (5 mL) and then once with 5 mL chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (CI, 24:1, Sigma). The DNA was finally precipitated with ice-cold ethanol (2 volumes of 100%) in the presence of sodium acetate (0.3 mM, pH 5.3). Samples were gently mixed and then incubated at − 20 °C for a minimum of 4 h. Falcon tubes were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to collect the DNA pellet. Ethanol was discarded, a washing step with 70% ethanol was carried out and pellets were re-suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8). Finally, an additional clean-up was performed using Genomic DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to completely remove inhibitors and resuspend DNA in molecular grade water.</p>
