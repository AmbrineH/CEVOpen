<p id="Par40">GC-MS analysis was carried out as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In brief, the OH-PAHs were extracted with ethylacetate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated prior to sylilation with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSFTA). Trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers of OH-PAHs were analysed using an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with a CP-Sil 8 CB-MS (Varian) column. Mass spectra were obtained at 70Â eV in selected ion mode (SIM).
