<p id="Par67">In the study presented here, the microbial contents of the entire GI tract were used from fishes that were starved 7Â days prior to sampling. It is well known that different alimentary components harbor distinct microbial communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and that starvation influences the composition of GI tract microbiota [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In future studies, it is preferable to collect intestinal contents based on a prior visual assessment of the alimentary anatomy.
