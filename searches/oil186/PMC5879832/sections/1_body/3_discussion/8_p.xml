 <italic class="italic">Deferribacterales</italic> is a member of the recently discovered phylum Deferribacteres, and bacteria belonging to this group are considered acetoclastic iron-reducers. Iron is a nutrient that often limits bacterial growth, and animals typically try to reduce biologically available iron in order to avoid bacterial infections. Interestingly, it was found earlier, that exposure of juvenile Atlantic cod to HDF200 base oil (containing PAHs) for 30Â days, resulted in downregulation of serotransferrin, a glycoprotein involved in iron-binding [
