<p id="Par68" class="p">On the phylum level, pentachlorophenol (PCP) exposure of goldfish for 28 days resulted mainly in increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> abundance and reduction of

 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> ratio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. We did not observe such effect of oil on Atlantic cod in this study. Here, both 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> were present in lower relative abundances among upper exposure level individuals. Another recent study, which examined the effects of radio-labeled graphene nanoparticles of different size in adult zebrafish, also found that microbial communities were affected, and the size of the graphene nanoparticles seemed to be an important factor in determining the composition of GI tract microbiota [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. While bacterial community composition of control fish (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) and large nanoparticle exposed fish (n = 4) were similar, significant differences were observed in the gut microbiota composition of the small nanoparticle exposed fish (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) based on NMDS analysis.
