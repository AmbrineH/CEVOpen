<p id="Par69" class="p">The intestinal bacterial community in our three control samples resembles that found in 11 cod individuals from the inner Oslo fjord [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], as it is dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrionales</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrionales</italic>. The large proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrionales</italic> (median: 55%) in our samples is close to what is observed by Star et al. (median: 50%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] and is also in agreement with findings in other marine carnivores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. Further, members of the most abundant orders have previously been reported in Atlantic cod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Although the comparison with the Oslo fjord samples is based on a small sample sizes, the similarity between these communities indicates that our laboratory setting did not alter the species composition drastically compared to those found in wild populations.
