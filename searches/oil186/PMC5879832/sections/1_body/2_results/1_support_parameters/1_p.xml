<p id="Par47" class="p">Chemical analysis of the Troll C crude oil used in this exposure confirmed that all 16 EPA PAHs were present, their sum was 1.6 g/L. The most abundant PAHs present were 2- and 3-ring PAHs and the highest concentrations were found for those of 2-methylnaphthalene and 3-methylnaphthalene. The PAH profile of the seawater in the header tank also showed presence of both low and high molecular weight PAHs. Chemical analysis results for Troll C crude and header tank are summarized in additional files [see Additional files
