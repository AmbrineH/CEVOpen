<p id="Par51">Variation among individual fish was highest for the high exposure group as revealed by the scattering. The plot indicates a dose-response effect. Moreover, PERMANOVA analysis confirmed a significant difference between the control and low oil concentration exposed fish when compared to the medium and high oil concentration samples (
