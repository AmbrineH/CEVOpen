<p id="Par50" class="p">The results of both FF and GC-MS analysis of PAH metabolites in bile confirmed the uptake and biotransformation of PAHs after exposure and results can be seen in additional files [see Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>, respectively]. Distribution pattern of PAHs found in Troll C crude oil was reflected through the distribution pattern of PAH metabolites in the bile analysed by FF. Highest concentrations were measured for 2–3-ring PAH metabolites, while 4-ring and 5-ring PAH metabolites were present in lower concentration. GC-MS results further confirmed these observations, showing C
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-OH-, and C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-OH-naphthalene to be found in the highest concentrations in bile from crude oil exposed fish. The level of PAH metabolites revealed a grouping of samples according to exposure level when using multi-variate analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot showed a distinct clustering of control and low oil concentration exposed fish, clearly separated from the cluster of medium and high oil concentration exposed individuals.
