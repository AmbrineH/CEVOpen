<p id="Par55" class="p">While the number of observed OTUs appeared to decrease with increasing levels of oil exposure, no significant effect on the number of OTUs was determined by ANOVA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.37) as variation within treatment was high. Likewise, no significant differences in Shannon and Inverse Simpson diversity were detected between the four treatment levels in an ANOVA analysis. When comparing the treatment levels as partitioned into a lower (control + low) and an upper (medium + high) exposure group, however, a significant difference in Shannon diversity was identified using both ANOVA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.03, F = 6.04, DF = 1) and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the two groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.04, W = 31). Moreover, PERMANOVA analysis of differences in community composition between the lower and upper exposure group was performed using four different beta diversity measures [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>]. Significance values for Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the Jaccard index were both less than 0.05, although not below the Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of 0.0125 (0.05/4). Nevertheless, this analysis also indicated a shift (decrease) in the overall intestinal microbial diversity between cod exposed to lower and upper levels of crude oil.
