<p id="Par62">The other two samples from the upper exposure group (48 and 59) clustered together with control samples and the majority of low exposure samples. This was mostly due to the high abundance of 
 <italic>Vibrionales</italic>. This order was indeed significantly correlated (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) with these and most of the samples from the lower exposure group. There was also a significant correlation between abundance of 
 <italic>Fusobacteriales</italic> and the lower exposure group samples (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Finally, samples 44 and 45 were positioned more peripherally on the CA plot driven by their abundances of 
 <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> (phylum 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, sample 44) and 
 <italic>Mycoplasmatales</italic> (phylum 
 <italic>Tenericutes</italic>, sample 45), respectively.
