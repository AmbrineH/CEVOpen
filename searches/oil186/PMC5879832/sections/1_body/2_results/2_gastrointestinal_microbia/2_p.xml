<p id="Par53" class="p">The paired-end sequencing of the 12 amplicon libraries resulted in a mean raw read number of 1,313,000 per sample [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>]. After removal of phiX and other non-bacterial sequences we obtained a total of about 6 million assembled reads and a median of approx. 540,000 reads per sample [see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>]. After normalizing OTU abundances by common scaling based on the smallest library size (352,363 reads), and removal of OTUs present in only one sample, 994 OTUs representing &gt; 99% of the reads in the dataset were identified. Rarefaction curve analyses on the normalized data, depicting the relationship between read number and number of detected OTUs, confirmed that the number of OTUs detected per sample was not caused by uneven sequencing depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The difference in microbial communities between the lower and upper exposure groups was also suggested by their separation (blue vs. red tones) in an NMDS plot based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), as well as from the DGGE patterns observed for pooled samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>).
