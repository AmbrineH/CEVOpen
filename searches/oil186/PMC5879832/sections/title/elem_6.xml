  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atlantic cod (weight range of 137–1455 g) were caught in March–April 2015 in the Stavanger region, transported to the International Research Institute of Stavanger facilities and placed in 1000 L tanks. After a 1–2 weeks’ acclimation, fish were exposed to three different concentrations of dispersed crude oil from the Troll C platform (North Sea, Norway): low (0.01 mg/L) (n of fish = 8), medium (0.05 mg/L) (n of fish = 9) and high (0.1 mg/L) (n of fish = 6). A group of fish were kept in a tank with clean seawater flow and used as control (n of fish = 7). A constant flow of 8 L/min seawater into each tank was ensured in both control and exposed groups. The crude oil was continuously distributed from a header tank (dispersed oil reservoir) into the different exposure tanks through a continuous flow system (CFS) as described earlier [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], in order to mimic natural environmental conditions, e.g., oil spill scenario . Illustration of the CFS system is shown in an additional figure [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>]. The CFS was checked daily, oil droplet sizes were monitored three times a week by Multisizer measurements, and PAH concentrations were measured semi quantitatively by fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) weekly (data not reported). A detailed description of the exposure set up can be found in the thesis of Delgado [

  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 28 days of exposure, fish were sedated using 5 mg/L Aquacalm fish sedative (Metomidate HCl) and sacrificed by a sharp blow to the head. The entire intestinal tract was removed, placed in a sterile container, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction. For analysis of PAH uptake and biotransformation in fish, bile samples were drawn using a syringe, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until analysis.</p>

  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical analysis was carried out in order to assess PAH content of the Troll C crude oil and of samples taken from the header tank on day 14 and 28 (Intertek West Lab AS, ISO28540:2011). In the Troll C crude oil, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) PAHs were quantified, while in the header tank, 25 PAH compounds and groups of compounds were measured.</p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Morphometric measurements, i.e., length, total weight of fish and liver weights, were recorded for all sampled specimens. General physiological indices were calculated as follows [

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) analysis of bile samples was conducted as described by Aas et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Bile samples were diluted in 50% methanol and analysed using a Lumina fluorescence spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The concentration of PAH metabolites was expressed as mg pyrene fluorescence equivalents (PFE)/mL bile.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. In brief, the OH-PAHs were extracted with ethylacetate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated prior to sylilation with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSFTA). Trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers of OH-PAHs were analysed using an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with a CP-Sil 8 CB-MS (Varian) column. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV in selected ion mode (SIM).

   <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GI tract of three fishes from each exposure group were used for microbial community composition analysis. After thawing on ice, each GI tract sample was cut into small pieces using sterile scissors and tweezer and placed in 15 mL sterile tubes with 3 mL ATL lysis buffer (Qiagen). Samples were vortexed vigorously several times and kept at room temperature (approx. 22 °C), then centrifuged briefly at 10,000 rpm. The liquid phase was decanted into a fresh 15 mL tube and contents were lysed overnight at 55 °C. Following this overnight incubation, a 30 min RNA digestion was carried out at 37 °C by adding 20 μL RNAse A solution (100 mg/mL, Qiagen) to each sample. DNA was then purified using phenol:chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (PCI, 25:24:1, Sigma) extraction and ethanol precipitation. Briefly, to each lysate (approx. 3 mL), 5 mL of PCI was added and mixed vigorously. Samples were kept on ice followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min. The supernatant was pipetted into a new tube before the extraction was repeated one more time with PCI (5 mL) and then once with 5 mL chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (CI, 24:1, Sigma). The DNA was finally precipitated with ice-cold ethanol (2 volumes of 100%) in the presence of sodium acetate (0.3 mM, pH 5.3). Samples were gently mixed and then incubated at − 20 °C for a minimum of 4 h. Falcon tubes were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to collect the DNA pellet. Ethanol was discarded, a washing step with 70% ethanol was carried out and pellets were re-suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8). Finally, an additional clean-up was performed using Genomic DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to completely remove inhibitors and resuspend DNA in molecular grade water.</p>

   <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was carried out on all individual genomic DNA samples and on pooled genomic DNA samples which were from the same exposure group. The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA was amplified as described previously [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] (forward primer 341f: 5‘-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’ with a GC-clamp 5′- CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3′ attached at the 5′-end and reverse primer 907r: 5′- CCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3′). Each 50 μL PCR mix was composed of molecular grade water, 5 μL PCR buffer (5 Prime), 0.1 mM of each dNTP’s, 10 pM of each primer, 1 μL of genomic DNA and 0.25 μL of Taq polymerase (5 U/μL, 5 Prime). The PCR program was as follows: initial activation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of: (1) denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, (2) annealing at 55 °C for 40 s and (3) elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. A final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min was also included. The DGGE was carried out on a 6% acrylamide gel containing denaturing agents, urea and formamide, in a gradient of 20–80% prepared by using the IngenyPhorU gradient former. Equal amounts of PCR products were loaded into each well (confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis). The run was performed using an IngenyPhorU (Ingeny International BV, Goes, The Netherlands) system (17 L volume, 1 x TAE as buffer, temperature at 60 °C) at 90 V for 18 h. Bands were visualized using post-staining (GelRed in TAE) for 60 min prior to imaging.

   <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amplicon libraries were prepared using BioScientific’s NEXTflex V4 library preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. All DNA samples were diluted 10 times prior to first PCR step. Primer and barcode sequences are shown as additional file [see Additional file 
    <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>]. Instead of the recommended 10 cycles, 25 cycles were used during the first PCR reaction in order to obtain sufficient amount of products. PCR clean-up was then performed using MinElute Column Clean-up kit (Qiagen) and cleaned reaction mixes were diluted. The second PCR step was performed using 25 cycles as well. Approximately 40 μL of PCR products were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, bands corresponding to expected product size were excised and the second cleanup step was performed with MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Quiagen). DNA concentration was then measured with a NanoVue instrument (GE Healthcare). Products from three repeated library preparation rounds were pooled together prior to amplicon sequencing. Finally, the amplicons were sequenced by the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC) using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) V3 chemistry reagents (600 cycle, paired end). PhiX was blended in at 30% and a maximum of 1 bp mismatch was allowed during demultiplexing. All sequences have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), acc. nr. PRJEB21667.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Briefly, paired-end reads were joined using “make.contigs” and filtered based upon a minimum average Phred quality score of 25, contig length (max 289 bp) and a zero-tolerance to ambiguous base pairs. Chimeras were removed using the UCHIME algorithm [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] implemented in Mothur, before the sequences (V4 region) were aligned and classified using the Silva SEED bacterial database (v. 119) as reference. The dataset was clustered into OTUs based on a 97% similarity sequence similarity using average neighbour clustering. The OTU table output of Mothur was imported into R studio [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] (based on R (v. 3.2.3) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]) for further processing using the R package “phyloseq” (v. 1.14.0) [

   <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common scaling procedure [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] normalized the OTU count in a given library with a factor corresponding to the ratio of the smallest library size in the dataset to the library size of the OTU in question. This replaces rarefying (i.e. random sub-sampling to the lowest number of reads) as it effectively results in the library scaling one would achieve by averaging an infinite number of repeated sub-samplings. We then excluded all OTUs present in only one sample from the dataset. Next, rarefaction curves were calculated on the observed number of reads to confirm a sufficient sequencing effort using an R script from the Phyloseq repository website [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Finally, alpha diversity measures and ordination distances for non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were calculated in Phyloseq. Distances were calculated based on OTUs with more than 10 reads (&gt; 99% of total number of reads).
   </p>
   <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in within-sample (fish specimen) diversity (alpha diversity) were tested using both analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Further, differences in bacterial community composition (beta diversity) between the exposure groups were assessed using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) using the “adonis” function in the R package “Vegan” [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. The test was run with 20,000 permutations, applying both OTU-based (Bray-Curtis/Jaccard) and phylogeny-based (weighted and unweighted UniFrac) measures. PERMANOVA was also applied to test for differences in PAH metabolites between the exposure groups. PERMANOVA assumes the multivariate dispersion in the compared groups to be homogeneous; this was verified using the “betadisper” function in “Vegan”. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) procedure implemented in “Vegan” was used to quantify the contribution of individual OTUs to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the groups. “MetaStats” [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] was used to test for OTUs and orders with statistically significant differential abundances between the exposure groups. Only OTUs containing more than 0.1% of the total number of reads in the normalized and filtered dataset were used in this analysis. Finally, a correspondence analysis (CA) (“
    <span class="italic">cca</span>” in Vegan) was performed to explore the gut microbial community structure. Environmental parameters (order abundances) that significantly (
    <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) correlated with the ordination were fitted onto the CA plot using the “
    <span class="italic">envfit</span>” command in Vegan.
