 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atlantic cod (weight range of 137–1455 g) were caught in March–April 2015 in the Stavanger region, transported to the International Research Institute of Stavanger facilities and placed in 1000 L tanks. After a 1–2 weeks’ acclimation, fish were exposed to three different concentrations of dispersed crude oil from the Troll C platform (North Sea, Norway): low (0.01 mg/L) (n of fish = 8), medium (0.05 mg/L) (n of fish = 9) and high (0.1 mg/L) (n of fish = 6). A group of fish were kept in a tank with clean seawater flow and used as control (n of fish = 7). A constant flow of 8 L/min seawater into each tank was ensured in both control and exposed groups. The crude oil was continuously distributed from a header tank (dispersed oil reservoir) into the different exposure tanks through a continuous flow system (CFS) as described earlier [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], in order to mimic natural environmental conditions, e.g., oil spill scenario . Illustration of the CFS system is shown in an additional figure [see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>]. The CFS was checked daily, oil droplet sizes were monitored three times a week by Multisizer measurements, and PAH concentrations were measured semi quantitatively by fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) weekly (data not reported). A detailed description of the exposure set up can be found in the thesis of Delgado [

The entire intestinal tract was removed, placed in a sterile container, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction. For analysis of PAH uptake and biotransformation in fish, bile samples were drawn using a syringe, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until analysis.</p>
