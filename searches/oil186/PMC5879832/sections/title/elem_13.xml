  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical analysis of the Troll C crude oil used in this exposure confirmed that all 16 EPA PAHs were present, their sum was 1.6 g/L. The most abundant PAHs present were 2- and 3-ring PAHs and the highest concentrations were found for those of 2-methylnaphthalene and 3-methylnaphthalene. The PAH profile of the seawater in the header tank also showed presence of both low and high molecular weight PAHs. Chemical analysis results for Troll C crude and header tank are summarized in additional files [see Additional files 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>, respectively].

  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Morphometric parameters (CI and HSI) and concentrations of PAH metabolites in fish bile, reported for the three individuals used for GI microbial community analysis, were intended to give an overall description of the effect of oil on the exposed fishes. Moreover, concentrations of PAH metabolites in fish bile were used as support parameter for the GI microbial community analysis.</p>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CI and HSI values, reported in additional tables [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>], showed no differences between fish exposed to crude oil and the control group. The lack of significant difference between exposure groups was confirmed by statistical analysis using data from all exposed fishes (data not shown).
  </p>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of both FF and GC-MS analysis of PAH metabolites in bile confirmed the uptake and biotransformation of PAHs after exposure and results can be seen in additional files [see Additional files 
   <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">6</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">7</a>, respectively]. Distribution pattern of PAHs found in Troll C crude oil was reflected through the distribution pattern of PAH metabolites in the bile analysed by FF. Highest concentrations were measured for 2–3-ring PAH metabolites, while 4-ring and 5-ring PAH metabolites were present in lower concentration. GC-MS results further confirmed these observations, showing C
   <sub>2</sub>-OH-, and C
   <sub>3</sub>-OH-naphthalene to be found in the highest concentrations in bile from crude oil exposed fish. The level of PAH metabolites revealed a grouping of samples according to exposure level when using multi-variate analyses (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot showed a distinct clustering of control and low oil concentration exposed fish, clearly separated from the cluster of medium and high oil concentration exposed individuals.

  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation among individual fish was highest for the high exposure group as revealed by the scattering. The plot indicates a dose-response effect. Moreover, PERMANOVA analysis confirmed a significant difference between the control and low oil concentration exposed fish when compared to the medium and high oil concentration samples (

First, bacterial community compositions were compared by PCR-DGGE. This first screening showed that there were large variations among individuals as shown by discrete band patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). However, some bands were clearly present in all samples. There was also clear distinction between the band patterns of the pooled samples of lower and upper oil exposure groups (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). One band (#1 on Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) in particular appeared to be more dominant in the upper exposure group while two other bands (#2 and #3 on Fig.

  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The paired-end sequencing of the 12 amplicon libraries resulted in a mean raw read number of 1,313,000 per sample [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM9">9</a>]. After removal of phiX and other non-bacterial sequences we obtained a total of about 6 million assembled reads and a median of approx. 540,000 reads per sample [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM10">10</a>]. After normalizing OTU abundances by common scaling based on the smallest library size (352,363 reads), and removal of OTUs present in only one sample, 994 OTUs representing &gt; 99% of the reads in the dataset were identified. Rarefaction curve analyses on the normalized data, depicting the relationship between read number and number of detected OTUs, confirmed that the number of OTUs detected per sample was not caused by uneven sequencing depth (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). The difference in microbial communities between the lower and upper exposure groups was also suggested by their separation (blue vs. red tones) in an NMDS plot based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the samples (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), as well as from the DGGE patterns observed for pooled samples (Fig.

  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the number of observed OTUs appeared to decrease with increasing levels of oil exposure, no significant effect on the number of OTUs was determined by ANOVA (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.37) as variation within treatment was high. Likewise, no significant differences in Shannon and Inverse Simpson diversity were detected between the four treatment levels in an ANOVA analysis. When comparing the treatment levels as partitioned into a lower (control + low) and an upper (medium + high) exposure group, however, a significant difference in Shannon diversity was identified using both ANOVA (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.03, F = 6.04, DF = 1) and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the two groups (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.04, W = 31). Moreover, PERMANOVA analysis of differences in community composition between the lower and upper exposure group was performed using four different beta diversity measures [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM8">8</a>]. Significance values for Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the Jaccard index were both less than 0.05, although not below the Bonferroni corrected 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value of 0.0125 (0.05/4). Nevertheless, this analysis also indicated a shift (decrease) in the overall intestinal microbial diversity between cod exposed to lower and upper levels of crude oil.
