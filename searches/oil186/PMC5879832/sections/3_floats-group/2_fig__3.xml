  <p class="p">Diversity of microbial gut communities in Atlantic cod exposed to oil. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Rarefaction curves of 16S rDNA sequences at the 97% similarity cut-off. Specimens were exposed to increasing levels of oil exposure (
   <italic class="italic">blue to red</italic>). Curves are labelled with sample name (treatment level and fish specimen numbers). All samples are normalized to the same sequencing depth. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> NMDS plot of all samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Oil exposure treatment codes: Ctrl = Control, no oil, Low = low concentration of oil, Med = medium concentration of oil, High = high concentration of oil. Fish from the lower and upper exposure groups are colored in red and blue tones, respectively, and fish specimen numbers are shown after treatment codes
