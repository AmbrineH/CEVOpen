 <p>Antifungal activity of essential oils (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content>s) of 
  <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> (thyme) and 
  <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (clove) against 
  <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production was studied in potato dextrose agar (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDA</styled-content>) and potato dextrose broth (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDB</styled-content>), as well as in Iranian white cheese as a food model. The results showed that the inhibitory potential of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content>s in the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDB</styled-content> medium is more than 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDA</styled-content> medium. Clove 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content> on 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDB</styled-content> medium prevented fungal growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production at 300 and 100 ppm, respectively. However, the thyme 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content> was not able to inhibit fungal growth completely and showed the strongest inhibition effect at 400 ppm. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content>s also had more inhibitory activity in laboratory culture media than the food environments. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content>s in all concentrations reduced aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production and fungal growth in cheese, but only the clove 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content> at 150 ppm was able to prevent the fungal growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production completely. Thyme 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content> reduced aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> value to below detection threshold (2 ppb) at 10 μl. Our findings propose 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">EO</styled-content>s as a natural inhibitor to control fungal contamination of foodstuffs such as Iranian white cheese.
