  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sub> production was studied in potato dextrose agar (

  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PDB</span>), as well as in Iranian white cheese as a food model. The results showed that the inhibitory potential of

  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EO</span> was not able to inhibit fungal growth completely and showed the strongest inhibition effect at 400 ppm. 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EO</span>s also had more inhibitory activity in laboratory culture media than the food environments.
