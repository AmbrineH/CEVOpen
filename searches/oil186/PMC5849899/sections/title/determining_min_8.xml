 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suspension spore (0.1 ml) was added to each culture media containing different concentrations of EO. Plates were then incubated at 28°C for 48 hr. The lowest EO concentration which prevented visible microbial growth in that plate was determined as MIC or minimal inhibitory concentration of EO. Some agar pieces were removed from the plates containing MIC of EO and some agar pieces were removed from two plates with higher and lower EO concentration than MIC and finally they were cultured on PDA medium. Moreover, the first concentration at which visible microbial growth was observed was determined as the MFC or minimum fungicidal concentration (Mahboubi &amp; Haghi,
