<p>The results of the inhibitory effects of the EOs against aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production in both PDA and PDB media are shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. It was found that at the same time, the aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production in PDA medium was higher than that of PDB medium, which was because of the freely movement of hyphae in the PDB culture medium and greater possibility to access nutrients during incubation. In the case of PDB medium, the hyphae remained at the growth phase for longer time and aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production was postponed. Moreover, the pyruvate concentration per unit volume of the culture medium is a critical factor for aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production by 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and since in PDB medium the distribution of compounds is more extensive than PDA medium, the pyruvate concentration in PDB is less than that of PDA and consequently the aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production was more restricted in PDB medium. Also, in PDA medium inhibitory effect of EOs was only limited to the location where surface of the hyphae was contacted to the solid media. While in the PDB medium, all of the essential oil had contact to the hyphae.
