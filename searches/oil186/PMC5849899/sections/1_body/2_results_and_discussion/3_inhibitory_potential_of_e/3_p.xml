<p>Comparison of Tables

 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref> data with Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref> data shows that EOs in the PDB medium has less inhibitory potential against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth than PDA medium. This phenomenon can be attributed to the following factors: (1) the presence of more nutrients in the PDB than PDA per unit weight (g) of culture medium; (2) the absence of agar in PDB culture medium and higher water availability of PDB than PDA medium; (3) presence of higher volume of dissolved oxygen in PDB medium than PDA medium; (4) higher incubation time of PDB medium (10 days) than that of PDA medium (3 days) and consequently inability of some inhibitory compounds to maintain their inhibitory effects when incubation time is prolonged. Accordingly, to achieve a correct comparison, the effect of time and amount of culture medium must be omitted for PDA and PDB culture medium. In this regard, all data related to PDA and PDB media were calculated on the basis of medium weight (g) and unit of time (day).
