 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sub> production by 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> in the PDB medium. As we expected, according to the obtained data, clove EO showed higher inhibitory effect than thyme EO. In this regard, clove EO showed inhibitory effect of 100% against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth at concentration of 300 ppm, but for thyme EO the strongest inhibition effect (75%) was seen at concentration of 400 ppm. In a similar study, Razeghi‐Abyaneh et al. investigated and confirmed the antimicrobial effects of thymol and carvacrol in PDB medium against 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth.
