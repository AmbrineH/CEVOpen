<p>Carvacrol, thymol, and eugenol are known as the most important polyphenolic compounds of thyme and clove EOs (López‐Malo, Alzamora, &amp; Palou,

 <xref rid="fsn3557-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and lower levels of the EOs are needed to prevent the growth of microorganisms in vitro media compared to food samples (Bagamboula, Uyttendaele, &amp; Debevere, 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Accordingly, the reduction of the inhibitory potential of the EOs against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth and aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production was ascribed to the created interactions between polyphenols and proteins of cheese (Ultee &amp; Smid,
