<p>Results related to the inhibition effects of thyme and clove EOs in Iranian white cheese are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3557-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>. By the end of the 40th day of storage, thyme EO showed the inhibitory potential of 86.81% at 200 ppm concentration against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth and the highest inhibitory effect of thyme EO was recorded at 600 ppm, which was equal to 91.3% of inhibition. Moreover, because of high mold inhibitory potential of clove EO, which was evidenced in previous experiments
 <italic>,</italic> the essence showed 85.3%, 95%, and 100% of inhibition against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 ppm, respectively. Similar to the results of the PDA and PDB medium, in Iranian white cheese the inhibitory effect of the EOs against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth was higher than their inhibitory effect against aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production. In the case of clove EO, 50 and 100 ppm of the essence could eradicate the aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> after 20 and 10 days of storage, respectively, and by introducing 150 ppm of the clove EO no aflatoxin were found during any time of storage.
