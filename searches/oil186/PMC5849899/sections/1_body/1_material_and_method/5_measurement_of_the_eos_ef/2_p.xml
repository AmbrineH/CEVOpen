<p>Plates containing any of thyme or clove EOs were prepared. In order to culture 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, one of the fungus 3‐day cultures was divided into parts (2 × 2 mm), and each of these parts was placed at the center of the plates and incubated at 28°C. The positive control plate contained fungi with no EO, and negative control plate only contain EOs with no fungi. The plates were checked every day, and the growth of fungus was enumerated as a function of hyphae growth radius. Comparison of this radius in plates containing different concentrations of EO and positive control plate was introduced as inhibitory effect of EO on the fungi growth (Gandomi et al.,
