<p>Measurement of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> amount in cheese samples was performed using a high‐performance liquid chromatography devise (Agilent, USA) which was equipped with fluorescence detector and immunoaffinity type column. For each subsample, 2 g of the cheese sample was weighed into an acid‐washed pyrex flask at room temperature and extracted with 100 ml methanol:water (80:20, v/v) containing 5 g of sodium chloride by blending vigorously for 1 min in Waring Blender at high speed. The extract was filtered through fluted filter paper (24 cm, Vicam, Watertown, MA, USA) and 10 ml of the filtrate was diluted into 50 ml with deionized water and mixed vigorously. The mixture was passed through microfiber filter paper (11 cm, Vicam, Watertown, MA, USA) and 20 ml of filtrate was loaded on the immunoaffinity column (Aflatest, Vicam, Watertown, MA, USA). The column was washed two times with 10 ml of deionized water and the aflatoxins were eluted by passing 1 ml of HPLC grade methanol through column at a rate of 1–2 drop/second into acid‐washed HPLC vials. The eluate was evaporated to dryness under a flow of nitrogen at room temperature. The standards and samples were protected from direct light during all procedures (Kamkar et al.,
