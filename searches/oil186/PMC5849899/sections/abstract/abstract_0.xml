 <p>Antifungal activity of essential oils (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span>s) of 
  <span class="italic">Zataria multiflora</span> (thyme) and 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> (clove) against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span> growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production was studied in potato dextrose agar (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PDA</span>) and potato dextrose broth (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PDB</span>), as well as in Iranian white cheese as a food model. The results showed that the inhibitory potential of 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span>s in the 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PDB</span> medium is more than 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PDA</span> medium. Clove 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span> on 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PDB</span> medium prevented fungal growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production at 300 and 100 ppm, respectively. However, the thyme 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span> was not able to inhibit fungal growth completely and showed the strongest inhibition effect at 400 ppm. 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span>s also had more inhibitory activity in laboratory culture media than the food environments. 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span>s in all concentrations reduced aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production and fungal growth in cheese, but only the clove 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span> at 150 ppm was able to prevent the fungal growth and aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> production completely. Thyme 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span> reduced aflatoxin B
  <sub>1</sub> value to below detection threshold (2 ppb) at 10 μl. Our findings propose 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">EO</span>s as a natural inhibitor to control fungal contamination of foodstuffs such as Iranian white cheese.
