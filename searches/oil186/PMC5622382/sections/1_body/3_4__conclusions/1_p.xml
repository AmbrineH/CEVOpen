<p>This study has revealed the presence of five major chemotypes of sage (
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>) leaf essential oils, with several subtypes. Most sage oils belonged to the “typical”, α-thujone &gt; camphor &gt; 1,8-cineole, chemotype, but the essential oil compositions can vary widely and may have a profound effect on flavor and fragrance profiles as well as biological activities. It would be interesting to see if there exist differences in fragrance descriptions or in biological activities for the different chemotypes of sage essential oils.
