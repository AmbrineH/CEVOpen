<p>The leaf essential oil samples of 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> were analyzed by GC-MS using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD), operated in the electron impact mode with electron energy = 70 eV, a scan range of 40–400 amu, a scan rate of 3.99 scans/sec, and operated through an Agilent ChemStation data system. The GC column was an HP-5 ms fused silica capillary column with a (5% phenyl)-polydimethylsiloxane stationary phase, a film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm. The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 92.4 kPa and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The inlet temperature was 250 °C and the interface temperature was 280 °C. The GC oven temperature was programmed, 60 °C initial temperature, which was held for 5 min, temperature increased at a rate of 3 °C/min up to 280 °C. Solutions of essential oils (1% in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) were prepared and 1-μL injections were carried out using a splitless mode. Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [
