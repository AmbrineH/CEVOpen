<p>Although C1 (thujone/camphor) is the major chemotype of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, there are several other chemotypes and this should have a profound effect on the flavor and fragrance profile of the herb as well as any potential biological activities and medicinal uses. The overall fragrance description and the fragrance descriptions of the components of C1c type sage oils have been reported [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A perusal of the literature has not revealed any flavor or fragrance descriptions of the other sage oil chemotypes, however. Similarly, most bioactivity studies have been carried out on C1 chemotype sage oils. Savalev and co-workers have examined the butyryl- and acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitory activities of type C2a sage oils [
 <xref rid="B56-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; Lima and co-workers examined the cytotoxicity of a C2b type sage oil on rat hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B43-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; and Abu-Darwish and co-workers carried out antifungal studies with chemotype C4b sage oils [
 <xref rid="B14-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, no C1c type sage oils were included in these studies for comparison. Russo and co-workers examined the cytotoxic activities on three different tumor cell lines of two different chemotypes of sage oil, C1b and C5 chemotypes, but there were no correlations between sage oil chemical compositions and cytotoxicities [
