<p>Jug-Dujaković and co-workers examined the essential oil compositions of 25 indigenous populations of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> growing in the Dalmatian region of Croatia [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These workers carried out a hierarchical cluster analysis based on eight principal components (α-thujone, camphor, β-thujone, 1,8-cineole, β-pinene, camphene, borneol, and bornyl acetate), and were able to delineate three chemotypes of Dalmatian sage from Dalmatia: (A) α-thujone &gt; camphor &gt; 1,8-cineole &gt; β-thujone; (B) β-thujone &gt; α-thujone &gt; camphor ≈ 1,8-cineole; and (C) camphor &gt; α-thujone &gt; 1,8-cineole &gt; camphene ≈ borneol.
