<p>The most populated chemotype, C1, is an α-thujone/camphor chemotype and represents “typical” sage oil. The C1 cluster can be further subdivided (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00047-f002">Figure 2</xref>) into three distinct subgroups: C1a, camphor &gt; α-thujone &gt; β-pinene, which is equivalent to group 1 described by Tucker and Maciarello [
 <xref rid="B61-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], type C described by Jug-Dujaković et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and type IIb described by Lakušić and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; C1b, α-thujone ≈ camphor &gt; sclareol; and C1c, α-thujone &gt; camphor &gt; 1,8-cineole, which is equivalent to Tucker and Maciarello type 5 [
 <xref rid="B61-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], Jug-Dujaković et al. type A [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and Lakušić et al. type IIa [
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Chemotype C1c averages 28.0% α-thujone, 18.6% camphor, 10.5% 1,8-cineole, and 6.4% β-thujone, and represents the “best overall” composition of sage oil [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is noteworthy that type C1c is also represented by samples from the Dalmatian region of the Balkan Peninsula [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as well as commercial samples from Europe [
 <xref rid="B52-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and Albania, Mexico, and California from this study.
