 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sage (also known as garden sage, common sage, or culinary sage; 
  <span class="italic">Salvia officinalis</span> L., Lamiaceae) is a popular culinary and medicinal herb, native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but now cultivated worldwide. The plant has been used since ancient times for various human ailments. For example, in England, a decoction of sage leaves with wine was gargled to relieve toothache [

  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00047">2</a>]; the Cherokee Native Americans have used an infusion of the plant to treat colds and coughs, and as an antidiarrheal [

Commercial sage oil is generally characterized by thujones, with α-thujone usually predominating (18–43%) over β-thujone (3–8.5%), camphor (4.5–24.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.5–13%), α-humulene (0–12%), α-pinene (1–6.5%), camphene (1.5–7%), and bornyl acetate (2.5% maximum) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caution should be exercised in using sage essential oil. The oil contains large concentrations of α-thujone, which was thought to have been the hallucinogenic constituent of absinthe and the cause of absinthism. This, however, has been shown to be false [
  <a rid="B4-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-medicines-04-00047">4</a>]. Nevertheless, high doses of α-thujone causes convulsions by way of blocking γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels [

  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00047">9</a>]. Use of the herb itself is safe, however; it has been estimated that between 2 and 20 cups of sage tea would be required to reach the acceptable daily intake of thujone [

  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00047">11</a>]. α-Thujone has also been shown to reduce 5-HT
  <sub>3</sub> (ligand-gated ion channel serotonin) receptor activity [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00047" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00047">12</a>]. In this work, we have characterized two commercial sage essential oils as well as an essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of sage leaves grown in Mexico. In addition, a cluster analysis has been carried out to place the different chemotypes of sage oil in perspective.
