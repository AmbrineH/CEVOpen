 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The micro-emultocrit technique (MET) was first described by Macedo, Fernandes,[
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>] as an appropriate tool to evaluate and predict influences provided by small variations in the HLB values on emulsions. Thus, besides the simplicity, the ability to use a low amount of sample and with a short time of execution made this method an excellent tool to evaluate and/or optimize formulation parameters and their respective HLB values. The results of the short term stability study are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figure 4</a>. Regarding the creaming index data, the lowest CI rates were observed at time D1 for the formulations F3, F4, F5 and F6, where CI were 3.62%, 3.43%, 3.47%, and 3.51%, respectively. After 30 days (D30), lower CI were observed for F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5 (2.42%, 1.88%; 1.81%; 1.83% and 1.78%, respectively). And, on the last day of analysis (D90), the CI for F1, F2, F3 and F4 were 2.43%, 1.75%; 2.9%, and 1.73% respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By comparing the values obtained by the micro-emultocrit technique it became apparent that the results for formulations containing PaEO between the days (D1, D30 and D90) showed a statistically significant difference between the formulations, when 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0,05.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Franzol and Rezende,[
  <a rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref62">62</a>] to obtain emulsions there is a need to introduce energy in the emulsified systems, presenting very agitated droplets in the first days. This is because the emulsified system has free energy in the first days of storage which can lead to altered results. Thus, the study was conducted using the micro-emultocrit technique on three different days, where it was observed that the day D1 showed instability in relation to D30 and D90, possibly because free energy still existed in the system. The formulations on D30 and D90 had greater stability, because free energy had already dissipated promoting a kinetic stabilization. It was noted that F2 is the most stable formulation due to lower IC, based on the static data.
