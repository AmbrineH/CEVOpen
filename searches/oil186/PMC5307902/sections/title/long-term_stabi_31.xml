 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PaOE containing emulsions were evaluated for a period of 180 days to assess the stability of the systems. In spite of the various HLB values of the formulations, the process of emulsification by phase inversion was able to produce stable emulsions with a milky aspect and which remained stable on the day of preparation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the emulsions showed different behavior to creaming during the storage time, according to the concentration of the emulsifying agent used. The cream index (CI) reflects the emulsion stability by measuring the height of the separated cream layer with time, but also indirectly demonstrates the process of separation of droplets in the creaming.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studies by Guerra-Rosas, Morales-Castro,[
  <a rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref53">53</a>] showed that after the emulsification, the droplets migrate to the surface of the sample (coalescence) after a few hours of emulsification, forming a layer of cream. Consequently, there is a decrease of the CI over storage time in which the emulsion is preparing for phase separation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emulsions at room temperature showed significant creaming formation in the first 24 h (D1) [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">Table 4</a>]. As the storage period increases, the emulsions showed a gradual increase in the creaming index (CI). The emulsions F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F11 showed a phase separation process after 120 days. Therefore, phase separation of the emulsion F12 and F13 in D180 demonstrated instability of these formulations. The F14 formulation showed a high CI in D180. On the other hand, there was no phase separation of emulsions for F1, F2, F3, and F4. However, among these emulsions, the F1 had the lowest rate of creaming [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When comparing the formulations at ambient temperature with 5°C, the temperature influences on stability were observed.[
  <a rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref54">54</a>] According to studies conducted by Hosseini, Jafari[
  <a rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref55">55</a>] and Leal, Sousa,[
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">29</a>] high temperatures promote a high frequency of collisions of the droplets, speeding up physical-chemical and chemical reactions, favoring the coalescence process resulting in a lower stability of the emulsions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formulations stored at 5°C presented a better stability when compared to the formulations stored at room temperature [
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">Table 5</a>].[
  <a rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref56">56</a>] There was an increase of IC with increasing storage time in the formulations. However, the emulsions F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5 showed the least CI, and the formulation F2 had the lowest CI, proving to be the most stable at the temperature 5ºC [
