 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A solution of ethanol in water 90% (v/v) was used to determine the essential oil solubility. To maintain the constant volume of essential oil (0.5 ml), an alcoholic solution was added in equal quantities to the essential oil until the complete solubilization of the essential oil was achieved.[
