 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantitative analysis plays an important role in the pharmaceutical field throughout the production process from quality control to finished product to achieve a quality standard required for a drug.[
  <a rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref63">63</a>] This approach becomes more critical and challenging when complex materials such as biological matrix are used as active ingredients. Regarding the essential oils in which the chemical complexity is followed by adverse physico-chemical properties, the quantitative evaluation is used both as an indication of stability and measurement of technological success. According to Lukhoba, Simmonds,[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] and Ruzsíková, Součková,[
  <a rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref64">64</a>] the drug quantitative analysis facilitates development of medicines.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical control of the emulsions was performed by the quantitative analysis of the Carvacrol, which is the major constituent of the PaEO. The contents of the chemical marker were assayed by GC, and the PaEO contents in the emulsions were evaluated, also indicating the emulsions stability. The contents of the chemical marker for each formulation were evaluated after 7 and 180 days of storage at room temperature [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 5</a>]. The quantification of Carvacrol in the emulsions was carried out only at room temperature because volume loss was observed, unlike with emulsions, which are stored at 5°C. The proportions of PaEO entrapped in emulsified systems were estimated from the total volume of essential oil added to each formulation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 7 days, the percentages of carvacrol present in the emulsions were ranged from 25.6% to 100.00%. Maximum carvacrol content was observed in the formulations F2 [97.38%] and F10 [100.00%]. Regarding the content of carvacrol after 180 days, an important decrease was observed. The content reduction ranged from 50.3% to 89.6%, for formulations F8 and F11, respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The F1, F2, F3, and F4 emulsions, which had the highest values of HLB, showed the highest carvacrol content after 180 days. Thus, this showed that the most stable formulations are those which showed higher HLB values and the highest levels of carvacrol. According to studies by Viana, Bohrer,[
  <a rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref65">65</a>] the HLB system is based on surfactants, which are amphiphilic compounds whose molecules are in the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups. The higher HLB values are assigned to more hydrophilic surfactants in which the hydrophilic groups are more suitable for the production of O/W emulsions. In fact, the essential oil properties presented a volatility which could explain the difficulty of oil entrapment and retention.
