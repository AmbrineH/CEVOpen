 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils, obtained from different plant species, have been extensively studied as bioactive products for therapeutic purposes in the pharmaceutical industry due to their antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and repellent properties.[

  <a rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref47">47</a>] Furthermore, essential oils have showed lower toxicity and resistance in comparison to synthetic products.[
  <a rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref48">48</a>] On the other hand, the chemical complexity and variability of the herbal matrix, in addition to other deleterious properties such as susceptibility to degradation, volatility and, water insolubility, makes the technological development of pharmaceutical systems to improve the oil characteristics fundamental, in order to assure the biological properties and its effectiveness.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emulsions can improve stability and the biopharmaceutical profile of essential oils, as well as provide protection against oxidation, and allow for the introduction of technological adjuvants in a formulation.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These systems are defined as heterogeneous mixtures that consist of droplets of a liquid dispersed in a second continuous immiscible liquid phase forming a thermodynamically unstable system. To produce stable emulsions, surfactants are added to the system.[

  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">30</a>] The selection of the surfactant used is fundamental in the production of formulations with a good stability. The first step in the selection of the correct surfactants for the emulsion system is the identification of the HLB value of the oil fraction. The concept of the hydrophile-lipophile balance [HLB] was first described by Griffin[
  <a rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref51">51</a>] and is used as a semi-empirical scale for selecting surfactants to form stable emulsions. A well established methodology to identify the HLB of essential oils is the study of long-term stability of a bath of emulsions produced with the essential oil, and ranging the HLB value of the surfactants.[
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] The HLB value of the more stable emulsion is considered the HLB of the essential oil.
