  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The macroscopic aspect, CI, pH, and conductivity were evaluated on storage days 1, 3, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. The samples were stored at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) and at a low temperature (5 ± 1°C). These parameters enabled the evaluation of the emulsion system stability and therefore the prediction of the chemical stability of the components of the emulsion.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The short-term stability was evaluated by the micro-emultocrit technique (MET).[
   <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">32</a>] The formulations were stored in closed containers at room temperature and were not homogenized before testing. The heparin-free capillary tubes were filled to 75% with each formulation and placed in a micro-centrifuge (Quimis, model Q10.500, São Paulo, Brazil) at 10,500 rpm for 10 min. The evaluation was realized at room temperature on the storage days 1 (D1), 30 (D30) and 90 (D90). After the centrifugation cycle, the IC calculations were performed in accordance with (equation 2). The short-term stability realized by the micro-emultocrit technique revealed not only, that the emulsion stability was highly influenced by the gravity acceleration, but also managed to predict influences provided in the HLB values. The Stability measurements were made in triplicate for each of the three days.
