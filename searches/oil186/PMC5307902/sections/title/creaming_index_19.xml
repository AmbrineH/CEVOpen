 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The creaming rate was determined experimentally by the measurement of the creaming index (CI) from Eq.2. The CI values were obtained from the ratio between the total height of cream layer (CC) and the total height of emulsion layer (CT). CC and CT were measured directly into a storage glass flask with the help of a graduate scale.</p>
