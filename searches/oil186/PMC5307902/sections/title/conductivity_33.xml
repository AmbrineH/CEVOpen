 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Masmoudi, Le Dr√©au,[
  <a rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref58">58</a>] modifications could be observed to the conductivity values of the emulsions before seeing the instabilities of the systems. Studies by Bernardi, Pereira[
  <a rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref59">59</a>] observed modifications to the conductivity values of the emulsions before seeing the instabilities of the systems. The studies by Abdullah, Abdulkarim[
  <a rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref60">60</a>] and Mahmood and Akhtar[
  <a rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref61">61</a>] attributed the continuous increase of conductivity values to the process of coalescence of the internal phase. This was followed by a reduction, which may be attributed to phase separation. Nevertheless, F1 and F2 presented an increase in conductivity during all the experiment, and they were the only formulations that did not have a decrease in conductivity during the period of 180 days [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 3</a>]. Furthermore, F2 showed a lower value in conductivity than F1 and a better stability.
