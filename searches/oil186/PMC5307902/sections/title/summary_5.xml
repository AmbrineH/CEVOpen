    <p>The essential oil from leaves of 
     <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> was extracted by steam distillation and characterized.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>The emulsions containing essential oil were produced and the stability was performed in the short and long term.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>The critical hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the essential oil was 15.7 and was achieved by the combination of surfactants (Tween 80
     <span class="sup">®</span> and Span 20
     <span class="sup">®</span>).
