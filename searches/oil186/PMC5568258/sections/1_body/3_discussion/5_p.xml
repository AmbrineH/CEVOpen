<p id="Par43">In the current study, we observed 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> essential oil’s bactericidal action for all of the bacteria tested: Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>). The MIC and MBC data show higher antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. This is probably due to the greater complexity of the Gram-negative cell wall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which interferes with any direct action on the pathogen metabolism. Among the five strains tested, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 0.11 mg/mL) was found to be the most sensitive to 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> essential oil, showing even higher sensitivity than the other Gram positive bacteria, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 0.22 mg/mL). For the three Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> essential oil more strongly inhibited 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> (MIC = 0.44 mg/mL) compared to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 0.88 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 7.0 mg/mL). 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was the least sensitive to the essential oil, possibly due to the ability of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to produce biofilm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], which further complicates direct action of the aromatic oil component against the bacterial cell.
