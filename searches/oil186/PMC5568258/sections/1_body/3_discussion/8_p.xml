<p id="Par46">For HeLa cells, 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> oil shows increasing cytotoxicity over longer exposure times, indicating possible anticancer activity. For the Vero E6 strain, 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> oil cytotoxicity decreased with increasing exposure time, i.e., the greater the exposure time the lower the cytotoxic activity, and the higher the cell viability. This effect was also observed for the HEK-293 line, where cell viability was superior to both Vero strain readings. For the Vero E6 and HEK-293 strains, these results confirm that the essential oil is potentially non-cytotoxic to normal human and mammalian cells in general.
