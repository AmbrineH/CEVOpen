<p id="Par42">Some papers support the hypothesis that α-pinene is responsible for the antimicrobial action reported in the present study. In work by Leite et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], this terpene was isolated and showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Other studies that identified α-pinene as a major constituent in the composition of essential oils from plants other than 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> also observed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [
