<p id="Par41">This study presents α-pinene (87.85%) as the major constituent in 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> leaf essential oil. However, it is not known whether α-pinene is chiefly responsible for the bactericidal action of the oil, or if one of the other terpenes promotes such action, since in other studies, the essential oils from 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> leaves have shown different terpene proportions from our results [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is important to consider differences in the chemical composition of essential oils extracted from plants of the same species. These differences arise from factors such as geographic variation, climate, soil, planting modes, fertilizers used, time of collection, and the post collection processing and extraction techniques employed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is believed that the 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> essential oil’s antibacterial activity is likely conferred by terpenes, since they are abundant in the composition.
