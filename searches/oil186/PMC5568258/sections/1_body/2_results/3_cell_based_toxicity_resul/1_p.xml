<p id="Par36">In the cell viability assay for the Vero E6 line, it was shown in the first reading after 24 h of exposure that there was toxic activity at concentrations of 4.4 mg/mL and 2.2 mg/mL of oil, inducing cell death at 93.91% and 2.32%, respectively. However, the lower oil concentrations of 1.1 mg/ml, 0.55 mg/ml, and 0.275 mg/ml did not affect the viability of the cells. In the second reading, after 48 h of exposure, cell toxicity occurred only at the highest concentration, 4.4 mg/mL, which killed 94.26% of cells. For the other concentrations of 2.2 mg/mL, 1.1 mg/mL, 0.55 mg/mL and 0.275 mg/mL, cell viability was not affected by the oil. However, statistically, there was no significant difference between the cellular viability values at 24 h and 48 h (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.7972 (
