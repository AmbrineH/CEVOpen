<p id="Par37">After treating HeLa strain for 24 h, we observed that the largest 
 <italic>M. urundeuva</italic> oil concentrations had a greater inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation. Accordingly, the oil showed inhibitions from 11% to 21% between the doses of 1.1 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL. After treatment for 48 h, concentrations of 2.2 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL showed a greater inhibition of proliferation – 32.4% and 44.3%, respectively. This suggests that, although there was no statistically significant difference between the viabilities observed after 24 h and 48 h (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.8085; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), the oil had notable antitumor activity after 24 h that intensified over longer exposure times, as shown in the 48 h reading, which slightly decreased cell viability at all concentrations (Fig.
