<p id="Par27">Essential oils were analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The same chromatographic conditions were used for GC-MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010-Plus) and GC-FID (GC-20100FI) analysis. The oil was analyzed using an RTx-5 infused-silica capillary column (30 m × 0,25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness); the splitless injection used an injector temperature of 220 °C, and the column was programmed to run from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min and held isothermal for 7 min. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and helium and hydrogen (H
 <sub>2</sub>) were used as the gas carriers for the GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, respectively. The interface temperature of the GC-MS was 240 °C and mass spectra were recorded from 30 to 450

Individual components were identified by comparing the acquired mass spectrum with reference data using the Wiley L-Built library and by comparing their retention indices with a commercially available database (NIST 2.0) and the indices described by [
