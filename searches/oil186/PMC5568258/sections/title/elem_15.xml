Bacterial growth occurred in all assays for both the negative control (NC) and for the growth control (GC), confirming the non-bacterial inhibition of Tween 80 and the viability of the strains used and demonstrating the antibacterial effect of

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the cell viability assay for the Vero E6 line, it was shown in the first reading after 24 h of exposure that there was toxic activity at concentrations of 4.4 mg/mL and 2.2 mg/mL of oil, inducing cell death at 93.91% and 2.32%, respectively. However, the lower oil concentrations of 1.1 mg/ml, 0.55 mg/ml, and 0.275 mg/ml did not affect the viability of the cells. In the second reading, after 48 h of exposure, cell toxicity occurred only at the highest concentration, 4.4 mg/mL, which killed 94.26% of cells. For the other concentrations of 2.2 mg/mL, 1.1 mg/mL, 0.55 mg/mL and 0.275 mg/mL, cell viability was not affected by the oil. However, statistically, there was no significant difference between the cellular viability values at 24 h and 48 h (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.7972 (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), indicating that the oil only inhibits Vero E6 cells at the highest concentration, 4.4 mg/mL. The results are shown in Fig.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After treating HeLa strain for 24 h, we observed that the largest 
   <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> oil concentrations had a greater inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation. Accordingly, the oil showed inhibitions from 11% to 21% between the doses of 1.1 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL. After treatment for 48 h, concentrations of 2.2 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL showed a greater inhibition of proliferation – 32.4% and 44.3%, respectively. This suggests that, although there was no statistically significant difference between the viabilities observed after 24 h and 48 h (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.8085; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), the oil had notable antitumor activity after 24 h that intensified over longer exposure times, as shown in the 48 h reading, which slightly decreased cell viability at all concentrations (Fig.
