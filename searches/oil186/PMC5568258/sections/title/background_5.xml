 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the earliest times, medicinal plants have been widely used as natural drugs in the treatment, curing and prevention of disease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Among these are bacterial diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. While facing increasing bacterial resistance against routinely used traditional and synthetic antibiotics for the treatment of microbial diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], we find that research in plant-based natural products to elucidate new therapies from novel antibacterial agents has grown significantly [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Studies report that certain natural antibacterials, when given with standard antibiotics, are even more effective in synergy than the standard drug alone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. In the cells of resistant pathogens, these naturally occurring molecules supposedly reach different targets than the known antibiotics do.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among various natural substances with antimicrobial potential, essential oils have been highlighted. These generally consist of a mixture of natural volatile chemical compounds, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and their oxygenated derivatives [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Such compounds comprise the secondary metabolites of aromatic plants, which are considered to be natural remedies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] with antimicrobial activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. They may therefore be an alternative to overcome the increasing antibacterial resistance of pathogens. Essential oils are also being investigated by some researchers for their anti-cancer potential [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the aromatic plants whose essential oils are extracted, a promising candidate is an endemic savanna tree, widely distributed in Brazil, that belongs to the family Anacardiaceae: 
  <span class="italic">Myracrodruon urundeuva</span> (Aroeira of the backwoods) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. This plant has been noted for its antimicrobial potential, which was evidenced when molecules obtained from crude extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> were found to have antibacterial and antifungal properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Additionally, other studies indicate antiparasitic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], encouraging research on the possible uses for this substance in herbal medicine.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. urundeuva</span> comprises a blend of terpenes which have not yet been fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. urundeuva,</span> which is typically grown in northeastern Brazil.
