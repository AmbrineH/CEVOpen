<p>The effects of the RC extract and the essential oil were tested on guinea pig urinary bladder strips as well. RC crude extract evoked concentration-dependent contraction at 20 and 200 μg/ml (

 </bold> and

 </bold> for 200 μg/ml). The solvent of the extract had no contractile effect on the bladder (
