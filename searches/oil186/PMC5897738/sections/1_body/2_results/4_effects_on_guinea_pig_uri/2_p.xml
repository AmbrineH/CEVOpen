<p>To study the relaxant effect of the crude extract, the bladder strips were sub-maximally pre-contracted with histamine (1–3 μM). Atropine and tetrodotoxin were present in the bathing fluid. Since excitatory purinergic mechanisms are present in the bladder, α,β-methylene ATP desensitization (10 + 10 μM for 10 min each) was also performed. RC crude extract had no effect at a concentration of 20 μg/ml, whereas a concentration of 200 μg/ml induced 58.3 ± 4.6% relaxation (
 <italic>N</italic> = 7 and 8, respectively). The solvent itself (1 μl/ml DMSO) exerted no effect.
