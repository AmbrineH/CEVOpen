<p class="p">Our experiments revealed the smooth muscle relaxing activity of RC extract, fractions and essential oil in this experimental setting. On histamine-precontracted preparations (treated with 0.5 μM histamine for 15 min, in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin, both 0.5 μM), concentration-dependent relaxation was observed in response to treatment with RC crude extract (60–200 μg/ml) (

 </bold>). The highest concentration tested induced full relaxation. The relaxation detected with the 20 μg/ml test sample did not exceed the changes evoked by the solvent itself (1 μl/ml DMSO; see below). In several cases the relaxation was preceded by a little contraction. The relaxation induced by the 60 μg/ml extract was not significantly altered by the adrenergic β-receptor antagonist propranolol (1 μM; 51.3 ± 7.8% relaxation,
