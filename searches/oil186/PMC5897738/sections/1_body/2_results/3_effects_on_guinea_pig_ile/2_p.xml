<p>The 60 μg/ml concentration of the extract was used for pharmacological analysis. Both atropine (0.5 μM), an antagonist of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors and tetrodotoxin (0.5 μM), an inhibitor of voltage-sensitive Na
 <sup>+</sup> channels (hence, of neuronal axonal conduction) inhibited the contractile effect of RC crude extract. In contrast, the purinoceptor antagonist PPADS (50 μM) or a combination of serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists methysergide (0.3 μM), SB204070 (1 μM) and Y25130 (1 μM) failed to influence the contractile effect of the extract (
