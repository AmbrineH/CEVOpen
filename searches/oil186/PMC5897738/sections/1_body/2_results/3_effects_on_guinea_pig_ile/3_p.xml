<p>The functional blockade of capsaicin-sensitive neurons did not inhibit the contractile effect of the RC extract (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>) as compared to time-matched, solvent-treated controls (
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>
 </bold>). The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (3 μM) moderately but significantly inhibited the contraction in response to the RC extract.
