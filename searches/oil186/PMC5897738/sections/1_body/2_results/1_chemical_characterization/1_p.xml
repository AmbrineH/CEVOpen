<p>In the HPLC retention time range of 4–9 min, four characteristic peaks were detected in the crude RC extract and its fractions F40–F100. The corresponding components were isolated from the plant material and were identified as the flavonoids apigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, and luteolin by 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR experiments (see Supplementary Figures 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1–S6</xref>). These compounds were further used as reference standards to characterize the RC extracts. The identification of reference compounds in different extracts was based on matching the retention times and UV spectra. Retention times of luteolin, eupafolin, apigenin, and hispidulin were 4.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 8.5 min, respectively (
