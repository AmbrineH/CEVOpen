<p>In untreated circularly oriented human jejunal preparations the RC crude extract evoked transient contraction (43.4 ± 10% at 200 μg/ml, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 5), while the 20 μg/ml concentration sample had a negligible effect (2.8% contraction on 5 preparations). RC extract induced relaxation in PGF
 <sub>2α</sub>-precontracted preparations (in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). This effect reached 45% with 60 μg/ml concentration (
 <italic>N</italic> = 4), while a concentration of 200 μg/ml produced full relaxation (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6), where a relaxation to the pre-prostaglandin level was taken as 100%.
