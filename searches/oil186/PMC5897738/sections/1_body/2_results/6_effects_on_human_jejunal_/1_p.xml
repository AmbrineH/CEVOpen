<p>In untreated longitudinally oriented human jejunal preparations RC crude extract induced transient contraction amounting to 12.4 ± 3.5% and 30.5 ± 0.6% at 20 and 200 μg/ml concentrations, respectively (
 <italic>N</italic> = 8). Atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreated preparations were pre-contracted with PGF2α (1 or 2 μM). RC extract showed a concentration-dependent relaxant effect (25.8 ± 4.3% at 20 μg/ml, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 8; 68.5 ± 8.5% at 60 μg/ml, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 7; 50.8 ± 3.7% at 200 μg/ml, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 9). RC essential oil produced no contraction. A lasting relaxant effect was detected on pre-contracted preparations (in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). The relaxant effect reached 26.9 ± 5.2% at 1 μg/ml and 81.4 ± 8.2% at 10 μg/ml concentrations (
 <italic>N</italic> = 8 and 7, respectively).
