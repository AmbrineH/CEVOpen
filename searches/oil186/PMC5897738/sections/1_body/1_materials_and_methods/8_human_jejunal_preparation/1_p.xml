<p>Macroscopically intact segments of human jejunum, removed during the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer were used. Strips of either longitudinal or circular orientation were prepared (the mucosa and submucosa were removed) and fixed as described above, under a tension of 10 mN. Freeze-dried extracts of RC, as well as the essential oil of the plant were mixed in and further diluted with DMSO. The amounts of DMSO administered to the jejunum preparations are indicated in the Section “Results”.</p>
