<p>Results of the pharmacological experiments are given as mean ± SEM, with 
 <italic>N</italic> denoting the number of preparations used for testing efficacy. At most 2 preparations from the same animal were used for each type of experiment. Results are provided in relative values, where 100% contraction means maximal spasm of the preparations from the basal tone and, in pre-contracted preparations, 100% relaxation means relaxation of the preparation to the level before adding the precontracting agent. The Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test was used for the comparisons of two independent groups, more than two independent samples were compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test, and two dependent samples were compared by the Wilcoxon test. The statistical program GraphPad Prism 5 was used throughout. A probability of 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or less indicated statistical significance.
