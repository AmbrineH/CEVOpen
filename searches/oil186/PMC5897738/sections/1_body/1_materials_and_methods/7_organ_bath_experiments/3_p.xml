<p class="p">In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of the materials was tested. For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderate concentration of histamine (0.5 Î¼M, added for 15 min). In preliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used. In the bulk of the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonal conduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> channels) was added prior to the histamine administration. This was done to avoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of the material to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clear situation.
