<p>The GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (FID), using a 30 m × 0.35 mm × 0.25 μm HP-5 fused silica capillary column. The temperature program ranged from 60°C to 210°C at 3°C min
 <sup>-1</sup>, and from 210°C to 250°C (2 min hold) at 5°C min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The detector and injector temperature was set to 250°C and the carrier gas was N
 <sub>2</sub>, with split sample introduction. Quantities of the individual components of the essential oil were expressed as the percent of the peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FID analysis.
