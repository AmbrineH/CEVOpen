<p>Identification of the compounds was based on comparisons with published MS data (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2007</xref>) and with a computer library search (the database was delivered together with the instrument) and also by comparing their retention indices with literature values (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2007</xref>). Retention indices were calculated against C8â€“C32 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kovats, 1965</xref>). A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injected in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by using the same temperature program that was used for analyzing the essential oil.
