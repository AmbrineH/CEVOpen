<p>The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQ ion trap bench-top mass spectrometer. All conditions were as above except that the carrier gas was He at a linear velocity of 31.9 cm s
 <sup>-1</sup> and the capillary column was DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The positive ion electron ionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, and the mass range of 40–400 amu.
