<p class="p">From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four marker compounds (used as reference standards in further experiments) were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography (SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as stationary phase), gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzed by NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 500 MHz (
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H) or 125 MHz (
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C).
