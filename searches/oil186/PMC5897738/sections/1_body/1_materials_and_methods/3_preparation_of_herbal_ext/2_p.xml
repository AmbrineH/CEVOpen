<p>From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four marker compounds (used as reference standards in further experiments) were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography (SiO
 <sub>2</sub> as stationary phase), gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO
 <sub>2</sub>). The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzed by NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 500 MHz (
 <sup>1</sup>H) or 125 MHz (
 <sup>13</sup>C).
