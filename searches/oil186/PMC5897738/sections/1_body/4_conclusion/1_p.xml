<p>Our results support the overall smooth muscle relaxant effect of a hydroethanolic RC extract and of the essential oil of RC. The predominant effect of the extract, its fractions and flavonoids is relaxation, being more sustained than the transient contraction observed in some cases. This activity is in correlation with the flavonoid content of the extract. Since the components of the essential oil are partly extracted with alcohols, the constituents of the oil also contribute to the overall effect of the hydroethanolic RC extract. The extract used in our experiments was prepared in accordance with the European Medicines Agency monograph for this plant, therefore our study contributes to the body of evidence relating the traditional use of this plant.</p>
