<p>Roman chamomile extract was effective in human jejunal preparations as well. Both an excitatory and a tetrodotoxin- and atropine-resistant relaxing effect were demonstrated, again, the smooth muscle relaxant one being more sustained than the excitatory one. Preliminary experiments have shown that this early contraction is reduced by atropine. Due to limited access to human tissue, no further analysis of these responses could be performed.</p>
