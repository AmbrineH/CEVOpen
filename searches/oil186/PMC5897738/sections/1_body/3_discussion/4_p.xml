<p class="p">Following the transient and mild-to-moderate stimulant effect, the RC crude extract exhibited a sustained relaxant effect on the guinea pig ileum in the presence of tetrodotoxin and atropine, and preliminary experiments indicated a similar relaxant effect also in the absence of atropine and tetrodotoxin. Yet, atropine and tetrodotoxin were included into these experiments for creating a methodologically clear situation, where an initial, neuronally mediated excitatory action would hardly interfere with the relaxant one. The concentrations of the extract causing relaxation were roughly the same as those causing contraction. Based on these data we propose that the site of action for the relaxant effect of RC is on the smooth muscle itself. Neither the adrenergic Î²-receptor antagonist propranolol nor the NO synthase inhibitor N

In fact, a direct relaxant effect of the extract was demonstrated on all gastrointestinal preparations tested, including human and rat gastrointestinal preparations, as well as in guinea pig bladder. In preparations with high intrinsic tone (rat ileum and rat colon), relaxant activity was practically the only response to be seen.
