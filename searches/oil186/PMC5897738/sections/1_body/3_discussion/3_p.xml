<p class="p">Pharmacological experiments were carried out with the hydroethanolic extract, its fractions (F20, F40, F60, F80, and F100), four flavonoids (apigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, and luteolin) and the essential oil of the plant on different smooth muscles 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>. The hydroethanolic extract of RC has both stimulatory and relaxant effects on guinea pig ileum. The moderate, transient stimulatory activity results from the activation of cholinergic neurons, as confirmed by its inhibition by tetrodotoxin (an inhibitor of neuronal voltage-sensitive Na

Although capsaicin, a stimulant of a certain class of sensory receptors (through which it evokes a “local efferent” response) shows a similar cholinergic, neurogenic effect in guinea pig small intestine preparations (see 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barthó et al., 2004</xref> for review), a functional blockade of capsaicin-sensitive nerve endings by capsaicin pretreatment failed to inhibit the contractile action of RC extract. The contractile action of RC extract was moderately, yet significantly reduced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, which may indicate a modulatory role of endogenous prostanoids. Other pharmacological inhibitors tested had no contraction-reducing effect, therefore it is proposed that neither endogenous serotonin, nor PPADS-sensitive purinergic mechanisms play a role in the excitatory action of RC extract. It should be noted that both serotonin and ATP or the P
