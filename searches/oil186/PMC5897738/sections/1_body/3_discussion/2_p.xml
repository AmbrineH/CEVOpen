<p class="p">The phytochemical analysis of the extract revealed the presence of flavonoids in the plant, four of which (apigenin, luteolin, eupafolin, and hispidulin) were isolated and identified. The hydroethanolic extract was fractionated on polyamide to gain fractions with different flavonoid content in order to examine the role of these compounds in the effect on smooth muscles. The flavonoid content of the extract and fractions was analyzed by HPLC. The flavonoid content of the extract was fractionated successfully, fractions F80, F100 (and to some extent F60) containing higher amounts of flavonoids than the crude extracts. The flavonoid pattern of fractions also differed. The essential oil analyzed by us belongs to the chemotype characterized by the predominance of methallyl angelate.</p>
