 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organ bath arrangement. The preparations were suspended in Krebs–Henseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37°C, and aerated with a mixture of 95% O
  <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The solution contained 119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO
  <sub>3,</sub> 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl
  <sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM KH
  <sub>2</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub>, and 11 mM glucose (pH = 7.4). Movements of the preparations were recorded with isotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus, March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personal computer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The guinea pig ileum is a preparation of a low spontaneous tone. In part of the experiments the effects of RC extract, its fractions, essential oil, or flavonoids were studied at basal tone. All experiments commenced with determining the maximal longitudinal spasm by adding histamine (10 μM) to the organ bath for 2 min. This response served as reference for determining the relative amplitude of any contractile effect that the samples to be tested might have had.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of the materials was tested. For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderate concentration of histamine (0.5 μM, added for 15 min). In preliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used. In the bulk of the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonal conduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> channels) was added prior to the histamine administration. This was done to avoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of the material to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clear situation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All experiments commenced after an equilibration period of 45 min. Relaxant effects were studied on pre-contracted preparations (see below). Maximal spasm of the tissue was evoked to serve as a basis for the comparisons to evaluate the responses obtained by our test materials. The materials examined were administered in a single concentration (i.e., in a non-cumulative manner).</p>
