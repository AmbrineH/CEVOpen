 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guinea pigs (short-haired, colored, 350–450 g) or Wistar rats (220–300 g) of either sex were killed by a blow to the head and exsanguination. Three centimeter segments of the ileum or distal colon were placed into the organ bath in a vertical position, under a constant tension of 7 mN. Longitudinal strip preparations (approximately 2–3 cm in length) of guinea pig urinary bladder or rat gastric fundus were fixed under a tension of 5 mN.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out in accordance with University guidelines. The protocol was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee, University of Pécs (registration number, BA02/2000-1/2012) with the understanding that isolated organ studies after stunning the animal cannot be regarded as animal experiments.</p>
