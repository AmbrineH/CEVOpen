 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the pharmacological experiments, RC crude extract was prepared according to the description of the European Medicines Agency monograph (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">EMA-HMPC, 2012</a>). Ten grams of plant material was extracted with 70% EtOH (3 Ã— 100 ml) via ultrasonic bath, evaporated in vacuum and lyophilized (yield, 3.169%). Part of the RC crude extract was fractionated to gain RC extract fractions with different compositions for further experiments. Vacuum liquid chromatography on polyamide with elution by MeOH-H
  <sub>2</sub>O (20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) was used to gain fractions from the crude extract as follows: F20, F40, F60, F80, and F100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four marker compounds (used as reference standards in further experiments) were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography (SiO
  <sub>2</sub> as stationary phase), gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO
  <sub>2</sub>). The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzed by NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 500 MHz (
  <span class="sup">1</span>H) or 125 MHz (
  <span class="sup">13</span>C).
