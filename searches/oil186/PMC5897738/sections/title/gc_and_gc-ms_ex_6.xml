 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (FID), using a 30 m × 0.35 mm × 0.25 μm HP-5 fused silica capillary column. The temperature program ranged from 60°C to 210°C at 3°C min
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, and from 210°C to 250°C (2 min hold) at 5°C min
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. The detector and injector temperature was set to 250°C and the carrier gas was N
  <sub>2</sub>, with split sample introduction. Quantities of the individual components of the essential oil were expressed as the percent of the peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FID analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQ ion trap bench-top mass spectrometer. All conditions were as above except that the carrier gas was He at a linear velocity of 31.9 cm s
  <span class="sup">-1</span> and the capillary column was DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The positive ion electron ionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, and the mass range of 40–400 amu.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identification of the compounds was based on comparisons with published MS data (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Adams, 2007</a>) and with a computer library search (the database was delivered together with the instrument) and also by comparing their retention indices with literature values (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Adams, 2007</a>). Retention indices were calculated against C8–C32 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Kovats, 1965</a>). A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injected in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by using the same temperature program that was used for analyzing the essential oil.
