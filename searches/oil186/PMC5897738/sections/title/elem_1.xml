  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the pharmacological experiments, RC crude extract was prepared according to the description of the European Medicines Agency monograph (
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">EMA-HMPC, 2012</a>). Ten grams of plant material was extracted with 70% EtOH (3 × 100 ml) via ultrasonic bath, evaporated in vacuum and lyophilized (yield, 3.169%). Part of the RC crude extract was fractionated to gain RC extract fractions with different compositions for further experiments. Vacuum liquid chromatography on polyamide with elution by MeOH-H
   <sub>2</sub>O (20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) was used to gain fractions from the crude extract as follows: F20, F40, F60, F80, and F100.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four marker compounds (used as reference standards in further experiments) were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography (SiO
   <sub>2</sub> as stationary phase), gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO
   <sub>2</sub>). The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzed by NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 500 MHz (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (FID), using a 30 m × 0.35 mm × 0.25 μm HP-5 fused silica capillary column. The temperature program ranged from 60°C to 210°C at 3°C min
   <span class="sup">-1</span>, and from 210°C to 250°C (2 min hold) at 5°C min
   <span class="sup">-1</span>. The detector and injector temperature was set to 250°C and the carrier gas was N
   <sub>2</sub>, with split sample introduction. Quantities of the individual components of the essential oil were expressed as the percent of the peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FID analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQ ion trap bench-top mass spectrometer. All conditions were as above except that the carrier gas was He at a linear velocity of 31.9 cm s
   <span class="sup">-1</span> and the capillary column was DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The positive ion electron ionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, and the mass range of 40–400 amu.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identification of the compounds was based on comparisons with published MS data (

   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column (
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Kovats, 1965</a>). A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injected in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by using the same temperature program that was used for analyzing the essential oil.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guinea pigs (short-haired, colored, 350–450 g) or Wistar rats (220–300 g) of either sex were killed by a blow to the head and exsanguination. Three centimeter segments of the ileum or distal colon were placed into the organ bath in a vertical position, under a constant tension of 7 mN. Longitudinal strip preparations (approximately 2–3 cm in length) of guinea pig urinary bladder or rat gastric fundus were fixed under a tension of 5 mN.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out in accordance with University guidelines. The protocol was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee, University of Pécs (registration number, BA02/2000-1/2012) with the understanding that isolated organ studies after stunning the animal cannot be regarded as animal experiments.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organ Bath Experiments</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organ bath arrangement. The preparations were suspended in Krebs–Henseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37°C, and aerated with a mixture of 95% O
   <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. The solution contained 119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO
   <sub>3,</sub> 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO
   <sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM KH
   <sub>2</sub>PO
   <sub>4</sub>, and 11 mM glucose (pH = 7.4). Movements of the preparations were recorded with isotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus, March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personal computer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The guinea pig ileum is a preparation of a low spontaneous tone. In part of the experiments the effects of RC extract, its fractions, essential oil, or flavonoids were studied at basal tone. All experiments commenced with determining the maximal longitudinal spasm by adding histamine (10 μM) to the organ bath for 2 min. This response served as reference for determining the relative amplitude of any contractile effect that the samples to be tested might have had.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of the materials was tested. For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderate concentration of histamine (0.5 μM, added for 15 min). In preliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used. In the bulk of the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonal conduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na
   <span class="sup">+</span> channels) was added prior to the histamine administration. This was done to avoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of the material to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clear situation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All experiments commenced after an equilibration period of 45 min. Relaxant effects were studied on pre-contracted preparations (see below). Maximal spasm of the tissue was evoked to serve as a basis for the comparisons to evaluate the responses obtained by our test materials. The materials examined were administered in a single concentration (i.e., in a non-cumulative manner).</p>

Strips of either longitudinal or circular orientation were prepared (the mucosa and submucosa were removed) and fixed as described above, under a tension of 10 mN. Freeze-dried extracts of RC, as well as the essential oil of the plant were mixed in and further diluted with DMSO.

The Mann–Whitney 
   <span class="italic">U</span> test was used for the comparisons of two independent groups, more than two independent samples were compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test, and two dependent samples were compared by the Wilcoxon test.
