 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In untreated longitudinally oriented human jejunal preparations RC crude extract induced transient contraction amounting to 12.4 ± 3.5% and 30.5 ± 0.6% at 20 and 200 μg/ml concentrations, respectively (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8). Atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreated preparations were pre-contracted with PGF2α (1 or 2 μM). RC extract showed a concentration-dependent relaxant effect (25.8 ± 4.3% at 20 μg/ml, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8; 68.5 ± 8.5% at 60 μg/ml, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 7; 50.8 ± 3.7% at 200 μg/ml, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 9). RC essential oil produced no contraction. A lasting relaxant effect was detected on pre-contracted preparations (in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). The relaxant effect reached 26.9 ± 5.2% at 1 μg/ml and 81.4 ± 8.2% at 10 μg/ml concentrations (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8 and 7, respectively).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In untreated circularly oriented human jejunal preparations the RC crude extract evoked transient contraction (43.4 ± 10% at 200 μg/ml, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 5), while the 20 μg/ml concentration sample had a negligible effect (2.8% contraction on 5 preparations). RC extract induced relaxation in PGF
  <sub>2α</sub>-precontracted preparations (in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). This effect reached 45% with 60 μg/ml concentration (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4), while a concentration of 200 μg/ml produced full relaxation (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 6), where a relaxation to the pre-prostaglandin level was taken as 100%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The solvent itself (1 μl/ml DMSO) did not evoke either contraction or relaxation on this preparation (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4–6).
