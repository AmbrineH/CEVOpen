<p>Palm oil is a widely used ingredient in the food industry. It represents a significant source of saturated fatty acids, to which scientific evidence attributes negative health effects when used in excess, especially with regards to cardiovascular diseases. They are contained in palm oil added to food during industrial transformations, but they are also present in other foods that naturally contain them (milk and its derivatives, eggs, meat). The required intake of fatty acids is greatest during the first few years of life and decreases with age. However, the consumption of saturated fats in the western population is higher than the suggested amount for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, especially in children from 3 to 10 years of age. </p>
