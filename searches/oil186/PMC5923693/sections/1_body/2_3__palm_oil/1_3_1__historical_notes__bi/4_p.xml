<p>The metabolic effects of palm oil are influenced by the stereospecific distribution of the different fatty acids: palmitic acid is esterified in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol in 87% the cases and in the sn-3 position approximately 12% of the time, while the unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic) are predominantly esterified in the sn-2 position. This particular distribution affects their intestinal absorption: fatty acids that are esterified in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions are substrates of pancreatic lipase and are released in the intestinal tract. Fatty acids that are esterified in the sn-2 position are instead absorbed efficiently, similar to monoglycerides, after hydrolysis of the fatty acids at sn-1 and sn-3 [
