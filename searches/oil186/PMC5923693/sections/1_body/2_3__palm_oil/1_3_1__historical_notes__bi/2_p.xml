<p class="p">Palm oil is produced in tropical areas (Indonesia and Malaysia) and is derived from palm nuts. Its fat has a solid consistency at room temperature because of its elevated percentage of saturated fatty acids. The crude form is known as red palm oil for its coloration, which is derived from elevated concentrations of α- and β-carotenoids. In addition, the native form is rich in other antioxidants, including phytosterol and vitamin E (in the form of α-tocopherol and tocotrienol), which protect the cellular membrane and influence platelet aggregation, modulating the synthesis of thromboxane. Palm oil was also shown to be an excellent oil source for delivering vitamin A in countries with high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition [

It could be demonstrated that the stability of vitamin A is much higher in palm oil than in soybean oil, which makes palm oil a superior vehicle in fortification programs. In Europe, palm oil is used after refinement, which strips it of carotenoids and similar antioxidant compounds.
