<p class="p">The possible alternatives to palm oil use in the food industry are the following [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]: (1) saturated animal fats, solid or semi-solid at room temperature, such as butter, lard or tallow: they have been gradually eliminated or substituted for their unfavourable health consequences; (2) saturated vegetable fats, solid at room temperature, such as cocoa butter (the most expensive fat), coconut and palm kernel: their use is limited owing to their correlation with increased plasmatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels; (3) other vegetable oils, rich in mono/polyunsaturated fats and fluid at room temperature, from fruits (olives), seeds (sunflowers), legumes (peanuts, soy and especially rapeseed) and grains (corn, rice), despite their nutritional qualities, they are disadvantageous in industrial use, owing to both their costs and their limited shelf life.
