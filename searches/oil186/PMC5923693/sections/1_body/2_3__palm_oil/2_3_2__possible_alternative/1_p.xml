<p>Food lipids are made up of glycerides, principally triglycerides. Saturated fatty acids, especially myristic, palmitic and stearic acids, are the main compounds of mammal fats, while polyunsaturated fats are prevalent in fish oils [

Oleic acid prevails in olive oil and linoleic acid in corn, sunflower, grape seed, and safflower oil. Coconut and palm kernel oil have notably higher quantities of saturated fats than other oils. Linoleic and linolenic acids are found in abundance in soybean oil [
