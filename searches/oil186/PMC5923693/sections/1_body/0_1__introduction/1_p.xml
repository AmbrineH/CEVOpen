In particular, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) warned of the presence of substances formed during the production process, particularly when vegetable oils are refined at high temperatures (approximately 200 Â°C); the oils undergo partial hydrolysis of triglycerides with glycerol oxidation, leading to the formation of 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) and 2-mono-chloropropanediol (2-MCPD) [

The highest levels of these compounds were observed in palm oil, but the majority of refined vegetable oils contain considerably large quantities. Interestingly, while refined palm oil might contain high amounts of MCPD, raw palm oil might be considered healthy.
