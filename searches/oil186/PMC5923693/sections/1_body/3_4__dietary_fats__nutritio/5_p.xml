<p>When recommendations are compared with consumption, the actual Italian diet does not seem well balanced: smoked meats are eaten four times a week instead of twice a week; the amount of milk and yogurt is less than the recommended amount, while cheese consumption is higher than the desirable level. Moreover, legumes are almost absent. Therefore, it would be advisable to raise the intake of some products such as legumes, milk and yogurt in place of red meat, processed meat and cheeses. These changes could reduce the proportions of both total fat and saturated fat in the diet, decreasing them from 36 to 34% and from 11 to 10% of total calories, respectively, and would also diminish the level of salt consumption [
