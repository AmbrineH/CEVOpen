<p>In human milk, unsaturated fatty acids, including optimal percentages of essential fatty acids (Î±-linolenic and linoleic), are more prevalent than saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids, 50% of which consist of palmitic acid, account for 40% of total fat. Moreover, the particular stereospecific distribution of the different fatty acid triglycerides guarantees advantageous absorption. The differences between breast milk versus bovine milk are essentially qualitative; this is the reason why bovine milk is enriched with oleic acid and saturated lauric, myristic and palmitic acids [
