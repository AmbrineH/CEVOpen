 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, nutritional recommendations suggest that fat intake should not exceed 30–35% of total calories, with a maximum of 10% from saturated fats. US guidelines for 2015 to 2020 define the target range of fat intake as between 30 and 40% of calories in early childhood and between 25 and 35% starting at the age of 4 years, keeping the consumption of saturated fats under 10% of total calories [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2011, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ANSES) stated that there is no evidence of benefits associated with fat consumption of less than 35% of total calories; furthermore, the risk associated with a fat consumption of up to 40% of calories has not been clearly documented [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2012, the Nordic (Scandinavian) Nutrition Recommendation raised the maximum value of acceptable lipids intake to 40% and stated that a level of fat consumption below 20% of total energy would increase the risk of low absorption of other macro- and micronutrients. The limit for saturated fats remains unchanged at 10% [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2014, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition (SINU) compiled the fourth revision of the Dietary Reference Values (Livelli di Assunzione di Riferimento di Nutrienti ed energia per la popolazione italiana (LARN)) for the Italian population, defining an interval of 20–35% of calories from fat as a benchmark for maintaining one’s health without compromising the adequate absorption of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. In particular, fat intake should not exceed 35–40% of total calories in children up to 3 years old, with a maximum 10% of calories from saturated fat for all age ranges [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-15-00651">17</a>]. The INRAN-SCAI 2005–2006 survey, the most recent investigative nutritional sample of the Italian population, shows that both total and saturated fat intake are slightly above the recommended levels (36% for total fats, 11% for saturated fats) in children between 3 and 18 years old [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-15-00651">22</a>]. The intake of saturated fats from foods containing palm oil in Italy was recently better defined by the Italian Institute of Health, reworking data supplied by INRAN-SCAI. According to this document, the absorption of saturated fatty acids from palm oil in foods is higher during breastfeeding and weaning [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-15-00651">4</a>]. Moreover, bakery products represent significant sources of saturated fats from palm oil, especially in younger children. This document also shows that the primary nutritional source of saturated fats in Italy is dairy, followed by oils (mainly olive oil, whose consumption should not, however, be reduced), fresh and processed meats and, lastly, baked goods [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When recommendations are compared with consumption, the actual Italian diet does not seem well balanced: smoked meats are eaten four times a week instead of twice a week; the amount of milk and yogurt is less than the recommended amount, while cheese consumption is higher than the desirable level. Moreover, legumes are almost absent. Therefore, it would be advisable to raise the intake of some products such as legumes, milk and yogurt in place of red meat, processed meat and cheeses. These changes could reduce the proportions of both total fat and saturated fat in the diet, decreasing them from 36 to 34% and from 11 to 10% of total calories, respectively, and would also diminish the level of salt consumption [
