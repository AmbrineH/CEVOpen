 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The guidelines suggest that saturated fat consumption be restricted to 10% of total calories. However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the real benefits of such a limit for the reduction of cardiovascular disease onset; it is still controversial [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-15-00651">33</a>]. A meta-analysis that focused on the relationship between saturated fats and cardiovascular risk did not identify any significant link [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-15-00651">34</a>]. It must be considered that cardiovascular disease development is multifactorial; therefore, it is difficult to understand the real role played by palm oil alone. Further studies on this potential risk are needed before drawing any conclusion.
