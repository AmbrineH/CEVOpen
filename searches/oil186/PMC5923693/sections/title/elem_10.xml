  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.1. Effects on the Lipid Profile</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1970s, the Seven Countries Study showed that the dietary consumption of saturated fats correlated to total cholesterolaemia and LDL, known factors in coronary risk [
   <a rid="B29-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-15-00651">29</a>]. Subsequent studies confirmed the connection between the levels of saturated fats and an increase in LDL cholesterol. The fatty acid composition of palm oil consists of high amounts of palmitic but also oleic acid. Consumption of oleic acid is considered as healthy. On the contrary, due to the fact that palm oil contains palmitic acid, which is a saturated fatty acid, it was extrapolated that palm oil should give rise to elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. However, the effects of palm oil on the lipid profile emerge from a meta-analysis of studies on the replacement of palm oil with mono-unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fats, myristic and lauric acid or trans-unsaturated fats: such substitutions do not induce variations in the LDL/HDL ratio [
   <a rid="B31-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-15-00651">31</a>]. The effect of palm oil on LDL cholesterolaemia seems to be considerably less than expected [
   <a rid="B32-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-15-00651">32</a>]. In conclusion, palm oil does not exert significant effects on the lipid profiles of young people or of people with normal cholesterolaemia.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.2. Correlations with Cardiovascular Diseases</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The guidelines suggest that saturated fat consumption be restricted to 10% of total calories. However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the real benefits of such a limit for the reduction of cardiovascular disease onset; it is still controversial [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-15-00651">33</a>]. A meta-analysis that focused on the relationship between saturated fats and cardiovascular risk did not identify any significant link [
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-15-00651">34</a>]. It must be considered that cardiovascular disease development is multifactorial; therefore, it is difficult to understand the real role played by palm oil alone. Further studies on this potential risk are needed before drawing any conclusion.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.3. Oncological Risk</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implications of palm oil use for oncological risk are not well known. The consumption of palm oil does not have a relevant impact on the risk of cancer [
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-15-00651">35</a>]. Protective effects in relation with free radicals and anti-inflammatory action are also carried out by micronutrients, such as carotenoids, tocopherol, and tocotrienols, which are abundant in palm oil. Nevertheless, these compounds are absent in the palm oil usually used in the food industries in Europe. In conclusion, there is no evidence that standard consumption of palm oil in packaged foods plays a relevant role in increasing or decreasing the risk of cancer.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent study (LIPOGAIN) [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-15-00651">36</a>,
   <a rid="B37-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-15-00651">37</a>] conducted on young, healthy, average-weight and slightly overweight subjects (Body mass index (BMI) 18–27 kg/m²) highlights that the consumption of desserts prepared with palm oil causes a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile, a doubling of visceral fat and a significant increase of hepatic steatosis compared with the use of sunflower oil.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such effects are probably connected with the consumption of fatty acids in general and not palm oil in particular, as similar results were observed with the use of butter in the place of palm oil [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-15-00651">38</a>]. However, definitive data in this regard do not exist in the literature [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6.5. Correlation with Mortality Rate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, the scientific literature has paid attention to the relationship between saturated fat in diets and the mortality rate. According to a meta-analysis published in 2015 [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-15-00651">12</a>], the correlation between the consumption of saturated fats and all-cause mortality is zero. This consideration is confirmed by the PREDIMED study [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-15-00651">40</a>] conducted in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Unsaturated trans fats are the only fatty acids associated with an increased risk. In literature, different studies have evaluated the effect of various dietary fats on coronary mortality: in particular, in 2016 The NutriCODE group showed that a favourable impact (−11%) on coronary mortality would be obtained by adequately increasing polyunsaturated-fat omega-6 consumption, while the reduction of saturated fats within 10% indicated by the guidelines would only translate to a reduction of 1% in the same coronary mortality. On a global scale, the reduction of saturated fats would produce results of modest importance [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-15-00651">41</a>]. The evaluation of the effects of palm oil on cardiovascular health and on all-cause mortality is more complex for the lack of specific data. The only relevant indirect data is the absence of correlation between the levels of palmitic acid absorption and coronary risk in a study of American nurses, at least for consumption up to 10% of total calories [
