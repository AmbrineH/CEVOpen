 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first historical records related to human use of palm oil date back to five thousand years ago, when it played an essential role in the mummification process in Egypt [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-15-00651">3</a>]. Its use in manufacturing, including artisanal and industrial production, subsequently spread to Western Africa, Asia and, later, Europe. Its use for food purposes became considerable in the nineteenth century, when it became one of the most widely used vegetable oils in the food industry [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Palm oil is produced in tropical areas (Indonesia and Malaysia) and is derived from palm nuts. Its fat has a solid consistency at room temperature because of its elevated percentage of saturated fatty acids. The crude form is known as red palm oil for its coloration, which is derived from elevated concentrations of α- and β-carotenoids. In addition, the native form is rich in other antioxidants, including phytosterol and vitamin E (in the form of α-tocopherol and tocotrienol), which protect the cellular membrane and influence platelet aggregation, modulating the synthesis of thromboxane. Palm oil was also shown to be an excellent oil source for delivering vitamin A in countries with high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-15-00651">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-15-00651">16</a>]. It could be demonstrated that the stability of vitamin A is much higher in palm oil than in soybean oil, which makes palm oil a superior vehicle in fortification programs. In Europe, palm oil is used after refinement, which strips it of carotenoids and similar antioxidant compounds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Palm oil should not be confused with palm kernel oil, derived from palm seeds, which has a significantly higher concentration of saturated fatty acids [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-15-00651">3</a>]. Globally, palm oil is used as follows [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-15-00651">4</a>]: (1) 80% in the food industry (i.e., oil for frying, margarine, baking products, many processed foods); (2) 19% in cosmetics, soaps, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, lacquers and similar products; (3) 1% for the production of biodiesel. Crude palm oil is made up of almost 100% lipids, nearly all in the form of triglycerides. Saturated fatty acids (predominantly palmitic acid) constitute approximately 45% of its total fatty acids. The balance between saturated and monounsaturated plus polyunsaturated fatty acids (approximately 1:1) is nutritionally favourable. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The metabolic effects of palm oil are influenced by the stereospecific distribution of the different fatty acids: palmitic acid is esterified in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol in 87% the cases and in the sn-3 position approximately 12% of the time, while the unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic) are predominantly esterified in the sn-2 position. This particular distribution affects their intestinal absorption: fatty acids that are esterified in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions are substrates of pancreatic lipase and are released in the intestinal tract. Fatty acids that are esterified in the sn-2 position are instead absorbed efficiently, similar to monoglycerides, after hydrolysis of the fatty acids at sn-1 and sn-3 [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The more efficient absorption of fatty acids esterified in the sn-2 position also explains the different absorption of the various fatty acids in breast milk versus bovine milk. Palmitic acid is the predominant saturated fatty acid in the human diet and is the most common saturated fat in breast milk. In contrast to bovine milk, breast milk contains a large quantity of palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position. This makes the absorption of palmitic acid easier for the nursling, which favours rapid growth in the first months of life [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-15-00651">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-15-00651">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Palm oil undergoing interesterification procedures has a nonselective distribution of saturated fatty acids in the sn-3 binding position of glycerol. After interesterification, palmitic acid is no longer selectively excreted in the faeces and is absorbed more efficiently owing to its presence in the sn-2 position. In the literature, palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position seems not to have direct effects on postprandial lipemia, glucose metabolism or insulin compared with palmitic acid esterified in sn-1 or sn-3 [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-15-00651">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-15-00651">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential critical objections to palm oil are derived mainly from the use of oil exposed to many heating and cooking cycles in industry and catering, since those conditions are conducive to the formation of oxidation products, which are unfavorable for the cardiovascular system [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-15-00651">7</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-15-00651">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, the food industry pays special attention to industrial transformation processes such as temperature, sudden changes in heat and pressure, and critical contamination levels of glucose fatty acids (GE), 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD and their esters to guarantee the quality of their products [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-15-00651">1</a>]. The same production companies are required to respect the environment by adhering to projects for the sustainability of palm oil, working together in national palm oil alliances.
