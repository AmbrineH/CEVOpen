 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implications of palm oil use for oncological risk are not well known. The consumption of palm oil does not have a relevant impact on the risk of cancer [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-15-00651">35</a>]. Protective effects in relation with free radicals and anti-inflammatory action are also carried out by micronutrients, such as carotenoids, tocopherol, and tocotrienols, which are abundant in palm oil. Nevertheless, these compounds are absent in the palm oil usually used in the food industries in Europe. In conclusion, there is no evidence that standard consumption of palm oil in packaged foods plays a relevant role in increasing or decreasing the risk of cancer.
