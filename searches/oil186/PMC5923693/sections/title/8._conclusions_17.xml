 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Palm oil is a widely used ingredient in the food industry. It represents a significant source of saturated fatty acids, to which scientific evidence attributes negative health effects when used in excess, especially with regards to cardiovascular diseases. They are contained in palm oil added to food during industrial transformations, but they are also present in other foods that naturally contain them (milk and its derivatives, eggs, meat). The required intake of fatty acids is greatest during the first few years of life and decreases with age. However, the consumption of saturated fats in the western population is higher than the suggested amount for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, especially in children from 3 to 10 years of age. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, there is no evidence of harmful effects of palm oil on the health of children; in fact, palmitic acid has been to be necessary in the first years of life, as it is one of the main components of breast milk. Nevertheless, palm oil has possible ill health effects linked to its composition of fatty acids: its consumption is not correlated to risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in young people with a normal weight and cholesterol level; the elderly and patients with dyslipidaemia or previous cardiovascular events or hypertension are at a greater risk. Therefore, in the context of a balanced diet, rich in foods with normal saturated fatty acid content, it is necessary to repeat the importance of limiting the intake of saturated fats foods with a high saturated fat content, in order to respect the quantity recommended in the nutritional guidelines (10% maximum value of total calories). </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the request on the eventual toxicity of palm oil as a dietary ingredient coming from the Directorate General for Hygiene in Food and Nutrition of the Ministry of Health, the Italian Ministry of Health has recently drawn up its scientific and technical opinion. The document concludes that no food or ingredient is definable as toxic in and of itself [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the matter is not palm oil itself but the group of fatty-acid-rich foods to which it belongs. The most important thing is to consume no more than 10% of saturated fatty acids, regardless of their origin and regardless of oneâ€™s age. Correct information based on a careful analysis of the scientific evidence, rather than a focus on a singular presumed culprit substance, should encourage better lifestyles. </p>
