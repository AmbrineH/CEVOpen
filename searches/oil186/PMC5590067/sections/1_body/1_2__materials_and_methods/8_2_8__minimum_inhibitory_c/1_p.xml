<p>Microdilution tests were conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), OPAS1 M27-A2 for yeasts and OPAS M7-A6 for bacteria according to literature [
 <xref rid="B20-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, MIC values were determined using micro titer plates (96 wells) in a total volume of 100.0 µL. Microorganisms were cultured in test tubes filled with 3 mL of medium (RPMI 1640 for yeast and BHI for bacteria) overnight at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (150 rpm). The cultures were diluted and adjusted to 1–2 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> CFU/mL using a McFarland´s scale. The CFU counts and viability was confirmed by viability counts on YPD and BHI plates (100.0 µL of diluted cells). Crude essential oil and reference standards were serial diluted (two-fold) and added to each well. A negative control containing medium only and growth control containing cell, DMSO (10.0 µL), or saline (10.0 µL) and Tween 80 were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Depending on the microorganism, the micro titer plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 24 or 48 h. Microorganism growth was determined by reading the absorbance at 530 nm in a plate reader (Logen, MT-960, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), and the minimum inhibitory concentration was considered the lowest concentration at which at least 80% of growth was inhibited. All tests were performed in triplicate.
