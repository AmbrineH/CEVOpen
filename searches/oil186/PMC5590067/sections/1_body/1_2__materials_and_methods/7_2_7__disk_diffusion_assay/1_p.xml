<p>To assess the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Z. monogynum</italic> essential oil, the disk diffusion method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, OPAS M2-A8) was used with some modification. Thin agar plates with 10 mL of either YPD (yeast) or LB (Gram-negative) or BHI (Gram-positive) media supplemented with 2% agar were covered with 10 mL of soft agar medium (YPD, LB, or BHI plus 1% agar) containing 100 μL of each fresh culture (adjusted to OD
 <sub>600</sub> = 0.3) of yeast or bacteria grown for 12–16 h in 3 mL of liquid media incubated at 30 °C/37 °C with aeration (150 rpm). After the agar was solidified, 5 mm filter paper disks sterilized and impregnated with 20 μL of crude essential oil diluted in DMSO were placed on top of agar plates and incubated at 30 °C/37 °C for 24 or 48 h depending on the microorganism. Fluconazole (1 mg) and chloramphenicol (200 μg) impregnated disks were used as positive controls for yeast and bacteria, respectively. Negative control was prepared by paper disks impregnating with DMSO at the same concentration employed to dilute the essential oil. All tests were performed in duplicates. Tested strains were selected based on their clinical importance and previous results obtained by our research group [
