<p>The hydrodistillation of the 185.0 g of leaves resulted in 1.1 g of essential oil. Analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and calculation of Kovats indexes and comparison with the literature data [
 <xref rid="B18-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] allowed for the identification of 18 compounds (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t002">Table 2</xref>), which represents 99.06% of the oil. The major compound is citronellol (43.03%), a monoterpenoid that is followed by the sesquiterpenoid farnesol (31.96%). Another monoterpenoid, citronellal (9.57%), was identified followed by D-germacrene (4.52%), β-pinene (2.02%), δ-elemene (1.38%), and (Z)-β-farnesene (1.20%). Together, these seven compounds correspond to 93.68% of the oil composition.
