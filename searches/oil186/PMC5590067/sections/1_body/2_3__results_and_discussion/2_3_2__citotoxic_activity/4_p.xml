<p>The results presented here, where the essential oil from 
 <italic>Z. monogynum</italic> showed similar or lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (in the case of MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines) in comparison to standard drugs (cisplatin and paclitaxel) against the tested cells, suggest that it could be further explored as a source for compounds with antitumor activity. Thus, the essential oil from 
 <italic>Z. monogynum</italic> could be considered as a source of antitumor compounds.
