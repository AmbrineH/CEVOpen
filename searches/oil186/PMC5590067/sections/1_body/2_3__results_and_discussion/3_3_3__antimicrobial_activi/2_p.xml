<p>Several essential oils and their major constituents from medicinal plants have been reported to possess a wide range of bacterial and fungal inhibitory potentials [

 <xref rid="B28-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the selectivity index (SI
 <sub>50</sub> = IC
 <sub>50</sub>/MIC) estimated for this essential oil is low, meaning that it may have low selective toxicity. In the future, this matter could be overcome by chemical modifications in the inhibitor.
