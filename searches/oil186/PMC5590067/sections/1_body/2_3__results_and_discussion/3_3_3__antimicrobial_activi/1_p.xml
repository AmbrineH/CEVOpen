<p>Regarding antimicrobial activity, initially, disk diffusion assays were conducted with the yeasts and bacterial strains listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</xref> in order to screen for antimicrobial activity. No bacterial strains were sensitive to essential oil from 
 <italic>Z. monogynum</italic>, but the crude oil was sensitive to yeast, especially 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> sp. (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-medicines-04-00031">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Since no biological activity was detected for bacterial strain in this qualitative assay, no further experiments were conducted with these microorganisms. However, the MIC test applied to the yeast species listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t001">Table 1</xref> confirmed that all yeast strains were sensitive to essential oil at concentrations ranging from 0.75 (
 <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>) to 6.0 mg/mL (
 <italic>Candida</italic> sp.) with 90% growth inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00031-t004">Table 4</xref>).
