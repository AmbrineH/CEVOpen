 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the results, the essential oil from leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> has a different qualitative and quantitative composition when compared to the composition previously described, showing sesquiterpenes citronellol and farnesol as major constituents. Lower IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for the tested tumor cell lines proved that this EO has significant cytotoxic activity. EO from 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> has also proven to exhibit moderate activity against 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cereviseae</span> yeasts, but not significant activity against 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> bacterial strains. Analysis of the EO composition suggests that the major compounds might not be responsible for the observed activities as citronellol itself was previously tested against 
  <span class="italic">Candida tropicalis</span> and showed to be potent against this bacterium.
