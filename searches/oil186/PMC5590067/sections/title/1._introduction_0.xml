 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Rutaceae family has approximately 150 genera distributed worldwide in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> genus comprises more than 200 species, being the most abundant genus in Rutaceae regarding to the number of species. In 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> genus, it is common to find secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, lignans, coumarins, amides, flavonoids, and triterpenes [

  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> genus, several biological activities—larvicidal [

  <a rid="B6-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-medicines-04-00031">6</a>], and anti-inflammatory [
  <a rid="B7-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-medicines-04-00031">7</a>], among others—have been described. In Brazil, people of the state of Rondônia use the tea from leaves and roots of 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylium</span> sp. to relieve toothache [
  <a rid="B8-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-medicines-04-00031">8</a>]. Additionally, the species 
  <span class="italic">Z. simullans</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Z. chalybeum</span> are used for the treatment of malaria [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils of various species of 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> genus, such as the essential oil from branches of 
  <span class="italic">Z. armantum</span>, which presented strong insecticidal activity against pests that attack stored products [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00031">11</a>], have had their activities tested. Essential oil from the seeds of the same species has larvicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</span>, mosquitoes that are vectors of diseases [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Z. gilletti</span> leaves showed larvicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles gambiae</span>, the mosquito vector of malaria in Africa [
  <a rid="B12-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-medicines-04-00031">12</a>]. It has also been found that the essential oil 
  <span class="italic">Z. alatum</span> exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity [
  <a rid="B13-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-medicines-04-00031">13</a>], and the essential oil of

  <a rid="B14-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-medicines-04-00031">14</a>]. The methanolic extract and the essential oil from fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum leprieurii</span> presented anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties in vitro assays [

  <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum monogynum</span> is popularly known as laranjeira-do-mato, tinguaciba-da-restinga, tinguaciba, limão-bravo, or limãozinho, occurring in Brazil in the states of Alagoas, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo [
  <a rid="B16-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-medicines-04-00031">16</a>]. The study of Maia and Andrade [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00031" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00031">17</a>] in 2007, with leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> collected in different regions of Brazil, gave rise to two essential oils with different compositions and characteristics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, there are no data in the literature about biological activities of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span>. The purpose of this study was (i) to give a chemical characterization of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> essential oil, (ii) to investigate its cytotoxic activity in vitro against six tumor cell lines (B16F10, MCF-7, A2058, HeLa, HL-60 and T75), and (iii) to determine the antimicrobial effect of 
  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> essential oil against yeast (
