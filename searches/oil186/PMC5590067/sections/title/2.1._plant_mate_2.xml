  <span class="italic">Z. monogynum</span> (185 g) were used to obtain the essential oil by a hydro-distillation process for 2 h at 80 °C; the residual water was removed through the addition of anhydrous sodium sulfate, which was then properly removed by a filtration procedure. An aliquot of the obtained essential oil was used for GC and GC/MS analysis.
