 <p>The effect of boiling and roasting on the lipid quality, proximate composition, and mineral content of African walnut seeds (
  <italic>Tetracarpidium conophorum</italic>) was assessed. Results indicated that the quality of walnut oil significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) reduces with the treatments. Oils extracted from 
  <italic>DBWN</italic> 60
  <italic> </italic>min (Dried and boiled walnuts 60 min) and 
  <italic>FBWN</italic> 60 min (Boiled fresh walnuts 60 min) were the most altered. The proximate composition and mineral content of walnut seeds was also significantly affected (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) by the treatments. This study reveals that, thermal processing has significant effects on the nutrients and quality of lipids of walnut oil. 
  <italic>DTRWN</italic> 60 min (Dried and traditionally roasted walnuts 60 min), 
  <italic>DORWN</italic> 60 min (Dried and oven roasted walnuts 60 min), and 
  <italic>TRFWN</italic> 30 min (traditionally roasted fresh nuts 30 min) are the best methods for cooking walnut because they preserve the quality of its lipids and some of the nutrients.
