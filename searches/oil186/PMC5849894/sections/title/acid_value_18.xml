 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in acid value (AV) of oils might be an important measure of rancidity of foods. Free fatty acids are formed due to hydrolysis of triglycerides and may get promoted by reaction of oil with moisture (Frega, Mozzon, &amp; Lercker, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0014">1999</a>). The changes in acidity of walnut oil during processing are shown in Table 
  <a rid="fsn3570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3570-tbl-0001">1</a>. No significant difference (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; .05) was registered between the control 
  <span class="italic">(FWN)</span> and the following processed samples 
  <span class="italic">(FBWN</span> 60 min
  <span class="italic">, DTRWN</span> 60 min
  <span class="italic">, DORWN</span> 60 min, and 
  <span class="italic">TRFWN</span> 30 min). However, there was a significant increase (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05) in acid value of 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min; and a significant decrease in AV of 
  <span class="italic">DWN</span> compared to the control 
  <span class="italic">(FWN)</span> and the other processed samples. The significant increase in acid value registered in 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min might be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of its triglycerides, leading to the accumulation of free fatty acids. It has been proven that, free fatty acids easily undergo oxidation than esterified ones. This can explain the fact that the lipids of this same sample were the most altered as previously observed with the PV, TBA, and IV. Also, its AV was lower than 4 mg KOH/g which is the recommended acid value of crude oils (FAO, WHO, 
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0013">2009</a>). The decrease in AV observed in 
  <span class="italic">DWN</span> compared to 
  <span class="italic">FWN</span> can be related to the rapid transformation of the free fatty acids present into hydroperoxides. Moreover, drying + boiling (60 min) significantly increase the acidity of walnut oil. This result is in accordance with those of Tenyang et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3570-bib-0027">2017</a>) who showed that the acid value of sesame oil significantly increases during boiling and roasting at different temperature and time.
