 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of boiling and roasting on lipid quality and nutritional value of walnut seeds. Results show that the quality of walnut oil was significantly affected by boiling and roasting. However 
  <span class="italic">DBWN</span> 60 min and 
  <span class="italic">FBWN</span> 60 min were the most altered samples. These treatments are not suitable for the preservation of walnut oil quality. The proximate composition of walnut seeds was also significantly affected by the treatments. Almost all the cooking methods have significantly increased the lipid content of the nuts, while their protein and carbohydrate concentrations decreased. Traditional roasting for 60 min increases the ash content of walnut seeds. The minerals of the nuts were also significantly modified during cooking. Both boiling and roasting have significantly decreased the K, Ca, Na, and P content of walnut. Traditional and oven roasting for 60 min considerably increase the amount of magnesium, while the other treatments decrease its concentration. All processing technique including boiling leads to a significant loss of calcium and magnesium. Traditional roasting reduces the concentration of iron of walnut seeds.
