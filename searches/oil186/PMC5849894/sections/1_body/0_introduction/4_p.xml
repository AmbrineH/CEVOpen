Many studies have reported the effect of processing temperature on the nutritional, antinutritional values, and antioxidant properties, and African walnut seeds in some countries. These include: effect of boiling and traditional roasting on the nutritional, antinutritional, and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds (Arinola &amp; Adesina, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>); impact of processing on the nutrient content, vitamin, and mineral composition of African walnuts (Okonkwo &amp; Ozoude, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>); effect of cooking on phenolic content and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds Ademiluyi, Oboh, Aragbaiye, Oyeleye, and Ogunsuyi (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Though considerable attention had been given to the study of African walnut seeds, there is, however, very limited reports on the effects of processing on the walnut seeds grown in Cameroon, and especially on the quality of their lipids. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of boiling and different roasting methods on lipid quality and proximate composition of walnut seeds.
