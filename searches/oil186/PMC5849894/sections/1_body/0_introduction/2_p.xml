<p>African walnut (
 <italic>Tetracarpidium conophorum</italic>) is a popular Central and Western Africa plant where it is planted mainly for its nuts, which are usually eaten as snacks when the unshelled nuts are boiled and cracked (Babalola, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The proximate composition of 
 <italic>T. conophorum</italic> revealed that it is rich in protein (29.14%), fat (54.14%), carbohydrate (4.17%), ash (3.32%), and several vitamins (Arinola &amp; Adesina, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). A bitter taste is usually observed upon drinking water immediately after eating the nuts, due to the presence of antinutrients. The leaves, barks, and nuts of 
 <italic>T. conophorum</italic> have also been demonstrated as good sources of phenolic antioxidants with various biological properties. Food materials are usually processed in order to improve palatability and reduce toxicity, and as a means of preservation (Kanu, Kalu, &amp; Okorie, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Walnuts seeds are generally consumed after several processing techniques. General method of processing of walnut prior to consumption involves prolonged cooking of the seeds by boiling and roasting with or without the shell. These processing methods usually improve the organoleptic properties of the nuts, reduce their antinutrients content, and prolong their shelf life (Ayankunbi, Keshinro, &amp; Egele,
