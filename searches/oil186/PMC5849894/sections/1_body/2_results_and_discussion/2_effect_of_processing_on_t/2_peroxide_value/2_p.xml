<p>Peroxide value (PV) is commonly used to determine the magnitude of primary oxidation products (mainly hydroperoxides) in oils (Shahidi &amp; Wanasundara, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The changes in PV of walnut oil samples are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>. The peroxide values of all the processed samples (
 <italic>DWN, DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, DTRWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, DORWN</italic> 60 min, 
 <italic>and TRFWN</italic> 30 min) have significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) compared to that of the control (FWN). The highest PV was registered in 
 <italic>DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>,</italic> and was 19.10 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/Kg, which was significantly higher than 10 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/Kg, which is the recommended peroxide value of oils and fats (FAO/WHO, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). However, the PV of control and the other processed samples were lower than the recommended value, meaning that these treatments were better in preserving walnut oil than 
 <italic>DBWN</italic> 60 min. No significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) was observed between the PV of 
 <italic>FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, DTRWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, DORWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic>TRFWN</italic> 30 min. The increase in peroxide value in the processed samples compared to the control 
 <italic>(FWN)</italic> can be attributed to the accumulation of hydroperoxides as a result of free radicals attacking the unsaturated fatty acids of oil (Nyam, Wong, Long, &amp; Tan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Womeni et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). These results are in accordance with those of Tenyang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) who demonstrated that, the peroxide values of sesame oil increases with the thermal treatment of sesame seeds.
