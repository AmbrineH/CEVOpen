<p class="p">The increase in acid value (AV) of oils might be an important measure of rancidity of foods. Free fatty acids are formed due to hydrolysis of triglycerides and may get promoted by reaction of oil with moisture (Frega, Mozzon, &amp; Lercker, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The changes in acidity of walnut oil during processing are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>. No significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05) was registered between the control 
 <italic class="italic">(FWN)</italic> and the following processed samples 
 <italic class="italic">(FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, DTRWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, DORWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">TRFWN</italic> 30 min). However, there was a significant increase (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) in acid value of 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min; and a significant decrease in AV of 
 <italic class="italic">DWN</italic> compared to the control 
 <italic class="italic">(FWN)</italic> and the other processed samples. The significant increase in acid value registered in 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min might be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of its triglycerides, leading to the accumulation of free fatty acids. It has been proven that, free fatty acids easily undergo oxidation than esterified ones. This can explain the fact that the lipids of this same sample were the most altered as previously observed with the PV, TBA, and IV. Also, its AV was lower than 4 mg KOH/g which is the recommended acid value of crude oils (FAO, WHO, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The decrease in AV observed in 
 <italic class="italic">DWN</italic> compared to 
 <italic class="italic">FWN</italic> can be related to the rapid transformation of the free fatty acids present into hydroperoxides. Moreover, drying + boiling (60 min) significantly increase the acidity of walnut oil. This result is in accordance with those of Tenyang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) who showed that the acid value of sesame oil significantly increases during boiling and roasting at different temperature and time.
