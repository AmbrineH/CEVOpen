<p>From Table

 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and Nwaoguikpe et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), respectively. The presence of these minerals in African walnut is also beneficial, due to their direct relationship with hypertension in humans. This may be the reason why the plant is used to prevent and control high blood pressure (James, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). The phosphorus content of walnut was also reducing in almost all the cooked samples. Its concentration was ranged between 16.86 and 22.38 mg/100 g, which is lower than 35 mg/100 g as previously reported by (Nwaoguikpe et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
