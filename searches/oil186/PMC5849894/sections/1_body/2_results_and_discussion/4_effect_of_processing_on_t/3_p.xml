This indicates that, oven and traditional roasting for 10 min is suitable for the elevation of the amount of magnesium in walnut seeds. The decrease in magnesium content registered in 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, FBWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">TRFWN</italic> 30 min can be attributed to the loss of this mineral in water during processing through the diffusion process. However, its elevation in 
 <italic class="italic">DTRWN</italic> 60 min and 
 <italic class="italic">DORWN</italic> 60 min can be due to the fact that, the antinutritional present in the nuts and which were complexed to the mineral were significantly destroyed by heat, leading to the increase in its concentration (Makinde &amp; Akinoso,
