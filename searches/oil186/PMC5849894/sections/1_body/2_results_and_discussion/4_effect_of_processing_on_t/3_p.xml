<p>Concerning the magnesium content, its concentration significantly decreased (

 <italic> </italic>min (172.75, 203.34, and 416.05 mg/100 g, respectively) compared to 
 <italic>DWN</italic> (1119.35 mg/100 g), while those of 
 <italic>DTRWN</italic> 60 min and 
 <italic>DORWN</italic> 60 min were significantly higher (1539.05 and 1691.35 mg/100 g, respectively). This indicates that, oven and traditional roasting for 10 min is suitable for the elevation of the amount of magnesium in walnut seeds. The decrease in magnesium content registered in 
 <italic>DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, FBWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic>TRFWN</italic> 30 min can be attributed to the loss of this mineral in water during processing through the diffusion process. However, its elevation in 
 <italic>DTRWN</italic> 60 min and 
 <italic>DORWN</italic> 60 min can be due to the fact that, the antinutritional present in the nuts and which were complexed to the mineral were significantly destroyed by heat, leading to the increase in its concentration (Makinde &amp; Akinoso, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The amount of magnesium obtained in this study was higher than 171.12 mg/100 g as previously reported by Ayoola et al. (
