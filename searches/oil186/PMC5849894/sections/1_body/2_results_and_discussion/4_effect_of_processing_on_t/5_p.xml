<p>Concerning the single micronutrient analyzed, (iron) its concentration has significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in DBWN 60
 <italic> min,</italic> FBWN 60 min, and DORWN 60 min compared to the control. However the amount of iron in DTRWN 60 min and TRFWN 30 min were significantly lower than those previously mentioned. This indicates that traditional roasting significantly decreases the amount of iron of walnut. The concentrations of iron obtained in this study vary between 14.64 and 43.32 mg/100 g, which is higher than 11.0 mg/100 g as previously reported by Oyoola et al. (2011). The amount of iron provided by walnut can helps in the prevention of iron‐nutritional anemia.
