<p class="p">Results also showed that walnut seeds are rich in macronutrients: 52.75%–56.89% of lipids, 21.96%–24.18% of proteins and 9.21%–14.18% of carbohydrates (digestibles and undigestibles). This composition is closed to that previously reported by Arinola and Adesina (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) with the same nuts. These authors showed that the total lipids, proteins and carbohydrates content of cooked and raw walnut varied between 54.14 and 62.65%, 22.47 and 29.14%, and 11.41 and 13.4%, respectively. It is also observed in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> that the amounts of lipid of 
 <italic class="italic">FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, DTRWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, DORWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">TRFWN</italic> 30 min were significantly higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) compared to that of 
 <italic class="italic">DWN</italic> (control) and 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min. This might be due to the loss of water, which facilitate lipids extraction. However, no significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05) was registered between the lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">DWN</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min. Similar trend has been obtained by Onyeike et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) when evaluating the effect of heat processing on the proximate composition and energy value of African walnut seeds. Talking about the total protein content, a significant decrease (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) in its concentration was registered with 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, DTRWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">DORWN</italic> 60 min compared to the control (DWN). This reduction can be attributed to the Maillard reaction, as proteins are substrates of nonenzymatic browning (Tenyang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Similar result has been reported by Arinola and Adesina (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), who showed that the amount of protein of walnut seed was decreasing during boiling and roasting. However, no difference was registered between the amount of protein of 
 <italic class="italic">FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, TRFWN</italic> 30 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">DWN</italic> (Control). The total carbohydrate content of processed and raw walnut sample also presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> showed that, the amount of sugar varies significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) with the processing method. The amount of carbohydrate of 
 <italic class="italic">DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic class="italic">, FBWN</italic> 60 min, 
 <italic class="italic">DORWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic class="italic">TRFWN</italic> 30 min has significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) decreased during the treatments compared to the control 
 <italic class="italic">(DWN)</italic>. As previously mentioned, this can be related to the Maillard reaction, as carbohydrates (reducing sugars) are also substrates of nonenzymatic browning (Tenyang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). These results are in accordance with those of Onyeike et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) who demonstrated that the total carbohydrate content of walnut seeds was decreasing during processing.
