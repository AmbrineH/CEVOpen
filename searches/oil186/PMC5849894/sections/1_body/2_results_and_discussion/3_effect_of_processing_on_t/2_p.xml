<p>The effect of boiling and roasting on the proximate composition of walnut seeds is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>. Results showed that, the moisture content of control 
 <italic>(DWN)</italic> and processed walnut samples falls between 0.47 and 4.81%. 
 <italic>DTRWN</italic> 60 min and 
 <italic>DORWN</italic> 60 min have presented significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) amounts of moisture compared to the control (DWN) and the other processed samples. However, the moisture content of those other processed samples (
 <italic>DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, FBWN</italic> 60 min, 
 <italic>and TRFWN</italic> 30 min was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than that of 
 <italic>DWN</italic>. It has been demonstrated that, low moisture content of food samples increase their shelf‐lives by reducing the microbial and enzymatic activities (Oyenga, 
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Concerning the changes in ash content, it was ranged between 7.30 and 9.03%. No significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) was observed between the amount of ash of 
 <italic>DWN</italic> (control) and those of 
 <italic>DBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, FBWN</italic> 60 min
 <italic>, DORWN</italic> 60 min, and 
 <italic>TRFWN</italic> 60 min. However, a significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) ash content (9.03%) was registered with 
 <italic>DTRWN</italic> 60 min, but that amount of ash was similar (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) to that of 
 <italic>DBWN 60 min</italic> (7.65%). This result suggests that drying + traditional roasting increases the amount of ash in walnut. The concentration of ash detected in this study is higher than those reported by Arinola and Adesina (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). These authors reported that the amount of ash in raw, boiled and roasted walnut was ranged between 2 and 4%, and was decreasing with the treatments. However, our findings were not far from those of Onyeike, Anyalogbu, and Monanu (
 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) who demonstrated that ash content of cooked and raw walnut seeds of 5.45%–6.05%. They also find no significant difference between the amount of ash in cooked and raw walnut.
