 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The nuts were separately grinded to pass 1 mm sieve. A quantity of 80 g of each power was separately macerated in 400 ml of hexane at room temperature for 24 hr with constant shaking. After that, the mixture was filtered using the whatman paper N1, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotatory evaporator at 40°C. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4°C for further analysis.
