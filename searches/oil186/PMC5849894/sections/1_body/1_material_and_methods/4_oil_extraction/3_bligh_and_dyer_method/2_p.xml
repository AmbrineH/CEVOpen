<p class="p">Oils were extracted from samples containing water (

 <xref rid="fsn3570-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1959</xref>). About 80 g of nuts were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 ml of chloroform and 200 ml of methanol were subsequently added. The mixture was grinded for 3 min; follow by the addition of 100 ml of chloroform and 100 ml of water. The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered. The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, this in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol, and water, respectively. After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous. The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45°C under reduced pressure. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4°C for further analysis.
