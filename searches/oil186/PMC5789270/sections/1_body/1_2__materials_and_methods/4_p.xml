<p class="p">Peaches (‘Vista Rich’) and nectarines (‘Sweet Red’) were harvested from two different orchards located in Lagnasco (Cuneo, Italy, 44°37′33″60 N, 07°33′21″24 E) at the firm-ripe stage and transported immediately to the laboratory of DISAFA, University of Torino, during the summer of 2015. All fruit were sorted by size. Defect-free fruit were randomly divided into five lots of 350 fruit each. Each lot was treated in a different way and further divided into 5 replicates of 70 fruit. Each replicate was a box kept in a container at the same temperature, but different atmosphere according to the treatment. </p>
