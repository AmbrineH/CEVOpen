 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to agar-agar (Merck) (15 g/L). Lower EO concentrations were obtained by serial dilutions. 50 mL of medium were poured into Petri dishes and after agar solidification, 5 diffusors were installed in storage cabinets under the fruit boxes. Fruit were stored in refrigerator cabinets (75 × 70 × 65 cm) at 0 °C and 98% relative humidity for 28 days. Fumigation was performed at 1% and 10% EO concentrations. A total of four treatments were tested: thyme EO at 1%, thyme EO at 10%, savory EO at 1% and savory EO at 10%. An untreated control was included. The analyses were performed at 1, 14 and 28 days of cold storage.
