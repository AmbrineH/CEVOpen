<p>Pure essential oil of savory and thyme were diluted at 1% and 10% in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) for direct injection using split mode (80%). Sampling in the chambers was performed using SPME fiber assembly 100 Î¼m PDMS (Supelco Analytical, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 5 min in triplicate at 1, 14 and 28 days of incubation whereby the injector was in splitless mode. Relative composition (percentage) of volatile compounds was calculated by comparing peak area to area of total chromatogram (from 7.5 to 40 min). Absolute quantification was calculated for carvacrol and thymolusing a standard calibration curve between 1 and 50 ppm (mg/L). Relative quantification was determined for the other compounds, by using standard calibration curve of thymol for thyme essential oil and standard calibration curve of carvacrol for savory essential oil.
