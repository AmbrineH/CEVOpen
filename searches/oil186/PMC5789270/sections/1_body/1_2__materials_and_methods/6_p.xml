<p class="p">After harvesting, healthy sound fruit were selected. Rotten fruit were counted and incidence of diseased fruit was calculated for each treatment every 7 days up to 28 days of storage, and for 5 days of shelf life at 20 °C. Pathogens were isolated by transferring small pieces of symptomatic fruit tissues, previously washed in 1% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed in sterile deionized water, onto potato dextrose agar (PDA, Merck) plates amended with 25 mg/L streptomycin sulfate (Merck). A 7-day-old culture was used for DNA extraction by using the EZNA Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of 50 isolates was amplified using the ITS1/ITS4 primers [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 25 mM, 0.2 µL of Taq polymerase and 2 µL of template DNA. PCR cycles included a denaturing step at 95 °C for 2 min and 35 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. ITS amplicons were sequenced by BMR Genomics (Padua, Italy), and DNA sequences were compared with those present in the NCBI database and deposited with accession numbers.
