<p class="p">The carotenoid content was determined every 14 days, using the method reported by Talcott and Howard [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The carotenoids were extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (ethanol/acetone

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> with 0.2% butylhydroxytoluene) and 2 g of fresh sample from 10 fruit, homogenized at 24,000 rpm for 1 min using an Ultra-Turrax T-25 Tissue homogenizer (IKA
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>-Labortechnik, Saufen, Germany). The samples were then centrifuged at 2900 rpm for 20 min at 2 °C (Avanti J-25 centrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The recovered supernatants were combined with 30 mL of extraction solvent, 25 mL of hexane and 12.5 mL of nanopure water. The tubes were left in the dark at 4 °C for 1 h, then the samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes. Absorbance was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (DU 530, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at 450 nm, with β-carotene as an external standard. The results are expressed as μg β-carotene equivalents per kg weight of fruit and are an average of three replicates per treatment and per time point (at 0, 14 and 28 days of storage).
