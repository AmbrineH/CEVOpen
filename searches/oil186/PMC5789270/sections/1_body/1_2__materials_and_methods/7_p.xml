<p>The effect of essential oils on conidial germination was investigated on two main peach and nectarine pathogens, 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic>. Two virulent strains isolated from peaches were stored on agar slant at 4 °C until use. 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> conidial suspension was obtained from 15 days of culture grown on PDA+ streptomycin 25 mg/L at 25 °C. 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> was cultured on tomato agar plate (250 mL of tomato puree, 750 mL of deionized water and 20 g of agar) amended with 25 mg of streptomycin for 5 days. 5 mL of sterile deionized water were added to the plate and the mycelium was gently scraped with L-shaped spreader to detach the conidia. Conidial suspension was filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth and 100 µL were spread on PDA+ streptomycin plates. PDA plates were sealed with the essential oil diffusor. EOs were added to the diffusors at 350 µL/L and 35 µL/L, a concentration proportional to the quantity present in the cabinet considering the concentration of EO diffusor, the number of diffusors per cabinet and the volume of the cabinet and the plates. Conidial germination was assessed after 20 h for 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 36 h for 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> counting 100 conidia per plate. Three replicates were used for each treatment and the assay was repeated twice. Conidia were considered germinated when the germ tube exceeded the conidial length.
