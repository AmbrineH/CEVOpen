<p class="p">Ascorbic acid (AA) was determined according to Sánchez-Moreno et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and González-Molina et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and evaluated at 0, 14 and 28 days (three replicates per treatment and per time point). The ascorbic acid was extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (methanol:water 5:95

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and 10 g of fruit flesh from 10 fruit per treatment by homogenization with a T-25 Ultra-Turrax for 3 min. Then, pH was adjusted to 2.2–2.4, and the extract was adsorbed onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA, USA). The resultant solution was added to 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Fluka Chemika, Neu-Ulm, Switzerland) and left to stand for 37 min before HPLC analysis. The AA and dehydroascorbic acid contents were expressed as mg/kg fresh weight. Three replicate analyses were performed on the flesh. The chromatographic system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was equipped a Kinetex-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), a pump and a diode array detector. The system was controlled through HPLC online software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) at 40 °C. The mobile phase (isocratic) comprised 50 mM monobasic potassium phosphate and 5 mM cetrimide (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Saint Louis, MO, USA) in methanol:water (5:95 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min. The detector was set at 261 nm for AA and 348 for dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). External calibration curves for AA and DHAA, respectively, were used for quantification. The total run time was 15 min. The detection limit is 0.5 mg/kg of fresh weight.
