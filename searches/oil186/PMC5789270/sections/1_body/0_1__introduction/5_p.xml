<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the vapor phase of thyme and savory EOs, applied by fumigation through slow-release diffusors, on both quality parameters and postharvest diseases of peaches and nectarines, during cold storage and shelf life. Savory and thyme solid diffusors were prepared at two different concentrations and they were used to treat naturally infected peaches and nectarines. In order to clarify how essential oils diffuse and persist in cold rooms, the atmospheric composition of the storage cabinets was analyzed during cold storage. At the same time, the antimicrobial activity of essential oil vapors was evaluated in vitro on conidial germination of 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, two of the main postharvest pathogens of peaches and nectarines.
