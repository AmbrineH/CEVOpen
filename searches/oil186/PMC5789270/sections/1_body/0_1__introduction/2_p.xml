Crop protection in Europe should be performed in the orchard because only one fungicide (fludioxonil) can be used on stone fruit after harvesting, but the supermarket chains typically request either no further postharvest treatments or a limited number of active ingredients, as residues, on the fruit. The last fungicide has to be applied 1 or 2 weeks before harvesting, to guarantee a high level of fruit protection against pathogens during storage, and to remain below the maximum residue limits imposed by European legislation [
