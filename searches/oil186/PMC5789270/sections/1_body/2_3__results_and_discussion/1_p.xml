<p class="p">The vapor phase activity makes EOs potential biofumigants of fruit in storage chambers. Slow release diffusors, based on EO gel emulsions, were used to release EO vapor phase during the storage of peaches and nectarines. Pathogens were not inoculated, so only natural pathogen inoculum could develop both on nectarines and peaches. </p>
