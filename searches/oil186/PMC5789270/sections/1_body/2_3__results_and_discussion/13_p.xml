<p>As diffusors, based on EO gel emulsions, were used to release EO vapor phase during the fruit storage, we wanted to determine the concentration of EO compounds in the atmosphere of the chambers during fruit cold storage. The analyses performed in chambers with thyme EO diffusors at 1% and 10% showed a very high amount of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, the main volatile organic compound at 1, 14 and 28 days. Thymol, instead, was on average 2.0% during the three samplings in thyme EO at 10%, while in thyme EO at 1% thymol was 0.40%, 3.66% and 3.67% at day 1, 14 and 28, respectively. Thymol in storage chambers was released slowly and at lower concentration, compared to the pure essential oil composition. This experiment demonstrated that thymol was slowly released by diffusors during the 28 days of fruit storage in cold chambers, and persisted by increasing in absolute concentration during storage.
