 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is much less sensitive to essential oil antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our experiments, the fungus confirmed to be less sensitive to EO vapors, compared to 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> and maximum reduction of conidial germination was 40.1% for savory vapors at 10%. Germ tube length of 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> growth was inhibited only by 10% thyme treatment, while the other treatments were not statistically different from the untreated control.
