<p>The use of EOs led to a delay in the loss of total carotenoids content and AA in the pulp. Some EOs (thymol, menthol and eugenol) have shown antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging capability [

 <xref rid="B50-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] suggested that the addition of thymol slowed the AA loss in grape. Nevertheless, different effects of EOs on total carotenoids content between nectarines and peaches were evident. The EOs were more effective on the metabolism of nectarines, while in peaches the action of the EOs was less evident.
