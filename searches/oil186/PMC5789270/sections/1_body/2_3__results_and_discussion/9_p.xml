<p>On peaches, under high disease pressure, untreated fruit were completely damaged by brown rot. On fruit fumigated with EOs, 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. were isolated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The efficacy of thyme EO against 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> depended on its concentration. 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> affected only 30% and 25% of the rotten fruit fumigated with 1% and 10% thyme EO, respectively.
