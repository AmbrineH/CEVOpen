<p class="p">The hue angle is a measure of ripening. In general, the hue angle values of the ground color decrease during postharvest storage, as fruit become yellow. In nectarines, the hue angle remained stable during storage, but some differences among treatments were observed and nectarines treated with EOs were yellower than the control fruit. In peaches, the ground color became yellower during storage as expected, but no differences among treatments were observed. In conclusion, the use of EOs had no negative effect on fruit color. The color variations were connected with the natural ripening process and were slowed down by cold storage. </p>
