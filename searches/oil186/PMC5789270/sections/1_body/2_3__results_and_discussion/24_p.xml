<p>Untreated control showed the highest weight loss at the end of the storage in both trials. The efficacy of EO fumigation could be related to the formation of a coating on the fruit surface that modifies gas permeation, reducing respiration rate and water loss. Our results were in agreement with previous experiments on cherries [

Here, ground and overcolor lightness and hue angle were monitored during storage. The lightness values of the nectarines decreased both in ground and overcolor during cold storage (
