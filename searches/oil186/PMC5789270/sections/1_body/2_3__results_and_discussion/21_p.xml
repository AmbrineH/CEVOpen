<p>In vitro tests confirmed the results obtained in fruit: the antimicrobial activity of vapor EOs does not need a direct contact. Moreover, the higher efficacy against 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic>, compared to 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> in vitro explained the higher reduction of brown rot on fruit, accompanied by a higher incidence of gray mold. This effect was particularly evident on peaches. Untreated fruit were affected exclusively by 
 <italic>M. fructicola,</italic> while other pathogens could develop on fumigated fruits by colonizing the niche left empty by the inhibition of 
 <italic>M. fructicola</italic>. Thanks to the lower sensitivity of 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> to EO vapors, the pathogen could start to develop on fumigated fruit causing gray rots.
