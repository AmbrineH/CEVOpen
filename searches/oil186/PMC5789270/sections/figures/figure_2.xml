 <p> M. fructicola (gray columns) and B. cinerea conidial germination percentage (black columns) after biofumigation without direct contact with essential oil in vitro. Conidial germination was assessed after 20 h for B. cinerea and 36 h for M. fructicola at 20 °C. Values of the same pathogen, followed by the same letter, are not statistically different by Tukey’s Test ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>)
