 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vapor phase activity makes EOs potential biofumigants of fruit in storage chambers. Slow release diffusors, based on EO gel emulsions, were used to release EO vapor phase during the storage of peaches and nectarines. Pathogens were not inoculated, so only natural pathogen inoculum could develop both on nectarines and peaches. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EO fumigation was effective in controlling postharvest rots of peaches and nectarines, but the efficacy was different in the two experimental conditions. During cold storage, no rots developed either on nectarines ‘Sweet Red’ or on ‘Vista Rich’ peaches. Rot incidence on nectarines ‘Sweet Red’ and peaches ‘Vista Rich’ greatly differed during shelf life (5 days at 20 °C). After shelf life, on nectarines the rot incidence in untreated fruit was 23.3%, while most peaches (99.3%) were rotten in untreated control (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f001" href="#foods-07-00007-f001">Figure 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disease incidence was influenced by the weather conditions during fruit growing. A high incidence of brown rot on peaches, which were harvested one month before nectarines, was favored by fresh and humid weather conditions, while nectarines were harvested in August, after a period characterized by high temperatures and scarce precipitations, which limited the development of brown rot [
  <a rid="B32-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-foods-07-00007">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Untreated control showed the highest percentage of rotten fruit in both trials. The pathogens isolated from rotten fruit were identified using morphological and molecular tools. On nectarines, the postharvest pathogens isolated from untreated fruit were 
  <span class="italic">Monilinia fructicola</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> spp. (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t001" href="#foods-07-00007-t001">Table 1</a>), with an incidence of 10.7%, 8.0% and 4.6%, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The efficacy of the EO treatments was influenced by the disease incidence: under low disease pressure, three out of four treatments significantly reduced the fruit rot incidence, while under high disease pressure, only vapors of thyme at 10% significantly reduced the rots compared to the control.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On nectarines, savory EO at 10% was the most effective treatment, with only 4.0% of the fruit damaged by postharvest pathogens. All the treatments were effective in controlling postharvest diseases, except for savory EO at 1%, which was not statistically different from the control at the end of the shelf life (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f001" href="#foods-07-00007-f001">Figure 1</a>a). Thyme EO was very effective in controlling 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span>. The increase in EO concentration resulted in a decrease of brown rot. 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> was isolated with an incidence of 4.0% and 6.8% for 1% and 10% thyme EO treatment, respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On nectarines, 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> was the major pathogen in untreated fruit (47.2% of rotten fruit), while the relative incidence decreased to 45.0% and 26.8% in fruit treated with thyme EO at 1% and 10%, respectively. 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> affected 34.3%, 55.0% and 73.2% of rotten fruit in the control, in thyme at 1% and at 10%, respectively. After the first report of 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> in Italy in 2009 [
  <a rid="B33-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-foods-07-00007">33</a>], the pathogen has mainly substituted the endemic species 
  <span class="italic">M. laxa</span> in Italian orchards. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> spp. was not isolated in fruit fumigated with thyme EO. Savory EO vapors were less effective in controlling this pathogen because only 10% concentration inhibited 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> spp. growth, while 3.4% of fruit fumigated with 1% savory EO showed 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> rot. Reduced activity against 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> spp. was reported for savory essential oil, moreover the essential oil at 400 ppm favored 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> rot [
  <a rid="B34-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-foods-07-00007">34</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria</span> spp. is a secondary pathogen of nectarines and the presence on the samples is mainly due to long storage.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On peaches, under high disease pressure, untreated fruit were completely damaged by brown rot. On fruit fumigated with EOs, 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium</span> spp. were isolated (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f001" href="#foods-07-00007-f001">Figure 1</a>b). The efficacy of thyme EO against 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> depended on its concentration. 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> affected only 30% and 25% of the rotten fruit fumigated with 1% and 10% thyme EO, respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span>, the causal agent of gray mold, is uncommon on peaches, but its presence can be higher when the incidence of brown rot is low [
  <a rid="B35-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-foods-07-00007">35</a>]. The application of thyme or savory EO, both on nectarines and on peaches favored a reduction of brown rot incidence, but a concomitant increase of gray mold. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In accordance with the literature, 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> was very sensitive to thyme essential oil [
  <a rid="B36-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-foods-07-00007">36</a>]. The fungicidal properties of thyme EO are mainly due to thymol, recognized as the most active phenolic compound against postharvest molds [
  <a rid="B37-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-foods-07-00007">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the EO used in the trial was determined by direct injection. Principal volatile compounds present in pure thyme essential oil were thymol (26.0%), followed by 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, α-terpineol and linalool (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t002" href="#foods-07-00007-t002">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As diffusors, based on EO gel emulsions, were used to release EO vapor phase during the fruit storage, we wanted to determine the concentration of EO compounds in the atmosphere of the chambers during fruit cold storage. The analyses performed in chambers with thyme EO diffusors at 1% and 10% showed a very high amount of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene, the main volatile organic compound at 1, 14 and 28 days. Thymol, instead, was on average 2.0% during the three samplings in thyme EO at 10%, while in thyme EO at 1% thymol was 0.40%, 3.66% and 3.67% at day 1, 14 and 28, respectively. Thymol in storage chambers was released slowly and at lower concentration, compared to the pure essential oil composition. This experiment demonstrated that thymol was slowly released by diffusors during the 28 days of fruit storage in cold chambers, and persisted by increasing in absolute concentration during storage. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding savory essential oil, direct injection showed that the principal volatile compound was linalool (22.2%), followed by carvacrol (13.3%), thymol (10.7%) and eucalyptol (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t003" href="#foods-07-00007-t003">Table 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In storage room atmosphere, where savory diffusors at 10% were used, linalool and eucalyptol were the main components at the three sampling times. On the contrary, thymol and carvacrol in chambers showed a significant decrease compared to the pure EO, in fact they were present at 0.14% to 0.63% for carvacrol and at 0.17% to 0.60% for thymol at the beginning and at the end of the trial, respectively. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results showed that antifungal components of thyme and savory essential oils increased during storage, but they were a low fraction of the volatile organic compounds in the storage chambers, compared to their concentration in pure EO. For this reason, diffusors could be considered effective in a slow release of vapor EOs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal activity of thyme and savory EO in vapor phase was demonstrated by performing an in vitro test in agar plate, where 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> could germinate in an atmosphere with the same concentration present in the cabinet (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f002" href="#foods-07-00007-f002">Figure 2</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal effects depended on the type and concentration of EO, and on the pathogen species [
  <a rid="B17-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-foods-07-00007">17</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> was almost completely inhibited by savory vapors at 10%. Thyme essential oil vapors led to 40% decrease of conidial germination rate. As expected, vapor treatments were more effective in vitro, when EO concentration increased. All the EO treatments caused a significant decrease of germ tube length with respect to the untreated control (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t004" href="#foods-07-00007-t004">Table 4</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous results showed that thymol vapors inhibited 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> mycelial growth and were fatal for conidia viability; the fumigated spores resulted shrunken and with collapsed protoplasts [
  <a rid="B38-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-foods-07-00007">38</a>]. Thymol is able to crystallize on the outer surface of cell walls and exposed fungal structures were characterized by disrupted cell membranes and disorganized cytoplasmic organelles, reducing to 50% conidial viability at 2 µg/mL and to 17–23% when thymol was applied at 8 µg/mL [
  <a rid="B39-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-foods-07-00007">39</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> is much less sensitive to essential oil antimicrobial activity [
  <a rid="B40-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-foods-07-00007">40</a>]. In our experiments, the fungus confirmed to be less sensitive to EO vapors, compared to 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span> and maximum reduction of conidial germination was 40.1% for savory vapors at 10%. Germ tube length of 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> growth was inhibited only by 10% thyme treatment, while the other treatments were not statistically different from the untreated control. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In vitro tests confirmed the results obtained in fruit: the antimicrobial activity of vapor EOs does not need a direct contact. Moreover, the higher efficacy against 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span>, compared to 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> in vitro explained the higher reduction of brown rot on fruit, accompanied by a higher incidence of gray mold. This effect was particularly evident on peaches. Untreated fruit were affected exclusively by 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola,</span> while other pathogens could develop on fumigated fruits by colonizing the niche left empty by the inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">M. fructicola</span>. Thanks to the lower sensitivity of 
  <span class="italic">B. cinerea</span> to EO vapors, the pathogen could start to develop on fumigated fruit causing gray rots. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the efficacy against the postharvest rots, weight loss, color, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and carotenoids contents were analyzed during fruit storage.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of thyme EO reduced weight loss particularly on peaches (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t005" href="#foods-07-00007-t005">Table 5</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Untreated control showed the highest weight loss at the end of the storage in both trials. The efficacy of EO fumigation could be related to the formation of a coating on the fruit surface that modifies gas permeation, reducing respiration rate and water loss. Our results were in agreement with previous experiments on cherries [
  <a rid="B41-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-foods-07-00007">41</a>], grapes [
  <a rid="B42-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-foods-07-00007">42</a>], and peaches [
  <a rid="B43-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-foods-07-00007">43</a>] treated with eugenol, thymol, menthol and cinnamon vapors. The EO vapors were shown to reduce the dehydration process or weight loss in fruit [
  <a rid="B44-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-foods-07-00007">44</a>]. Other studies showed that the application of essential oils together with edible coatings could reduce the water loss [
  <a rid="B45-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-foods-07-00007">45</a>]. There are few references reporting the effect of EO treatments on fruit color. Here, ground and overcolor lightness and hue angle were monitored during storage. The lightness values of the nectarines decreased both in ground and overcolor during cold storage (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t006" href="#foods-07-00007-t006">Table 6</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences among the treatments were observed at the end of the shelf life, when treated samples showed higher values than the untreated control. Regarding peaches, no differences among the treatments were detected (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00007-t007" href="#foods-07-00007-t007">Table 7</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hue angle is a measure of ripening. In general, the hue angle values of the ground color decrease during postharvest storage, as fruit become yellow. In nectarines, the hue angle remained stable during storage, but some differences among treatments were observed and nectarines treated with EOs were yellower than the control fruit. In peaches, the ground color became yellower during storage as expected, but no differences among treatments were observed. In conclusion, the use of EOs had no negative effect on fruit color. The color variations were connected with the natural ripening process and were slowed down by cold storage. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EO vapors influenced also carotenoid content preserving the amount of these antioxidant compounds in fumigated fruit. Generally, carotenoids decrease during storage. They are photo- and heat-sensitive and tend to oxidize if they are not protected from light and atmosphere [
  <a rid="B46-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-foods-07-00007">46</a>]. In nectarines, only untreated control and fruit treated with savory EO at 1% showed a significant decrease in total carotenoid content during storage, while carotenoid amounts remained stable in the other fumigated fruit (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f003" href="#foods-07-00007-f003">Figure 3</a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the trials, fruit treated with thyme at 1% and 10% had the highest amount of carotenoids (1189 μg/kg and 1162 μg/kg, respectively). </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both on nectarines and peaches, untreated fruit showed the lowest AA content at the end of cold storage resulting statistically different from treated fruit (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00007-f004" href="#foods-07-00007-f004">Figure 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EOs preserved ascorbic acid contents, without showing statistical differences between the treatments. In peaches, fruit fumigated with savory and thyme essential oils at 1% maintained the grater ascorbic acid content at the end of the trial. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ascorbic acid content decreased significantly during cold storage, as expected, and the EO influenced the process. The decrease in ascorbic acid could be explained by the chemical properties and metabolic functions of AA in the plant cell [
  <a rid="B47-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-foods-07-00007">47</a>]. AA and dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) are important antioxidants and are used against the reactive oxygen species, produced naturally by the metabolism of vegetal cells, and accumulated during storage [
  <a rid="B48-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-foods-07-00007">48</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EOs led to a delay in the loss of total carotenoids content and AA in the pulp. Some EOs (thymol, menthol and eugenol) have shown antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging capability [
  <a rid="B49-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-foods-07-00007">49</a>]. These effects could explain the EO efficacy in reducing the loss of nutrients. Valero et al. (2006) [
  <a rid="B50-foods-07-00007" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-foods-07-00007">50</a>] suggested that the addition of thymol slowed the AA loss in grape. Nevertheless, different effects of EOs on total carotenoids content between nectarines and peaches were evident. The EOs were more effective on the metabolism of nectarines, while in peaches the action of the EOs was less evident.
