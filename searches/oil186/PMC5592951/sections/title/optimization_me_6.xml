 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of the optimization is to determine the best-suited solution to a problem under a given set of constraints. The optimization problem is represented as an intelligent search problem where one or more agents are used to determine the optimal solution on the search landscape for the desired problem population.
  <a rid="b32-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32-aabc-10-065">32</a> There are several kinds of numerical optimization methods such as neural network, gradient-based search, GA, ant colony, and PSO.

  <a rid="b33-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33-aabc-10-065">33</a> PSO is one of the most famous optimization methods that has proved its efficiency in searching for the optima. Generally, it is a population-based algorithm that can be easily implemented and applied to solve various optimization problems by searching for the optimal solution within the available solutions based on social behavior patterns of organisms that live and interact within large groups. PSO incorporates swarming behaviors observed in flocks of birds, schools of fish, or swarms of bees.
