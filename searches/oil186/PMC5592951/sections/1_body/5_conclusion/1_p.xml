<p>Reliance on natural products has become an important trend in many fields as the alternative medicine, which depends on using the natural anti-organisms in fighting bacteria, fungi and tumoral infections. One of the most efficient anti-organisms extracted from the plants is the EO that proves its efficiency as antibacterial agents. This article presents a new computational tool known as EOROT in an attempt to determine the best and optimal EO in inhibiting the activity of the bacteria growth. Furthermore, EOROT has the ability to increase the EOâ€™s utilization by using it in inhibiting multiple kinds of bacteria, which, in turn, will save the cost of materials. On the other hand, the extracted information from the EOROT tool could be used to predict the efficiency of the EOs in inhibiting the other types of bacterial activities that may decrease the time also. The weak point in this research is the limited number of EOs and types of bacteria used in the case study, with the research based on only 24 EOs tested toward 17 kinds of bacteria. Thus, in the future work, the EOROT will be developed to handle a larger number of data and also it will be enhanced to predict the activity of the EOs.</p>
