<p>Neves et al have presented a decision system for predicting the biological activity of the 
 <italic>Schinus</italic> characterized by a variability in its chemical composition depending on its geographical and seasonal growing. The proposed study was conducted with the objective to characterize the founding of a computational framework that uses the knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to set the structure of the information and the associated inference mechanisms by using a logic programming-based approach to the knowledge representation and reasoning complemented with a computational framework based on ANNs. This model has achieved an accuracy of ~85% in predicting the pharmacological activity of the 
 <italic>Schinus</italic> EOs.
