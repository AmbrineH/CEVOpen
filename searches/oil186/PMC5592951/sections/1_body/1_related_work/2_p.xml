<p>Daynac et al have developed a computational model to evaluate the use of the ANNs for predicting the antimicrobial activity of EOs. The suggested model was fast artificial neural network (FANN) software that used 49 EOs with definition of their chemical compositions as the network inputs; the output data reflected the antimicrobial activity of these EOs against four common pathogens: “
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>”, “
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>”, “
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>”, and “
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>”. The ANN has proved its efficiency in predicting &gt;70% of the antimicrobial activities within a 10 mm maximum error range by disk diffusion assays.
