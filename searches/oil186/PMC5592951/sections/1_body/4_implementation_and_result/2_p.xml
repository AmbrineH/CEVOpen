<p>By completing the compound’s reduction process, the noninfluential compounds in the EO’s composition will be neglected according to the indiscernibility relation in the RS algorithm that preserves only the core of these compounds that have a vital impact in the EO’s activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-aabc-10-065">Figure 3</xref> displays the difference between the number of EOs’ compounds before and after applying the reduction process using EOROT.
