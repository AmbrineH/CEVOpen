<p class="p">In this section, the EOROT will be practically applied on the 24 EOs, which are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-aabc-10-065" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The suggested EOs have &gt;850 compounds; many of them are not vital compounds in the chemical compositions. As discussed in the previous section, the first phase in EOROT is the reduction process that is based on the reduction of compounds and establishing of logic rules. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-aabc-10-065" class="xref">Table 4</xref> displays the results after implementing the process of compoundsâ€™ reduction.
