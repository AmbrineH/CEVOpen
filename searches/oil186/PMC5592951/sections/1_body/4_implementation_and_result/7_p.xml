<p class="p">Thus, it could be concluded that the proposed computational tool “EOROT” enhances the process of finding the optimal EO that can inhibit the growth activity of the bacteria with the best MIC rate. In addition, EOROT takes into consideration how to boost the utilization of the available EOs, for instance
