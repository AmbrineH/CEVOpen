<p class="p">This article presents a new optimization tool based on EO reduction (Essential Oil Reduction and Optimization Tool [EOROT]) for enhancing the classification process of the EOs according to their antibacterial influence rate. The developed EOROT tool is based on three main phases. Determining the EOsâ€™ chemical composition is the first phase. Second, reducing the huge number of these chemical compounds by specifying the main antibacterial compounds and establishing some logic rules to finding the relation between these compounds. Finally, finding the EOs that have high antibacterial activities and searching for the most-suited EO for every type of the bacteria.
