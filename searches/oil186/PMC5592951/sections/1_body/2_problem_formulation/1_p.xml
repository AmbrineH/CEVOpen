<p>The EO is a complex mixture of a huge number of compounds. Some of these compounds are characterized by their high antimicrobial activity such as aldehydes, phenols, and terpene alcohols (e.g., cinnamaldehyde, citral, carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol), while other compounds such as ketones or esters (e.g., β-myrcene, α-thujone, and geranyl acetate) have a limited activity against the microbes. On the other hand, EOs that contain terpene hydrocarbons were usually inactive in facing the microbial infection.
 <xref rid="b7-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The traditional chemical methods used for extracting and analyzing the EOs to determine their chemical composition are usually expensive and complicated due to the variation in the structure and concentration percentage of the EO compositions.
 <xref rid="b3-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Developing a computational tool may have a significant role in decreasing the time and cost of chemical analysis and in determining the most proper EO that has the optimal antibacterial activity, especially for the scientific industries that are based on using the EOs as antibacterials or antioxidants.
