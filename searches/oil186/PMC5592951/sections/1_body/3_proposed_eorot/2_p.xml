<p>It is commonly known that the activity of the bacteria may be repressed by more than one type of anti-organisms, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-aabc-10-065">Table 2</xref>. The EO, which is labeled as one of the most famous anti-organisms (anti-bacteria), can inhibit the bacteria growing with variant ratios according to the MIC rate. Testing the EOs against the bacteria and measuring the MIC can be done via many types of antimicrobial screening methods such as well-diffusion method and disk diffusion method (DDM). This research is based on the second method.
 <xref rid="b24-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Some EOs have limited impact on specific types of bacteria, while others have wide anti-bacterial impact. Thus, it is a difficult issue to determine the EOs that contain the suitable antibacterial compounds that can achieve the desired inhibition for the bacterial growth due to the huge number of compounds in their chemical composition as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-aabc-10-065">Table 1</xref>. Herein, the importance of the reduction process appears in an attempt to abstract the chemical compounds and retain only those that have a high antibacterial impact.
