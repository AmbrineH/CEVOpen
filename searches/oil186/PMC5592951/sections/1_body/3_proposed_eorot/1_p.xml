<p>The suggested EOs presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-aabc-10-065">Table 1</xref> are commonly characterized by their antibacterial effects, especially for certain types of bacteria listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-aabc-10-065">Table 2</xref>. The influence of the EO on inhibiting the bacteria activity can be measured by several methods such as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
 <xref rid="b8-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The selected 24 EOs were tested on 17 types of bacteria, and the activities of the EOs against these bacteria were studied via the presence or the absence of inhibition zones according to MIC measure, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-aabc-10-065">Table 2</xref>.
 <xref rid="b8-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="b26-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The MIC can be defined as the lowest concentration of the EO at which the bacteria do not show visible growth after overnight incubation.
