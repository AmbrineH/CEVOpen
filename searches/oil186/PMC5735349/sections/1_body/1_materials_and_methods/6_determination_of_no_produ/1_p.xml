<p>RAW264.7 cells (1.8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were plated in 24 well-plates for 24 h and then cultured with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of LEO (0.01 %, 0.02 %, and 0.04 %) for 24 h. The amount of nitrite that accumulated in the culture medium was measured and used as an indicator of NO production. Briefly, 100 μl of cell culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of 1 X Griess reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was then measured at 540 nm. A fresh culture medium was used as the blank in every experiment.
