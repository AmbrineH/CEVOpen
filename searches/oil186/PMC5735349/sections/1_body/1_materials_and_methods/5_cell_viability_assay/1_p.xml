<p>The cytotoxicity of LEO against RAW264.7 cells was examined via an MTT assay. RAW264.7 cells (1.8 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were plated in 96-well plates for 24 h and then treated with aliquots of LEO at 37 C for 24 h. MTT solution was added to each well for 4 h. The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration. The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in DMSO and absorbance was measured at 540 nm.
