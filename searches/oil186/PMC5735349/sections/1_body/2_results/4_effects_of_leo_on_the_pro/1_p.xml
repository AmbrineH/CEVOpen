<p>We further investigated the effects of LEO on the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>, the production of IL-6 and TNF-α was considerably increased by LPS but significantly inhibited by LEO in a dose-dependent manner.
