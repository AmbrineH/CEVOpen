<p>Western blot analyses were used to determine whether the inhibitory activity of LEO on the production of NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> was related to the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2. The data shown in Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref> demonstrate that the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 in the LPS-stimulated cells increased when compared with the untreated control. However, LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) inhibited LPS-induced increases in iNOS and COX-2 levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the inhibitory effects of LEO on the production of NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub>.
