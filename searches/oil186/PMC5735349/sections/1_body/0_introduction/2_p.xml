<p>Nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB) regulates a variety of genes associated with immune and acute-phase inflammatory responses. The activation of NF-κB due to pro-inflammatory stimulation is indicated by rapid phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitors of kappa B (IκBs) (Rajapakse et al., 2008[

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). They then induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α (Makarov, 2000[

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; Hsieh et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are one of the major kinases involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, stress responses, differentiation, and immune defense (Liu et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). MAPKs comprise three major subgroups, namely, p38 MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Their activation plays an important role in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and in the production of cytokines (Rajapakse et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; Rao, 2001[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Therefore, MAPK and NF-κB may be effective as anti-inflammatory agents.
