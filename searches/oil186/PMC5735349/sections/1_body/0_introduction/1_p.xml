<p>Prolonged inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Inflammation is caused by pro-inflammatory mediators, including both pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, and pro-inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Ljung et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; Walsh et al., 2005[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). Therefore, inhibition of these inflammatory mediators is an important target pathway in the treatment of diseases with anti-inflammatory components.
