 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]). For this reason, we selected LPS as an inflammatory stimulant for the study. The production of NO by iNOS due to stimulation with LPS plays an important role in inflammation (McCann et al., 2005[
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]). Similar to NO, PGE
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> is an inflammatory mediator generated at inflammatory sites by COX-2, which is involved in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Lipsky, 1999[

 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]). Thus, reducing the levels of NO, PGE
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>, iNOS, and COX-2 may be an attractive target for confirming anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are known to contribute to inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with LEO inhibited the production of NO and PGE
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> by reducing LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2. Moreover, LEO reduced LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production. Other studies have similarly reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of essential oils is associated with the suppression of mediators such as PGE
