<p class="p">MAPKs are the major components of the signaling pathway that leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, it is known that MAPKs play an important role in inflammatory signaling in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Hommes et al., 2003[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]; Nakano et al., 1998[
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]). Furthermore, p38 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-Î±, in LPS-induced macrophage responses (Bhat et al., 1998[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]). In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK is thought to be implicated in the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in LPS-induced macrophage responses (Ajizian et al., 1999[
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]; Bhat et al., 1998[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]). Other studies have reported that JNK is primarily implicated in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Chan and Riches, 1998[
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; Uto et al., 2005[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]). Therefore, we assessed the MAPK signaling pathway to elucidate the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of LEO in LPS-activated macrophages. The results showed that pretreatment with LEO resulted in a significant suppression of JNK, ERK, and p38 phosphorylation in the LPS-activated macrophages.
