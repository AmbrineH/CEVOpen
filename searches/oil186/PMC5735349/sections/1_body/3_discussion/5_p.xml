<p class="p">NF-κB is a mammalian transcription factor that regulates many genes, including those involved the expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are important in immune and inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Barnes and Karin, 1997[
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is present as a quiescent form bound to the inhibitory protein IκB in the cytosol (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). Upon stimulation with LPS, IκB is degraded, which permits the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex, where it binds kb sites and activates the gene transcription of iNOS, COX-2, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Surh et al., 2001[
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). In our studies, LEO attenuated IκB-α degradation and suppressed NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. This suggests that it inhibits the activation of inflammatory mediators by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway during the activation of macrophages.
