<p>Nerolidol, the major component of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Peperomia serpens</italic>, has been shown to inhibit carrageenan-induced paw and ear edema in mice (Pinheiro et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Fonseca et al. (2016[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of nerolidol via its inhibitions of carrageenan-induced paw edema formation and LPS-stimulated IL-6 and IL-1β production in peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activities of α-humulene and (-)-trans-caryophyllene have been demonstrated via their inhibition of the production of different inflammatory mediators in carrageenan-treated rats (Fernandes et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In addition, other minor compounds present in LEO, such as α-pinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene, dl-limonene, geraniol, and bornyl acetate, have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities (Chen and Viljoen, 2010[
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; d'Alessio et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; Rufino et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], 2015[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; Wu et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activity of LEO could be attributed to its major constituents or a synergetic action among the constituents present in the oil.
