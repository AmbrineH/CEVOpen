 <p> Effect of LEO on IL-6 and TNF-α production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Cells (1.8 × 10 5 cells/ml) were stimulated by LPS (1 μg/μl) for 24 h in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %). Supernatants were collected, and the IL-6 and TNF-α concentration in the supernatants was determined by ELISA. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. </p>)
