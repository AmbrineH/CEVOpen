 <p> Effect of LEO on phosphorylation of NF-κB in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.8 × 10 6 cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 18 h, and the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/μl) in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) for 30 min. The levels of p-p50, p 50, p-IκB-α and IκB-α were determined using Western blot method. </p>)
