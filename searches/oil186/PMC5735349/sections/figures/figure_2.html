 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Effect of LEO on NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Cells (1.8 × 10 5 cells/ml) were stimulated by LPS (1 μg/μl) for 24h in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %). (A) Cytotoxicity of LEO was assessed by MTT. Supernatants were collected, and the (B) NO and (C) PGE 2 concentration in the supernatants was determined using Griess reaction and the enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. </p>)
