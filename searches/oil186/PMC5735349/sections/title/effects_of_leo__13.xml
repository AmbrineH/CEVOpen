  <sub>2</sub> in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of LEO by evaluating the production of NO and PGE
  <sub>2</sub> in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 2B
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>, NO production was substantially higher in LPS-treated cells than in the untreated cells. However, LEO suppressed NO production in the LPS-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 0.04 % LEO to the cells caused a reduction in LPS-induced NO production by 86.1 %. Moreover, results of the PGE
  <sub>2</sub> assays revealed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of PGE
  <sub>2 </sub>production by LEO in the LPS-activated cells. PGE
  <sub>2</sub> production was inhibited by 54.1, 65.8, and 71.8 % by LEO at concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %, respectively (Figure 2C
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">(Fig. 2)</a>).
