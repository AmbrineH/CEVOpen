 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further investigated the effects of LEO on the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 4
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">(Fig. 4)</a>, the production of IL-6 and TNF-α was considerably increased by LPS but significantly inhibited by LEO in a dose-dependent manner.
