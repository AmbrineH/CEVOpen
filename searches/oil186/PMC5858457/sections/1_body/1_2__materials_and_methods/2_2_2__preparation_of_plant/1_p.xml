<p class="p">The seed pods were shade dried for 7–10 days. The dried seed pods were powdered mechanically using a commercial electrical stainless steel blender and the powdered seed pod (200 g) was extracted with hexane (350 mL), petroleum benzene (350 mL), chloroform (350 mL), ethyl acetate (350 mL), and acetone (350 mL) in a Soxhlet apparatus (boiling point 60–85 °C) for 7 h. Finally, the crude extract was concentrated to reduce the solvent content by using a rotary evaporator (Superfit, Mumbai, India, Model-R/150/01) under reduced pressure 23–27 mm Hg at 48 °C, with the resultant residue stored at room temperature.</p>
