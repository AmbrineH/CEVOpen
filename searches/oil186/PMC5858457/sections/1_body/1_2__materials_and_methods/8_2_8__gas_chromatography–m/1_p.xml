<p class="p">Clarus 680 was used in the analysis, which employed a fused silica column, packed with Elite-5MS (5% biphenyl 95% dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 250 μm df), and the components were separated using helium as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was set at 260 °C during the chromatographic run. One microliter of extract sample was injected into the instrument. The oven temperature was as follows: 60 °C (2 min), followed by 300 °C at the rate of 10 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and then 300 °C, where it was held for 6 min. The mass detector conditions were: transfer line temperature 240 °C, ion source temperature 240 °C, and ionization mode electron impact at 70 eV, a scan time 0.2 s, and scan interval of 0.1 seconds. Considering fragments from 40 to 600 Da, the spectrums of the components were compared with the database of spectrum of known components stored in the GC-MS NIST (2008) library (mass spectrometry database). The GC-MS analysis was carried out in the Sophisticated Instrument Facility, (SAIF).Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.
