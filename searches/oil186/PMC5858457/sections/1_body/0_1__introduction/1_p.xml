Chemical pyrethroids have been relied upon as the insecticides of choice for mosquito control, due to their low mammalian toxicity and quick knockdown activity. In many parts of the world, mosquito vectors have developed resistance against the synthetic chemical insecticides, thus rendering their use for control in some areas ineffective [
