 <italic>Vachellia nilotica</italic>, widely known as 
 <italic>Acacia nilotica</italic>, belongs to the Fabaceae family, and is present in India and other parts of the world. This plant is used as medicine for humans and animals. Chronic larval toxicity from 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> stem bark acetone extracts against major mosquito species has been reported by Chaubal et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00388" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Acute toxicity of acetone leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> at 212.1 mg/L and chronic toxicity at 144.2 mg/L was observed in larval 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>; in addition, these extracts have shown the ability to suppress egg hatchability and adult emergence [
