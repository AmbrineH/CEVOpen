<p class="p">Nature provides several bioactive compounds for the control of mosquitoes, namely plant-derived products, marine algal-derived products, microbial-derived products, and other biological compounds. The use of biological-derived products of plant origin is recommended because they are effective, environmentally friendly, and generally have a low toxicity [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-00388" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Plant oils have rich sources of secondary bioactive metabolites that can be obtained from the nonwoody parts, particularly leaves and seeds through steam distillation or hydrodistillation. Essential oils are rich in species belonging to Rutaceae, Asteraceae, Umbelliferae, Myrtaceae, and Lamiaceae families [
