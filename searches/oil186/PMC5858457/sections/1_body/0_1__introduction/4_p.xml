<p class="p">Commercial available plant-derived essential oils and secondary metabolites are very effective as for good repellents and their insecticidal agents can be incorporated into integrated vector control approaches [

 <italic class="italic">A. nilotica</italic> seed pods are reported to contain saponins, terpenes, and tannins, all of which display antiparasitic activity [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-00388" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Although 
 <italic class="italic">A. nilotica</italic> crude extracts have insecticidal activity [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-00388" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-00388" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], there are no reports of seed pod extracts and seed essential oils being used as mosquito control agents. Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the mosquitocidal activity of seed oil and seed pod solvent extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nilotica</italic> against three important mosquito vectors.
