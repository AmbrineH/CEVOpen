<p class="p">While the development and use of botanically derived compounds can be cost effective in developing countries, there are still may issues which need to be addressed in order to allow for large-scale production. The current results clearly show that hydrodistilled essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A. nilotica</italic> seeds has strong mosquitocidal activity against major mosquito species. 
 <italic class="italic">A. nilotica</italic> seed hydrodistilled essential oil harbors bioactive molecules like hexadecane and heptacosane, which can be isolated and further tested for effective mosquitocidal activity. Future evaluation on the separation of the active principles responsible for the mosquitocidal activity can further facilitate the development of ecofriendly plant-based pesticide for controlling mosquito vectors.
