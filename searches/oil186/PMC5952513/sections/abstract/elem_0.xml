   <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</span> has insecticidal effect in Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, the essential oil from the dried 
   <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> plant was used as a larvicidal compound against the malaria mosquitoes, 
   <span class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</span> and

   <span class="italic">Zanthoxylum</span> essential oil were investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). The larvicidal bioassays of the whole oil, as well as the main compounds in the oil (estragole and eucalyptol) were performed using WHO method.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 63 main compounds (99.32%) were found in the oils, including estragole (15.46%), eucalyptol (10.94%), β-caryophyllene (5.52%), 
   <span class="italic">cis</span>-linalool oxide (3.76%), 
   <span class="italic">cis</span>-limonene oxide (3.06%). A dose-dependent effect on mortality was recorded with increasing concentrations of essential oil and compounds increasing mortality of the larvae. Larvicidal bioassays revealed that 24 h LC
   <sub>50</sub> of the whole essential oil was 36.00 mg/L and LC
   <sub>90</sub> was 101.49 mg/L against 
   <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span>, while LC
   <sub>50</sub> was 49.02 mg/L and LC
   <sub>90</sub> was 125.18 mg/L against 
   <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>. Additionally, 24 h LC
   <sub>50</sub> of estragole were 38.56 and 41.67 mg/L against 
   <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>, respectively, while the related LC
   <sub>90</sub> were 95.90 and 107.89 mg/L. LC
   <sub>50</sub> of eucalyptol were 42.41 and 45.49 mg/L against 
   <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>, while the related LC
   <sub>90</sub> were 114.45 and 124.95 mg/L.
