 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 63 main compounds (99.32%) were found in the oils, including estragole (15.46%), eucalyptol (10.94%), β-caryophyllene (5.52%), 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-linalool oxide (3.76%), 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-limonene oxide (3.06%). A dose-dependent effect on mortality was recorded with increasing concentrations of essential oil and compounds increasing mortality of the larvae. Larvicidal bioassays revealed that 24 h LC
  <sub>50</sub> of the whole essential oil was 36.00 mg/L and LC
  <sub>90</sub> was 101.49 mg/L against 
  <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span>, while LC
  <sub>50</sub> was 49.02 mg/L and LC
  <sub>90</sub> was 125.18 mg/L against 
  <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>. Additionally, 24 h LC
  <sub>50</sub> of estragole were 38.56 and 41.67 mg/L against 
  <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>, respectively, while the related LC
  <sub>90</sub> were 95.90 and 107.89 mg/L. LC
  <sub>50</sub> of eucalyptol were 42.41 and 45.49 mg/L against 
  <span class="italic">An. anthropophagus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">An. sinensis</span>, while the related LC
  <sub>90</sub> were 114.45 and 124.95 mg/L.
