  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> has insecticidal effect in Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, the essential oil from the dried 
   <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> plant was used as a larvicidal compound against the malaria mosquitoes, 
   <italic>Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> and 
   <italic>Anopheles sinensis.</italic>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Compounds in the 
   <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> essential oil were investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). The larvicidal bioassays of the whole oil, as well as the main compounds in the oil (estragole and eucalyptol) were performed using WHO method.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">In total, 63 main compounds (99.32%) were found in the oils, including estragole (15.46%), eucalyptol (10.94%), β-caryophyllene (5.52%), 
   <italic>cis</italic>-linalool oxide (3.76%), 
   <italic>cis</italic>-limonene oxide (3.06%). A dose-dependent effect on mortality was recorded with increasing concentrations of essential oil and compounds increasing mortality of the larvae. Larvicidal bioassays revealed that 24 h LC
   <sub>50</sub> of the whole essential oil was 36.00 mg/L and LC
   <sub>90</sub> was 101.49 mg/L against 
   <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic>, while LC
   <sub>50</sub> was 49.02 mg/L and LC
   <sub>90</sub> was 125.18 mg/L against 
   <italic>An. sinensis</italic>. Additionally, 24 h LC
   <sub>50</sub> of estragole were 38.56 and 41.67 mg/L against 
   <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
   <italic>An. sinensis</italic>, respectively, while the related LC
   <sub>90</sub> were 95.90 and 107.89 mg/L. LC
   <sub>50</sub> of eucalyptol were 42.41 and 45.49 mg/L against 
   <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
   <italic>An. sinensis</italic>, while the related LC
   <sub>90</sub> were 114.45 and 124.95 mg/L.

  <p id="Par4">The essential oil of 
   <italic>Z. acanthopodium</italic> and its several major compounds may have potential for use in the control of malaria mosquitoes.
