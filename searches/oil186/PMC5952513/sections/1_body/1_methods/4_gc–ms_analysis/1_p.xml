<p id="Par12" class="p">The oils were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed using a GC–MS 6890-5975 system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). For GC–MS detection, an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV was used. Helium gas (1 mL/min) was used as carrier gas. Injector and mass transfer line temperatures were set at 250 and 280 °C, respectively. EO solution (1 μL) in hexane was injected and analysed under the following column conditions: initial column temperature at 40 °C for 1 min, increased to 250 °C at a 3 °C/min heating ramp, and maintained at 250 °C for 20 min. Kovats indices were calculated for all of the volatile components by using a homologous series of

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8</sub>–C
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25</sub>) in an HP-5 MS column. The major oil components were identified by co-injection with standards (whenever possible) and confirmed using the Wiley (V.7.0) and National Institute of Standards and Technology V.2.0 GC–MS library on the basis of Kovats indices. The relative concentration of each compound in the oil was quantified on the basis of the peak area integrated in the analysis program.
