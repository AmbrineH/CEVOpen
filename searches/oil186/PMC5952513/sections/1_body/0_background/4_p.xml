 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> is a shrub or small tree in the 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> genus of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> family, native to southern China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, Laos, Burma, northern Thailand Vietnam, Indonesia, and Peninsular Malaysia. It has 5–13 alternate leaves with serrated edge (3–8 cm long and 1–2 cm wide) and axillary inflorescences with densely globose clusters of unisexual flowers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Much like the closely related 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum piperitum</italic>, it has similar tongue-numbing characteristic seed pericarps, which are often used as spices in cooking, and traditional Chinese medicine reported great effect on contraception, relieving pain and killing parasites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Additionally, the hydrodistilled essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic>, with many active ingredients, is a novel agent with special effect. In the present study, the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> was determined and its larvicidal activity was evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic>.
