 <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> is a shrub or small tree in the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> genus of 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> family, native to southern China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, Laos, Burma, northern Thailand Vietnam, Indonesia, and Peninsular Malaysia. It has 5–13 alternate leaves with serrated edge (3–8 cm long and 1–2 cm wide) and axillary inflorescences with densely globose clusters of unisexual flowers [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum piperitum</italic>, it has similar tongue-numbing characteristic seed pericarps, which are often used as spices in cooking, and traditional Chinese medicine reported great effect on contraception, relieving pain and killing parasites [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic>, with many active ingredients, is a novel agent with special effect. In the present study, the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> was determined and its larvicidal activity was evaluated against 
 <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic>An. sinensis</italic>.
