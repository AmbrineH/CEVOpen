<p id="Par6" class="p">Among mosquitoes, 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> is the only vector of human malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] and, of these, 30–40 species commonly transmit parasites of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles sinensis</italic> have been chosen as the test target mosquito species in this research, because they are rife and harmful in China. The mosquito 
 <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic> is a member of the 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles hyrcanus</italic> group, distinguished from other series by the presence of pale bands (usually four) on the palpi and a tuft of dark scales on the clypeus on each side. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> is a major vector in central China, able to spread malaria 18–20 times better than 
 <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. The larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic> live on the surface of water. Compared to adults, the ability of larvae to escape the insecticide is limited, so the time from larvae to adult is an important period to control mosquitoes [
