<p id="Par6">Among mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> is the only vector of human malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and, of these, 30–40 species commonly transmit parasites of the genus 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. 
 <italic>Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles sinensis</italic> have been chosen as the test target mosquito species in this research, because they are rife and harmful in China. The mosquito 
 <italic>An. sinensis</italic> is a member of the 
 <italic>Anopheles hyrcanus</italic> group, distinguished from other series by the presence of pale bands (usually four) on the palpi and a tuft of dark scales on the clypeus on each side. 
 <italic>Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> is a major vector in central China, able to spread malaria 18–20 times better than 
 <italic>An. sinensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The larvae of 
 <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
 <italic>An. sinensis</italic> live on the surface of water. Compared to adults, the ability of larvae to escape the insecticide is limited, so the time from larvae to adult is an important period to control mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].
