 <italic>g</italic> of dried plant material yielded 7.2 mL (0.36%, v/w) of a light- yellow oil with a distinct smell. The GC–MS analysis of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> essential oil revealed 63 components representing 99.32% of the oil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The composition was 13.98% monoterpene hydrocarbon fraction, 24.24% oxygenated monoterpene fraction, 16.60% sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction, 13.75% oxygenated sesquiterpenoid fraction, 21.57% phenylpropanoids and 9.18% others. The main components of the oil were estragole (15.46%), eucalyptol (10.94%), β-caryophyllene (5.52%),
