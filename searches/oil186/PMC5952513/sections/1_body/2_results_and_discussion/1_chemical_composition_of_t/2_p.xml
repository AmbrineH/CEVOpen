<p id="Par16" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> essential oil, main compounds were estragole, eucalyptol and β-caryophyllene. They were often reported in the essential oil extracted from different kinds of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> plants. Estragole is a component isolated from various trees and plants and its extraction from 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> plants has been described but is relatively rare. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>] showed that in the essential oil of fresh fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum schinifolium</italic>, estragole was the major compound (69.52%). Eucalyptol was common in many plants including 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> plants in related literature. Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] showed that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum avicennae</italic> leaves and stems had high content of monoterpenoids including 53.05% eucalyptol. Prieto et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] determined the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum monophyllum</italic> oil were eucalyptol (9.19%); Eiter et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] analysed the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum clava</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">herculis</italic> and found the content of eucalyptol ranged from 16 to 43%. Similar research was also carried out on the essential oil from the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum bungeanum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum rhetsoides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum myriacanthum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>], the content of eucalyptol is 16.0% 15.7% and 18%, respectively. β-Caryophyllene, is also a common constituent in many 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> essential oils. It reported to be found in the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum newbouldia</italic> leaves (36%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum syncarpum</italic> (9.2–9.3%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> leaves (3.0%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum rubescens</italic> leaf (22.1%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum setulosum</italic> (13.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum ekmanii</italic> (11.5%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum procerum</italic> leaves (7.0%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The results indicate that the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. acanthopodium</italic> essential oil shares some similar main constituents with other species of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic>.
