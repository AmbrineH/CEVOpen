<p id="Par18">Mosquitoes, including 
 <italic>An. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>An. anthropophagus</italic> used in these experiments, act as vectors for many disease-causing viruses and cause serious health problems worldwide in both humans and animals. Although 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> is a known potential source of anthelmintic agents for traditional Chinese medicine, only a few studies have assessed the anti-mosquito activity of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species. Trongtokit et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] showed that the essential oil from 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum limonella</italic> had repellent effect against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles dirus</italic>. Effects of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 54 ppm), 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 58 ppm) and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49 ppm) was analysed by Tiwary et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum articulatum</italic> was examined with respect to its larvicidal properties against the larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and showed that LC
 <sub>50</sub> was 77.62 ppm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Essential oil of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum piperitum</italic> had insecticidal effect against 
 <italic>Aedes gardnerii</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles barbirostris</italic>, 
 <italic>Armigeres subalbatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex gelidus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex vishnui</italic> group, and 
 <italic>Mansonia uniformis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The related activity of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum beecheyanum</italic> was also reported, 24 h LC
 <sub>50</sub> was 6.895 mg/mL against 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> adults and 119.020 mg/mL against 4 instar larvae [
