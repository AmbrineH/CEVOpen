<p id="Par19">When comes to the larvicidal mechanism of the 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> essential oil, it can be attributed to some compounds in the oil that can lead to alteration in the membrane structure of larval cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], especially estragole, eucalyptol, β-caryophyllene and limonene, whose separated insecticidal effect have been revealed in a series of reports. Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] showed estragole had strong contact toxicity against 
 <italic>Lasioderma serricorne</italic> adults with 24 h LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.58 mg/adult, and in the fumigant toxicity test, the 24 h LD
 <sub>50</sub> was 5.18 mg/L air. When against 
 <italic>Maize weevils</italic>, 24 h LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of estragole was 14.10 ppm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Kimbaris et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] showed that 24 h LC
 <sub>50</sub> of eucalyptol was inactive at concentrations even as high as 100 mg/L against early fourth instar mosquito larvae of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>. Against the 3rd instars of the 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> 24 h LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of eucalyptol was 91.45 mg/L [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The current study proved that estragole and eucalyptol played important role as insecticidal compounds in 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> essential oil against two anopheline mosquito species. Yang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] showed that eugenol was the most significant compounds of 
 <italic>Clove Bud</italic> oils with reference to repellent activity against the bean bugs 
 <italic>Riptortus clavatus</italic>. You et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] showed that β-caryophyllene, exhibited strong insecticidal and repellent activities against 
 <italic>Lasioderma serricorne</italic>. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] showed the limonene LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.21 mg/L for 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and 14.07 mg/L air 
 <italic>for L. serricorne</italic>.
