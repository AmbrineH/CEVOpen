 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using medicinal plants to treat coincides with a human life history. Natural remedies, especially herbal drugs, have been considered as the basis and even in some cases the only method of treatment.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] The use of this treatment method has a history of all civilizations and is an important component in the development of common medical science. Although, in the past half century, the use of chemical and synthetic drugs has become extremely popular, their side effects made re-orientation to medicinal plants. It is well known that the uses of medicinal plants have been historically one of the effective treatment methods. Although plants have always been and are regarded as a valuable resource for humans, enough scientific investigations have not been done on them, and there are still largely unknown plants in the world. Consequently, there are thousands of new unknown compounds in nature that can be used not only as drugs but also as a leader to make other synthetic drugs.[
