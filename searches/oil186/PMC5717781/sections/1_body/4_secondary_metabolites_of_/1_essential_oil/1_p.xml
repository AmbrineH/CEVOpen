<p>The major chemical constituents of the essential oil of different species of 
 <italic>Echinophora</italic> that have been identified are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. This table shows that in most of the studies reported of 
 <italic>E. cinerea</italic>, any combination of the alpha-phellandrene compound has been identified as the highest among species diversity, but there are major differences in the other species. Differences in chemical composition of essential oils through the results and published reports can be caused by differences in the harvest season, weather conditions, geographic region of growing, parts of plants, extraction methods, and time.
