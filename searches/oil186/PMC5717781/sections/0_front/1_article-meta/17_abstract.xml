 <p class="p">This review was conducted to investigate the botany, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of 
  <italic class="italic">Echinophora</italic> species. The information of this review was obtained by searching for keywords 
  <italic class="italic">Apiaceae</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Echinophora</italic>, pharmacological effects, and traditional and modern medicine in scientific articles and books published in search engines Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Web of Science. The traditional uses of 
  <italic class="italic">Echinophora</italic> and the existence of valuable phytochemicals in the plant have led to isolation and drug discovery of natural medicines such as antibiotic, analgesics, and anticancer drugs, and the beneficial effects of these plants can widely be used in healthcare.
