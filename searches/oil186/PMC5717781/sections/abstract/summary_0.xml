 <p>This review was conducted to investigate the botany, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of 
  <span class="italic">Echinophora</span> species. The information of this review was obtained by searching for keywords 
  <span class="italic">Apiaceae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Echinophora</span>, pharmacological effects, and traditional and modern medicine in scientific articles and books published in search engines Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Web of Science. The traditional uses of 
  <span class="italic">Echinophora</span> and the existence of valuable phytochemicals in the plant have led to isolation and drug discovery of natural medicines such as antibiotic, analgesics, and anticancer drugs, and the beneficial effects of these plants can widely be used in healthcare.
