 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-FID quantitative analysis of thyme essential oil showed decrease of thymol and carvacrol concentrations; therefore innovative technological step such as incorporation of volatile oil into microcapsules should be applied. Oleogel containing thyme essential oil demonstrated antibacterial activity against
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span>. Experimental design was used to optimize mixture of colloidal silica, liquid paraffin, and olive oils for the final formulation according to the evaluation of texture parameters: cohesiveness, consistency, firmness, and index of viscosity. Correlation analysis showed significant influence of colloidal silica on texture parameters. The researches about preparations with investigated thyme essential oil in the prevention and treatment of skin damage may be extended.
