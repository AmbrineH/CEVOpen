 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial assay of the oleogels with essential oil of thyme was performed against
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans. </span>The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined after incubating the oleogels with different concentrations of thymol in Petri dishes. The results are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. The results suggest that the oleogel may be tried as matrices for drug delivery or can be alternative preparation for the chemical drugs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MIC of thyme oil of 0.25% was observed on the growth of
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans </span>strain on solid medium and colonial morphology differed from control, especially in size, and the smallest colonies were detected in the presence of thyme oil with concentration of 0.125% [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Concentration of thymol in the essential oil varies from 20% to 54% in all species of thyme and
  <span class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris</span> as well. Plenty of results of biological activity dependence on concentrations of active substances are published. According to the results of quantitative analysis of oleogel, which demonstrated decreasing concentration of active ingredients, and antimicrobial test results of this study, it was decided to formulate oleogels with 0.1% of essential oil of thyme.
