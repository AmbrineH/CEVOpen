 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The preliminary formulation of the oleogel was prepared for the suitable lower 5% and upper 8.5% limits of colloidal silica concentration for the gelation of oils. The experimental design is conducted by using Design-Expert® 6 (version 6.0.8, Stat-Easy Inc., Minneapolis, USA). A set of mixtures was formed using response surface design central composite criterion. The experimental mixture design was applied to study the effect of two-component system—colloidal silica—on the response variables: firmness, cohesiveness, consistency, and index of viscosity. The set of mixtures is shown in
