<p>Anhydrous colloidal silica is suitable for the formulation of oleogel with desired texture and chemical and physical stability. The clear gel is formed when the material is characterized by a similar refractory index as Aerosil (1.48). Incorporation of the silica into oil leads to an increase in viscosity, which is brought about by hydrogen bonding between the silica particles: 5â€“10 percent silica imparts a paste-like consistency on a range of oils [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Liquid paraffin and olive oil were chosen for the oleogel formulation with the goal of evaluating the influence of the oil origin on the texture and stability. The composition of oleogel was optimized with response surface central composite design in order to get desirable textural properties.
