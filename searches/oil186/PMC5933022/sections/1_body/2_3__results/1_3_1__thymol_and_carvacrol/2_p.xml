<p class="p">The quantitative determination of the two main components of the thyme by GC-FID method was applied for the oil and for the oleogels. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref"> Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that thymol and carvacrol peaks were well resolved from each other and displayed excellent peak symmetry and separation efficiency. The concentrations of thymol (9.61 mg/mL) and carvacrol (0.07 mg/mL) were determined in the essential oil. Quantitative analysis of oleogel containing thyme essential oil showed that thymol concentration decreased by 30% and carvacrol concentration decreased by 10% from the initial amount.
