<p>The antimicrobial assay of the oleogels with essential oil of thyme was performed against
 <italic> Candida albicans. </italic>The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined after incubating the oleogels with different concentrations of thymol in Petri dishes. The results are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. The results suggest that the oleogel may be tried as matrices for drug delivery or can be alternative preparation for the chemical drugs.
