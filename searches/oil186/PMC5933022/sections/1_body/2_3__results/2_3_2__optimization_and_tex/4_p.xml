<p>The relationship between the texture parameters and amounts of oleogel components, colloidal silica, and paraffin oil was evaluated as well. Correlation analysis between main components of oleogel and texture parameters was performed using Spearman's rank coefficient. Colloidal silica as the most important component due to the gelation ability showed high influence on the texture parameters. Correlation coefficients between the amount of Aerosil and cohesiveness, consistency, firmness, and index of viscosity were 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.978, 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.977, 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.966, and 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.726, respectively.
