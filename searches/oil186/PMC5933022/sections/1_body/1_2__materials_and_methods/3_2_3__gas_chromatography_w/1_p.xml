<p>GC-FID analyses were carried out on gas chromatograph GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, USA). Compounds were separated on Crossbond™ 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane Rxi®-5 ms, 30 m × 0,25 mmi.d., df 0,25

The injector and detector temperatures were set at 290 and 310°C, respectively. Samples were diluted individually with methanol before GC analysis. The identification of main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) was performed by comparing their retention times of the chromatographic peaks to the reference standards. The main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) were quantified using GC-FID chromatographic data and equations of linear regressions (
