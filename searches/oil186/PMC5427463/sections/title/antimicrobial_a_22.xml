 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of the SoEO to inhibit bacteria and fungi (indicator organisms) was summarized (see Table 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T3" href="#T3">(Tab. 3)</a> and 4
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T4" href="#T4">(Tab. 4)</a>). Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were inhibited by the SoEO. According to MIC and MBC values reported in Table 3
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T3" href="#T3">(Tab. 3)</a>, the SoEO showed an interesting activity against the Gram-positive pathogens (
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. luteus</span>) and also a very good activity against 
  <span class="italic">B. cereus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> with MIC values of 0.625 and 0.312 mg/mL, respectively. However, the SoEO cultivated in south Brazil, showed no activity against several 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> strains (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerning the Gram-negative bacteria, the sample was slightly active against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. enteretidis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. tumefaciens</span> which showed the lowest values of MIC (2.5 mg/ mL). Our results are similar to those previously reported in the literature, indicating that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria (Mangena and Muyima, 1999[
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">33</a>]). The microorganisms tested in this study cover some human pathogens known as opportunists for man and animals and cause food contamination and deterioration. Our results are of a great importance, particularly in the case of 
  <span class="italic">B. cereus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. enteretidis</span> which are well known for their resistance to a number of phytochemical compounds and for the production of several types of enterotoxins that cause gastroenteritis (Halpin-Dohnalek and Marth, 1989[
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>]). As shown in Table 4
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T4" href="#T4">(Tab. 4)</a>, the SoEO exhibited varying degrees of antifungal activity against all tested strains. The inhibition zones were in the range of 09 - 15 mm, with MIC values of 0.156 - 5 mg/mL. The most sensitive one was 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</span> (MIC = 0.156 mg/mL), but the SoEO showed also a very good activity against 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span> (MIC = 0.625 mg/ mL for both). Interestingly, we have demonstrated the capacity of the SoEO to control some fungal strains, particularly fungi (
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. alternata</span>) responsible for biodeterioration of food during postharvest processing, transport and storage and agricultural phytopathogenic fungi.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies reported that there is a relationship between the chemical composition of the most abundant components in the EO and the antimicrobial activity (Deans and Sbodova, 1990[
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>]). In this context, camphor, α -thujone and 1,8-cineole (herein, abundants in SoEO) are well-known chemicals having antimicrobial potentials (Pattnaik et al., 1997[
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">41</a>]). α-pinene, 2-β-pinene and limonene also had a strong antibacterial activity (Sökmen et al., 2003[
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">50</a>]). These chemical components exerted their toxic effects against microorganisms through the disruption of bacteria or fungal membrane integrity (Knobloch et al., 1989[
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">24</a>]). In addition, the SoEO contained relatively high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes (Table 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a>) and it is well known that essential oils containing high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes have strong antifungal activities compared to EO relatively rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons or sesquiterpenes (Kordali et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">26</a>]). Therefore, the obtained antibacterial and antifungal activities were related to synergistic effects between different major and minor components of the SoEO, suggesting that the SoEO may potentially be useful in food preservation and pest management.
