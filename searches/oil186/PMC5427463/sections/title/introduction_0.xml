  <span class="italic">Salvia</span> (sage) is the largest genus of the Lamiaceae family, which is native of the Mediterranean area and includes about 900 species (Walker et al., 2004[
  <a rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" href="#R55">55</a>]). From its Latin name “
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span>”, meaning to cure, it is used in folk medicine for their antibacterial (Özcan et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>]), antitumoral (Cardile et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>]), antidiabetic (Kim et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>]), and antioxidant (Kolak et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>]) activities. Sage is also used traditionally in food preparation, herbal tea (Demirci et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>]), flavoring agents in perfumery and cosmetics (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Tunisia, numerous 
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span> species were investigated. Among them, 
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span>
  <span class="italic">officinalis </span>was encountered in different national parks all along Tunisian territory and considered as a medicinal herb with an interesting essential oil (EO) potential (Chemli, 1997[
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the medicinal potential of various plants in Tunisia, at our knowledge, few studies explored the biological activities of this plant. Most of them reported antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> essential oil (SoEO) (Bouaziz et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>]; Fellah et al., 2006[
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>]; Hayouni et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>]). Furthermore, there are many reports concerning essential oils from this species in other countries (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]; Tepe et al., 2005[
  <a rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" href="#R53">53</a>]). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These properties make the SoEO very promising as a source of botanical insecticides. This aspect has been largely exploited in the case of EOs from rosemary and other aromatic plants, which are effective against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae (El Abdouni Khiyari et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a>]; Santana-Méridas et al., 2014[
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">46</a>]). At our knowledge, insecticidal activity of Tunisian SoEO has not yet been investigated. Moreover, allelopathic properties of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span> genus were also reported and the first studies that demonstrated the presence of volatile growth inhibitors produced by 
  <span class="italic">Salvia </span>species were carried out on 
  <span class="italic">S. leucophylla </span>and 
  <span class="italic">S. apiana </span>by Muller and Muller (1964[
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">37</a>]). The effects of EOs extracted from 
  <span class="italic">S. hierosolymitana</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. multicaulis </span>on germination and initial radical elongation of 
  <span class="italic">Raphanus sativus </span>L. (radish) and 
  <span class="italic">Lepidium sativum </span>L. (garden cress) showed different activities against the tested species (Mancini et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">32</a>]), while the phytotoxic activity of the SoEO from Tunisia has not been reported before.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowing that the activity of EOs from aromatic plants could be affected by several factors such as the geographical origin, the genetic background of the plant from which the EO was obtained (Pattnaik et al., 1997[
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">41</a>]), the aims of this study were (i) to determine the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> from Tunisia (ii) to assess antioxidant activity, (iii) to test antimicrobial activity against some pathogens and phytopathogen strains, (iv) to test insecticidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</span> larvae and 
  <span class="italic">Tribolium castaneum</span> adults and (v) to evaluate its effects on seed germination and radical and hypocotyl elongation.
