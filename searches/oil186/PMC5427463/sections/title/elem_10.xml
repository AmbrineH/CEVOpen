  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria and fungi strains were obtained from international culture collections (ATCC) and the local culture collection of the Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Tunisia. The bacterial strains used in this study included: 
   <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> ATCC 14579, 
   <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 25923, 
   <span class="italic">Micrococcus luteus</span> ATCC 1880 and Gram-negative bacteria: 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella enterica </span>serotype 
   <span class="italic">Enteritidis</span> (
   <span class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</span>; food isolate), 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> ATCC 25922, 
   <span class="italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> and the following fungal strains: 
   <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> CTM 10099, 
   <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span> (food isolate), 
   <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Rhizoctonia solani</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</span> (CTM10402), and 
   <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span> (CTM 10230). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria were maintained as stock cultures at -80 °C in Luria Bertoni broth medium (LB), supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol. The fungi were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 25 °C for 7 days and stored at 4 °C until use. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicator organisms (bacteria) were grown in 3 mL LB broth overnight at 37 °C. For the test, final inoculum concentrations of 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/mL were used. Fungal spore suspensions were collected from the surface of such fungal colonies by gently scraping with a loop and suspended in 3 mL Potato Dextrose broth (PDB). This suspension was mixed vigorously by vortexing for 15-20 min. The spore suspension stock was diluted to obtain a concentration of 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> spores/mL (measured by Malassez blade).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agar diffusion method </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial activities of the SoEO were assessed 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> by well diffusion method (Güven et al., 2006[
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>]), with some modifications. The SoEO was dissolved in ethanol/water (v/v) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then filtered through a sterile Millipore membrane filter (diameter 0.45 µm) and used for activity assay. 100 μL of indicator strain (approximately 10
   <span class="sup">6 </span>CFU/mL) were displayed on plate filled with LB or PDA. Wells (06 mm diameter) were drilled in the agar plates with a sterile Pasteur pipette and then 50 µL of SoEO were added to the wells. The plates were incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism and inhibition zone diameters were measured after appropriate time as described above. Gentamicin (10 μg/wells) was used as a positive control in antibacterial tests, while amphotericin B (20 μg/wells) was used as a positive control in antifungal activity. Negative control consisted of 50 % ethanol which is used to dissolve the SoEO. The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination of MIC and MMC </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC), which includes minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC), using the broth dilution method (Güllüce et al., 2007[
   <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a>]) with minor modifications against the indicator strains, used in this study. The test was performed in sterile 96-well microplates with a final volume in each microplate well of 100 μL. For susceptibility testing, 90 μL of LB broth or PDB were distributed from the second to the twelfth test wells. A stock solution of the SoEO was prepared by dissolving 100 μL of the oil in ethanol and then adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. The first well of the microplate was prepared by dispensing 170 μL of the growth medium and 10 μL of the SoEO to reach a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then 90 μL of scalar dilutions were transferred from the second to the ninth well. Thereafter, 10 μL of indicator strain (final inoculum concentrations of 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/mL for bacteria and 10
   <span class="sup">6 </span>spores/mL for fungi) were added to each well. The final extract concentrations adopted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity were 0.039 to 10 mg/ mL. The tenth well was considered as positive growth control containing LB media for bacterial strains while PDB was used for fungi, since no essential oil solution was added. Another well containing 50 % ethanol (v/v), without SoEO, was used as a negative control. The plates were then covered with sterile plate covers and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 72 h for fungi at 28 °C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the total EO at which the microorganism does not demonstrate visible growth after incubation. As an indicator of microorganism growth, 25 μL of 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg/mL) dissolved in sterile water were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (Eloff, 1998[
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>]). When microbial growth was inhibited, the solution in the well remained clear after incubation with MTT. The MMCs were determined by serial subcultivation of 10 μL in LB or PDA plates and incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC and the MFC, indicating ≥ 99.5 % killing of the original inoculum. 50 % ethanol was used as a negative control. The determinations of MIC, MBC and MFC values were done in triplicate and repeated twice.
