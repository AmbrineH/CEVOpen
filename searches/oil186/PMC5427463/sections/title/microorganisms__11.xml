 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria and fungi strains were obtained from international culture collections (ATCC) and the local culture collection of the Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Tunisia. The bacterial strains used in this study included: 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> ATCC 14579, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 25923, 
  <span class="italic">Micrococcus luteus</span> ATCC 1880 and Gram-negative bacteria: 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella enterica </span>serotype 
  <span class="italic">Enteritidis</span> (
  <span class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</span>; food isolate), 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> ATCC 25922, 
  <span class="italic">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span> and the following fungal strains: 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> CTM 10099, 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</span> (food isolate), 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rhizoctonia solani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</span> (CTM10402), and 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span> (CTM 10230). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bacteria were maintained as stock cultures at -80 째C in Luria Bertoni broth medium (LB), supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol. The fungi were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 25 째C for 7 days and stored at 4 째C until use. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicator organisms (bacteria) were grown in 3 mL LB broth overnight at 37 째C. For the test, final inoculum concentrations of 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> CFU/mL were used. Fungal spore suspensions were collected from the surface of such fungal colonies by gently scraping with a loop and suspended in 3 mL Potato Dextrose broth (PDB). This suspension was mixed vigorously by vortexing for 15-20 min. The spore suspension stock was diluted to obtain a concentration of 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> spores/mL (measured by Malassez blade).
