 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical composition of S. officinalis essential oil</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 49 constituents, representing 97.97 % of the total oil, have been identified from the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span>. In Table 1
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="T1" href="#T1">(Tab. 1)</a> the compounds of the volatile oil and their relative percentages are listed in the order of their Kovats index. The monoterpene fraction of the oil amounted to 75.93 % with oxygen containing monoterpenes as the largest group of this fraction (48.43 %). Camphor (25.14 %), α-thujone (18.83 %), 1,8-cineole (14.14 %) and β-thujone (4.46 %) were the main compounds of the monoterpenoidic fraction. Among the sesquiterpene fraction (17.4 %), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated (9.33 %) with β-caryophyllene (3.30 %) as the major component while viridiflorol (7.98 %) was identified as the main constituent of sesquiterpene alcohol fraction. Other components were present at amount lower than 3 % of the total yield. Our composition differs from that reported by other Tunisian studies, mostly due to the different geographic experimental areas. The EO contents of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> collected from north of Tunisia, were 1,8-cineole (33.27 %), β-thujone (18.40 %), α-thujone (13.45 %), borneol (7.39 %), β-elemene (4.82 %), camphor (3.31 %) and α-pinene (2.74 %) (Hayouni et al., 2008[
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>]). Fellah et al. (2006[
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>]) found that SoEO from mountainous region in the center-west of Tunisia was mainly composed by α-thujone (26.49 %), 1,8-cineole (16.96 %), viridiflorol (13,04 %), β-thujone (11.55 %) β-caryophyllene (9.04 %), β-pinene (5.19 %) and camphre (3,38 %). However, essential oil analysis of sage from south of Tunisia revealed that β-thujone (17.76 %), 1,8-cineole (16.29 %), camphor (14.19 %), α-thujone (7.41 %), trans-Caryophyllene (5.45 %) were the major components (Bouaziz et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>]). Studies on 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> performed in Spain (Laborda et al., 2013[
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">27</a>]), Italy (Marino et al., 2001[
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">34</a>]) and Brazil (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>]) also showed a significant variation in the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> compared to our results. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the other 
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span> species, our sage was particularly rich in camphor (25.14 %), α-thujone (18.83 %), 1,8-cineole (14.14 %), viridiflorol (7.98 %), β-Thujone (4.46 %), β-Caryophyllene (3.30 %), borneol (2.81 %), α-Humulene (2.48 %), β-Myrcene (1.93 %), limonene (1.43 %), α-Terpineol (1.33 %) and bornyl acetate (1.05 %). The main characteristic constituents of SoEO found in this study, are in accordance with the profile defined by standard ISO 9909 (Bruneton, 1999[
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a>]) for official 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> essential oil, which is cis-thujone (18-43 %), camphor (4.5-24.5 %), cineole (5.5-13 %), humulene (0-12 %), trans-thujone (3-8.5 %), camphene (1.5-7 %), pinene (1-6.5 %), limonene (0.5-3 %), bornyl acetate (2.5 % maximum) and linalool [free and esterified (1 % maximum)].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This variation is probably due to the different growth habitat. Indeed, the oil composition is highly influenced by genetic (Mader et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">31</a>]), environmental factors (Bettaieb et al., 2009[
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]), the developmental stage of the plants and extraction method (Hadri et al., 2010[
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>]). Previous studies revealed that SoEO composition varies significantly depending on light intensity (Li et al., 1996[
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">29</a>]), soil mineral fertilization (Piccaglia and Marotti, 1993[
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">42</a>]), climate conditions, organ, culture site and season (Santos-Gomes and Fernandes-Ferreira, 2001[
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">47</a>]).
