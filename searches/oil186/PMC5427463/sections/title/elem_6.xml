  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of SoEO to scavenge the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured using the method described by Sahin et al. (2004[
   <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">45</a>]) with modifications. 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO prepared in methanol (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL) was added to 1.5 mL of a methanolic DPPH solution (100 µM). The measurement of absorbance was made against a blank prepared for each concentration at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature. The positive control is represented by a solution of a standard antioxidant (BHT). Its absorbance was measured under the same conditions as the samples. Absorbance values of these solutions were recorded on an ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) spectrometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The results were expressed as percent inhibition (I %) using the following Eq

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reducing power of SoEO was determined on the basis of the method of Oyaizu (1986[
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">39</a>]). 500 µL of different concentrations of SoEO (1 to 20 mg/mL) were added to 1.25 mL of phosphate buffer (200 µM, pH 6.6) and 1.25 mL of potassium hexacyanoferrate [K

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this assay, the antioxidant capacity of SoEO on inhibition of lipid peroxidation was assessed (Hui et al., 2010[
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>]). 0.2804 g of Tween 20 and 0.2804 g of linoleic acid were mixed in 50 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) to prepare the linoleic acid emulsion. 2.5 mL of linoleic acid emulsion and 2 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) were added to 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL) and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Then, 100 µL of the reaction mixture, 100 µL of ammonium thiocyanate solution (30 %) and 100 µL of ferrous chloride solution (20 mM/ in HCl) were added to 9.7 mL of ethanol (75 %). After stirring for 3 min the absorbance was measured at 500 nm. α-Tocopherol was used as a positive control solution without adding SoEO or α-tocopherol was used as blank. The percentage of antioxidant activity was determined using the following Eq. (2):
