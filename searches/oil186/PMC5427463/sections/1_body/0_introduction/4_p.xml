<p class="p">These properties make the SoEO very promising as a source of botanical insecticides. This aspect has been largely exploited in the case of EOs from rosemary and other aromatic plants, which are effective against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae (El Abdouni Khiyari et al., 2014[

 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]). At our knowledge, insecticidal activity of Tunisian SoEO has not yet been investigated. Moreover, allelopathic properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> genus were also reported and the first studies that demonstrated the presence of volatile growth inhibitors produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia </italic>species were carried out on 
 <italic class="italic">S. leucophylla </italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">S. apiana </italic>by Muller and Muller (1964[
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]). The effects of EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">S. hierosolymitana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. multicaulis </italic>on germination and initial radical elongation of 
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus </italic>L. (radish) and 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum </italic>L. (garden cress) showed different activities against the tested species (Mancini et al., 2009[
