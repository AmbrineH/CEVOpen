 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several authors have reported different compositions of essential oils obtained from different plant species (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Govindrajan 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu, 2010</a>, Zhu et al. 2011, 2012, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Rajkumar et al. 2011</a>, 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Intirach et al. 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Liu et al. 2012</a> and 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Senthilkumar et al. 2013</a>). The plants show significant variations, both in terms of number and percentage composition, of different constituents in essential oil and it appears to be the characteristics of a particular plant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The excellent larvicidal activity of the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Co. grandis</span> against three species of mosquitoes could be either due to the major components, i.e. n-tetracosane and eicosane or synergistic action of the major and minor components present in it and is difficult to pin point at this stage. Tetracosane is an alkane hydrocarbon and use of hydrocarbons as pesticidal agents is reported (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Siddique et al. 2004</a>). Similarly, there are evidences indicating larvicidal and antimicrobial activities of the other major component, eicosane (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Akpuaka et al. 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Manas et al. 2014</a>). The results show significantly improved bioefficacy against one of the mosquito species, 
  <span class="italic">An. stephensi</span> compared to earlier report which showed LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values of 93.3 and 192.6ppm, respectively (as against the 39.41 and 123.24ppm in present study) (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Rajkumar et al. 2011</a>). Similarly, the LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values against 
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> have been found to be 47.54 and 86.54ppm for 
  <span class="italic">Mentha piperita</span>, 40.50 and 85.33ppm for 
  <span class="italic">Zingiber officinale</span>, 115.60 and 193.30ppm for 
  <span class="italic">Cu. longa</span> and, 148.50 and 325.70ppm for 
  <span class="italic">Oc. basilicum</span>, respectively (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Kalaivani et al. 2012</a>) compared to 48.20 and 131.84ppm for 
  <span class="italic">Co. grandis</span> in the present study. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> values of the 
  <span class="italic">Co. grandis</span> leaf essential oils against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</span> were marginally better than essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">Acorus calamus</span> reported by 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu (2012)</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results are also in agreement with several other previous reports where the major components of essential oils have shown excellent larvicidal or insecticidal activities, eg 
  <span class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</span> leaf essential oil (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu 2010</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Clausena anisata</span> leaf essential oil (Govindrajan 2011), 
  <span class="italic">Feronia limonia</span> leaf essential oil (
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Senthilkumar et al. 2013</a>). Similarly, 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Intirach et al. (2012)</a> studied essential oils of six different plant families and demonstrated their larvicidal activity against laboratory colonized 
  <span class="italic">An. cracens</span> mosquito. A careful observation of these representative studies indicated that there was no common thread in terms of chemical constituents, in these essential oils. The composition and major and minor components of essential oil are characteristics of particular plant and, at the best may be represented in the other members of same family. The composition and larvicidal activity of essential oil of a plant may vary as a function of age of plant, geographical location and season. The observed variations in the efficacy of essential oils from various plants against different vectors could be due to different chemical compositions and/or synergistic action of major and minor components in them (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu 2012</a>). The natural diversity of essential oils in the indigenous plants thus offer good opportunity of developing a cost effective, ecofriendly, region specific and practical strategy for the control of mosquito vectors either independently or as a part of integrated vector management strategy. Though there are no reports of insecticide/larvicide resistance in the study area, the same is well documented in African countries for 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> species against all the approved four classes (organochlorines, pyrethroids, carbamates and organophosphates) of insecticides (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Kristan et al. 2003</a>). Of the four classes, resistance to pyrethroids and its mechanisms in 
  <span class="italic">An. gambiae</span>: the most important malarial vector in Africa has been extensively studied. It was found out that the insect develops resistance to insecticide either by altering its binding site, by point mutations, or by detoxifying it enzymatically before it reaches the target site (
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Tielong et al. 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pyrethroids are the insecticides of choice for mosquito control primarily because of their superior human and environment safety records (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Adedayo et al. 2012</a>). Besides, the use of insecticide mixtures and their periodic rotation, integrated vector management, involving biopesticides/essential oils of plant origins could be the answer for preventing/ delaying development of resistance in mosquitoes (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Brogdon and Allister 1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study is a step forward in the direction, demonstrating the larvicidal potential of essential oil of a locally available plant against three most common mosquito species. The chemical analysis shows a different set of major and minor components in the essential oil than the earlier reported studies which can be gainfully utilized further.</p>
