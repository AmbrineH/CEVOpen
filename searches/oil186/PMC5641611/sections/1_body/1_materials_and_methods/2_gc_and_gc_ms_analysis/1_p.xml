<p>Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of essential oil was performed using JEOL GCMS-Mate-II model gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with an AOC-20i auto injector and HP-5 capillary column (30m × 0.25mm ID × 0.25μm coating thickness) column. The injector temperature was set at 280 °C, and the oven temperature was initially set at 40 °C then programmed to increase up to 300 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min and finally held at 200 °C for 5 min. Helium gas was maintained at a flow rate 1.0ml/min as a carrier gas. One microliter of the sample diluted with acetone in 1:10 ratio was injected in the split mode. The percentage of constituents in essential oil of leaves was calculated by the GC peak areas. Data handling was made through JEOL software and the compounds were identified based on the comparison of their retention time (RT) and mass spectra of WILEY, NIST library data of the GC-MS.</p>
