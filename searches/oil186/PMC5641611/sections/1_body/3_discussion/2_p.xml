<p>The excellent larvicidal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Co. grandis</italic> against three species of mosquitoes could be either due to the major components, i.e. n-tetracosane and eicosane or synergistic action of the major and minor components present in it and is difficult to pin point at this stage. Tetracosane is an alkane hydrocarbon and use of hydrocarbons as pesticidal agents is reported (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Siddique et al. 2004</xref>). Similarly, there are evidences indicating larvicidal and antimicrobial activities of the other major component, eicosane (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Manas et al. 2014</xref>). The results show significantly improved bioefficacy against one of the mosquito species, 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> compared to earlier report which showed LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values of 93.3 and 192.6ppm, respectively (as against the 39.41 and 123.24ppm in present study) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Rajkumar et al. 2011</xref>). Similarly, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have been found to be 47.54 and 86.54ppm for 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, 40.50 and 85.33ppm for 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, 115.60 and 193.30ppm for 
 <italic>Cu. longa</italic> and, 148.50 and 325.70ppm for 
 <italic>Oc. basilicum</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kalaivani et al. 2012</xref>) compared to 48.20 and 131.84ppm for 
 <italic>Co. grandis</italic> in the present study. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values of the 
 <italic>Co. grandis</italic> leaf essential oils against larvae of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> were marginally better than essential oils of 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> reported by 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu (2012)</xref>.
