<p class="p">The excellent larvicidal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Co. grandis</italic> against three species of mosquitoes could be either due to the major components, i.e. n-tetracosane and eicosane or synergistic action of the major and minor components present in it and is difficult to pin point at this stage. Tetracosane is an alkane hydrocarbon and use of hydrocarbons as pesticidal agents is reported (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Siddique et al. 2004</xref>). Similarly, there are evidences indicating larvicidal and antimicrobial activities of the other major component, eicosane (
