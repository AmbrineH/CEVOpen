<p>Efficient control of these diseases would require a two-pronged strategy, (i) prompt treatment with effective medicines and (ii) vector control based prevention strategies. Injudicious use of medicines, particularly antimalarial drugs, has resulted in development of resistance by the malarial parasite and enhanced casualties in endemic areas (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Intirach et al. 2012</xref>). Mosquito management therefore, offers a better and practical alternative for controlling diseases mediated by them. Mosquito adulticides, causing temporary reduction in population are good but do not offer a lasting solution. Mosquito larvae being delicate, less mobile and more concentrated in their natural habitat offer a much simpler and efficient point of intervention and control (

Plant extract including essential oils or insecticides from botanical origin are attractive alternatives because they contain high amount of various bioactive compounds, many of which are selective and have little or no harmful effects on non-target organisms and environment (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dharmagadda et al. 2005</xref>). Essential oil is natural volatile substances found in many plants. Essential oils isolated from plant are generally a mixture of many constituents, primarily biologically active monoterpenes (
