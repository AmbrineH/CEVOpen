  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>To study the chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
   <italic>Coccinia grandis</italic> against three mosquito species.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods:</title>
  <p>Essential oil was extracted by hydro distillation using clevenger apparatus and was analyzed for chemical constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Larvicidal activity was recorded after 12 and 24h of post-exposure against three mosquito species, 
   <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>, 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. Dead larvae were identified when they failed to move after probing with a needle in the siphon or cervical region. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values for three mosquito larvae were calculated by Probit analysis.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The GC-MS analysis revealed that essential oil contains 23 different constituents. Out of these 23 constituents, major constituents identified were n-tetracosane (39.18%), n-eicosane (30.04%), tetratriacotane (2.97%), 7-octadecanal (2.81%), and tricosane (2.31%). Essential oil from leaves of 
   <italic>Coccinia grandis</italic> exhibited significant larvicidal activity against 
   <italic>An. stephensi</italic> with LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values 39.41ppm and 123.24ppm, respectively. This was followed by 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> with LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values of 48.20ppm, 131.84ppm and 52.80ppm, 135.48ppm, respectively after 24h of exposure.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>The results could be useful in developing a cost effective, ecofriendly, region specific and practical strategy for the control of mosquito vectors.</p>
