 <p> Inhibition of RRV- renLuc replication by the 3 essential oils under the experimental conditions shown in Fig 5. HEK293T was exposed to RRV- renLuc at MOI 2 and treated as shown in Fig 5 with essential oils ( A) luciferase activity on HEK293T cells ( B) Viral growth by plaque assay on Vero cells. Controls are RRV- renLuc-infected cells infected without treatment by the essential oils. Values are expressed as relative percentage Â± SEM (n = 5).
