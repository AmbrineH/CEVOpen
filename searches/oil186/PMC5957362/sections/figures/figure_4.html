 <p> Comparative effect of the essential oils on HEK293T against RRV. Viability of HEK293T cells infected with RRV-T48 (MOI 2) upon treatment with chloroquine at the concentration 20 μg.mL -1and essential oil at the concentration 1× CC 10 at 24 h post-infection ( A); Inhibition of RRV- renLuc replication at MOI 2 using co-treatment of chloroquine at the concentration 20 μg.mL -1and essential oil at the concentration 1× CC 10 ( B); Viral growth by plaque assay on Vero cells ( C). Controls are RRV-infected cells without treatment by chloroquine and the essential oils. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5). (* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.005). </p>)
