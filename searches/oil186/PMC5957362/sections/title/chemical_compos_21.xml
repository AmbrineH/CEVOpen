 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of GC-FID and GC-TOF MS allowed identifying 37, 67 and 53 components of the essential oils from CC, PG and VZ, respectively, and their major components are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196757.t001" href="#pone.0196757.t001">Table 1</a> (detailed chemical compositions are available in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196757.s002" href="#pone.0196757.s002">S1</a>–
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196757.s004" href="#pone.0196757.s004">S3</a> Tables). For the CC essential oil, the major components were the two isomeric monoterpene aldehydes geranial (45.11%) and neral (36.11%) and a high amount of the monoterpene hydrocarbon myrcene (7.85%) typical for essential oils of African origin [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref033">33</a>]. The chemical composition of the PG oil was also found to be in accordance with the African type [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref034">34</a>] with five major monoterpenes, including citronellol (23.43%), geraniol (16.85%) and linalool (10.79%) alcohols beside the citronellyl formate ester (12.29%) and isomenthone ketone (7.06%). The major components identified for the VZ extract include the sesquiterpenes khusimol (23.78%), (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-isovalencenol (6.79%) and α-vetivone (3.84%), which are related to the Reunion chemotype [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref035">35</a>]. The cytotoxic concentrations CC
  <sub>50</sub> and CC
  <sub>10</sub> of the three essential oils are reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196757.t001" href="#pone.0196757.t001">Table 1</a>. The lowest CCs values were found for the CC essential oil followed by that of VZ, with the PG essential oil proving to be far less toxic (CC
  <sub>50</sub>&gt; 1000 μg.mL
  <span class="sup">-1</span>; CC
  <sub>10</sub> = 533 ± 199 μg.mL
