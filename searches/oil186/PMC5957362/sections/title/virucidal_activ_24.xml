 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine whether the essential oils interfere with virus entry, the residual infectivity was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells incubated with a mixture of virus (1×10
  <span class="sup">5</span> PFU) and the essential oils (0.1×CC
  <sub>10</sub> or 1×CC
  <sub>10</sub>). The infected cells without exposure to the essential oils were used as controls. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g002" href="#pone.0196757.g002">Fig 2A</a>, no significant effect was observed whichever essential oil was used. For the entry assay performed on cells pre-treated with the essential oils before infection, viral progeny production was not affected (
