 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine the inhibitory effects of the essential oils at the early stage of the viral replication, we used a luciferase-based monitoring method using RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc and controlled the residual infectivity by plaque assay. The time course of infection of RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc (MOI 2) on HEK293T cells was first determined to guide subsequent experiments. We observed that the luciferase activity increases until 36 h post-infection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g003" href="#pone.0196757.g003">Fig 3</a>) while the viral progeny production reaches a maximum at 30 h post-infection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g003" href="#pone.0196757.g003">Fig 3</a>). Thus, the effect of essential oils on RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc replication levels was determined 24 h after infection.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g006" href="#pone.0196757.g006">Fig 6</a>. Using the CC essential oil, only pretreatment and co-treatment significantly decrease both luciferase activity and residual infectivity titer. The maximum inhibitory effect was observed for co-treatment, with both a luciferase activity level and a virus residual infectivity titer down close to 50% of the non-treated (p ≤ 0.01 and p≤ 0.05 respectively). For the PG essential oil, all treatments induced a significant decrease of the virus activity with the lowest level of luciferase activity observed for pre-treatment (34%) but later was the treatment, more increased the luciferase activity to reach a high level (67%) for post-treatment at 6 h post-infection (ANOVA one-way test for trend slope = 13.2, p&lt;0.001). However, the reduction in virus residual infectivity titer is always significant (p&lt;0.05 to 0.01) compared to non-treated control, it varied in a non-regular manner not significantly different whatever was the timing of treatment (p&gt;0.058, Kruskal-Wallis test) even if maximum reduction was observed by co-treatment and post-treatment at 4 h post-infection (&lt; 20%). In contrast, the VZ essential oil exhibited no significant effect either on luciferase activity or on viral progeny production whatever was the treatment timing. Thus, the inhibitory profiles were found to be significantly different for the three tested essential oils.
