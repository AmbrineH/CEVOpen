 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antiviral activity of the essential oils was first screened by assessing the reduction of the viral cytopathic effect through determination of the viability of HEK293T cells by an MTT assay after infection by RRV-T48 at MOI 2. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g001" href="#pone.0196757.g001">Fig 1</a>, the viability of the infected cells without treatment was dramatically reduced beyond 30 h post-infection. Upon treatment by the essential oils at the non-toxic concentration 1×CC
  <sub>10</sub>, cell viability was determined at 24 h, 32 h or 48 h post-infection and compared with untreated cells. The results in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g001" href="#pone.0196757.g001">Fig 1B</a> showed that cell viability increases significantly at 32 h post-infection upon treatment with the essentials oils of CC (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) or PG (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.005). However, there was no more significant difference at 48 h post-infection.
