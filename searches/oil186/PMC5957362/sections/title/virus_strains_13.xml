 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ross River virus derived from an infectious clone of strain T48 (RRV-T48), GenBank GQ433359 was generously provided by Professor Richard J. Khun, Purdue University [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref029">29</a>]. The recombinant RRV-T48 expressing 
  <span class="italic">Renilla reniformis</span> luciferase, as an integral part of the non-structural polyprotein precursor, was obtained according to the procedure previously described for Chikungunya virus [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref030">30</a>]. Briefly, the resulting plasmids pRRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc was linearized and the corresponding RNA was transcribed 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> using the kit mMESSAGE mMACHINEs Kit (Ambion) before transfection into Vero cells to provide live RRV-
  <span class="italic">ren</span>Luc viruses [
  <a rid="pone.0196757.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196757.ref031">31</a>]. Supernatants were collected after 48 h (first passage) and used to infect Vero cells in order to grow final virus stocks for experiments (second passage).
