<p>In order to determine the inhibitory effects of the essential oils at the early stage of the viral replication, we used a luciferase-based monitoring method using RRV-
 <italic>ren</italic>Luc and controlled the residual infectivity by plaque assay. The time course of infection of RRV-
 <italic>ren</italic>Luc (MOI 2) on HEK293T cells was first determined to guide subsequent experiments. We observed that the luciferase activity increases until 36 h post-infection (

 <italic>ren</italic>Luc replication levels was determined 24 h after infection.
