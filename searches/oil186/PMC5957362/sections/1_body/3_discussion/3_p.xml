<p class="p">The cytopathic effect of RRV-T48 on HEK293T cells observed after 30 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>) and the time-limited cytoprotective effect of the tested essential oils at 32 h post-infection clearly indicated the best opportunity to control RRV infection at the early stages. Specific assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) showed that the essential oils do not have virucidal activity and could not interfere with virus entry at the two non-toxic concentrations tested (0.1×CC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub> and 1×CC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub>). Thus, we carried out further investigations to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil on viral replication. This was supported by the time course of infection of RRV-
 <italic class="italic">ren</italic>Luc at MOI 2 that reached a maximum at 36 hours (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196757.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>), leading us to select the endpoint of monitoring at 24 h post-infection for both the luciferase activity and the residual infectivity upon different treatments by the essential oils (
