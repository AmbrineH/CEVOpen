<p class="p">Thus, the results showed the high potential of the PG essential oil against RRV, as it has low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 1000 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and displays noteworthy inhibitory effects when present prior, during or after infection. The CC essential oil, which presented the highest cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 49.5 ± 20.5 μg.mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), exhibited a moderate antiviral activity when introduced prior or during the viral absorption. In contrast, there was no evidence for an inhibitory effect from the VZ essential oil. The contribution of the major components of essential oils to their antiviral properties has been claimed in the case of HSV-1 [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. PG and CC essential oils are monoterpene-rich essential oils in contrast to the non-active VZ essential oil that is mainly constituted by sesquiterpenes. Thus, we propose that antiviral capacity is related to the monoterpene composition, and the actual molecular components deserve to be characterized and explored further.
