 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A growing attention has been given to the antiviral capacity of essential oils against arboviruses as illustrated for dengue serotype 2 (DEN-2) virus [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, none of the available essential oils used as topical mosquito repellents have not yet been investigated for their antiviral capacity against mosquito-borne viruses. In here, we investigated such inhibitory effects of three common essential oils of CC, PG and VZ at non-toxic concentrations against RRV infection.
