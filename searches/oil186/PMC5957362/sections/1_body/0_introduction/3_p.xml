<p>In arboviruses-related control measures, a number of essential oils are exploited as topical repellents to reduce the incidence of mosquito bites [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, as yet these have not been investigated for antiviral activity at the site of infection, the skin, where they could be absorbed percutaneously. Such additional benefits of skin-applied essential oils may offer a great opportunity to control the early stages of infection, even when their repelling action fails. 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic> (family: Poaceae) and 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> (family: Geraniaceae) are distributed worldwide and their essential oils (denoted hereafter as CC, VZ and PG, respectively), are readily available and have notable mosquito repellent properties [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> of these three common essential oils at non-cytotoxic concentrations against RRV. We assessed their effects on both virus entry using the wild-type of RRV-T48 strain (RRV-T48) and viral replication using a recombinant RRV expressing 
 <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase (RRV-
 <italic>ren</italic>Luc).
