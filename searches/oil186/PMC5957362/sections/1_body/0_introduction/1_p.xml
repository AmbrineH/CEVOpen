<p>Management of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) related to neglected tropical diseases has become a global health public concern [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The discovery of novel prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against arboviruses remain a continuous goal aimed to counter emerging virus or new viral strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ross River virus (RRV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus, family 
 <italic>Togarividae</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The RRV incubation period in humans was estimated to be from 7 to 9 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and like the well-known Chikungunya virus that belongs to the same viral family, it typically causes fever, rash and polyarthralgia [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RRV is endemic in Australia where it is the most common mosquito-borne pathogen with an average of 5000 cases annually [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. After the major outbreak in the Pacific area in 1979 and 1980, serological studies revealed the silent circulation of RRV in the Fiji islands [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and more recently in French Polynesia [
