<p>Two biological characteristics distinguish RRV from other alphaviruses: more than 40 species of mosquitoes can act as its vectors, thus, providing a large number of potential amplification cycles, and numerous warm blood host (mainly marsupials) support this virus’s replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This provides numerous opportunities for RRV to infect humans and initiate outbreak foci [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, during 2017, a large outbreak was observed in the South-West Region of Australia with more than 2 thousand cases reported in less than 2 months. Because the infection lead to very painful and debilitating joint, up to months after the initial onset, the disease has a direct impact on health services and calls for direct responses from the Australian authorities [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Consequently, RRV for which no efficient treatment is available, remains a major focus of basic research, and necessitates on-going surveys by the Australian health services [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) has been proposed as an efficient therapeutic target to alleviate RRV-induced arthritis but to date only pentosan sulfate, initially approved for the treatment of cystitis in U.S., is available [

 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> re-evaluation of 40 plants species used in Australian folk medicine, inhibition of RRV-induced cytopathic effect (25–50%) was observed with the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Myoporaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Pittosporaceae</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Essential oils are natural complex mixtures and their antiviral properties are due to complementary and overlapping mechanisms, as assumed for herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus and yellow fever virus. To date, the anti-infective properties of essential oils, though of growing interest, have not been explored for RRV [
