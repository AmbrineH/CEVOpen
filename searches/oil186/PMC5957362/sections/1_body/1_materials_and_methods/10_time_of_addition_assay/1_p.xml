<p class="p">To assess the effect of the essential oils on the replication of RRV, HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C. Cells were infected with RRV-
 <italic class="italic">ren</italic>Luc at MOI 2 in presence of the essential oil. The essential oils were added at the highest non-toxic concentration (1×CC
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>): (i) 3 h before virus incubation (pre-treatment) and after virus incubation; (ii) during virus incubation (co-treatment) and after virus incubation; (iii) 2 h, 4 h or 6 h after virus incubation (post-treatment). In all cases, the luciferase activity was measured in hexaplicate from five independent experiments by the RRV-
 <italic class="italic">ren</italic>Luc assay. Virus titers were determined from five independent experiments from harvested supernatants. The end point of these two analyses was 24 h post-infection. Controls consist in RRV-infected-HEK293T cells untreated with the essential oils. Chloroquine at non-toxic concentration was used as positive control.
