<p>Ross River virus derived from an infectious clone of strain T48 (RRV-T48), GenBank GQ433359 was generously provided by Professor Richard J. Khun, Purdue University [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The recombinant RRV-T48 expressing 
 <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase, as an integral part of the non-structural polyprotein precursor, was obtained according to the procedure previously described for Chikungunya virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, the resulting plasmids pRRV-
 <italic>ren</italic>Luc was linearized and the corresponding RNA was transcribed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using the kit mMESSAGE mMACHINEs Kit (Ambion) before transfection into Vero cells to provide live RRV-
 <italic>ren</italic>Luc viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Supernatants were collected after 48 h (first passage) and used to infect Vero cells in order to grow final virus stocks for experiments (second passage).
