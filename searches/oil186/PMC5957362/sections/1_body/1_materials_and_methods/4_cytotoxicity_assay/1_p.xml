<p>Cell viability was measured using the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0196757.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Vero or HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C. Cells were then treated 21 h at 37°C with each essential oil within a wide range of concentrations (0.14–1130 μg.mL
 <sup>-1</sup>). The essential oils were solubilized in 0.4% DMSO (Sigma). Following the treatment, 20 μL of 5 mg.mL
 <sup>-1</sup> MTT solution (Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier France) were added on the 96-well plates and cells were stored at 37°C in the darkness. After 3 h of treatment, supernatant was removed and replaced by 100 μL of DMSO. Plates were then read at 570 nm on a microplate reader Tecan Sunrise™. The cytotoxic concentrations are defined as the concentration of the essential oil that causes death to 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) or 10% (CC
 <sub>10</sub>) of viable cells with respect to controls without the essential oil (
