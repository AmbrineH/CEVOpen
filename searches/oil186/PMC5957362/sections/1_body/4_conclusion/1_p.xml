<p>The repellent activity of the three essential oils from CC, PG and VZ was known from folk medicine. The present study provides the first investigation of their antiviral activity against RRV infection. The different inhibitory profiles of these three essential oils suggest a relationship with their chemical compositions. Exposure to these oils prior or at the same time as viral infection resulted in the highest inhibitory effects and suggest that the primary application of these essential oils as repellents may further provide an additional valuable preventive effect against the viral infection. Our findings demonstrate the value of re-evaluating essential oils mosquito repellents for their antiviral capacity, as this might provide a novel, eco-friendly and cost-effective strategy in the prevention of arboviruses infection.</p>
