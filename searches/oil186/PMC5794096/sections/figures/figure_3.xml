 <p> CHO-K1 cell viability after treatment with different concentrations of EOP. Cell proliferation in CHO-K1 was investigated by the MTT assay, and metronidazole was used as a positive control. Data are expressed as the mean Â± SEM of the viabilities of CHO-K1 cells in three independent experiments. (*) indicates a difference between the treatments in CHO-K1 cells. The differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. VC = vehicle control; MTZ = metronidazole. </p>)
