 <p> Anti-rCP40 total IgG (4A), IgG1 (4B) and IgG2a (4C) levels in immunized mice treated with EOP and recombinant endoglycosidase CP40 from C. pseudotuberculosis (rCP40), either separately or together. Measurements were taken on day 0 and then 21 and 42 days post-immunization. Data represent means Â± standard deviations of IgG levels in the sera collected from 6 animals/group. Different letters in the same experimental day indicate a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). </p>)
