 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recombinant endoglycosidase CP40 (rCP40), derived from 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pseudotuberculosis</span>, was used as an antigen for the adjuvant assay. The pAE/
  <span class="italic">cp40</span> recombinant plasmid previously constructed by our group [
  <a rid="pone.0191797.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191797.ref034">34</a>] was transformed into the 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> BL21 (DE3) Star strain by the heat shock method. The induction of expression was performed by adding 1 mM of IPTG followed by incubation at 37 Â°C for 3 h with constant agitation. Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-6x-His-tag antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to confirm rCP40 expression. A sepharose-nickel column, HisTrapTM (GE Healthcare), was used for purification of the recombinant protein. Purity was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was measured using a BCA kit (PIERCE).
