 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Red propolis was collected from the municipality of Brejo Grande, located in the state of Sergipe, in northeastern Brazil (S 10°28'25” and W 36°26'12”). Samples were collected in September 2011 and were maintained frozen at −20 °C until use. For the preparation of the essential oil, conventional hydrodistillation was carried out using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Briefly, 380 g of BRP was transferred to a volumetric flask, and 2 L of distilled water was added. A heating mantle was placed onto the Clevenger apparatus. The essential oil was extracted after boiling the mixture for a time period of one hour. The essential oil obtained was collected in amber vials and stored at 4 °C until use. The total yield obtained was approximately 0.25%.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical composition analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass-selective detector (Hewlett Packard 6890/MSD5973, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with the HP ChemStation software and the Wiley 275 library. A capillary column composed of HP-INNOWax fused silica (30 m × 250 μm) of 0.50 μm film thickness (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) was used for the study. The temperature program used was as follows: the column temperature started at 40 °C (held for 8 min) and was increased to 180 °C at 3 °C/min and then to 230 °C (held for 20 min) at 20 °C/min; the injector was at a temperature of 250 °C and the interface at 280 °C. The split ratio was 1:100, helium was the carrier gas (56 kPa), the flow rate was 1 mL/min, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the injected volume was 0.4 mL.</p>
