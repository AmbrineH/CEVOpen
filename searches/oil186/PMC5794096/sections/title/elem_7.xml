  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the Central Animal Facility of the Federal University of Pelotas, where the immunization assays were also conducted. All mice were kept in cages containing wood shavings and bedding and had free access to water and a maintenance diet 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>. A 12-h light/dark cycle at room temperature (21 ± 2 °C) was also maintained. All experiments were performed in compliance with the procedures of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA). The Ethics Commission on Animal Experimentation (CEEA) of Pelotas Federal University (UFPel) approved the project (number 2422). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

   <a rid="pone.0191797.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191797.ref034">34</a>] was transformed into the 
   <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> BL21 (DE3) Star strain by the heat shock method. The induction of expression was performed by adding 1 mM of IPTG followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h with constant agitation. Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-6x-His-tag antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to confirm rCP40 expression. A sepharose-nickel column, HisTrapTM (GE Healthcare), was used for purification of the recombinant protein. Purity was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was measured using a BCA kit (PIERCE).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the immunization assay, the mice were divided into the following three groups of six animals each: (a) G1: a negative control group immunized with 0,4 ng/kg BW EOP; (b) G2: inoculated with only 50 μg of rCP40 protein; and (c) G3: the test group inoculated with 0,4 ng/kg BW EOP plus 50 μg of rCP40. All doses were prepared in a final volume of 200 μL using sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) as a vehicle and administered via the intramuscular route. The animals were immunized with two doses administered 21 days apart. Animals were bled at days 0, 21, and 42 post-immunization to determine the antibody levels. Blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus with Pasteur pipettes. All blood collections were performed under anesthesia with 10% ketamine (1 mL/kg) and 2% xylazine (0.1 mg/kg) (Agener União Saúde Animal, Brazil). After coagulation, the blood was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min. The serum was removed and stored at −20 °C.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Serum samples from the immunized mice were used in immunoassays (indirect ELISA) for the quantification of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a anti-rCP40 antibodies. Polystyrene 96-well plates (Maxisorp-Nunc) were coated with 100 μL of a bicarbonate-carbonate buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.1 μg/well of rCP40 protein. Plates were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C and washed 3 times with PBS-T (PBS 1X, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20). The plates were then incubated with 200 μL/well of 5% skim milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C, for blocking purposes. A three-step wash was then performed. All serum samples obtained from mice were diluted in PBS (v/v 1:50), and 100 μL of each diluted sample was added to the plates in duplicate. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 μL/well of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (1: 5,000 in PBS-T) to the plates in order to detect total IgG prior to the revelation step. In plates designated for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2a, 100 μL/well of either goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1: 5,000 in PBS-T) or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (1: 2,000 in PBS-T) was added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS-T, subsequent to which 100 μL/well of anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (1: 5,000 in PBS-T). The plates were re-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed five times with PBS-T. The reaction was developed by the addition of 100 μL/well of the substrate-chromogen solution [
   <span class="italic">o</span>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; OPD tablets (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.4 mg/mL phosphate-citrate buffer containing 0.04% of 30% hydrogen peroxide, pH = 5.0] and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, and it was stopped by the addition of 50 μL/well of H
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> solution (4N). Optical density (OD) was determined using a microtiter-plate reader (Microplate Reader Mindray MR–96A) set at 492 nm.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analyzed using the software GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA). Differences in IgG levels between the groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. The results were considered statistically significant if p-value &lt;0.05.</p>
