  <span class="italic">vaginalis</span> 30236 isolate used for evaluating antiparasitic activity in this study was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Trophozoites were axenically cultured in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium (without agar; pH = 6.0) supplemented with 10% sterile bovine serum (inactivated at 56 °C) and incubated at 37 °C [
  <a rid="pone.0191797.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191797.ref032">32</a>]. Cultures with 95% viability, as confirmed through observation of motility, morphology, and trypan-blue exclusion (0.4%) assay under the light microscope at 400X magnification, were considered as alive and were used for evaluating the activity of EOP.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Cral
  <span class="sup">®</span>). Parasites were seeded at an initial density of 2.6 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> trophozoites/mL of TYM and incubated in the presence of EOP. Three experimental controls were also performed: parasites only, the vehicle used for solubilization of EOP (0.6% DMSO) and 100 μM MTZ (metronidazole; Sigma-Aldrich) (as a positive control). The microculture plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Subsequent to the incubation, a preparation containing trophozoites and trypan blue (0.4%) in a 1:1 ratio was prepared and counted in a Neubauer chamber. Cultures with 95% viability were utilized for the assay.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), different concentrations of EOP (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μg/mL) were tested as described by Hübner et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191797.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191797.ref033">33</a>], with some modification. Parasite pellets were used to establish the MIC as well as concentrations below and above the MIC value. Samples used as controls were inoculated in fresh TYM medium at 37 °C. Parasites were counted in a Neubauer chamber with trypan blue every 24 h for 96 h to confirm MIC. The viability of trophozoites was assessed by the exclusion of the trypan blue dye as well as by motility and morphology. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> (half the maximum inhibitory concentration) values were determined at the same concentrations used for the MIC test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A kinetic growth curve was constructed in order to obtain a more comparable activity profile of EOP activity against 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. 
  <span class="italic">vaginalis</span>. The viability of trophozoites was observed under a light microscope 96 h after incubation with EOP at the required MIC. Growth analysis was performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by the trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion method and by the evaluation of motility and morphology. All assays were performed independently at least three times in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the percentage of viable trophozoites compared to untreated parasites.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Anti-
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas vaginalis</span> activity assay, statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a probability value of 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Tukey’s test was utilized to identify significant differences between the means of different treatments. GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were obtained from the Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank (PABCAM, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) and cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Vitrocell Embriolife) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Vitrocell Embriolife), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% humidified air and 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The post-treatment proliferation of the CHO-K1 cell line was determined by measuring the reduction of soluble 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) to water-insoluble formazan. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
   <span class="sup">4</span> cells per well in 100 μL volumes and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 24 h before they were used in the cell viability assay. The cells were then treated with 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 μg of EOP for 24 h. DMSO was used as vehicle control (VC), untreated cells were used as a negative control and 100 μM of metronidazole (MTZ) was used as a positive control. Following the incubation, 20 μL of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional period of 3 h at 37 °C. Differences in the total cellular metabolism were detected at a wavelength of 492 nm by using a microplate reader. The inhibition (%) of cell proliferation was determined as follows: inhibitory growth = (1 − Abs
   <sub>492</sub> treated cells / Abs
   <sub>492</sub> control cells) × 100%. The IC
   <sub>50</sub> was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA). All observations were validated by at least three independent experiments in triplicate.
