<p class="p">The EOP was observed to exhibit a promisingly high level of antiparasitic activity, with cytotoxicity seen at higher concentrations of EOP. However, further studies using lower concentrations of EOP for topical application should be performed with the aim of reducing cytotoxicity levels and achieving potent localized action in the treatment of trichomoniasis. Our study also demonstrated the potential use of EOP as a vaccine adjuvant since the administration of EOP along with rCP40 was seen to increase IgG production. The results of this study shed light on several new properties of EOP and underline the importance of exploring its potential as an additional option for the treatment of trichomoniasis and as a vaccine adjuvant. Furthermore, studies dedicated to revealing the potential and the importance of EOP in other biological activities are encouraged, due to EOP chemical complexity.</p>
