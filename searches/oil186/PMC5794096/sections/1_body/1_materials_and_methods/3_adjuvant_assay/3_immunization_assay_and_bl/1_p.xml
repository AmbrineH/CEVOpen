<p class="p">For the immunization assay, the mice were divided into the following three groups of six animals each: (a) G1: a negative control group immunized with 0,4 ng/kg BW EOP; (b) G2: inoculated with only 50 μg of rCP40 protein; and (c) G3: the test group inoculated with 0,4 ng/kg BW EOP plus 50 μg of rCP40. All doses were prepared in a final volume of 200 μL using sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) as a vehicle and administered via the intramuscular route. The animals were immunized with two doses administered 21 days apart. Animals were bled at days 0, 21, and 42 post-immunization to determine the antibody levels. Blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus with Pasteur pipettes. All blood collections were performed under anesthesia with 10% ketamine (1 mL/kg) and 2% xylazine (0.1 mg/kg) (Agener União Saúde Animal, Brazil). After coagulation, the blood was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min. The serum was removed and stored at −20 °C.</p>
