 <italic>vaginalis</italic> 30236 isolate used for evaluating antiparasitic activity in this study was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Trophozoites were axenically cultured in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium (without agar; pH = 6.0) supplemented with 10% sterile bovine serum (inactivated at 56 °C) and incubated at 37 °C [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cultures with 95% viability, as confirmed through observation of motility, morphology, and trypan-blue exclusion (0.4%) assay under the light microscope at 400X magnification, were considered as alive and were used for evaluating the activity of EOP.
