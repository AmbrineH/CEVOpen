<p>A kinetic growth curve was constructed in order to obtain a more comparable activity profile of EOP activity against 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic>. The viability of trophozoites was observed under a light microscope 96 h after incubation with EOP at the required MIC. Growth analysis was performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by the trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion method and by the evaluation of motility and morphology. All assays were performed independently at least three times in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the percentage of viable trophozoites compared to untreated parasites.
