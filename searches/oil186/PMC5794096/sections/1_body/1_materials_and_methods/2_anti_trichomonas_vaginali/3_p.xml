<p>To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), different concentrations of EOP (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μg/mL) were tested as described by Hübner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with some modification. Parasite pellets were used to establish the MIC as well as concentrations below and above the MIC value. Samples used as controls were inoculated in fresh TYM medium at 37 °C. Parasites were counted in a Neubauer chamber with trypan blue every 24 h for 96 h to confirm MIC. The viability of trophozoites was assessed by the exclusion of the trypan blue dye as well as by motility and morphology. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (half the maximum inhibitory concentration) values were determined at the same concentrations used for the MIC test.
