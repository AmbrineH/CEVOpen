<p>Red propolis was collected from the municipality of Brejo Grande, located in the state of Sergipe, in northeastern Brazil (S 10°28'25” and W 36°26'12”). Samples were collected in September 2011 and were maintained frozen at −20 °C until use. For the preparation of the essential oil, conventional hydrodistillation was carried out using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Briefly, 380 g of BRP was transferred to a volumetric flask, and 2 L of distilled water was added. A heating mantle was placed onto the Clevenger apparatus. The essential oil was extracted after boiling the mixture for a time period of one hour. The essential oil obtained was collected in amber vials and stored at 4 °C until use. The total yield obtained was approximately 0.25%.</p>
