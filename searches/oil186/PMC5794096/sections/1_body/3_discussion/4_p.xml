 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which is much lower than MIC found here for EOP. Since EOP is a complex mixture containing mainly methyl eugenol, a phenylpropene with similarities with isoeugenol in chemical structure, and sesquiterpenes in low concentrations, it is expected a different biological result in comparison to the use of each isolated compound.
