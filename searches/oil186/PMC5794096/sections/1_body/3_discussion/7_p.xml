<p>In this study, we also confirmed that EOP has the potential to be used as an adjuvant in a veterinary vaccine formulation. In our study, a recombinant endoglycosidase CP40 (rCP40), encoded by the 
 <italic>cp40</italic> gene of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudotuberculosis</italic>, was used as the antigen as its antigenic properties have been previously confirmed [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our results confirmed that association of the rCP40 protein with EOP improves the immune response to this target compared to the administration of either of these components alone. We observed that the combination of the rCP40 with EOP led to IgG absorbances higher than those found by other researchers using traditional adjuvants such as saponin or Freundâ€™s complete adjuvant [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Herein, we used for the first time EOP as an adjuvant. In fact, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of BRP as a vaccinal adjuvant.
