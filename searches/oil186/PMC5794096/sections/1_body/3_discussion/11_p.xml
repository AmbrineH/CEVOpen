<p>Most of the studies involving the effect of BRP on the immune system are recent and have extensively investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of BRP on the inflammation process [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. BRP reduces nitric oxide levels and diminishes the levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and genes associated with inflammatory signaling in macrophages [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, BRP modulates neutrophil migration by interfering in rolling and adhesion processes through reduction of the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1/KC and CXCL-2/MIP-2 and reduction of calcium influx [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In vivo, BRP has been seen to promote protective effects against ulcerative colitis in a rat model, reducing gross and histological inflammatory lesions and decreasing the levels of myeloperoxidase and iNOS in colon tissue [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Moreover, mice treated orally with BRP showed improved cutaneous wound healing through faster wound closure, reduction of inflammatory infiltrate, and downregulation of the transcription factor pNF-κB and the inflammatory cytokines TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Antinociceptive activity of BRP towards neurogenic and inflammatory pain in mice was also observed without emotional and motor side effects [
