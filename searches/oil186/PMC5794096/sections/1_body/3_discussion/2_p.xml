<p>Some of the volatile compounds present in EOP have already been credited with having antiparasitic activity. These chemical entities include β-caryophyllene, α-pinene, α-bergamotene, and (E)-β-farnesene [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, methyl eugenol isolated from the essential oil extracted from the plant 
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic> showed significant nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Methyl eugenol is a specific constituent of Brazilian red propolis, among another types of propolis, which was revealed for the first time in 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, in this work, we hypothesized that methyl eugenol, a phenylpropene with the major concentration in EOP and the sesquiterpenes may be responsible for the antiparasitic activity against
