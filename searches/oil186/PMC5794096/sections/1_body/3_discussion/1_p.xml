<p>Although some Brazilian propolis essential oils, mainly those derived from green propolis, have been characterized previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], this is the first study to undertake the characterization of BRP essential oil. Only the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of BRP have been tested being isoflavones the main isolated compounds [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the essential oil (EO) of BRP could provide some volatile compounds with important biological properties, which are probably lost or eliminated in the other extraction methods. In fact, methyl eugenol, a phenylpropene, was the major volatile component isolated from EOP and most of the other isolates were classified as sesquiterpenes. Along similar lines, it is known that the Brazilian green propolis also has a predominance of sesquiterpenes. Nerolidol, β-caryophyllene, spathulenol, and δ-cadinene have been identified as other major volatile components of green propolis [

Studies have revealed that EO constituents make up a diverse family of low-molecular-weight organic compounds with extreme variations in biological activity. Based on their chemical structure, the active compounds of EOs can be divided into four major groups: terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, and “others” [
