<p>Until 42 days after immunization, the IgG2a production levels were higher than those observed for IgG1, which is indicative of a T-helper 1 cell (Th1) response. In mice, Th1 cells aid in the activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells and in the production of opsonizing and complement-activator immunoglobulin isotypes, such as IgG2a. Hence, it is widely believed that the primary function of Th1 cells is the generation of immunity against intracellular pathogens [

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses are highly sought after as they are effective for immunization against pathogens for which there are no currently licensed vaccines (examples: HIV-AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis) [
