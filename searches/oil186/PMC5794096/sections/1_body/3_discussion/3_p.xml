Therefore, it is hypothesized that cytotoxicity could be a limiting factor for the parenteral use of EOP, but its use in topical forms for the treatment of trichomoniasis, through topical vaginal application, appears to be an interesting alternative. It is well known that topical application allows for the delivery of higher drug concentrations to the vaginal epithelium at lower treatment doses [
