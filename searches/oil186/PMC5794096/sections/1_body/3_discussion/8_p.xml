<p>Compared to the administration of rCP40 alone, a combination of the recombinant protein with EOP was able to induce increases of 7.4-, 4.4- and 10.8-fold higher levels of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a, respectively. One of the most important challenges currently facing adjuvant research is the search for the ‘perfect mix’: an optimal, safe formulation whose different components are not only additive but also synergistic in nature, and whose administration gives rise to the desired robust immune response [
