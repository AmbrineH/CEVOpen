<p>Currently, the Brazilian propolis is classified in 13 different types, according to its physical-chemical properties, botanical origin and geographic area where propolis can be collected. Initially, Park et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] classified propolis samples from different Brazilian regions in 12 groups. Afterwards, a 13
 <sup>th</sup> type of propolis with peculiar chemical composition was found in hives located alongside the coast and mangroves in the Brazilian northeast and was called Brazilian red propolis (BRP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the last decade, the chemical composition of BRP has been revealed and related to its bioactivities. The main chemical components found in BRP are classified as isoflavones, flavones, flavonols, aurones, chalcones, pterocarpans and xanthones groups [
