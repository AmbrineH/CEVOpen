<p class="p">As aforementioned, most of the previous studies describing the biological activities of BRP uses ethanol as the extraction solvent, and the extraction method influences directly the yield and selectivity for some compounds [

Volatile compounds like those found in essential oils are in low concentrations in propolis, but play an important role by contributing to propolis pleasant aroma and its biological activities. Researchers have applied various methods to obtain propolis volatiles such as distilllation-extraction or hydrodistillation [
