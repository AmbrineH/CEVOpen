<p>EOP treatment also inhibited proliferation of the CHO-K1 cell line; however, this cytotoxicity was only significant at 500 μg/mL. No significant cytotoxicity was observed up to 250 μg/mL in growth inhibition of CHO-K1 cells after 24 h of treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191797.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The in vitro cytotoxicity activity of EOP showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 266 and 100 μg/mL in CHO-K1 cells and trophozoites, respectively, which may indicate selectivity of the EOP treatment at concentrations up to 250 μg/mL. The results enumerated above demonstrate that EOP is an important resource for future drug development, and its therapeutic potential against various infectious entities merits further study and analysis.
