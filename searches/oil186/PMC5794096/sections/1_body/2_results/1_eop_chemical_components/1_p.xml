<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of the red propolis extract enabled the identification of certain compounds present in the essential oil. A list of these constituents is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191797.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. GC-MS is a reliable method, indispensable in several areas where the analysis of complex mixtures and unambiguous identification is required, and since volatile compounds are well identified with GC-MS, this method is suitable for analysis of essential oils [

 <xref rid="pone.0191797.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Using GC-MS, our study was able to highlight methyl eugenol (13.1%), (E)-β-farnesene (2.5%), δ-amorphene (2.3%), α-cubebene (1.9%), and β-caryophyllene (1.5%) as the major components of the extract.
