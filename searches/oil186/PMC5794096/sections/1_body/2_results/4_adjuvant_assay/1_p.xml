 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191797.g004">Fig 4</xref> illustrates the results obtained from the ELISA assay designed for analyzing the production of anti-rCP40 total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies. The results demonstrate that animals from group G1 were unable to induce production of IgG and its isotypes. In group G2, increased total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were detected on day 42, subsequent to the administration of two doses of rCP40. Additionally, it was observed that the association of EOP with rCP40 (G3) leads to the induction of higher levels of IgG and its isotypes. When compared with groups G1 and G2, group G3 was observed to present a significantly higher increase (p &lt; 0.05) in total IgG total as well as isotypes IgG1 and IgG2a at days 21 and 42 after the first immunization (

The day-42 values clearly demonstrate that the association of EOP with rCP40 was able to increase the levels of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a by approximately 7.4, 4.4 and 10.8 fold, respectively, in comparison to the administration of rCP40 alone. Moreover, group G3 shows more pronounced IgG2a production compared to the production of IgG1 at day 42.
