<p>The volatlie oils were subjected to GC-MS analysis on an Agilent system consisting of a model 7890 N gas chromatograph, a model mass detector Triple Quad 7000 A in EI mode at 70 eV (

 <italic>z</italic>) range 40–600 amu) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and an Agilent ChemStation data system. The GC column was an HP-5 ms fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane stationary phase (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 9.7853 psi and flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Inlet temperature and MSD detector temperature was 250 °C. The GC oven temperature program was used as follows: 50 °C initial temperature, held for 5 min; increased at 6 °C/min to 190 °C for 20 min; increased 7 °C/min to 290 °C for 15 min; increased 7 °C/min to 300 °C for 10 mins. The sample was dissolved in dichloromethane, and 2 µL was injected (split ratio 10:1; split flow 12 mL/min).
