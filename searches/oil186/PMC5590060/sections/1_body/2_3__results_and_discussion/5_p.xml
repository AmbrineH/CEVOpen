<p>The dose dependent ferric reducing power of 
 <italic>E. foetidum</italic> essential oils and ascorbic acid is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00024-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The FRAP assay is an indication of the reducing potential of the antioxidants against the oxidative consequences of reactive oxygen species. It was observed that the reducing capacity of the volatile oils and standard compound increased with a corresponding increase in concentration. The leaf, stem and root oils demonstrated good reducing effects (20–100 µg/mL: 0.927–1.682, 0.852–1.546 and 0.506–1.307 respectively). This implicates the oil constituents’ ability to reduce the (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) by electron transfer. The ferric ion reduction ability of ascorbic acid in the assay (20–100 µg/mL, 1.271–1.996) was relatively higher than the absorbance values for the volatile oils. The trend of reducing power (100 µg/mL) followed the order: ascorbic acid &gt; leaf oil &gt; stem oil &gt; root oil. Merghache et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also showed that 
 <italic>E. tricuspidatum</italic> essential oil exhibited a dose dependent ability (to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) in the FRAP assay.
