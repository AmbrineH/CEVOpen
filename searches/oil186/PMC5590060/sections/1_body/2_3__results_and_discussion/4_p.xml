<p class="p">The chemical composition of the stem oil (which exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging effect) reveals a number of oxygenated constituents that were not identified in both leaf and root volatile oils, such as 2,4,6-trimethyl phenol, 2-undecanol, 1-undecanol, 1-dodecanol, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecen-1-ol and other aliphatic aldehyde compounds. These compounds may have furnished the antiradical activity shown by the stem oil. Therefore, the antioxidant activity depends on chemical composition. Chandrika et al. [
