<p class="p">The DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> essential oils is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00024-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The plot indicates the scavenging ability of the oils as percent inhibition at various concentrations; the scavenging effect was concentration dependent. This was demonstrated by the oils ability to act as hydrogen atoms or electrons donor in the conversion of the stable purple coloured DPPH to the reduced yellow coloured DPPH-H. Ascorbic acid (100 µg/mL) showed the highest percent inhibition (90.79%), followed by the stem oil (78.08%), root oil (67.53%) and leaf oil (56.76%). DPPH radical activity is usually presented with their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for stem, root and leaf oils were 46 µg/mL, 54.5 µg/mL and 56 µg/mL respectively while ascorbic acid showed 22 µg/mL.
