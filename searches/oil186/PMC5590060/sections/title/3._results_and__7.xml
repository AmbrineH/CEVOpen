 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yields of the leaf, stem and root essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> were 0.2%, 0.16% and 0.17% respectively. The characterization of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> oils are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" href="#medicines-04-00024-t001">Table 1</a>. Thirty four (34) constituents were identified in the volatile oils accounting for 99.99%, 96.63% and 92.27% respectively. The analyzed oils were qualitatively and quantitatively different, characterized by high amount of aromatic, linear unsaturated and saturated aldehydes. The leaf volatile oil contained a high proportion of (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-Dodecenal (28.43%), 13-tetradecenal (27.45%), dodecanal (14.59%) and 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (10.77%); the stem oil comprised of dodecanal (20.21%), 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (18.43%) and (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-dodecenal (8.27%), while 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (56.08%), 13-tetradecenal (9.26%) and (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-dodecenal (7.65%) were the most dominant in the root oil. The major aldehyde compounds occurred in all the samples, except 13-tetradecenal detected in both leaf and root oils. Monoterpene hydrocarbons occurred in the range 5.49%–28.11%, while the oxygenated monoterpene (3.49%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (0.44%) were detected in small quantities in the leaf part only.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of our findings with volatile oils of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> from other regions reveal some similarities and differences which may attributed to a number of factors such as clime, plant maturity and variety, processing and methods of analysis. (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-Dodecenal, the major component (28.43%) of the leaf oil in our Nigerian sample was reported predominant in volatile oils from Vietnam (45.5%) [

  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00024">10</a>]; but detected in small amount in the leaf oils of Cuba (5.7%) [

  <a rid="B22-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-medicines-04-00024">22</a>]. Similarly, 2,4.5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (lauraldehyde) (10.77%) in the leaf oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" href="#medicines-04-00024-t001">Table 1</a>) was presented as a major component (20.5%) in the Cuban oil [

  <a rid="B10-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-medicines-04-00024">10</a>]. On the other hand, its positional isomer, the 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde was not detected in the Nigerian oils, but was present as a dominant component (23.7%) in the S. Tome [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00024">5</a>] and Malaysian (9.6%) [
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00024">2</a>] leaf sample. The 13-tetradecenal (27.45%) in the leaf oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" href="#medicines-04-00024-t001">Table 1</a>) was not identified in S. Tome leaf oil, however the isomer, (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-tetradecenal (18.7 &amp; 25.3%) was reported as a major constituent [
  <a rid="B5-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-medicines-04-00024">5</a>]. The 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (37.55%) and 2-formyl-1,1,5-trimethylcyclohexa-2,4-diene-6-ol (19.82%) reported in the Malaysian root essential oil [
  <a rid="B2-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-medicines-04-00024">2</a>] was not identified in Nigerian root oil. Literature has revealed that the stem essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> is reported for the first time, however the Cuban seed oil is reported to contain carotol (19.3%) and hexadecanoic acid (12.0%) among other constituents [
  <a rid="B9-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-medicines-04-00024">9</a>]. Eyres et al. [
  <a rid="B24-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-medicines-04-00024">24</a>] showed that the prominent “character-impact” factor of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> essential oil are (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-dodecenal and (Z)-2-dodecenal.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> essential oils is depicted in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00024-f001" href="#medicines-04-00024-f001">Figure 1</a>. The plot indicates the scavenging ability of the oils as percent inhibition at various concentrations; the scavenging effect was concentration dependent. This was demonstrated by the oils ability to act as hydrogen atoms or electrons donor in the conversion of the stable purple coloured DPPH to the reduced yellow coloured DPPH-H. Ascorbic acid (100 µg/mL) showed the highest percent inhibition (90.79%), followed by the stem oil (78.08%), root oil (67.53%) and leaf oil (56.76%). DPPH radical activity is usually presented with their IC
  <sub>50</sub> value. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values for stem, root and leaf oils were 46 µg/mL, 54.5 µg/mL and 56 µg/mL respectively while ascorbic acid showed 22 µg/mL.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the stem oil (which exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging effect) reveals a number of oxygenated constituents that were not identified in both leaf and root volatile oils, such as 2,4,6-trimethyl phenol, 2-undecanol, 1-undecanol, 1-dodecanol, (
  <span class="italic">E</span>)-2-dodecen-1-ol and other aliphatic aldehyde compounds. These compounds may have furnished the antiradical activity shown by the stem oil. Therefore, the antioxidant activity depends on chemical composition. Chandrika et al. [
  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00024">17</a>] reported a higher DPPH radical activity (96.674% inhibition at 50 µg/mL, IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 22.14) for the Indian 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> leaf oil compared with the Nigerian leaf oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00024-t001" href="#medicines-04-00024-t001">Table 1</a>); however, the authors did not present the chemical profile of the leaf oil. Previous investigation on 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> leaf oils from India revealed the occurrence of muurola-4,10(14)-diene-1-ol (10.2%), hexahydrofarnesylacetone (5.5%), palmitic acid (4.6%) and phytol (4.9%) which were not identified in the Nigerian samples [
  <a rid="B25-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-medicines-04-00024">25</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dose dependent ferric reducing power of 
  <span class="italic">E. foetidum</span> essential oils and ascorbic acid is presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00024-f002" href="#medicines-04-00024-f002">Figure 2</a>. The FRAP assay is an indication of the reducing potential of the antioxidants against the oxidative consequences of reactive oxygen species. It was observed that the reducing capacity of the volatile oils and standard compound increased with a corresponding increase in concentration. The leaf, stem and root oils demonstrated good reducing effects (20–100 µg/mL: 0.927–1.682, 0.852–1.546 and 0.506–1.307 respectively). This implicates the oil constituents’ ability to reduce the (Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span>) to (Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>) by electron transfer. The ferric ion reduction ability of ascorbic acid in the assay (20–100 µg/mL, 1.271–1.996) was relatively higher than the absorbance values for the volatile oils. The trend of reducing power (100 µg/mL) followed the order: ascorbic acid &gt; leaf oil &gt; stem oil &gt; root oil. Merghache et al. [
  <a rid="B11-medicines-04-00024" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-medicines-04-00024">11</a>] also showed that 
  <span class="italic">E. tricuspidatum</span> essential oil exhibited a dose dependent ability (to reduce Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> to Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span>) in the FRAP assay.
