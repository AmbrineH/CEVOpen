  <bold class="bold">Background:</bold>
  <italic class="italic">Eryngium foetidum</italic> essential oils from Nigeria were investigated for the first time in order to ascertain their potency as natural antioxidants. 
  <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> is an aromatic and medicinal herb used in ethno-medicine and as a traditional spice for foods. 
  <bold class="bold">Methods:</bold> The hydro-distilled oils of 
  <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Free radical scavenging capacity of the volatile oils was determined using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. 
  <bold class="bold">Results:</bold> Leaf volatile oil contained a high proportion of (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-Dodecenal (28.43%), 13-tetradecenal (27.45%), dodecanal (14.59%) and 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (10.77%); the stem oil comprised of dodecanal (20.21%), 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (18.43%) and (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal (8.27%), while 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde (56.08%), 13-tetradecenal (9.26%) and (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal (7.65%) were the most dominant in the root oil. The IC
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> values for the leaf, stem and root oils were 56 µg/mL, 46µg/mL and 54.5 µg/mL respectively in the DPPH assay while the leaf oil exhibited the highest reducing potential among the test oils in the FRAP assay. 
  <bold class="bold">Conclusions:</bold> The Nigerian 
  <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> volatile oils contain high amount of acyclic aldehydes and aromatic compounds. The oils are a potential source of natural antioxidant as demonstrated by their strong antioxidant activity.
