 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chicken is purchased at an appropriate amount and about 2 hr after being slaughtered from one of the Faraz Bal Slaughterhouse and transferred in ice‐filled polyester boxes to Orouei meat product laboratory. Chicken meat is scalded and its fats are removed and washed with drinking water. Then, it is grinded with the meat grinder for the tests and kept in the refrigerator until the experiment was carried out. Chicken burger is prepared with the following formulation:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">80.23% chicken meat, 11.46% fat, 5.39% water, and 2.92% additive (salt, starch, dextrose, fiber, spices). In order to prepare a chicken burger sample, 800 g of chicken meat was thoroughly cut and grinded by a meat grinder No. 13, then the other ingredients (11 g of oil, 5 g of water, 3 g of additive (salt, starch, dextrose, fiber, spices) were added to the formulation and mixed for 15 min, then the dough was placed in a mold with an arbitrary shape with a length of about 5 cm (Melero, Diez, Rajkovic, Isabel Jaime, &amp; Rovira, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0029">2012</a>). After cutting the chicken burger sample was placed between two films prepared for each treatment and then placed in sterile polyethylene bags. Then, different treatments were kept in a refrigerator at 4°C and microbial tests were performed on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12. In general, the tests were carried out in six treatments and three replicates.
