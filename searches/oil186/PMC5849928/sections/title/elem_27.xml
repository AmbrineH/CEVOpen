  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical compounds of the AEO were calculated using the gas chromatography apparatus attached to the mass spectrometer, and the results were presented in Table 
   <a rid="fsn3544-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3544-tbl-0001">1</a>. Among the constituents, 21 combinations containing 99.88% of essential oil compounds were identified. Among the constituents, the most essential compounds were Anethole (74.40%), Thymol (11.44%), Terpinene‐ γ (4.61%), Dl‐Limonene (2.06%), and Estragole (1.87%). The results of this study are consistent with the results of Sharifi, Kiani, Ahmadzadeh, Ahmadzadeh, and Ahmadzadeh (
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0045">2008</a>) regarding anise essential oil. The most important compounds in their study were E‐anethole (92.9%), p‐allylanisole (2.2%), and Za‐bisabolene (1.8%). In the study of Orav, Raal, and Arak (
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0035">2008</a>), the major components of the AEO in different regions of Europe were trans‐anethole between 76.9% and 93.7% and γ‐himachalene between 0.4% and 8.2%. In all studies, the most important compounds of AEO were Anethole, and also the studies indicated that the AEO has anti‐bacterial and antioxidant properties and can be used as a natural preservative in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Of course, as you can see, there are differences in the amount and type of essential oil combinations in the various studies, in general, the composition of the herbal essential oils in terms of geographical area, plant variety, age of the plant when preparing the essential oil, environmental and seasonal conditions, type of crop, harvest time, drying and extraction of essential oils, extraction of various organs and eventually genetic variation of the plant can change (Burt, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the criteria used by most researchers to measure the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum concentration of fecundity. Due to the fact that each antimicrobial agent has different effects on microorganisms, this study investigated the AEO on gram‐negative microorganisms such as 
   <span class="italic">S. typhimurium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and gram‐positive bacteria like 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> using microdilution method. According to the results (Table 
   <a rid="fsn3544-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#fsn3544-tbl-0002">2</a>), the highest MIC values were observed in 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and the lowest values were found in 
   <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). Several reports have shown that gram‐positive bacteria are more susceptible to antibacterial compounds than gram‐negative bacteria. The resistance of gram‐negative bacteria against antibacterial agents with the hydrophilic surface of the outer membrane of bacteria that is rich in lipopolysaccharide molecules and creates a buffer against the penetration of different antibiotic molecules, as well as with perivascular enzymes that can break the molecules imported from outside are also in contact. Gram‐positive bacteria do not have such an external membrane in the cell wall structure. Some antibiotics can easily destroy the walls of the bacterial cell and the cytoplasmic membrane and lead to the release of its cytoplasm (Shan, Cai, Brooks, &amp; Corke,

The ability to absorb the moisture of a polymer is effective in many features of the film. As by increasing the moisture absorption in the film, the inhibitory properties of it deteriorate (Cuq, Gontard, Aymard, &amp; Guilbert,

The formation of these bonding led to the reduction in free hydroxyl and amine groups in the film network and thus reduced the amount of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and the functional groups of polymeric chains, and the reduction in hydrogen bonding resulted in a decrease in the moisture content of films containing anise essential oil (Hosseini et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water solubility is an important factor in the film that demonstrates the resistance of films against water and is used to package foods that has high water activity, or when films have to be in contact with water and act as food protectors is very important (Bourtoom &amp; Chinnan, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0010">2008</a>). In general, the higher the solubility, the lower the resistance to water (Abdollahi, Rezaei, &amp; Farzi, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0002">2012</a>). The solubility was reduced by adding AEO to chitosan film (25.98%), so that the lowest solubility was observed in chitosan + AEO 2% (9.49%) (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). The hydrophobic properties of essential oils, due to their lipid nature, lead to the hydrophobicity of essential oil samples than control film samples and produce a film with lower solubility in water. This type of film can be very useful for covering food that has a wet surface (Bahram et al.,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thickness is one of the important factors in the film, which directly affects the biological characteristics and durability of the packaged product. According to the results, adding anise essential oil to 1% concentration does not affect the thickness of the film. Increasing the essential oil concentration increased film thickness (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of the rate of water vapor permeability of polymer films are absolutely necessary if antimicrobial films are used in foods of medium and high humidity. In order to reduce water vapor permeability, different approaches such as the use of two or more layers of chitosan composites with moisture resistant materials such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (Sebit, Chollet, Degraeve, &amp; Peryorl, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0043">2007</a>) and polymers such as wax starch and another important approach is the use of hydrophobic compounds such as fatty acids, essential oils and extracts. By adding anise essential oil to chitosan film (3.82 × 10
   <span class="sup">−7</span> gs
   <span class="sup">−1 </span>m

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The addition of AEO to chitosan film increased the film tensile strength, with increased essential oil concentration, so that the highest increase in film tensile strength was observed in film chitosan + AEO 2% (21.38 MPa). Also, the results of maximum elongation break before the tear point was similar to that of the film tensile strength, so that the highest tensile strengths were observed in the chitosan + AEO 2% (12.32%) (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). The reason for this was that a strong interaction between the chitosan polymer and the AEO led to the creation of throughout connections and thus reduced the free volume and molecular mobility of the polymer. This phenomenon leads to the creation of a plate‐like structure and the arrangement of these plates as layers on one another increases the tensile strength (Hosseini et al., 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0020">2009</a>). Also, the hydrophilicity and high molecular weight of phenolic compounds of the essential oil, reduce the effects of softening in the film and increase the tensile strength of the essential oil films (Adams,

In fact, it can be stated that the use of the transfer coating slows down the moisture between the burger and the atmosphere and allows it to control the moisture content of the uncoated treatment.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest levels of thiobarbituric acid was observed in control treatment. The lowest levels of thyobarbitonic acid were observed in chitosan + essential oil 2%. Generally, biodegradable coatings such as chitosans have a very low permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide. Thus, the coating formed on the surface of the burgers significantly reduces the contact rate of the product with oxygen, which reduces the rate of initial oxidation of lipids and consequently the formation of hydroperoxides (Mohan, Ravishankar, &amp; Srinivasagopal, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0030">2008</a>). The anise essential oil has the ability to break free radicals by giving a hydrogen atom, and due to its significant amounts of phenolic compounds, the flavonoid has an antioxidant effect that delays oxidative damage in burgers and increased by increasing the percentage of this property in essential oils, and also the combination of essential oil and chitosan caused synergy of antioxidant properties, resulting in better results in chitosan and essential oil 2%. Several studies reported that the antioxidant effect of natural essential oils depends on the amount of their antioxidants (Burt,

Hydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds have an important role in the antimicrobial activity of essential oils and herbal extracts. The presence of the active hydroxyphenolic group has caused these compounds being able to easily form hydrogen bonds with active sites of enzymes (Burt, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>). These compounds usually malfunction in the cytoplasmic membrane, break and disrupt the proton movement, electron beam and activated transmission, and cause coagulation of cellular content (Burt, 
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>). In fact, the antimicrobial effect of these compounds is due to their reaction with proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms, which changes the permeability of the membrane and the formation of probable pores, and ultimately affects the driving force of the protons (Juven, Kanner, Schved, &amp; Weisslowicz,

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). By adding chitosan, the bacterial levels had a slower rate than the control treatment, which indicates the antimicrobial activity of chitosan. Different mechanisms have been reported for the antimicrobial activity of chitosan: (1) Chitosan inhibits the growth of bacteria as a chelating agent of metallic ions and nutrients, (2) Chitosan is able to bind to ionic groups existing on the surface of bacterial cells and the formation of poly‐electrolyte complexes with compounds present on the surface of the cells of the bacteria, which leads to the lack of transfer of nutrients to the cells and ultimately prevents their growth (Qi, Xu, Jiang, Hu, &amp; Zou,

   <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> was decreasing and increasing. In treatments containing 1.5 and 2% of AEO, from the third day of storage, no values of 
   <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span> were observed. In general, the reduction in bacterial growth in essential oil treatments is due to phenolic compounds in the AEO, which, by increasing the concentration of these compounds, can effectively inhibit bacterial growth and enhance the bactericidal properties. Since the essential oils are mainly lipophilic, they easily pass through the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane and disintegrate the structure of different layers of polysaccharides, fatty acids and phospholipids. In bacteria, membrane permeability is associated with loss of ions and membrane potential recovery, proton pump disruption, and reduced ATP reserve. Herbal essential oils can cause the cytoplasm clotting and damaging lipids and proteins. Damage to the wall and membrane of the cell can lead to the evacuation of macromolecules and eventually death of the cell (Bakkali, Averbeck, Averbeck, &amp; Idaomar,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Undoubtedly, sensory characteristics such as odor and taste are the most important factors in accepting a product from a consumer perspective. Therefore, it is important to examine the sensory characteristics by taking into consideration the marketability of the product; sensory analysis is the final guide to the acceptance of the product by the evaluators. According to the results (Figure 
   <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0003">3</a>), did not change the chicken odor by adding chitosan and anise essential oil to 1%, but with the increase in AEO concentration, the sensory rating of the chicken burger decreased. Regarding the taste of chicken burger, the addition of chitosan and AEO at 1.5% did not change the taste of chicken burger, but in AEO at 2%, the sensory score decreased. However, all treatments had a sensory score approved by the evaluators. Ojagh et al. (
   <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0034">2010</a>) also stated that by adding chitosan and cinnamon essential oil, the sensory analysis of the stored trout fillet decreased as compared to the control treatment. But in sum, all treatments had a sensory rating approved by the evaluators.
