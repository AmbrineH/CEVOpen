 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different dilutions prepared on a plate containing Baird Parker Agar Base were incubated at 37°C for 48 hr and then plates containing 20–300 colonies of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> were counted. For significant colonies of this microorganism, coagulase test was performed and positive coagulase colonies were reported as 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>. The coagulase test was performed as follows: the suspicious colonies were transferred to tubes containing 0.3 ml of heart and brain juice and mixed well, and then cultured on a tryptic soy agar diagonal agar using a culture loop. Both the liquid and solid cultures were incubated for 24–18 hr at 37°C. Solid culture was used for storage for confirmatory tests, if necessary. To a culture medium, about 0.5 ml of plasma was added and mixed, the tube containing the culture was re‐incubated at 37°C and were examined for clot formation at intervals of up to 6 hr, and in case of clot formation, 4+ and 3 +  clots were reported as positive coagulase (Downes &amp; Ito,
