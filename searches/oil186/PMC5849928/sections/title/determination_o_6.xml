 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequent concentrations of the anise essential oil (100, 125, 150, 175, 200, etc.) were prepared in Muller‐Hinton medium containing 5% Dimethyl Sulfoxide. In this method, plates of 96 houses were used with round holes and 300 μl volume. Then, 100 μl of essential oil was transferred to each well and 20 μl of bacterial suspension was added. The contents of each well were mixed for 2 min by the Shaker‐equipped Plate Reader. Then, light absorption was read using a plate reader at zero and at 630 nm length. Plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hr and after completing the incubation, cloudiness or lack of cloudiness were observed in the wells and light absorption was read using Plate Reader at the wavelengths (Hosseinzadeh et al.,
