 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Staphylococcus bacteria are a gram‐positive coccus and β‐hemolytic, which is positive for catalase and coagulase and fermentation of mannitol. This bacterium is commonly the cause of many human infections, and every human being infects the bacterium at least once in his lifetime (Jay et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0024">2005</a>). According to the results, over time, the amounts of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0002">2</a>d) increased in control and chitosan treatment and the highest levels of bacteria were observed in control treatment (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05) in treatments containing 0.5% 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> first, it reduced, and on the ninth day its values reached zero. In the treatment containing 1% of AEO decreased by increasing the time until the third day and on the sixth day the 
  <span class="italic">s. aureus</span> was kept to zero. In the treatment containing 1.5 and 2% essential oil of the anise from the third day of storage, no values of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> was not observed. The antimicrobial activity of anise essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> has also been reported in other researchers (Al‐Bayati, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0004">2008</a>; Gulcin et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0019">2003</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to ISRI (
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0022">2003</a>), the permitted levels of 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> for chicken burger is 3 log CFU/g. In this study, the control treatment had a permitted limit up to 3 days and the chitosan treatment up to 6 days and the rest of the treatments to the end of the storage period.
