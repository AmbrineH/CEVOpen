 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the increase in population and the emergence of new phenomena such as the development of cities, the establishment of factories and, consequently, the employment of family members, to provide livelihood and relative welfare, the need for ready‐made foods has become a necessity and expanded to some extent that these foods are an integral part of people's lives today, while chicken products are of particular importance (Luiz, Moreira, Correa Ede, &amp; Falcao, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0028">2004</a>). One of the products of chicken meat is frozen raw chicken burger. Meat keeping is limited due to its biological composition, even in glacial conditions, and it quickly receives microbial and chemical contamination, which can, in addition to health hazards, cause undesirable changes in its qualitative characteristics such as taste and smell, color, texture and a reduction in nutritional value and, finally, a loss of shelf life (Davidson &amp; Zivanivic, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0014">2003</a>). Oxidative spoilage causes unpleasant smell, undesirable flavor changes, eventually a change in the nutrient structure and a decrease in the nutritional value of the product, while microbial spoilage and contamination lead to serious risks to the health of the consumer. Therefore, the use of appropriate substances with antibacterial and antioxidant activity is useful and necessary to improve the quality and increase the shelf‐life of the meat while preventing economic losses. Antioxidants have been used for many years as additives in food. In fact, antioxidants, by reducing the rate of fat oxidation, increase the shelf‐life of foodstuffs and improve the stability of lipids and lipid foods, thereby preventing the loss of sensory characteristics and their nutritional value (Burt, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>). Today, the use of natural antioxidants, such as spices and plants, as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, is highly recommended for food preservation (Sakanaka, Tachibana, &amp; Okada, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0040">2005</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</span> L is from the Umbelliferae family, a herbaceous annual plant, the most part of which is its green, pear‐shaped and small fruits that are found in Turkey, Iran, India, Egypt and many other tropical regions. This plant is used as a flavoring in the food and pharmaceutical industries (Al‐Bayati, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0004">2008</a>; Gulcin et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0019">2003</a>). Based on the research, anise essential oil contains anothole, eugenol, methylchavicol, anisaldehyde and estragole and anothole has been identified as an effective ingredient in anise essential oil (Abdel‐Reheem &amp; Oraby, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0001">2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to what stated, the use of natural ingredients in food sources can be a good alternative to artificial preservatives, but restricts the cost of using and other problems, such as odor intensity, potential toxicity, and uncontrolled release of these substances into food products and also inactivation of food. One strategy to reduce the dose of essential oil while maintaining their effectiveness can be adding these natural compounds to edible coatings and films (Sánchez‐González, Vargas, González‐Martínez, Chiralt, &amp; Cháfer, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0042">2011</a>). Chitosan is a biopolymer that has many uses in the food industry and is the second most natural polymer in nature after cellulose. The polysaccharide has functional properties such as microbial, fungicidal and antioxidant properties, and also has properties such as compatibility with environment, biodegradation, nontoxicity and various physical and chemical properties. Other functional properties of chitosan are the ability to form film, adhesion properties, adsorption, refinement and as a dietary fiber used in food, medicine, pharmacy, dyeing, textiles, cosmetics, and so on. A wide range of microorganisms including gram‐positive bacteria, gram‐negative bacteria and molds are sensitive to chitosan (Vásconez, Flores, Campos, Alvarado, &amp; Gerschenson, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0048">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the stated contents, the study aimed to investigate the effect of edible Chitosan film containing anise essential oil (AEO) on microbial and chemical properties of chicken burger kept at refrigerated (4 ± 1°C) temperature.</p>
