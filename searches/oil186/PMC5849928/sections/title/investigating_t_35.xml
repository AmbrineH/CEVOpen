 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main group of microorganisms responsible for the spoilage of freshly stored meat is gram‐negative psycrophilic total count (PTC) (Ojagh et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0034">2010</a>). The important characteristics of the PTC is having a strong proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme and their reproductive rate in short time (Sallam, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0041">2007</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the number of PTC (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0002">2</a>b) increased with increasing storage time. So that the highest amount was observed in control sample and the least in chitosan and essential oil 2% (

Hydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds have an important role in the antimicrobial activity of essential oils and herbal extracts. The presence of the active hydroxyphenolic group has caused these compounds being able to easily form hydrogen bonds with active sites of enzymes (Burt, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>). These compounds usually malfunction in the cytoplasmic membrane, break and disrupt the proton movement, electron beam and activated transmission, and cause coagulation of cellular content (Burt, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>). In fact, the antimicrobial effect of these compounds is due to their reaction with proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms, which changes the permeability of the membrane and the formation of probable pores, and ultimately affects the driving force of the protons (Juven, Kanner, Schved, &amp; Weisslowicz, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0025">1994</a>).
