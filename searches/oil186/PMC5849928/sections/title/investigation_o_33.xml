 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to evaluate the degree of oxidation of fat in food, the TBA is widely used, indicating the amount of secondary oxidation products, especially aldehydes and ketones (Nishimoto, Suwetja, &amp; Miki, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0032">1985</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With increasing time, the levels of thyobic acid (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0001">1</a>b) increased in all treatments (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .05). The increasing trend of this index is due to the increase in free iron and other peroxides in the muscle, as well as the production of aldehydes from secondary products resulting from the hydroperoxides breakdown (Gomes, Silva, Nascimento, &amp; Fukuma, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0018">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest levels of thiobarbituric acid was observed in control treatment. The lowest levels of thyobarbitonic acid were observed in chitosan + essential oil 2%. Generally, biodegradable coatings such as chitosans have a very low permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide. Thus, the coating formed on the surface of the burgers significantly reduces the contact rate of the product with oxygen, which reduces the rate of initial oxidation of lipids and consequently the formation of hydroperoxides (Mohan, Ravishankar, &amp; Srinivasagopal, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0030">2008</a>). The anise essential oil has the ability to break free radicals by giving a hydrogen atom, and due to its significant amounts of phenolic compounds, the flavonoid has an antioxidant effect that delays oxidative damage in burgers and increased by increasing the percentage of this property in essential oils, and also the combination of essential oil and chitosan caused synergy of antioxidant properties, resulting in better results in chitosan and essential oil 2%. Several studies reported that the antioxidant effect of natural essential oils depends on the amount of their antioxidants (Burt, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0011">2004</a>; Sagdic, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0039">2003</a>). This study also confirms this issue.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum limit for Thiobarbituric of meat fat is 1–2 mg malondialdehyde/kg fat, which is acceptable for human consumption (Lakshmanan, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0027">2000</a>). In this study, chitosan + essential oils 1.5% and 2%, had an acceptable limit until the end of storage period.
