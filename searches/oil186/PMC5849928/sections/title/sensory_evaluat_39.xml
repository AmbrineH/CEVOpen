 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Undoubtedly, sensory characteristics such as odor and taste are the most important factors in accepting a product from a consumer perspective. Therefore, it is important to examine the sensory characteristics by taking into consideration the marketability of the product; sensory analysis is the final guide to the acceptance of the product by the evaluators. According to the results (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0003">3</a>), did not change the chicken odor by adding chitosan and anise essential oil to 1%, but with the increase in AEO concentration, the sensory rating of the chicken burger decreased. Regarding the taste of chicken burger, the addition of chitosan and AEO at 1.5% did not change the taste of chicken burger, but in AEO at 2%, the sensory score decreased. However, all treatments had a sensory score approved by the evaluators. Ojagh et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0034">2010</a>) also stated that by adding chitosan and cinnamon essential oil, the sensory analysis of the stored trout fillet decreased as compared to the control treatment. But in sum, all treatments had a sensory rating approved by the evaluators.
