 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> bacterium, also called 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>, is a kind of gram‐negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family. 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> has been identified in many foods worldwide, and the consumption of grinded raw meat is one of the common risks of foodborne pathogenetic infections such as 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> (Solomakos, Govaris, Koidis, &amp; Botsoglou, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0047">2008</a>). Antibiotic resistant 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> are transmitted to humans through the use of meat products and may also cause antibiotic resistance in humans. According to the results, with increasing time, the levels of 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3544-fig-0002">2</a> e) increased in control treatment. In Chitosan treatments, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> values were decreasing throughout the maintenance period. In the treatment containing 0.5% AEO, decreased by increasing the time until the third day and on the sixth day, the amount of 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> was reduced to zero. In the treatment containing 1, 1.5, and 2% AEO from the third day of storage, no evidence was found for 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>. ISRI (
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0022">2003</a>), suggested the permitted levels of 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> for chicken burger log CFU/g negative pathogen. The antimicrobial property of anise essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> has been reported by other researchers (Al‐Bayati, 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0004">2008</a>; Gulcin et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0019">2003</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study coincided with the results of researchers like Jalali et al. (
  <a rid="fsn3544-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3544-bib-0023">2016</a>), which indicated that coating treatment containing clove oil 1.5% was able to inhibit the growth of the inoculated Ashirosilicum bacterium in the phytofag fillet and to adhere to the acceptable level.
