<p class="p">The addition of anise essential oil to chitosan film (20.96%) decreased moisture content, so that the minimum moisture content in chitosan film + AEO was 2% (9.91%) (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05). This phenomenon is due to the formation of covalent connections between the chitosan chain and the AEO. The formation of these bonding led to the reduction in free hydroxyl and amine groups in the film network and thus reduced the amount of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and the functional groups of polymeric chains, and the reduction in hydrogen bonding resulted in a decrease in the moisture content of films containing anise essential oil (Hosseini et al.,
