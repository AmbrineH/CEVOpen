<p>Water solubility is an important factor in the film that demonstrates the resistance of films against water and is used to package foods that has high water activity, or when films have to be in contact with water and act as food protectors is very important (Bourtoom &amp; Chinnan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In general, the higher the solubility, the lower the resistance to water (Abdollahi, Rezaei, &amp; Farzi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The solubility was reduced by adding AEO to chitosan film (25.98%), so that the lowest solubility was observed in chitosan + AEO 2% (9.49%) (

The hydrophobic properties of essential oils, due to their lipid nature, lead to the hydrophobicity of essential oil samples than control film samples and produce a film with lower solubility in water. This type of film can be very useful for covering food that has a wet surface (Bahram et al.,
