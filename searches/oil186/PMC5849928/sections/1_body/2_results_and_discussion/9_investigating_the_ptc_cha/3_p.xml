<p class="p">In this study, the number of PTC (Figure

Hydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds have an important role in the antimicrobial activity of essential oils and herbal extracts. The presence of the active hydroxyphenolic group has caused these compounds being able to easily form hydrogen bonds with active sites of enzymes (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). These compounds usually malfunction in the cytoplasmic membrane, break and disrupt the proton movement, electron beam and activated transmission, and cause coagulation of cellular content (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In fact, the antimicrobial effect of these compounds is due to their reaction with proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms, which changes the permeability of the membrane and the formation of probable pores, and ultimately affects the driving force of the protons (Juven, Kanner, Schved, &amp; Weisslowicz,
