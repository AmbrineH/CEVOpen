<p class="p">The chemical compounds of the AEO were calculated using the gas chromatography apparatus attached to the mass spectrometer, and the results were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>. Among the constituents, 21 combinations containing 99.88% of essential oil compounds were identified. Among the constituents, the most essential compounds were Anethole (74.40%), Thymol (11.44%), Terpinene‐ γ (4.61%), Dl‐Limonene (2.06%), and Estragole (1.87%). The results of this study are consistent with the results of Sharifi, Kiani, Ahmadzadeh, Ahmadzadeh, and Ahmadzadeh (
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) regarding anise essential oil. The most important compounds in their study were E‐anethole (92.9%), p‐allylanisole (2.2%), and Za‐bisabolene (1.8%). In the study of Orav, Raal, and Arak (
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), the major components of the AEO in different regions of Europe were trans‐anethole between 76.9% and 93.7% and γ‐himachalene between 0.4% and 8.2%. In all studies, the most important compounds of AEO were Anethole, and also the studies indicated that the AEO has anti‐bacterial and antioxidant properties and can be used as a natural preservative in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Of course, as you can see, there are differences in the amount and type of essential oil combinations in the various studies, in general, the composition of the herbal essential oils in terms of geographical area, plant variety, age of the plant when preparing the essential oil, environmental and seasonal conditions, type of crop, harvest time, drying and extraction of essential oils, extraction of various organs and eventually genetic variation of the plant can change (Burt,
