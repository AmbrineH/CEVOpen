<p>One of the criteria used by most researchers to measure the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum concentration of fecundity. Due to the fact that each antimicrobial agent has different effects on microorganisms, this study investigated the AEO on gram‐negative microorganisms such as 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and gram‐positive bacteria like 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> using microdilution method. According to the results (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>), the highest MIC values were observed in 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and the lowest values were found in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Several reports have shown that gram‐positive bacteria are more susceptible to antibacterial compounds than gram‐negative bacteria. The resistance of gram‐negative bacteria against antibacterial agents with the hydrophilic surface of the outer membrane of bacteria that is rich in lipopolysaccharide molecules and creates a buffer against the penetration of different antibiotic molecules, as well as with perivascular enzymes that can break the molecules imported from outside are also in contact. Gram‐positive bacteria do not have such an external membrane in the cell wall structure. Some antibiotics can easily destroy the walls of the bacterial cell and the cytoplasmic membrane and lead to the release of its cytoplasm (Shan, Cai, Brooks, &amp; Corke,
