<p>The total count of microorganisms is a measure to determine the health quality of a product that expresses the nonusability of the product. With increasing time, total viable count (TVC) levels (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) increased in all treatments (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The increase in TVC for each treatment during the maintenance period depends on the amount of manipulation, the amount of health in the treatments and the initial rate of bacteria (Chidanandaiah, Keshri, &amp; Sanyal, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). According to the results, the addition of chitosan to chicken burger decreased the TVC, which indicates that chitosan coating plays a significant role in reducing the total bacterial load (Chidanandaiah et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In all maintenance periods, the lowest amounts of TVC were observed in chitosan + essential oil (2%) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The low amount of TVC in essential oil treatments can be due to phenolic compounds. The phenolic compounds in plant essential oils of the outer membrane destroy microorganisms and cause the release of liposaccharides and increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane to ATP. The withdrawal of ATP results in the completion of cellular energy storage and cell death (Burt,
