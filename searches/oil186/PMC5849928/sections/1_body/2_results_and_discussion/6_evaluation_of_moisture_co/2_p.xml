<p class="p">Moisture is one of the important factors in the quality of food. The results of moisture content in this study (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a) showed that by increasing time, moisture content decreased significantly in all treatments (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05). The reason for the decrease in moisture content of the samples is the effect of proteolytic enzymes on proteins and their conversion to free amino acids and, consequently, their inability to retain moisture. The reduction in moisture content of the samples, in addition to weight loss, reduces soluble proteins, increases oxidative changes, changes the nature of the protein, changes color and, consequently, reduces product quality (Beklevik, Polat, &amp; Özogul,
