<p>At all times, the lowest moisture content was observed in control treatment, and changes in moisture content were decreased by adding the coating and essential oil. The highest moisture content was observed in chitosan + essential oil (1.5% and 2%) (

In fact, it can be stated that the use of the transfer coating slows down the moisture between the burger and the atmosphere and allows it to control the moisture content of the uncoated treatment. Control of surface moisture content by edible coatings can significantly reduce the growth of microorganisms and the speed of their destructive reactions, thus increasing the storage time of foods (Ozdemir &amp; Floros,
