<p>After weighing, the film pieces were put into 50 cc of distilled water and stirring was done for 6 hr at a temperature of 25°C. Then the film and water mixture was filtered in a filter paper that has already reached constant weight and was accurately weighed. The filter paper was placed at 110°C with the sample to reach constant weight. The solubility of films in water is calculated as follows: (Hosseini et al.,
