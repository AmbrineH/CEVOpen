 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Water was poured into the cell permeability measurement for testing. Afterwards, the cell surface was coated with molten paraffin. Cells were placed inside the desiccators containing silica gel. Water at 25°C produces 100% moisture. The difference in humidity on the two sides of the coating at 25°C makes the gradient of a steam pressure equal to 2.337*10
