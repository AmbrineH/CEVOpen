 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157: H7. The microorganisms were collected from the Iranian Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. At first, bacteria were cultured in a Muller‐Hinton Agar medium for 18 hr at 37°C. The re‐culture was then taken from the first culture and kept at 37°C for 18 hr. The second culture was mixed to form a stoic with a ratio of 1–5 with sterile glycerin. In 100 μl volumes, It was kept at −20°C in eppendorf tubes, in 100 μl volumes. (Hosseinzadeh et al.,
