<p class="p">Seeds of anise were prepared from the Institute of Forestry and Rangeland Research in Kashan. After confirmation of scientific name by the Institute of Pharmacology, essential oil seeds were powdered using mixture and 150 g of powder was mixed with one liter of distilled water and the extraction was done for 3 hr using sodium sulfate and the essential oil was stored in dark containers until the test was carried out at 4°C (Al‐Bayati, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Identification of compounds was done using various parameters, such as mass spectrum studies, and comparison of these spectra with standard compounds and information available in the library of the GC/MS machine (Adams, 
 <xref rid="fsn3544-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The relative proportions of each of the constituents of the essential oil according to its curved surface in the GC chromatogram were obtained by normalizing the surface and ignoring the response coefficients.
