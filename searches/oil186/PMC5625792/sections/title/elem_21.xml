   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> (percentage of each compound, Retention Time (RT) and Retention Index (RI)). Thirty-six compounds, corresponding to 99.9% of the total oil, were identified in the ROEO, according to their elution order on a DB-5MS column. ROEO contained a complex mixture of compounds. In fact, monoterpene hydrocarbons, with 62.28%, were the most important classes of compounds present in ROEO (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Other classes, oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, were also found in smaller amounts, 21.72% and 12.18%, respectively (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The remaining compounds were identified in traces. The major components of ROEO were 1,8-cineole (23.56%), camphene (12.78%), camphor (12.55%), β pinene (12.3%), γ-terpinene (7.56%) and caryophyllene oxide (5.02%) (Table

   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the graphs. ROEO exhibited varying cytotoxic effect on Hela and MCF-7 cell lines with more pronounced activity against Hela cells. ROEO was strongly inhibiting the proliferation of Hela cells with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 0.011 μl ml
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, while at a concentration of 0.253 μl ml
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, it inhibited 50% of the MCF-7 cell proliferation.

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to study cell migration and proliferation of untreated and treated cells with ROEO, the cell migration assay was performed. Results showed that the wound disappeared rapidly after 48 h for the untreated cells in comparison with the wound in the treated cells whose is slowly covered by the cells during the same incubation time for both Hela and MCF-7 cells (Fig.
