 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the ROEO was performed using an Agilent 5975B mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 6890Â N gas chromatograph using the protocol previously described by Boukhris et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The identification of the ROEO compounds was realized using a comparison of their retention times to 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes, and their similarities to MS corresponding database (Wiley and NIST Library) and published data and spectra of authentic compounds.
