 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibacterial activity of the ROEO was evaluated by the micro-dilution method against two Gram positive bacterial strains, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> which represent species that are commonly found in multi-resistant infections. ROEO produced inhibitory and bactericidal effects against the tested strains. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values are summarized in Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>. ROEO exhibited important antibacterial effect against the two bacteria. It inhibited 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> ATCC 9144 and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> S61 with MIC values in the range of [1.25–2.5] and [0.312–0.625] μl ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively, whereas bactericidal activities against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> reached higher concentrations values in the order of 5 and 2.5 μl ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively.
