 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ROEO was evaluated for its in vitro anticancer activities against human cancer cells using MTT assay. Both cell lines, Hela and MCF-7, were exposed to increasing concentrations of ROEO. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the percentage of cell survival versus increasing concentrations of the essential oil in comparison with the control, which presents the untreated cells. As indicated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the percentage of cell viability decreases with increasing essential oil concentrations. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the graphs. ROEO exhibited varying cytotoxic effect on Hela and MCF-7 cell lines with more pronounced activity against Hela cells. ROEO was strongly inhibiting the proliferation of Hela cells with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 0.011 μl ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, while at a concentration of 0.253 μl ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, it inhibited 50% of the MCF-7 cell proliferation.
