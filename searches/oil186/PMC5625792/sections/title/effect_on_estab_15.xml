 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of ROEO on established biofilm was studied using the method previously described by Kavanaugh and Ribbeck [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] with slight modification. After biofilm formation for 48 h, the medium and non-attached bacteria were removed by aspiration using a micropipette followed by a twice washing with PBS. 200 μl of ROEO, diluted in medium and supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, were placed into each well to yield final concentrations of 1.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 μl ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Plates were further incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. After incubation, biofilms were stained with crystal violet as described previously. Each experiment was evaluated in triplicate. The control was a biofilm without essential oil. By comparing the OD values (570 nm) of the growth control with that of the essential oil, we calculated the percentage of biofilm eradication using the equation:
