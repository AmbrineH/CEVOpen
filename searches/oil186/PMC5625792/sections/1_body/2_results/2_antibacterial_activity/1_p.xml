<p id="Par34" class="p">The antibacterial activity of the ROEO was evaluated by the micro-dilution method against two Gram positive bacterial strains, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> which represent species that are commonly found in multi-resistant infections. ROEO produced inhibitory and bactericidal effects against the tested strains. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. ROEO exhibited important antibacterial effect against the two bacteria. It inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 9144 and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> S61 with MIC values in the range of [1.25–2.5] and [0.312–0.625] μl ml
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively, whereas bactericidal activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> reached higher concentrations values in the order of 5 and 2.5 μl ml
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively.
