<p id="Par39">Moreover, Resazurin test showed that ROEO has an effect on the viability of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. The cell viability is inversely proportional to the concentration of ROEO. In fact, at 50 μl ml
 <sup>−1</sup>, the cell viability in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> biofilm did not exceed 50% as assessed by fluorescence measurement (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The inhibition of cell viability was also found even at a concentration of 1.25 μl ml
 <sup>−1</sup>.
