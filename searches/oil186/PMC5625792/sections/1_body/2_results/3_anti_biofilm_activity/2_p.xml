<p id="Par36">For the anti-adhesion activity, results showed an important attenuated level of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> biofilm formation with different concentration of ROEO ranging from 1.25 to 25 μl ml
 <sup>−1</sup>, which presented 4 to 80-fold greater than the MIC. At a concentration of 25 μl ml
 <sup>−1</sup> (40–80 × MIC, 10 × MBC), ROEO showed the highest inhibitory effect with a percentage of inhibition value of 57.1%. Moreover, the doses of 12.5, 2.5 and 1.25 μl ml
 <sup>−1</sup> exerted also an inhibitory effect with reduction rate of 49.21, 25.43 and 23.24%, respectively (Fig.
