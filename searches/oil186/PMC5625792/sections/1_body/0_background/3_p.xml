<p id="Par16">In many studies, antitumor activity has been reported for essential oils against several tumor cell lines. In fact, in-vitro anticancer activity of the essential oil isolated from the leaf of 
 <italic>Machilus mushaensis</italic> from Taiwan was analyzed and the oil exhibited cytotoxic activity against human oral, liver, lung, colon, melanoma, and leukemic cancer cells [

 <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> (Lour) and this investigation exhibited the potent chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive effect of 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> (Lour) essential oil over lung metastasis [
