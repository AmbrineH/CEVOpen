 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, commonly known as Rosemary, is a flavoured herb which is native to the Mediterranean region and grows in various countries in the world [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] showed that 1,8-cineole is the major component of Rosemary essential oil, whereas, in other studies α-pinene was the main component, followed by 1,8-cineole, camphene, β-myrcene, borneol and camphor [

Essential oils represent an alternative “green “to be used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, agricultural and food fields while substituting chemical treatments. Biological activities of essential oils from various plants, including Rosemary, have been attributed to the presence of specific chemical compounds [
