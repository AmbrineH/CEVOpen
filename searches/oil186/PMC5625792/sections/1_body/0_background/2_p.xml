<p id="Par15">Bacteria, during development, can be present in planktonic or sessile forms known as biofilm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Biofilm is a microbial structure that causes many problems in medical field, in food industry and even to the environment. Thus, biofilm could cause many public health problems. Indeed, nearly 80% of chronic bacterial infections are associated with the presence of biofilm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, biofilms contaminate the majority of medical or prosthetic devices such as vascular prosthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], urinary catheters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], joint prostheses, pacemakers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], contact lens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and dental plates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As the antibiotic treatment is most effective against microbial infections, bacterial biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics posing a public health problem. Indeed, concentrations of antibiotics needed to inhibit bacteria in biofilms may be greater than a thousand times that required to inhibit the same planktonic bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. So, it is necessary to find alternatives to fight against biofilm problems. In addition, biofilms cause a problem in many food industries. They contaminate the surfaces in contact with food while causing an alteration of the organoleptic quality of food products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been previously demonstrated that essential oils are able to penetrate and cause the destruction of microbial biofilms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Few studies have shown the anti-biofilm activity of ROEO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, all of these studies did not use 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, which is the major cause of catheter infections, as a model for anti-biofilm studies.
