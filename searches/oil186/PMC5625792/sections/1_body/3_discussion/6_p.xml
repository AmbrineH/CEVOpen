<p id="Par47">ROEO strongly inhibited the proliferation of Hela followed by MCF-7 cells. The variability of cytotoxicity effect of this oil against Hela and MCF-7 cells could be associated to the polyvalent oil composition, the different types of interaction between compounds and cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and the difference of cancer cells sensitivities to cytotoxic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. According to the literature, the anticancer activity of ROEO is due to the main components such as 1,8-cineole, camphor, α-pinene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and β-caryophyllene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The evaluation of cell migration inhibition by ROEO showed that the oil could prevent the rapid cell migration. We can conclude therefore that the ROEO slows the proliferation and the cell migration. Thus, ROEO could be considered as a potential anti-cancer oil.
