 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in patients with all types of medical devices. In fact, it is often isolated from infected prosthetic joints, central venous catheters, intracardiac devices, artificial heart valves and vascular grafts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] demonstrated that 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is the cause of 13% of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) infections, with a high rate of intracardiac abscess (38%) and mortality by 24%. Billions of dollars are spent each year for the replacement of infected devices such as intravascular and urinary catheters, mechanical heart valves, pacemakers, contact lenses, prosthetic implants [
