<p id="Par46" class="p">The comparison of the effect of ROEO against biofilm and planktonic cells showed that bacterial cells within biofilm were more resistant than their planktonic forms. These findings correlate with previous studies showing that bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents within the biofilm can reach 1000 times of the bacterial resistance in suspension [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Another factor, which can justify the biofilm resistance, is that the majority of antimicrobial agents are active against cells in active division, which is not the case for bacteria in biofilm mode [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. In fact, the biofilm is a stack of layers. The deepest are characterized by low growth rates due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. It has been previously reported that essential oils could diffuse through polysaccharide matrix of the mature biofilm and destabilize it due to strong intrinsic antimicrobial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Moreover, the anti-adherent activity is explained by the alteration of bacterial surface proteins due to their interactions with oils. This, will inhibit the initial attachment phase to the abiotic surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. These results support the medical application of these oils for the prevention and/or treatment of certain infections and diseases.
