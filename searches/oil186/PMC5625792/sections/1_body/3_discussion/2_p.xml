<p id="Par43">ROEO is rich in monoterpene compounds (62.28%), which were reported in the literature for their antimicrobial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. More particularly, the richness of the oil in monoterpene hydrocarbons such as 1,8-cineole (23.56%), characterized by its strong antimicrobial activity against several bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] may explain the inhibitory and bactericidal effect against both strains 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> On the other hand, the effect of minor compounds such as Germacrene-D (0.19%), caryophyllene (2.8%), caryophyllene oxide (5.02%), terpinene-4-ol (1.23%), also known for their antimicrobial effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], could not be denied. In fact, it has been reported that these compounds could act synergistically and consequently be responsible of the founded antibacterial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].
