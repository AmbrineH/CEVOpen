 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study demonstrated the scolicidal activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> which could be used as a natural scolicidal agent to reduce the risk of spillage protoscoleces during CE surgery. However, further investigation is required to confirm these findings through studying the essential oil in a clinical setting as a new scolicidal agent.
