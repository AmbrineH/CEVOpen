   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a> shows the obtained results by the GC/MS analysis of 
   <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil. Thirteen compounds were identified, which represented 98.93% of the total oil. The main components were cinnamaldehyde (91.8%), ρ-metoxicinamate (1.57%), and α-pinene (1.25%).

   <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a> shows the scolicidal effects of 
   <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil with different concentrations following various exposure times. 
   <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> essential oil with the concentrations of 100 and 50 μL/mL killed 100% of protoscoleces after 5 min of exposure. Likewise, the mean mortality rate of protoscoleces with the concentration of 25 μL/mL was 100% after 10 min of incubation. However, lower concentrations showed moderate protoscolicidal effects so that, at the concentration of 12.5 μL/mL, 36.6, 74.3, 100, and 100% of protoscoleces and, at the concentration of 6.25 μL/mL, 16.6, 43, 82.3, and 100% of protoscoleces were killed after 5, 10, 20, and 30 min of incubation, respectively. However, the mortality rate of protoscoleces in the negative and positive controls was 4.3% after 30 min and 100% after 5 min of exposure, respectively. Therefore, the obtained findings demonstrated that the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">C. zeylanicum</span> at all of these concentrations had more significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) scolicidal effects than the control group.
