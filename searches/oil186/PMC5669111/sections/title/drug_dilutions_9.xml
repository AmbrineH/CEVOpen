 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil (0.1 mL) was dissolved in 0.97 mL of normal saline. In addition, to increase the dispersal of the essential oil, 0.03 mL of Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the test tube. Obtained solution was adequately mixed using a magnetic stirrer. Then, serial dilution was made to access the essential oil at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 Î¼L/mL. The selection of the essential oil dilutions was according to pilot experiments, which also indicated that normal saline plus Tween 20 had no effect on the growth of protoscoleces.</p>
