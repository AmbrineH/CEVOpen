<p>In line with the present results, Saleem 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported cinnamaldehyde (49.15%), limonene (15.10%), and α-pinene (1.25%) as the main components of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation method.[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In several studies, antimicrobial activities of cinnamaldehyde as the main component of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> against some pathogenic strains have been shown.[
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Therefore, phytoconstituents in this plant could be answerable for their scolicidal effects although their accurate manner of action is inadequately understood. However, some researchers have shown its effects on the energy creation of microorganisms.[
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The possible inhibition mechanisms of energy generation are the inhibition of glucose uptake or utilization of glucose and effects on membrane permeability.[
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Moreover, in the case of the antimicrobial mechanism of some monoterpene hydrocarbons such as limonene and α-pinene, Sikkema 
 <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that they were dim into pathogen and hurt cell membrane structures.[
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] In addition, other studies demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of these compounds is related to their capability to affect not only permeability but also other functions of cell wall; these compounds might cross the cell membranes and thus penetrate into the interior of the cell and interact with the critical intracellular sites.[
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Previous investigations on laboratory animals have demonstrated that liver and kidney is the main object limb of drug toxicity.[
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Injure to the structural integrity of the liver is evaluated by increased serum levels of enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin. On the other hand, the Cr blood test and BUN are used to evaluate kidney function. Acute and subacute toxicity is the first steps of evaluation toxicity effects all drugs. In these methods, tested drugs used in both routes of oral and intraperitoneal administration. In this study, we have used manifold concentrations in comparison with concentrations applied for its protoscolicidal scolicidal effects.
