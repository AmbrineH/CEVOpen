 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] For this reason, the present results supported the idea that 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> could be a natural origin for producing a new protoscolicidal agent which can be applied in CE surgery. Previously, Sharififar

 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported the presence of high amounts of tannin and alkaloid as well as lack of saponins in the phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> barks. Individual activities of these compounds were proven by Cowan.[
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] It was found that the main components were cinnamaldehyde (91.8%), r-metoxicinamate (1.57%), and Î±-pinene (1.25%).
