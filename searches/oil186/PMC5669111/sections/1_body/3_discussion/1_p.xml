<p>Consistent with the World Health Organization, a perfect scolicidal agent for dropping the risk of protoscoleces spillage through hydatid cyst surgery is explained by elevated effectiveness in a shorter time of contact, high influence at lower doses, higher accessibility, constancy in the attendance of cystic fluid, and lower toxicity.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Historically, herbs and spices as pure compounds, because of having low toxicity, low cost, high efficacy, and high availability, give boundless opportunities for new drug improvement.[

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> barks, its scolicidal effects on the hydrated cyst protoscoleces, and its acute toxicity in the mice model.
