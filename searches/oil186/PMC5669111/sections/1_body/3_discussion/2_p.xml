<p>The obtained findings demonstrated that 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> at concentrations of 100 and 50 μL/mL completely killed hydatid cyst protoscoleces after 5 min of incubation, whereas lower concentrations of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil motivated deferred protoscolicidal effects. It was also found that the scolicidal activity of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> was analogous with the current scolicidal agents such as 20% hypertonic saline, 20% silver nitrate, 0.5%–1% cetrimide, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> 3% (15 min), and 95% ethyl alcohol with potent scolicidal effects between 10 and 20 min.
