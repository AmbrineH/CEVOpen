 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Essential oils are an important supply of new antimicrobial agents as a result of their two imperative properties: further protection to people and environment in addition to low risk of the appearance of microbial resistance, given that they have components which possibly will indicate a range of mechanisms of antimicrobial effects.[

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) has long been used as a spice and flavoring agent in different cultures around the world for several centuries. True cinnamon or 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> is the inner bark of a small evergreen tree, which is considered a medication for respiratory, digestive, and gynecological disorders.[

 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Previous investigations have found cinnamaldehyde, camphene, linalool, a-phelendrene, a-terpinene, and limonene as the main constituents of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil.[

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This study analyzes the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark, its scolicidal effects on protoscoleces of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>, and its toxicity in mice.
