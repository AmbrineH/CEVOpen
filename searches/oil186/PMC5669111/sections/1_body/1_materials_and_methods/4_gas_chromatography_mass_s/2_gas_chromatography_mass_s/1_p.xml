<p>GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was carried out by a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) coupled with a TRACE mass (Manchester, UK). Helium was used as carrier gas with ionization voltage of 70 eV. Ion source and interface temperatures were 230 and 280°C, respectively. Mass range was from 40 to 300 U. Oven temperature program was the same given above for the GC.</p>
