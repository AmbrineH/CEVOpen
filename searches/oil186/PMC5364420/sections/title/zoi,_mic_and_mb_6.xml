  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>. The results showed that the essential oil had a satisfactory antibacterial activity on all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The ZOI values of the essential oil were in the range of 10.5–24.4 mm for all tested bacterial strains, respectively. The MIC and MBC values for tested bacterial strains were in the range of 10–40 mg/mL and 20–40 mg/mL, respectively. Unfortunately, the MIC and MBC values of the essential oil for 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> have not been gained when the concentration of essential oil reached the maximum in method system tested. Of these bacteria, the essential oil performed both a minimum MIC of 10 mg/mL and a minimum MBC of 20 mg/mL against 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>, which indicated it was the most effective bacterial inhibitor and bactericide against 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>. On the whole, the Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive than the Gram-negative ones to the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). To some extent, these results were consistent with previous studies on antibacterial activity of 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> essential oils

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, which was likely due to the significant differences in the outer layers of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance of Gram-negative bacteria against essential oils is attributed the presence of a hydrophilic outer membrane which possess hydrophilic polysaccharide chain as a barrier hydrophobic essential oil
