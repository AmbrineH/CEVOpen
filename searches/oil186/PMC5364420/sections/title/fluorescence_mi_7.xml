 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the sensitivity of tested foodborne pathogens, one Gram-negative strain 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and a Gram-negative strain 
  <span class="italic">S. yphimurium</span> were selected as the model organisms to investigate the effect of essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">C. rotundus</span> rhizomes on the viable counts of tested bacterial pathogen by fluorescence intensity changes of the bacteria.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As observed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>, the bacterial number and fluorescence intensity of the essential oil-treated 
  <span class="italic">S. yphimurium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> cells increased dramatically with incubation time and concentrations of essential oil. Taken together, these results confirmed the inhibiting capacity of essential oil on the growth rate of surviving 
  <span class="italic">S. yphimurium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span>, and also suggested that incubation time and concentration presented significant inhibitory effects on the growth of tested bacterial strains.
