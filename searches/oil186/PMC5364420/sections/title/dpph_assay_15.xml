 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scavenging rate and scavenging activity of the sample on DPPH radicals were determined according to the method as previously described
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>. The scavenging activity was expressed by EC
  <sub>50</sub> value that is the effective concentration at which free radicals are scavenged by 50% and is obtained by interpolation from regression analysis.
