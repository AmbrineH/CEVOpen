  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. It was found out that there was no statistically significant difference in sensory characteristics between groups of breast meat (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05); and the differences were significant for groups of leg meat (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). The mixed group had the best score in terms of taste, tenderness and juiciness. When literature was reviewed, it was seen that various aromatic compounds had different effects on chicken meat in terms of sensory properties and these effects changed in line with the dosage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. Simsek et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] reported that although blends of essential oil (thyme + anise + carnation) at different doses (100, 200 and 400 ppm) did not make any difference in sensory properties, essential oils could be used for antimicrobial use in broiler feeding, especially in adverse environmental conditions, and may have a positive effect on digestion. According to our experimental results, it is possible to say that addition of CAP+CAR+CIN at a dose of 150 mg/kg had a sensory synergistic effect and it improves taste, tenderness, juiciness and overall acceptability.
