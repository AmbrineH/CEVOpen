  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, the physical properties of the groups are shown. It was found out that the differences between the groups were statistically significant in terms of thawing, cooking losses and water holding capacity of breast and leg meat (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). The lowest level of thawing loss was observed in CAR group for breast meat and in CAR and CIN groups for the leg meat while the lowest level of cooking loss was observed in the mixed group that is CAP+CAR+CIN for both breast and leg meats. The lowest level of water holding capacity was found in the CAP and control groups for breast meat, and in CAP group for leg meat (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). The difference between the treatment groups and the control group was statistically insignificant in terms of pH levels (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). When the literature on the subject was reviewed, it was seen that addition of essential oils whose main compounds are CAP, CAR or CIN in different ratios had, in general, no effect on the physical properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Elmali et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] stated that the incompatibility of values observed in the study, such as pH levels, cooking loss, color, etc., could be due to the existence of different feeding programs. According to our results of the physical analysis, it can be concluded that the addition of CAR and CIN improves thawing loss in breast and leg meats, the addition of CAP+CAR+CIN improves the cooking loss, and the addition of CAP improves the water holding capacity.

Accordingly, the addition CAP, CAR, CIN and CAP+CAR+CIN to the diet at a dose of 150 mg/kg, did not affect the color (L* -lightness, a* -redness, b* -yellowness) of breast meat, but addition of CAP increased the level of L* value while addition of CIN decreased it (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] mentioned that increasing L* value was desirable in terms of acceptance by consumers. Although in our study the statistically highest L* value was found in the CIN group, this fact was not supported by the findings of sensory analysis carried out to determine consumer acceptance. Nevertheless, the sensory characteristics of the mixed group which had an L* value closest to the CIN group, were found to be more favorable.

  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>. When the groups were compared by the breast meats in terms of firmness, the highest value was found to be in the group with CIN supplement while the lowest value was found to be in the group with CAR supplement. In terms of toughness, no significant difference was observed between groups (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05) except for the group with CAR supplement. On the other hand, in terms of firmness, the difference between treatment groups was found to be statistically insignificant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05) while the highest value for toughness was found in the CAP+CAR+CIN group and the lowest level of toughness was observed in the control group. In the previous studies, it was reported that the results obtained from texture analysis of chicken meat were in line with the results of sensory or physical analysis (color, odor, taste, etc.) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. There is an inverse relationship between the firmness value obtained in textural analysis and the tenderness criterion in sensory analysis. However, the results obtained in the experiments indicated that there was no harmony between the firmness levels and tenderness values determined in the groups. Another relationship is between the value of toughness and the ratio of juiciness. The results obtained from the study show that the highest toughness value (in CAP+CAR+CIN treated group) and the best juiciness ratio (again in CAP+CAR+CIN treated group) seem to correlate positively.
