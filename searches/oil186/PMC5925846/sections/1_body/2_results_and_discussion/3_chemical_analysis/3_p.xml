 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>, the fat compositions of the breast meat in different groups are illustrated. Expectedly, the difference between the groups was found to be statistically significant for linoleic, eicosanoid, linolenic and lignoseric acids (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). When the groups were evaluated for total fatty acid contents of breast meat and Σn-3, Σn-6 Σn-9 fatty acids, it was found out that the difference between total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and Σn-3 fatty acids was statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) while the difference between total saturated (SFA), unsaturated (UFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA), Σn-6 and Σn-9 fatty acids was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Highest ratio for ΣMUFA was observed in CAR group while values for eicosanoid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), lignoseric and Σn-3 fatty acids were found to be highest in CAP+CAR+CIN group. Bolukbasi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] reported that adding 100 and 200 mg/kg of thyme oil to the feed decreased the ratio of ΣSFA while the same addition increased ΣMUFA and ΣPUFA ratios in breast meat. Ciftci et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported that the addition of 500 ppm and 1000 ppm cinnamon oil to the broilers’ ration reduced the ratio of ΣSFA but significantly increased the ratio of Σn-3 and Σn-6 fatty acids, without any affect on ΣMUFA in breast meat. Shin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] reported that addition of conjugated linoleic acid, flaxseed oil or fish oil at a rate of 2% in ration of broiler chickens decreased PUFA while increasing Σn-3 and Σn-6 levels. Sadeghi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] reported that addition of fish oil, instead of corn, to the ration at a rate of 5% did not affect SFA, MUFA, PUFA, but decreased Σn-6 and increased EPA and Σn-3 levels in breast meat.
