 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study underlined the nutritional potential of lesser African threadfin fermented flour and the importance of the use of essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</span> in the improvement of the microbiological quality of this fermented product. Nevertheless, due to the possible interaction between the composition of fermented fish and the essential oil, further investigations are necessary to identify the conditions that maximize the activity of the essential oil, without detrimental effects on the organoleptic properties of the fermented food product.
