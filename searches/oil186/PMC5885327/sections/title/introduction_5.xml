  <span class="italic">Pelargonium roseum </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Willd. (Geraniaceae), is indigenous to Southern Africa, but due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor, it is widely grown as an ornamental plant in almost all parts of the world. 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>has woody straight stems with short rough hairs covering leaves which give the plant a sweet scent (Lis-Balchin et al., 1996
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7"> ▶</a>, Carmen and Hancu, 2014
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2"> ▶</a>). Several bioactivities including antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects were attributed to
  <span class="italic"> P. roseum </span>( Rezai et al., 2008
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10"> ▶</a>; Carmen and Hancu, 2014
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2"> ▶</a>). The antimicrobial efficacy of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>essential oil was tested on several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungi. It was demonstrated that the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>possesses antibacterial and antifungal activities (Carmen and Hancu, 2014

  <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span>, which is considered the cause of avian trichomoniasis is a flagellate located in the upper digestive and occasionally in the respiratory tracts of a large variety of birds, mainly in the orders Columbiformes and Falconiformes (Boal et al., 1998
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1"> ▶</a>; Rouffaer et al., 2014
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11"> ▶</a>). Birds with avian trichomoniasis present caseous lesions within the anterior digestive tract. The lesions range from mild, often subclinical infections, to sever inflammation which can be acute and fatal, and lead to death by starvation due to the obstruction of the lumen of the esophagus (Gerhold et al., 2008
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5"> ▶</a>). 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> has significant health and economic impacts on the poultry industry especially pigeons and game birds rearing and breeding (Stockdale et al., 2015
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14"> ▶</a>) and is considered a major contributing factor to the regulation and even decline of avian populations. The drugs of choice for the treatment of trichomoniasis are nitroimidazoles. Subtherapeutic doses and preventive use of these drugs against trichomoniasis, have resulted in emergence of resistant strains of
  <span class="italic"> T. gallinae</span> (Lumeij and Zwijnenberg, 1990
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8"> ▶</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bearing all this in mind, the present study was designed to evaluate antitrichomonal effect of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>essential oil against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> both 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and to compare its effects to those of metronidazole as a standard antitrichomonal drug.
