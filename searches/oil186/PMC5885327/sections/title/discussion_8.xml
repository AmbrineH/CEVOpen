 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preventive treatment with nitroimidazoles have resulted in the emergence of resistant isolates of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> which are potentially serious threats endangering birds’ lives particularly wild birds. Nitroimidazole-resistant isolates of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> have been reported from different parts of the world including Belgium, Spain, the United States and Iran (Munoz et al., 1998
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9"> ▶</a>; Gerhold et al., 2008
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5"> ▶</a>; Rouffaer et al., 2014
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11"> ▶</a>; Tabari et al, 2017a
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15"> ▶</a>). In spite of the fact that nitroimidazole-resistant strains of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> are becoming prevalent, very few research has focused on finding alternative antitrichomonal agents effective against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. Youssefi et al. (2017)
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17"> ▶</a> evaluated the effects of essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia sieberi </span>against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. Treatment with 
  <span class="italic">A. sieberi</span> 10 μg/ml and metronidazole 20 μg/ml resulted in no viable trophozoite in culture medium after 24 hr (Youssefi et al., 2017
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17"> ▶</a>). Also, Tabari et al. (2017a) demonstrated the antitrichomonal effects of 
  <span class="italic">Peganum harmala</span> alkaloid extract against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>, both 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, and compared the effects of of metronidazole, as a conventional antitrichomonal medication with those of harmine and harmaline, the two alkaloids present in 
  <span class="italic">P. harmala</span>. It was shown that 
  <span class="italic">P. harmala</span> alkaloid extract can be considered a potent natural anti-trichomonal agent and an efficacious alternative for treating metronidazole-resistant isolates of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> (Tabari et al., 2017a
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15"> ▶</a>). Seddik and coworkers (2014) reported that garlic was as effective as MTZ in inhibiting 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> trophozoites’ growth both 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. They also observed side effects like cytotoxicity, carcinogenic effects and neurological dysfunction following MTZ administration, and recommended garlic as a safe alternative for prophylactic and therapeutic uses in case of trichomoniasis (Seddiek et al., 2014
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13"> ▶</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They found that 4-day treatment with garlic 200 mg/kg was effective for treatment of infected pigeons (Seddiek et al., 2014
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13"> ▶</a>). In the present study, 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> 5-day treatment with EO at a dose much lower than 50 mg/kg, resulted in full recovery of infected birds. Seddik et al. (2014) reported the 24-hr MIC of garlic extract 75 µg/mL while this value for 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> was 20 µg/mL. Comparison of these results reveal a probably higher efficacy of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. Fakhrie-Kashan showed that the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> had inhibitory effects on the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas</span>
  <span class="italic">vaginalis</span> trophozoeites (Fakhrie-Kashan et al., 2014). The IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> and MTZ after 24 hr, were 54.67, 27.63 and 0.0326 µg/mL, respectively. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> used in the present study revealed that β- citronellol (29%) and geraniol (18.5%) were the major constituents of the essential oil. Toxicity of β- citronellol and geraniol in 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> complex have been evaluated and ovicidal, larvicidal and moderate knock-down effect of these compounds in adults has been reported (Tabari et al., 2017). Antitrichomonal activity of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>EO against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae </span>is probably due to its citroneloll, geraniol and linalool contents; however, further studies for elucidation of the most effective components and their mechanism of action are still required. Data obtained in this study introduced 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> as a potent natural antitrichomonal agent effective against 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. Bioactive components of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> can be used as leading compounds in development of novel antitrichomonal drugs. In addition, further studies on probable inhibitory effects of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum</span> against 
  <span class="italic">T. vaginalis</span> are also recommended.
