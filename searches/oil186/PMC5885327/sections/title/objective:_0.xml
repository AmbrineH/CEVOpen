  <span class="italic">Pelargonium roseum </span>Willd. (Geraniaceae) is widely grown as an ornamental plant due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor. The present study evaluates the antitrichomonal effect of 
  <span class="italic">P. roseum </span>essential oil (EO) against 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> both 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and compares it to that of metronidazole (MTZ) as a standard antitrichomonal drug.
