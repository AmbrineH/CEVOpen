  <title>Objective:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Pelargonium roseum </italic>Willd. (Geraniaceae) is widely grown as an ornamental plant due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor. The present study evaluates the antitrichomonal effect of 
   <italic>P. roseum </italic>essential oil (EO) against 
   <italic>Trichomonas gallinae</italic> both 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> and compares it to that of metronidazole (MTZ) as a standard antitrichomonal drug.

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>In vitro</italic> assays were accomplished in multi-well plates containing MTZ and EO at final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL. 
   <italic>In vivo</italic> assay was carried out on 40 experimentally infected pigeons receiving MTZ and EO at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The 24-hr MIC of MTZ was 10 µg/mL, while for EO it was 20 µg/mL. Treatment with MTZ 50 mg/kg after 4 days led to full recovery of infected pigeons however EO 50 mg/kg resulted in the same outcome after 5 days. No mortality or clinical side effects were seen in treated birds.</p>

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>The present study introduced 
   <italic>P. roseum </italic>EO as a potent natural antitrichomonal agent effective against 
   <italic>T. gallinae</italic>. Bioactive components of 
   <italic>P. roseum</italic> can be used as potential therapeutic compounds in development of novel antitrichomonal drugs.
