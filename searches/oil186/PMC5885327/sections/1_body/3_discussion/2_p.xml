<p>They found that 4-day treatment with garlic 200 mg/kg was effective for treatment of infected pigeons (Seddiek et al., 2014
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). In the present study, 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> 5-day treatment with EO at a dose much lower than 50 mg/kg, resulted in full recovery of infected birds. Seddik et al. (2014) reported the 24-hr MIC of garlic extract 75 µg/mL while this value for 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> was 20 µg/mL. Comparison of these results reveal a probably higher efficacy of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> against 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic>. Fakhrie-Kashan showed that the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> had inhibitory effects on the growth of 
 <italic>Trichomonas</italic>
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> trophozoeites (Fakhrie-Kashan et al., 2014). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> and MTZ after 24 hr, were 54.67, 27.63 and 0.0326 µg/mL, respectively.
