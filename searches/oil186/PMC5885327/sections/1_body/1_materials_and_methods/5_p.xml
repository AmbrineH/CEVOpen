 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic> were recovered by wet mount method from infected native pigeons. Forty native pigeons (6 to 8 weeks old) were purchased from local breeders in Babol city (Mazandaran Province, Iran). By using swabs moistened with saline solution, samples were taken from membranous lesions of oropharyngeal region of suspicious birds. To produce wet smears, swabs were rubbed over the surface of a microscope slide. Smears were then examined under a light microscope at X100 and X400 magnification to confirm 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic> as the causative agent of lesions. Parasite culture was prepared by immersing oral swabs in tryptone/ yeast extract/ maltose (TYM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma, Germany) and incubated at 37°C (Sansano-Maestre et al., 2009

 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic>. Every 48 hr as the parasites in the logarithmic phase of growth presented more than 95% mobility and normal morphology, isolates were sub-cultured (Seddiek et al., 2014
