<p>The protocol used for the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study was in accordance with laboratory animal welfare guide of Pasteur Institute of Iran and has been approved by the ethics committee. Forty native pigeons ( &gt;6 weeks old) were examined and confirmed to be free of 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> then experimentally infected with Trichomonas by inoculation of 4 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup> trophozoites prepared in 1 mL of 48-hr culture medium. Seven days post-infection, birds were examined and those that were diagnosed as infected with 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic>, were randomly allocated into 5 groups as follows: the first group (CON) were infected but not medicated, EO 25 and EO 50 were the groups infected with 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> essential oil, respectively. MTZ 25 and MTZ 50 groups were infected with 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of metronidazole, respectively. All of the treatments were administered orally (PO) for 7 successive days. Birds of different groups were located in separate wire cages and fed with semisolid mixed grains diet in order to prevent starvation due to difficulty in swallowing because of trichomoniasis. The numbers of motile trophozoites recovered from the infected birds, were determined every day for seven consecutive days.
