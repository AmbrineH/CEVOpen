<p>For preparation of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> essential oil (EO), aerial parts of the plant were collected from a herb garden (Kashan, Iran) during 2014. The identity of the plant was confirmed by professor Rahimian, Sari Agricultural and Natural Resources University (Sari, Iran). By using a Clevenger type apparatus, the essential oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GC-9A with helium as the carrier gas on a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d; film thickness 0.25 mm). GC–MS analysis was carried out on a Varian 3400 GC–MS system with oven temperature set at 40-250°C at a rate of 4°C; transfer line temperature, 260°C; carrier gas, helium with a linear velocity of 31.5 cm/s; split ratio, 1/60; ionization energy, 70 eV; scan time, 1 s: mass range, 40-300 amu.
