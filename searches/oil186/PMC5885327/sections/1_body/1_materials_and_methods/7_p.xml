<p>For the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, we used the method described by Munoz et al., 1998 after making slight modifications. To examine the susceptibilities of 
 <italic>T. gallinae </italic>toward 
 <italic>P. roseum </italic>EO and MTZ, sterile multi-well plates were used to incubate the trophozoites with different concentrations of the essential oil and drug dilutions. A volume of 100 µL of culture medium containing 1× 10
 <sup>4</sup> parasites was pipetted into each well. Also, prediluted MTZ and 
 <italic>P. roseum </italic>EO were added to wells to give final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL. Tween 20 (0.01% of final concentration) was used as a solubilizing agent for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. Control wells received only Tween 20 without any treatments. Subsequently, to generate anaerobic conditions, a layer of 50 µL of vaseline was added to wells based on the method developed by Munoz et al., 1998. All assays were done three times. The wells were examined using an inverted microscope every 24 hr for 3 successive days. The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug in the well at which no motile parasite was observed.
