<p>The results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study of anti-trichomonal activity of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> essential oil and comparison of this activity with that of metronidazole as a standard anti-protozoal drug are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table. 1</xref>. The results revealed high efficacy of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> EO against 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic>. At the dose of 10 µg/mL, MTZ after 24-hr incubation resulted in no viable trophozoite in culture medium. The 24-hr MIC of 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> EO was 20 µg/mL. The 48 and 72-hr MIC values of MTZ were 5 and 2.5 µg/mL, respectively but these values for 
 <italic>P. roseum</italic> were 10 and 5 µg/mL, respectively.
