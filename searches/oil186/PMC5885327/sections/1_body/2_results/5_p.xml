 <italic>In vivo</italic> assay demonstrated effectiveness of MTZ and 
 <italic>P. roseum </italic>EO against 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> in experimentally infected pigeons (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Seven days post-inoculation of 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> (day 1), before initiation of treatments, number of trophozoites recovered from birds were measured and no significant difference was seen among different groups. On the second day of the experiment, treatment with MTZ and EO at the dose of 50 mg/kg resulted in significant reduction of trophozoites in comparison to control group (p&lt;0.05). MTZ at the dose of 50 mg/kg on the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> and 4
 <sup>th</sup> day of the treatment resulted in significant reduction in the number of 
 <italic>T. gallinae</italic> in comparison to all other groups (p&lt;0.05). On the 5
 <sup>th </sup>day, no motile trophozoite was recovered from birds treated with MTZ 50 mg/kg treated. One day later (the 6
 <sup>th</sup> day), treatment with EO 50 mg/kg led to full recovery of infected pigeons. It should be noted that MTZ and EO at the dose of 25 mg/kg even after 1 week of treatment did not cause full recovery. No mortality was recorded for treatment groups and no clinical side effects were observed in treated birds.
