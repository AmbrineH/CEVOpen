 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic> assay demonstrated effectiveness of MTZ and 
 <italic class="italic">P. roseum </italic>EO against 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic> in experimentally infected pigeons (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Seven days post-inoculation of 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic> (day 1), before initiation of treatments, number of trophozoites recovered from birds were measured and no significant difference was seen among different groups. On the second day of the experiment, treatment with MTZ and EO at the dose of 50 mg/kg resulted in significant reduction of trophozoites in comparison to control group (p&lt;0.05). MTZ at the dose of 50 mg/kg on the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> and 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day of the treatment resulted in significant reduction in the number of 
 <italic class="italic">T. gallinae</italic> in comparison to all other groups (p&lt;0.05). On the 5
 <sup class="sup">th </sup>day, no motile trophozoite was recovered from birds treated with MTZ 50 mg/kg treated. One day later (the 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day), treatment with EO 50 mg/kg led to full recovery of infected pigeons. It should be noted that MTZ and EO at the dose of 25 mg/kg even after 1 week of treatment did not cause full recovery. No mortality was recorded for treatment groups and no clinical side effects were observed in treated birds.
