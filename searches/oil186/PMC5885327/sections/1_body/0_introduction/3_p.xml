 <italic class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</italic>, which is considered the cause of avian trichomoniasis is a flagellate located in the upper digestive and occasionally in the respiratory tracts of a large variety of birds, mainly in the orders Columbiformes and Falconiformes (Boal et al., 1998

The lesions range from mild, often subclinical infections, to sever inflammation which can be acute and fatal, and lead to death by starvation due to the obstruction of the lumen of the esophagus (Gerhold et al., 2008

The drugs of choice for the treatment of trichomoniasis are nitroimidazoles. Subtherapeutic doses and preventive use of these drugs against trichomoniasis, have resulted in emergence of resistant strains of
