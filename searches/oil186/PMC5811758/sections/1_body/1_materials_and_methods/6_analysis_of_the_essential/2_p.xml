<p class="p">GC/MS analysis was done on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 /5972 system with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness). The operating conditions were the same conditions as described above but the carrier gas was He. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV. Scan mass range was from 40–400 m/z at a sampling rate of 1.0 scan/s. Quantitative data were obtained from the electronic integration of the FID peak areas. The components of the oil were known by their retention time, retention indices, relative to C
 <sub class="sub">9</sub>-C
 <sub class="sub">28</sub> n-alkanes, computer matching with the WILEY275.L library, as well as by comparison of their mass spectra with data already available in the literature (
