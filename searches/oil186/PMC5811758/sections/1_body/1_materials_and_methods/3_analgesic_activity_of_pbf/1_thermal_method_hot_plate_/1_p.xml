<p class="p">The hot-plate procedure was employed for the purpose of preferential assessment of the possible centrally mediated analgesic effect of PBFEO (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Animals were individually placed on a controlled hot-plate maintained at 55±0.2 °C. Briefly, the animals were placed on the hot-plate apparatus and latency to licking or shaking of the paws or jumping was recorded. PBFEO (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) was given to the separate group by intraperitoneal injection. Morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg) were also administered by the same route. The latency was recorded before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following intraperitoneal administration of the agents and is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect (MPE). MPE% = 100%
