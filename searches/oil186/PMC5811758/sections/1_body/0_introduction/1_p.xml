<p class="p">Plants belonging to the Apiaceae family are rich in secondary metabolites and embody numerous genera of high economic and medicinal value, yielding flavonoids, coumarins, acetylenes, terpenes, and essential oils (

 <italic class="italic">Pycnocycla</italic> is a genus belonging to the Apiaceae family, subfamily Apioideae, tribe Echinophoreae, and comprises approximately 20 species of herbaceous perennial, multicaulis, and spinous plants widely distributed in subtropical and tropical regions (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Pycnocycla</italic> is characterized by eight species in Iran, all of which are native or endemic (

 <italic class="italic">Pycnocycla bashagardiana</italic> Mozaff. is an endemic species found only in the south of Iran. It is commonly distributed in the Jask County, Hormozgan Province (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). Due to the widespread use of 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic> fruits in Iranian traditional medicine for relief and treatment of pain and inflammation-based disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, we were prompted to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the fruit’s essential oil and examine the pharmacological basis for the folkloric use of it as an antinociceptive and anti-inflammation agent. As the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic> contain a high amount of essential oils (1.6%, v/w) and possess a strong smell, we were prompted to evaluate the mentioned effects of its essential oil for the first time. The 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic> fruit’s essential oil (PBFEO) was also analyzed by Gas chromatography and GC-MS in order to detect the potentially responsible compounds for observed activities.
