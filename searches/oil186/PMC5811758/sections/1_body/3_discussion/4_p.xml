<p>The cotton-pellet granuloma is a widely used manner for the calculation of chronic anti-inflammatory substances (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The dry weight of the pellet correlates with the amount of granulomatous tissues, the moist weight of the pellets correlates with transuda. Chronic inflammation happens by means of the development of proliferating cells. These cells can be either spread or in granuloma form. PBFEO (100 mg/kg) indicated significant anti-inflammatory activity in cotton pellet induced granuloma and thus found to be effective in chronic inflammatory conditions, which shows its efficacy in inhibiting the increase in the number of fibroblasts and synthesis of collagen and mucopolysaccharides during granuloma tissue formation.
