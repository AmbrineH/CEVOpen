<p>Our results revealed that administration of PBFEO inhibited edema starting after half an hour and during all phases of inflammation, which is possibly inhibition of different aspects and chemical mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins. The inhibitory activity shown by PBFEO during a period of 4 hr in carrageenan-induced inflammation was in some way more efficient than that revealed by the group treated with mefenamic acid as standard drug.</p>
