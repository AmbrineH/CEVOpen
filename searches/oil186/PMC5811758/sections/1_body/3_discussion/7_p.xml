<p>The phytochemical results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effects of PBFEO may be due to its myristicin content. The major constituent of the oil was myristicin (76.1%). It was observed that myristicin comprised more than three-fourths of the oil composition. The anti-inflammatory activity of myristicin has been previously examined on RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in mice (

 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) demonstrated that myristicin could inhibit the production of several inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10. Since NO is believed to be a major pro-inflammatory mediator related to the bacterial and viral infections, obtained results suggest that the studied myristicin rich essential oil might have anti-inflammatory activity against the pathologic and excessive production of NO in virus-stimulated macrophages and monocytes (
