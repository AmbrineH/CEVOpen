<p>The acute anti-inflammatory effect of PBFEO in rat paw edema induced by carrageenan was established using the essential oil administered IP (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg), as well as mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg), significantly inhibited (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) the carrageenan paw edema formation, which was determined at the third hour of the experiment (peak of edema formation) by 41.91, 58.09, and 25.51%, respectively. At the fourth hour of the experiment, this edema inhibition reached 23.52%, 52.68%, and 62.92%.
