 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In hot-plate and formalin tests, the studied doses of PBFEO were not effective. However, in carrageenan test, all studied doses of PBFEO significantly reduced the paw edema in comparison to the control animals (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05). Anti-inflammatory activity of PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05) was found to be more than mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg). In cotton pellet-induced granuloma, PBFEO was also effective regarding the transudate and granuloma formation amount. PBFEO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 12 constituents, representing 96.0% of the oil, were identified. The major component of the oil was characterized as myristicin which might be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity.
