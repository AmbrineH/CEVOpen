  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hot-plate procedure was employed for the purpose of preferential assessment of the possible centrally mediated analgesic effect of PBFEO (
   <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>). Animals were individually placed on a controlled hot-plate maintained at 55±0.2 °C. Briefly, the animals were placed on the hot-plate apparatus and latency to licking or shaking of the paws or jumping was recorded. PBFEO (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) was given to the separate group by intraperitoneal injection. Morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg) were also administered by the same route. The latency was recorded before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following intraperitoneal administration of the agents and is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect (MPE). MPE% = 100%

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chemical method Formalin test in mice</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analgesic effects of PBFEO were investigated by formalin test. 30 min after separate injection of different doses of the essential oil (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg, positive control) and the vehicle, formalin (50 µl of 2.5%) was injected into the hind paw of the mice. Scoring of nociceptive behaviors began after formalin injection and was continued for 60 min. A nociceptive score was recorded for each five-minute time block by measuring the amount of time spent in each of the following behavioral types: 3, the injected paw was licked, bitten, or shaken; 2, the injected paw was elevated; 1, the injected paw had little or no weight placed on it; and 0, the injected paw was not favored. Pain rating ranging from zero to three, was calculated (
   <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>). Individual time course determinations in the formalin test were changed to area-under-the-curve values, zero to ten min after formalin injection (AUC phase ?) and 10–60 min after formalin injection (AUC phase ??) (
