 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oils as carriers firstly meant for hydrophobic drugs to sink, long, medium and short chain triglycerides (LCT, MCT, and SCT) were predominantly used in the preparation of ME/NEs with the rank order of MCTs&gt;LCTs&gt;SCTs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Type of oil used in the formulation has a great impact on solubilization, digestion of carrier lipid and drug release with desired characteristics. Principally, LCTs and MCTs are converted into free fatty acids by water dispersion during digestion. Free fatty acids of MCTs are able to migrate rapidly into surrounding medium whereas those produced by LCTs accumulate at the oil-water interface thereby lipase activity is inhibited [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] Semisynthetic MCT’s are superior over natural MCTs as it was proven in Naringenin nanoemulsions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Combination of LCT’s and MCTs was also promised with superior emulsifying and dissolution profiles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The success of MEs/NEs is affected by molecular and lipid characters of MCT and LCTs such as loading of drug and droplet size, chemical nature, and stability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. As absorption of ME/NEs is governed by Ostwald ripening principle, significant portal absorption of crodomol GTCC, an MCT and lymphatic absorption of corn and canola oils (LCT) were resulted [
