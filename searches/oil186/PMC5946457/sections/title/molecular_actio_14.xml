 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particulate emulsified delivery systems are being gradually more used to protect bioactives against the intense environment, to improve molecular targets, stability and to increase bioavailability. Molecular action of selected lipophilic drugs when associated with oil core or amphiphiles of the ME/NE systems is ascribed to transfer the drug molecules into the targeted cells by fusion of oil droplet with the cell membranes through lipid exchange or by endocytosis of the oil droplets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. If the targeting moieties (folate, thiamine, etc.) with corresponding cell surface receptors are anchored to ME/NEs to adapt multifunctional property, they can directly target a tissue of interest and remain longer at the disease site to allow the total transfer of the drug molecules. Different molecules owned by anti-inflammatory agents, insulin, cancer etc., were rationalized herein.

 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential PUFA transporters of an abluminal membrane of the endothelial cells of BBB allowed the CNS acting essential PUFA (omega-3 and omega-6), a lipophilic moiety into the brain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>]. Nonionic surfactants (tween 80 and poloxamer) augmented brain targeting essential PUFA through lipoprotein receptor-mediated uptake owing to the affinity of apolipoprotein E for LDL receptor in the BBB enabled uptake by RME (receptor-mediated endocytosis). In another instance, enhanced brain uptake of doxorubicin resulted with drug- loaded MEs with principal interaction of ME entities with plasma apolipoprotein A–I facilitated scavenger receptor in BBB endothelium [

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Curcumin encapsulated by a combination of cationic surfactants such as cetyl and dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide was found to be intact even against alkaline hydrolysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>] and bioaccessible with use of triacylglycerols (medium chain) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>]. Polymeric micelles of curcumin were bestowed with over 55-fold increase in bioavailability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>]. In similar lines, tamoxifen loaded NEs (size &lt; 47 nm) inhibited cell proliferation 20-fold greater and increased cell apoptosis 4-fold greater in the HTB-20 breast cancer cell line [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>].

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oral administration of ME of cyclosporine A resulted in increased bioavailability with not many side effects in hepatic impaired patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>] and stable plasma drug concentrations were maintained in renal impaired patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. Oral application of carvedilol loaded NEs has displayed two-fold faster release profile and several folds increase in C
  <sub>max</sub> and AUC [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>]. Thus the particulate emulsified systems are proven to be superior in the treatment of certain ailments though they were orally administered.
