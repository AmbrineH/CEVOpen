<p id="Par38">As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a fraction of particulate drug, encapsulated by triglycerides is restructured in the endoplasmic reticulum and then released into the mesenteric lymph duct as chylomicrons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Thereafter it reaches the systemic circulation via thoracic lymph [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Lymphatic uptake becomes ever effective since the drug molecules are bypassed. But, the chain length of triglycerides and solubility of the drug in oil determines the outcome of lymphatic uptake of orally administered lipophilic moieties.
