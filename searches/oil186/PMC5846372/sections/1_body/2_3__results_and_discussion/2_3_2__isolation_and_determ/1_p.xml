<p>Six compounds were isolated from the essential oil of sample 
 <italic>Κ</italic>N2 by applying a series of liquid-liquid extractions based on acid-base chemical reactions, as well as with preparative TLC: eugenol, cinnamic aldehyde, and myristicin were determined by NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis, while cinnamyl alcohol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene were determined only by GC-MS analysis.
