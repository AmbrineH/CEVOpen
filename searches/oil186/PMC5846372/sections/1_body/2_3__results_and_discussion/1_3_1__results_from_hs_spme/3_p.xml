<p>It is remarkable that, according to the analyses of the volatiles in KN3, they were not identified as the main components of ginger
 <italic> (Zingiber officinale)</italic> and consequently we assume that ginger is not included in the mixture or it is included in small quantities. As for the presence of cardamom and pepper, due to the lack of some of their main metabolites (some of them exist in other contained plants at the same time), we conclude that if they are present they will be in small quantities.
