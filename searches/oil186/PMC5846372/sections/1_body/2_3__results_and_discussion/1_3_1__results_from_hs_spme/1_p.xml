<p>All three samples of “Kainari” from Mytilini, Paleochori, and Agiassos in Lesvos were studied for the first time to our knowledge. The rich aroma of the mixture was studied through Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME)/GC-MS analyses. Furthermore, the pentane and methanol extracts were also studied through GC-MS with respective results. The major constituents that have been determined through GC-MS analyses were cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol, myristicin,
