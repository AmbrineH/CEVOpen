<p class="p">The free radical scavenging activities of herbal teas and methanol extracts were determined by DPPH and ABTS assays (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). All extracts showed significant antioxidant activity performing 30–64% inhibition at DPPH assay (50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL), as well as 26–48% inhibition at ABTS assay (10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL). The herbal tea KN3 performed the higher inhibition at DPPH (64.7%) and at ABTS (46.9%) which is in accordance with the high TPC. Also, the methanol extracts of KN1 and KN3 showed high inhibition.
