<p>According to in vitro antimicrobial tests (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>) against two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic> S. epidermidis</italic>) and four Gram-negative ones (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>,
 <italic> E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, </italic>and
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic>), as well as against oral pathogens
 <italic> (S. mutans and S. viridans)</italic> and three human pathogenic fungi (
 <italic>Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, </italic>and
 <italic> C. glabrata</italic>), the herbal teas exhibited a broad spectrum of strong antimicrobial activity, while KN3 herbal tea appeared to be the most active against all tested microorganisms, which can be explained by the high percentage of cinnamic aldehyde and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene that appears in herbal tea of KN3 as shown in
