 <italic>(i) Total Phenolic Content (TPC)</italic>. It was determined by using Folin-Ciocalteu method with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As referred to literature, 10 mg of each crude methanol extract or lyophilized herbal tea was dissolved in 1 mL of corresponding extracting solvent to produce the stock of sample solution. The lower concentrations of sample were prepared by diluting 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the stock sample solution with 900 
 <italic>μ</italic>L methanol or distilled water. Then, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sample was put in a test tube and mixed with 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, followed by an addition of 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 35% sodium carbonate after 3 minutes. Then, the resulting mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for an hour and absorbance was measured at 725 nm (UV-1700, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) after incubation. Caffeic acid was used as calibrated standard and results were expressed as milligram Caffeic Acid Equivalent per gram of dry extract (mg CAE/g dry extract). The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.
