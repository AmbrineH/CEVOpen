The reagents were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Total phenolic content was expressed as mg Gallic Acid Equivalents per gram of dry extract (mg GAE/g dry extract). The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.
