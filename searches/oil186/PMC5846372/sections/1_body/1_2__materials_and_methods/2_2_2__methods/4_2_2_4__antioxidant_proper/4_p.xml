 <italic>(iii) 2,2-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic Acid) (ABTS) Assay. </italic>The ABTS radical cation scavenging assay was performed using the method reported by Re et al. (1999) with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In brief, a stock ABTS aqua solution (7 mM) was reacted with potassium persulfate aqua solution (2.45 mM) and kept overnight in dark to yield a dark colored solution containing ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radical cation. Trolox was used as a positive control (IC50: 8.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations. Prior to use in the assay, the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radical cation was diluted with distilled water for an initial absorbance of about 0.700 (±0.02) at 734 nm. Afterwards, in a 96-well plate 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> radical cation solution and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Trolox or samples were added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. A negative control containing 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMSO and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L ABTS was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sample and 100
