 <italic class="italic">(ii) 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) Assay. </italic>The DPPH radical scavenging assay was performed according to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The stock DPPH solution (314 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>M) was prepared in absolute ethanol and kept in dark at room temperature until its use. Gallic acid was used as a positive control (IC50: 4.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations. Briefly, in a 96-well plate, 190 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the DPPH solution and 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of gallic acid or samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A negative control containing 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L DMSO and 190 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L DPPH was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L sample and 190 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L EtOH.
