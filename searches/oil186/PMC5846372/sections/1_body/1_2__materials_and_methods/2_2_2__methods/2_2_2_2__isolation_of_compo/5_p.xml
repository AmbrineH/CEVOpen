 <italic>(ii) Isolation of Azo Dyes. </italic>The freeze-dried herbal teas of KN1 and KN2 (454 mg), which presented the same chromatographic profile, and the freeze-dried herbal tea of KN3 (450 mg) were separately further purified using a medium pressure liquid chromatography MPLC (Borosilikat 3.3 Code Number 28147, Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland) packed with reversed phase silica gel (RP18) and two Series 1 pumps with flow speed 8 mL/min, eluted with decreasing polarities: H
 <sub>2</sub>O/MeOH (100/0 to 0/100). Azorubine was isolated and identified from the water fraction of KN1-KN2 and amaranth from KN3. The isolated compounds were identified by NMR and literature data [
