 <italic>(ii) GC-MS Analysis. </italic>The analyses were performed on a HP 6890 GC with 5973 MSD (Hewlett-Packard, Germany), with ionization energy 70 eV. The GC is equipped with a 1/10 split/splitless injector and a 30 m long DP5 capillary column, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 mm thickness. The temperature in the injection sample was 200°C and gas was He and flow rate is 0.7 mL/min. Identification was made using the Wiley275 library and bibliographic data. The temperature programs that have been used are the following:
