 <italic>(i) Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME)</italic>. The rich aroma of the Kainari samples was studied through HS-SPME/GC-MS analyses [

 <italic>μ</italic>m coating 57330-U, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) attached in a manual SPME fiber holder (Supelco). For SPME extraction, 10 mg of each sample in a glass vial (15 mL) closed with PTFE coated silicone rubber septum was used. The temperature in our experiment was set at 70–75°C and the vial with sample was placed on the hot-plate for 15 minutes. After that time, the fiber was exposed for 5 minutes and then it was transferred to perform GC-MS analysis.
