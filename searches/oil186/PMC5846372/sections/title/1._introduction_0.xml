 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For over thousand years, herbs and plants have played a major role in traditional and herbal based medicines. Herbal infusions and plants are the major source of phenolic compounds in our diet. It is known that phenolic compounds have many biological activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Due to the increasing popularity of a whole market for herbal dietary supplements and traditional medicines, we present in this study the chemical analysis and potential bioactivities of a unique herbal tea combination named “Kainari.”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kainari is a combination (mixture) of several spices, in powder form, which is used as herbal tea, usually with an intense red color, traditionally prepared in the Greek island of Lesvos and used in folk medicine as a warming beverage in winter. Historically, it was brought to the island from Greek emigrants from Asia Minor in early 19th century. In Turkey, a similar herbal tea called “kaynar” (means in Turkish boiled) or Lohusa Serbeti (convalescence serbet) is used traditionally in childbirth to give energy to the new mothers and to boost their lactation [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tradition of making “Lohusa Serbeti” after a birth probably is derived from Byzantine birth tradition (custom) where what was called “lochozema,” a nourishing broth, was given to new mothers [

  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. It is mentioned in ceremonial books that after the birth of an imperial child “Porphyrogenitus” and in one-week-long period of celebration, the preparation of “lochozema,” a nutritious “childbed soup like” broth, was offered in Constantinople's main streets. Then, as birth custom, it was given to all new mothers, to aid milk production and recovery [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exact history of “Lohusa Serbeti” is not known but the drink was certainly popular during the latter part of the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922), when the drink was given to new mothers, people that visited the new mother and with jugs of the drink also sent to the mother's friends, family, and cleric as a way of announcing the birth of her child. After drinking “Lohusa Serbeti” everybody present had to say a prayer asking God to bless the new mother with a plentiful supply of breast milk [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also important the red color of the drink as it is a symbol in Turkey for good luck and joy [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>], but also has a symbolic imperial importance [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Moreover, red color is considered apotropaic, by which is meant that red color is thought to ward off evil so by giving a red drink to a new lactating mother, protect both the mother and her baby [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To prepare “Lohusa Serbeti,” water, cinnamon sticks and cloves, and “lohusa” sugar (pink-red in color, natural red color, or red food dye) are boiled together, to be served hot in winter or cold during summer [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Kainari,” as already referred to, arrived to Lesvos Island after 1922 and it is used as a pleasant, aromatic, tonic, warming beverage. The composition of the mixture differentiates from “Lohusa Serbeti” and in our days, Kainari infusion is prepared by adding hot water to half spoon of Kainari mixture, which is produced by mixing powders of several spices, while the exact composition of mixture is kept secret. Some of the ingredients that are usually part of the herbal tea combination are mainly cinnamon and clove and in smaller quantities other spices such as ginger, nutmeg, galangal, and pepper.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objective of this research was to study, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the composition of three different Kainari samples from three villages of Lesvos Island (Greece), as well as to evaluate the total phenolic content (TPC) and the potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Six volatile compounds and two azo food dyes have been isolated and identified. The total phenolic content was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu method and the free radical scavenging activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS assays. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the samples was tested against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, two oral pathogens, and three pathogenic fungi.</p>
