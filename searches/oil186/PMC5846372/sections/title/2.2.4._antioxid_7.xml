  <span class="italic">(i) Total Phenolic Content (TPC)</span>. It was determined by using Folin-Ciocalteu method with slight modifications [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. As referred to literature, 10 mg of each crude methanol extract or lyophilized herbal tea was dissolved in 1 mL of corresponding extracting solvent to produce the stock of sample solution. The lower concentrations of sample were prepared by diluting 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of the stock sample solution with 900 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L methanol or distilled water. Then, 50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of sample was put in a test tube and mixed with 60 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, followed by an addition of 120 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of 35% sodium carbonate after 3 minutes. Then, the resulting mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for an hour and absorbance was measured at 725 nm (UV-1700, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) after incubation. Caffeic acid was used as calibrated standard and results were expressed as milligram Caffeic Acid Equivalent per gram of dry extract (mg CAE/g dry extract). The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alongside, 25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of extracts or standard solution of gallic acid (2.5 to 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) in DMSO was added to 125 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of a Folin-Ciocalteu solution (10% v/v), followed by 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of sodium carbonate (7.5% w/v) in a 96-well plate. The reagents were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Total phenolic content was expressed as mg Gallic Acid Equivalents per gram of dry extract (mg GAE/g dry extract). The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.

  <span class="italic">(ii) 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) Assay. </span>The DPPH radical scavenging assay was performed according to a previously described method [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The stock DPPH solution (314 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>M) was prepared in absolute ethanol and kept in dark at room temperature until its use. Gallic acid was used as a positive control (IC50: 4.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations. Briefly, in a 96-well plate, 190 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of the DPPH solution and 10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of gallic acid or samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A negative control containing 10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L DMSO and 190 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L DPPH was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L sample and 190 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L EtOH.

  <span class="italic">(iii) 2,2-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic Acid) (ABTS) Assay. </span>The ABTS radical cation scavenging assay was performed using the method reported by Re et al. (1999) with slight modifications [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. In brief, a stock ABTS aqua solution (7 mM) was reacted with potassium persulfate aqua solution (2.45 mM) and kept overnight in dark to yield a dark colored solution containing ABTS
  <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation. Trolox was used as a positive control (IC50: 8.3 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations. Prior to use in the assay, the ABTS
  <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation was diluted with distilled water for an initial absorbance of about 0.700 (±0.02) at 734 nm. Afterwards, in a 96-well plate 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l of ABTS
  <span class="sup">•+</span> radical cation solution and 50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l of Trolox or samples were added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. A negative control containing 50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L DMSO and 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L ABTS was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 50 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L sample and 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L dist. H
