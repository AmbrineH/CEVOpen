  <span class="italic">(i) Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME)</span>. The rich aroma of the Kainari samples was studied through HS-SPME/GC-MS analyses [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. The HS-SPME was performed with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane coated fiber (75 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m coating 57330-U, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) attached in a manual SPME fiber holder (Supelco). For SPME extraction, 10 mg of each sample in a glass vial (15 mL) closed with PTFE coated silicone rubber septum was used. The temperature in our experiment was set at 70–75°C and the vial with sample was placed on the hot-plate for 15 minutes. After that time, the fiber was exposed for 5 minutes and then it was transferred to perform GC-MS analysis.

  <span class="italic">(ii) GC-MS Analysis. </span>The analyses were performed on a HP 6890 GC with 5973 MSD (Hewlett-Packard, Germany), with ionization energy 70 eV. The GC is equipped with a 1/10 split/splitless injector and a 30 m long DP5 capillary column, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 mm thickness. The temperature in the injection sample was 200°C and gas was He and flow rate is 0.7 mL/min. Identification was made using the Wiley275 library and bibliographic data. The temperature programs that have been used are the following:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Temperature Program I. </span>The initial temperature is 100°C and then rises at a rate of 4°C/min, up to a maximum temperature of 300°C. Total analysis time was 52 min. This program was used to analyze methanol and pentane extracts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Temperature Program II. </span>The initial column temperature is 50°C which is maintained for 3 minutes and then increased at a rate of 30°C/min to 150°C. From 150°C, it rises at a rate of 3°C/min up to 250°C, where it remains for 10 min. It was used for the HS-SPME analyses [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Temperature Program III. </span>The initial column temperature is 60°C and then increases at a rate of 3°C/min to a maximum temperature of 280°C. Total analysis time was 93 min. It was used for the analysis of the essential oil B.

  <span class="italic">(iii) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). </span>
  <span class="sup">1</span>H-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX 400 instrument (400 MHz) using CD
  <sub>3</sub>OD, CDCl
  <sub>3</sub>, and DMSO-d6 as solvents and TMS as an internal standard.
