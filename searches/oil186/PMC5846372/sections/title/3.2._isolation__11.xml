 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six compounds were isolated from the essential oil of sample 
  <span class="italic">Κ</span>N2 by applying a series of liquid-liquid extractions based on acid-base chemical reactions, as well as with preparative TLC: eugenol, cinnamic aldehyde, and myristicin were determined by NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis, while cinnamyl alcohol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene were determined only by GC-MS analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, two food dyes were isolated and identified as parts of the family of azo colors. Samples KN1 and KN2 contained the same food color azorubine [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>], while sample KN3 contained amaranth [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The azo colors are compounds bearing the functional group R-N = N-R′, where R and R′ may be either aryl or alkyl. Azo dyes are one of the most important chemical categories of dyes which are used for the coloring of natural and synthetic fibers, candies, and cosmetics but also food and beverages [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>, 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Many azo dyes are nontoxic, although some of them have been accused for allergic reactions and increasing hyperactivity in children [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two isolated compounds are being referred to EFSA as amaranth (E123) and azorubine or carmoisine (Ε122) and are well-known food dyes [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>].
