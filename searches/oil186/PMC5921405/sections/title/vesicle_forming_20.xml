 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the presence of Span/Tween (S/T) 20 and S/T 80 surfactants, the yielded vesicles were low along with formation of many separated crystals. By contrast, multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were obtained from the S/T 40 and S/T 60 surfactants in the presence of Chol and 0.5% MEO.</p>
