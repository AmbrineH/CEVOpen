 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The zeta potential values of nMEO formulations are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>. We have found that empty niosome of S/T 40 and S/T 60 in the presence of Chol has zeta potential values of 2.96 ± 0.05 to 4.13 ± 0.03 mV. In the present study, relatively high and negative zeta potential values were achieved, in spite of not incorporating any amphiphile molecules in the nisomes and is likely to be related to the multi-component nature of MEO.
