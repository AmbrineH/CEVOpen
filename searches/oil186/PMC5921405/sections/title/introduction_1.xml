 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years, aromatic plants, such as myrtle, have been widely used for their medicinal properties (
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>). Different parts of myrtle such as leaves, berries, branches, and fruits have been widely applied in the traditional medicine (
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>). Moreover, not only have myrtle leaves been utilized for treatment of diarrhea, stomachache, hyperglycemia, cough, and pulmonary disorders but they have also been externally used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and for mouth ulcer, burn, and wound healing (
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>). Such therapeutic potentials may be related to myrtle's major secondary metabolites including polyphenols and essential oils (EOs) (
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EOs are natural multi-component systems composed mainly of both terpenes and some other non-terpene components (
  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>). Low chemical and physical stability of the EOs as well as their lipophilic nature have been considered as the important obstacle to the preparation and storage of the EOs formulations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of physical properties, EOs are volatile compounds which can easily evaporate and/or decompose even at room temperature due to very low boiling point and direct exposure to light or oxygen, respectively (
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>). Furthermore, conventional formulations of EOs can oftentimes cause skin irritation and sensitization. Several approaches including the application of vesicular systems such as niosomes (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">7</a>) have been developed to resolve these problems. Niosomes are non-ionic surfactants and have been used in drug (
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>) or gene delivery (
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>). In drug delivery, niosomes are capable of increasing skin penetration and acting as a local depot to provide sustained release of topically applied drugs in the dermis. Due to properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, low cost, and superior chemical and storage stabilities, niosomes offer several advantages over other vesicular systems (
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>). EOsâ€™ entrapment in the hydrophobic region of niosomes can improve their permeability and stability features, consequently reducing skin irritation properties of EOs (
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a>). Niosomal formulations can improve the stratum corneum functions by attenuating water loss from trans-epidermal skin and increasing skin smoothness by replacing its lost lipids. Furthermore, the residence time of drug in the stratum corneum and epidermis increases and its systemic absorption decreases following application of niosomal systems (
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>). It was previously shown by Manosroi, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. that niosomal encapsulation of 
  <span class="italic">Mimusops elengi</span> flower extract reduced extract cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblast and also enhanced its physical stability (
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current study, at first myrtle essential oil (MEO) was extracted and analyzed and then the niosomal myrtle essential oil (nMEO) were prepared and characterized in for their size, zeta potential, percentage of entrapment efficiency (EE%), and stability. Finally, functionality of nMEO for microbial growth inhibition was measured against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span>. These bacterial species are responsible for wound contamination, wound colonization, and clinical infections. Also they may cause opportunistic skin infections in immune-suppressed patients. Gram-positive coccid such as 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus, S. epidermidis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">M. luteus</span> may origin from wound infections, impetigo, furuncles, abscesses, and carbuncles. The Gram-negative bacilli including 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. marcescens</span> are part of normal intestinal flora. However, in some situation they may cause infection in complicating burn injuries and also surgical site (
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>). In this study, we hypothesized that nMEO is more efficient than MEO in drug releasing behavior.
