<p class="p">Encapsulation of MEO in niosomal formulation consisting of nonionic surfactants and Chol could be a promising strategy to improve the efficacy and stability of MEO. MLVs were obtained from S/T 40 and S/T 60 surfactants in the presence of Chol and 0.5% MEO. Moreover, higher EE% and stability was achieved by F6 formulation. The release profile followed first order kinetics. The results of the present study proved that, in comparison to MEO, encapsulation of MEO in F6 formulation enhanced antibacterial activity against some bacterial spices.</p>
