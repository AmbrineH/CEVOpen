 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL bacteria was used to uniformly lawn Muller-Hinton agar plates. The two-fold MEO dilutions ranging from 4000 to 250 μg/100 μL were prepared by dissolving them in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80. Muller-Hinton-broth with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80 was used for preparing nMEO two-fold dilutions ranging from 2000 to 250 μg/100 μL. Empty sterilized discs (6.4 mm) were impregnated with 100 μL of different concentrations and placed on the agar surface. Paper disc moistened with 10% DMSO or empty niosome were used as a vehicle control and blank, respectively. Also antibiotic discs including ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were used as positive controls. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the zone of inhibition was measured.
