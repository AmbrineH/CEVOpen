<p>The stability results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. Niosome size was not changed significantly during 3 months at 4 °C, a finding that confirmed physical stability of niosomal formulation in the above-mentioned condition as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. Nonetheless, size of vesicles significantly was increased during storage time at 40 °C with RH of 70% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the results also showed that increasing the Chol content from 30 to 50 molar ratios enhances stability at 4 °C during 3 months. Furthermore, it has been revealed that smaller vesicles are thermodynamically unstable (
