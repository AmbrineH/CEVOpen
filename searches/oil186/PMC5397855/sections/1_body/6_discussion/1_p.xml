<p class="p">Insecticidal activity of the garlic essential oil and its compounds against the mealworm beetle, 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> were determined from the bioassays in the laboratory conditions. Garlic essential oil caused substantial mortality and repellency in larva, pupa, and adult stages. The best results were obtained with concentrations of 16 and 32% in 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> as reported for other stored grain pests according to the concentration of these products
