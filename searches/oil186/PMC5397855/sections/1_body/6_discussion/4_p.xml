<p class="p">Diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide demonstrated toxic activity on different developmental stages of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic>. Diallyl disulfide have stronger contact toxicity in larvae (LC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref> at different developmental stages as well as other insects
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Our results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> was more susceptible in the pupal stage followed by larvae and adults exposed to diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide. One possible explanation for the developmental stages difference is that efficacy may be affected by the penetration of the garlic compounds into the body and the ability of the insect to metabolize these compounds.
