 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide identified as toxic compounds in garlic essential oil, were obtained commercially. Diallyl sulfide (purity 97.0%) and diallyl disulfide (purity 70%) were purchased from Across Organics (New Jersey, USA). Six different concentrations of the commercial compounds besides the control (acetone) were adjusted in 1 mL of stock solution (treatment and acetone) used to calculate the lethal LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> concentrations: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. For each treatment, aliquots were taken from the stock solution and mixed with acetone in 5 mL glass vials. Different concentrations of the each treatment were applied in 1 uL solution on the body of larva, pupa and adult of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>. Individuals were placed in Petri dishes with wheat bran and sugarcane. A total of 50 larvae, 50 pupae, and 50 adults were used for each concentration and mortality was evaluated for 48 h after application to compared with toxicity garlic essential oil, followed by rate corrections according to the Abbott’ formule
