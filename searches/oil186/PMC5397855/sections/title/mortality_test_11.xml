 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Garlic essential oil efficacy was determined by calculating the lethal concentrations (LC
  <sub>50</sub>, and LC
  <sub>90</sub>) values under laboratory conditions and conducted in triplicate. Six concentrations of garlic essential oil besides the control (acetone) were adjusted in 1 mL of stock solution (essential oil and acetone): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32% (w/v). Aliquots were taken from the stock solution and mixed with acetone in 5 mL glass vials. Different concentrations of the garlic essential oil were applied in 1 uL solution on the thorax of larva, pupa and adult of
