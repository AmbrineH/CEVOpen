Respiration rate were subjected to two-way analyses of variance (time × insecticide treatment) and Tukey’s HSD test (P &lt; 0.05) when appropriate (PROC GLM). As the time interval was assessed in different insect samples, they are not pseudoreplicates in time and therefore subject to regular two-way analyses of variance instead of repeated measures analyses of variance using SAS User software.
