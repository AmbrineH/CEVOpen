 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insecticidal activity of the garlic essential oil and its compounds against the mealworm beetle, 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> were determined from the bioassays in the laboratory conditions. Garlic essential oil caused substantial mortality and repellency in larva, pupa, and adult stages. The best results were obtained with concentrations of 16 and 32% in 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> as reported for other stored grain pests according to the concentration of these products
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">11</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. The susceptibility of stored pest products such as 
  <span class="italic">S. oryzae, S. zeamais, Sitotroga cerealella</span> Oliver (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span> may vary with the exposure at garlic essential oil applied to the body of these insects or by fumigation
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different concentrations of the garlic essential oil showed toxic effects on larva, pupa and adult of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> 48 h after topical application. The dose-response bioassay confirmed toxicity against 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>, reaching a 90% mortality rate. Increasing concentrations of garlic essential oil in this insect have shown immediate toxic responses within 12 h of application
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Comparing the contact toxicity of garlic essential oil on developmental stages of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>, the larva was significantly more susceptible followed by pupa and adult. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> of larva (0.77–1.36%), pupa (2.37–4.01%), and adult (2.03–4.73%) indicate that small quantities of the garlic essential oil are toxic in this insect, being more tolerant with age.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the garlic essential oil revealed 14 compounds detected, 10 identified and quantified in terms of relative percentages. In particular, diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl tetrasulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin were the main compounds that were detected in garlic essential oil. The result is in accordance with those of previous reports
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>. The above compounds are produced as a result of the degradation of allicin under the harsh thermal treatment in the hydrodistillation procedure. Allicin is not a stable compound and readily degrades 
  <span class="italic">via</span> several pathways to form the secondary products of various sulfides contributing the characteristic flavour and odour of garlic
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. Various studies indicated that the rapid decomposition of allicin in garlic aqueous extract involved transformation mainly to diallyl sulfides
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>. In this study, the main compounds of garlic essential oil are sulfur compounds (thiosulfinates) such as diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide. However, there are considerable variations in the chemical composition of garlic essential oil where 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin is a main compound. In general, the diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide are the most abundant constituents of fresh garlic oil and commercially can be variations in the relative proportions of these compounds
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide demonstrated toxic activity on different developmental stages of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>. Diallyl disulfide have stronger contact toxicity in larvae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 57.68 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), pupae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 55.13 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and adult (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 81.52 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), than diallyl sulfide in larvae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 117.1 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), pupae (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 48.86 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and adult (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 85.97 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Garlic essential oil and its constituents, diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide have been highly toxic to 
  <span class="italic">S. zeamais</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a> at different developmental stages as well as other insects
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Our results showed that 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> was more susceptible in the pupal stage followed by larvae and adults exposed to diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide. One possible explanation for the developmental stages difference is that efficacy may be affected by the penetration of the garlic compounds into the body and the ability of the insect to metabolize these compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The insects exposed to the garlic essential oil and toxic compounds displayed altered locomotion activity, and muscle contractions that were observed in detailed descriptions at high concentrations in LC
  <sub>50</sub> and LC
  <sub>90</sub> test. In some individuals, the paralysis was constant with concentrations near the LC
  <sub>50</sub> without recovery signs. Paralysis and muscle contractions in individuals of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> at LC
  <sub>50</sub> can be explained by the toxic effect in the nervous system of the same. The rapid toxicity of essential oils and their constituents in insects indicates neurotoxic action as reported to 
  <span class="italic">Delia radicum</span> Linnaeus, 
  <span class="italic">Musca domestica</span> Linnaeus (Diptera: Muscidae), 
  <span class="italic">Cacopsylla chinensis</span> (Yang et Li), and 
  <span class="italic">Diaphorina citri</span> Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) with hyperactivity, hyperextension of the legs and abdomen and rapid knock-down effect or immobilization
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that has been shown to be inhibited by garlic compounds and can act only or in synergism as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and allicin
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>. The presence of the diallyl sulfide in garlic compounds may be responsible for the toxic effect in 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> and may cause inhibition by cross-linking with essential thiol compounds in enzyme structures, altering the functional shape of the protein and denaturalization
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxic compounds of garlic essential oil induced mortality in larva, pupa and adult of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> within a short period of time. The LT
  <sub>50</sub> of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> larva applied with LC
  <sub>90</sub> diallyl disulfide and diallyl sulfide was approximately 20 and 36 h, pupae was 21 and 33 h, and adults was 27 and 40 h, respectively. Toxic compounds affect multiple regions of the insect body over a period of time, ranging from one to 20–40 h for death. In this period, the necrotic areas were increasing progressively on the insect body. The comparative effects on 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> between garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were observed at various time points. An essential oil of quick action should be preferred for protection of products stored to be able to prevent feeding and avoid or reduce damage by insect pests
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">11</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The repellency test indicated that garlic essential oil and diallyl disulfide has a greater effect on 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> behavior than diallyl sulfide had little effect. Odor produced from volatile compounds was repulsive to larvae and adults of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> and was observed during early hours to finished bioassay. Monosulfides, disulfides, and trisulfide breakdown products of the thiosulfinates are volatile compounds and toxic to insect herbivores
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a>. These compounds are garlic majority compounds and toxic to pests of stored products such as 
  <span class="italic">S. zeamais</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Garlic essential oil has high percentage of diallyl disulfide as main volatile compound and repellent properties to 
  <span class="italic">S. zeamais</span> and 
  <span class="italic">T. castaneum</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. Our results suggest that garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide have high activities of behavioral deterrence against 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>, as evaluated by the behavioral responses of larvae and adults to different odor sources and the number of insects repelled, indicating their potential to the pest control in stored products.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The garlic essential oil and their toxic constituents compromised the respiration rate of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> up to 3 h after exposure, likely reflecting in behavior response and subsequently, the locomotors activity. Respiratory rate and body mass of insects can represent the sum of the energy demands of the physiological processes of insects that are necessary to produce defense mechanisms against the essential oils and toxic compounds
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>. Thus, low respiration rate is an indicator of physiological stress, and essential oils can compromise insect respiration by impairing muscle activity, leading to paralysis
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>. Several studies of plant volatile and their constituents were shown to effectively disrupt the recognition process of the host substrate and influence the walking behavior on insects
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>. The absorption of a fumigant by an insect is positively correlated with its respiration rate
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>. In this study, adults of 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> have low respiration rate caused by garlic essential oil and their constituents, resulting in physiological costs due to energy reallocation from other basic physiological processes. This favors the use of these toxic compounds by fumigant action and can cause significant negative effects on 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed the potential of garlic essential oil and main compounds to control the 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> in starches and stored products. In order to prevent or retard the development of insecticide resistance, the toxicity and repellency effects of garlic essential oil and toxic compounds on 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> show that can be used individually or mixture to management populations. The lethalities of diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide on 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> may have advantages by their mode of action on this insect. These findings show that the compounds of garlic essential oil are a potential source of insecticidal compounds and warrants further exploration.
