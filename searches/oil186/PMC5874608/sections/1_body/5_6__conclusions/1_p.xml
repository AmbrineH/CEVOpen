<p>This review summarizes the current status, distribution, chemical value and biological studies on genus 
 <italic>Conradina</italic>. There is still some debate about the exact number of 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> species as well as the classification/taxonomy of this genus and more studies, especially genetic studies, are still needed. The available information increases the importance of protecting 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> from extinction. Future studies on this genus may provide valuable information on the mechanism of evolution.
