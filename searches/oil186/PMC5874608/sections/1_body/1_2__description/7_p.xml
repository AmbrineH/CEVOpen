 <italic class="italic">C. verticillata</italic> Jennison (Cumberland rosemary) is the only species of this genus that is not found in Florida. The species was established in 1933 [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. It is a rare species, existing only as three small subpopulations in Tennessee and one subpopulation in Kentucky [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">C. verticillata</italic> is found only in boulder bars, cobble bars, sand bars and gravel bars in close proximity to rivers on the Cumberland Plateau of north-central Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The preferred habitat conditions include open to slightly-shaded area, moderately deep well-drained sandy soil, periodic flooding, and topographic features like narrow channels or depressions on gravel bars. 
 <italic class="italic">C. verticillata</italic> is the only species that is triploid (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3) and accordingly has a lower ability to reproduce and disperse sexually and greatly reduced seed germination rates. The fresh seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">C. verticillata</italic> are physiologically dormant and require cold stratification to germinate [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It has been on the federal list of threatened species since 1991 [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The major threats facing 
 <italic class="italic">C. verticillata</italic> are habitat destruction, general deterioration of water quality, competition and shading by woody plants.
