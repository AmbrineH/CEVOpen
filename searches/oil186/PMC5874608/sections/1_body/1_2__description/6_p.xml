 <italic>C. glabra</italic> Shinners (Apalachicola rosemary) was described in a sand hill community east of the Apalachicola River in Liberty County, Florida in 1962 [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This species is very narrowly distributed and restricted to Liberty County, Florida. Out of its seven known locations, six 
 <italic>C. glabra</italic> subpopulations (artificially divided by the Florida gas transmission pipeline) are remaining, all of which are located on private silvicultural lands and subject to much disturbance. Its other historical locations were converted to pine plantations, and can no longer support this species. Because of homozygosity and inbreeding, many of flowers of 
 <italic>C. glabra</italic> are male sterile, and the stamens are very malformed [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was added to the federal list of endangered species in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], primarily due to habitat loss and modification of forestry practices. There is no record of how abundant 
 <italic>C. glabra</italic> was before its habitat was altered because the silviculture operations began before its discovery.
