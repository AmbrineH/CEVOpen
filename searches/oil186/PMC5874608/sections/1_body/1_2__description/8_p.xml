<p>In 2009, analysis of patterns of genetic structure based on microsatellites in 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> led to the identification of 
 <italic>C. cygniflora</italic> Edwards, Judd, Ionta &amp; Herring [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. cygniflora</italic> can only be found in Dunns Creek state park in south-central Putnam County, Florida. It occupies nine tightly-clustered sites that probably form around two to four self-sustaining subpopulations. 
 <italic>C. cygniflora</italic> carries several unique morphological characters that distinguish this species from all other described 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> species including thin-walled unicellular hairs, epidermis features, and larger calyces. Due to its exceptionally limited geographic distribution and low number of individuals, 
 <italic>C. cygniflora</italic> is considered a candidate for listing as federally endangered [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
