 <xref rid="B9-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and is an excellent candidate for restoration of coastal areas. It can be used for beach projects that require planting on the back side of primary dunes, or any side of secondary dunes. It has also been used in gardens as a groundcover as the branches can reach up to 1 m in spread. False rosemary was easily propagated in the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension using softwood stem cuttings from terminal shoots taken during the growing season.
