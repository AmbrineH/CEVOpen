<p>Morphologically, 
 <italic>C. brevifolia</italic> Shinners (short-leaved rosemary) is very similar to 
 <italic>C. canescens</italic>, differing by its shorter leaves and greater number of flowers per axil, and it is also similar to the endangered 
 <italic>C. glabra</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. brevifolia</italic> was described as a new species by Shinners [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many taxonomic reviews of 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> have upheld 
 <italic>C. brevifolia</italic> as a distinct species yet it is taxonomically questionable [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some taxonomists are still uncertain that 
 <italic>C. brevifolia</italic> is a true different species and therefore they treat it as a synonym to 
 <italic>C. canescens. C. brevifolia</italic> has a very restricted range in the middle of the Lake Wales Ridge in Central Florida [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and has been listed as a federally endangered species in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Habitat destruction for agricultural and residential purposes is the main threat to this species.
