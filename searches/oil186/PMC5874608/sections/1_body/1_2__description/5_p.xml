 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> Small (large-flowered rosemary) is endemic to the scrub habitat of Floridaâ€™s east coast between Daytona Beach and Miami as well as near Orlando and Okeechobee County [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A regime of frequent fires benefits 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> because it cannot tolerate shade and requires an open sunny habitat. 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> is a candidate for listing as an endangered species but of a lower priority than other 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Loss of the Florida scrub habitat is the major threat to this species.
