 <xref rid="B27-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some taxonomic discrepancies surround 
 <italic>C. montana</italic> and 
 <italic>C. puberula</italic> since some experts treat both species as synonyms of 
 <italic>C. verticillata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. canescens</italic>, respectively.
