<p>Each species of 
 <italic>Conradina</italic> occupies a separate geographical region [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Five of the species are endemic to Florida, one is native to west Florida, south Alabama, and south Mississippi, and one is endemic to north-central Tennessee and Kentucky (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Due to habitat destruction from residential, commercial, and agricultural land conversions and their very restricted distribution, three of these species are on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) federal list as endangered (
 <italic>Conradina brevifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. etonia</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], one as threatened (
 <italic>C. verticillata</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and two species are considered candidates for listing as endangered (
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. cygniflora</italic>).
