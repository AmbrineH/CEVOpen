 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review summarizes the current status, distribution, chemical value and biological studies on genus 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span>. There is still some debate about the exact number of 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> species as well as the classification/taxonomy of this genus and more studies, especially genetic studies, are still needed. The available information increases the importance of protecting 
  <span class="italic">Conradina</span> from extinction. Future studies on this genus may provide valuable information on the mechanism of evolution.
