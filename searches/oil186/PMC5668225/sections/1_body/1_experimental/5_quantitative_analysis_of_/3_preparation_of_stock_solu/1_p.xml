<p id="Par20">For the quantitative analysis of β-pinene limonene, γ-terpinene, linalool, linalyl acetate, five stock solutions A were prepared using 150 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 5 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions A were further used to prepare diluted working solutions B. In particular, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.3 and 1.5 mL of each stock solution A, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 5 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions B were 0.6, 1.2, 3, 6, 7.8, 9.6 mg/mL respectively.</p>
