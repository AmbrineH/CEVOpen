<p id="Par21" class="p">For the quantitative analysis of α-pinene, α-phellandrene, α-terpinene, p-cimene, terpinolene, myrcene, ocimene, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, α-terpineol, octyl acetate, caryophyllene, thirteen stock solutions C were prepared as follows: 50 mg of each analyte was diluted to 100 mL with diethyl ether. Aliquots of these solutions C were then used to prepare diluted working solutions D. In particular, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.7 and 2.5 mL of each analyte, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 5 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions D were 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.13, 0.17, 0.21 mg/mL.</p>
