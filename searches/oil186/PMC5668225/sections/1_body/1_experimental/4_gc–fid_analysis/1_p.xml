<p id="Par17" class="p">GC–MS analyses were performed using a HP6890 A series 2 GC System (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a HP-35MS (35% diphenylsiloxane; I = 20 m, d = 0.25 mm 0.25 µm). The column temperature was programmed at 40 °C for 0 min, to 250 °C at 3 °C/min, to 280 °C at 5 °C/min, where it was maintained for 15 min. The injector and detector temperatures were programmed at 230 and 300 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate 1 mL/min.</p>
