<p id="Par27" class="p">For the quantitative analysis of limonene and β-pinene at 0 °C, two stock solutions G were prepared using 150 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions G were further used to prepare diluted working solutions H. In particular, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 mL of each stock solution G, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentration of each analyte in working solutions H were 0.225, 0.30, 0.375, 0.450, 0.525 and 0.60 mg/mL respectively.</p>
