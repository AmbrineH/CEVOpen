<p id="Par26" class="p">For the quantitative analysis of α-pinene, p-cimene, mircene, linalool, linalyl acetate at 0 °C, five stock solutions E were prepared using 50 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions E were further used to prepare diluted working solutions F. In particular, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 mL of each stock solution E, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions F were 0.015, 0.025, 0.050, 0.065, 0.075 and 0.085 mg/mL respectively. </p>
