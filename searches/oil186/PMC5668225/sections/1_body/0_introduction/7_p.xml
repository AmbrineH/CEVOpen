<p id="Par8">Over the years specific studies designed to identify an analysis procedure for the determination of headspace gas at equilibrium with liquid essential oil have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These works are mostly based on the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) by which the headspace gas is extracted by a fused silica fiber coated with a suitable stationary phase (HS-SPME) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber are then thermally desorbed in the GC injector port of a GC–MS instrument to perform the qualitative analysis and GC–FID for the quantitative determination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
