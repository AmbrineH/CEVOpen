<p id="Par7" class="p">The migration of volatile molecules into the headspace phase does not just depend on their volatility but also on their affinity for the liquid phase sample; volatile compounds relative concentrations between the two phases will reach an equilibrium value. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of each volatile component in the headspace vapor will be equivalent to the vapor pressure that is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase. In essence, the concentration of a compound in the headspace is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase and can be affected by temperature, respective volumes of the sample and the headspace, and other factors [
