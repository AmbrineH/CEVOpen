<p id="Par39">To this aim, a weighed amount of essential oil was placed in a headspace vial, after adding a given amount of anisole the vial was sealed and then allowed to stand for 30 min at 0 °C to establish the equilibrium at that temperature. Once the volatile compounds have equilibrated, an aliquot of the headspace gas was withdrawn using a gas tight syringe, injected into the gas chromatograph injection port and analyzed by GC–MS. The individual analytes present in the headspace gas were identified through comparison of retention times and mass spectral data with those of authentic standards (Fig.
