<p id="Par51">The composition of the headspace vapor generated at 40 °C was characterized by the presence of octyl acetate, not detected at 22 °C, and the significant decrease of limonene, and α and β-pinene. On the contrary, linalool and linalyl acetate were appreciably increased contributing to the composition of the gaseous phase of BEO at 40 °C with 27.52 and 10.40%, respectively (Table
