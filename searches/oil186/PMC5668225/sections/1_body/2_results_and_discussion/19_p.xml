<p id="Par50">At 22 °C the gas phase in equilibrium with liquid phase is enriched in some components with respect to the composition determined at 0 °C. In fact, α-phellandrene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, linalool and linalyl acetate, which were not detected in the gaseous phase at 0 °C, were identified and determined in the gaseous phase at 22 °C. In particular, at 22 °C γ-terpinene and linalyl acetate got to 13.13 and 0.66% respectively and linalool grew from 3 to 9% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At both temperature, the main components were limonene (58.07% at 0 °C and 47.27% at 22 °C) and β-pinene (25.90% at 0 °C and 19.69% at 22 °C).
