  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three samples of the gaseous phase of the bergamot essential oil were prepared as follows: 100 mg of bergamot essential oil and 7 mg of anisole used as the internal standard, were transferred to three 10 mL vials that were sealed and then maintained at 0, 22 and 40 °C respectively.</p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature of 0 °C was obtained using an ice bath in which liquid phase and solid phase coexist. The temperature of 22 °C was that measured in a conditioned environment at 22 °C. 40 °C was obtained by means of a thermostated oil bath with a digital vertex thermometer.</p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 30 min, a gastight syringe was used to weigh out the gaseous phase (0.4 mL) and then subjected to the quantitative analysis by both GC–MS and GC–FID. Quantitative data were obtained by comparing the analyte/anisole area ratios in the standard solutions with the corresponding ratios in the essential oil samples solutions.</p>
