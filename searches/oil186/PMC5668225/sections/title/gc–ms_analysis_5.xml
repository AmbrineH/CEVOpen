 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC–MS analyses were performed using a 6890N Network GC System (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a HP-35MS (35% diphenylsiloxane; l = 20 m, d = 0.25 mm 0.25 µm) capillary column and with a mass spectrometer 5973 Network MSD operated in electron impact ionization mode (70 eV). GC–MS analyses were carried out in split mode, using helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min flow rate). The column was maintained at an initial temperature of 40 °C for 0 min, then ramped to 250 °C at 3 °C/min, to 280 °C at 5 °C/min, where it was maintained for 15 min. Quantitative GC–MS analysis was carried out in splitless mode (splitless time, 1 min), by using anisole as the internal standard. The identification of the compounds was based on comparison of their retention times with those of authentic samples, and on comparison of their EI-mass spectra with the NIST/NBS, Wiley library spectra and literature [
