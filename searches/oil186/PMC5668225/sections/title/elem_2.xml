GC–MS analyses were carried out in split mode, using helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min flow rate). The column was maintained at an initial temperature of 40 °C for 0 min, then ramped to 250 °C at 3 °C/min, to 280 °C at 5 °C/min, where it was maintained for 15 min. Quantitative GC–MS analysis was carried out in splitless mode (splitless time, 1 min), by using anisole as the internal standard. The identification of the compounds was based on comparison of their retention times with those of authentic samples, and on comparison of their EI-mass spectra with the NIST/NBS, Wiley library spectra and literature [

In particular, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8 mL of each stock solution K, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions L were 0.05, 0.065, 0.085, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14 mg/mL respectively. For the quantitative analysis of limonene and β-pinene at 22 °C, two stock solutions M were prepared using 100 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions M were further used to prepare diluted working solutions N. In particular, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 mL of each stock solution M, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions N were 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50 and 0.60 mg/mL respectively.</p>

For the quantitative analysis of α-pinene, α-phellandrene and octylacetate, at 40 °C, two stock solutions Q were prepared using 10 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions Q were further used to prepare diluted working solutions R. In particular, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 mL of each stock solution Q, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether. The final concentrations of each analyte in working solutions R were 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.035 mg/mL respectively. For the quantitative analysis of limonene, β-pinene, linalyl acetate, γ-terpinene and linalool at 40 °C, five stock solutions S were prepared using 100 mg of each analytes and dissolving them in 100 mL of diethyl ether. Solutions S were further used to prepare diluted working solutions T. In particular, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 mL of each stock solution S, after adding 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution, was made up to 10 mL volume with diethyl ether.

For each compound, six solutions were prepared and analyzed by GC–MS. The statistical analysis was obtained comparing the analyte/anisole area ratios in the solutions with the corresponding concentrations. A value of P correspondent to 0.011 was considered significant.</p>
