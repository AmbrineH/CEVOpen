   <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil was characterized by eight chemical compounds accounting for 93.6% of the total composition. The major component was the monoterpene phenol carvacrol accounting for half essential oil composition (50.32%), followed by its isomer thymol (14.8%) and by γ-terpinene (13.6%) and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (8.40%). Minor components were (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (2.1%), α-terpinene (1.6%), myrcene (1.5%) and linalool (1.3%).

   <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil showed a dose dependent larvicidal activity at 24 and 48 h of treatments. All larvae were killed at doses of 1 μl/ml after 24 h showing a paralysis that indicates mortality. Although the efficacy of the treatment can be considered similar at 24 and 48 h because the mortality was 100% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the LD
   <sub>50</sub> of essential oil was lower after 48 h.

   <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil, carvacrol and thymol acted as AChE inhibitors, indicating that this could be one of the mechanisms involved in the larvicidal activity (Fig.

However, higher doses of thymol were needed to inhibit the AChE enzyme at the same level. The AChE inhibitory potential decreased in the following order: carvacrol &gt; 
   <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> &gt; thymol. Galantamine at 0.1 mg/ml induced 100% of AChE inhibition.
