 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present work, the essential oil from 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> was assayed for the first time against L3 larvae of 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span>. For the purpose, a commercial oil was used and analysed showing a chemical composition fully consistent with those reported in literature concerning Moroccan oregano accessions, with phenolic compounds such as carvacrol and thymol as the most abundant components, followed by their biogenetic precursors γ-terpinene and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (Bakhy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Only quantitative differences have hitherto noticed among the main essential oil constituents. Notably, the monoterpene phenols thymol and carvacrol may be detected in comparable amounts (Ghanmi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2015</a>; Kloucek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2012</a>; Sbayou et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2014</a>; Bouhdid et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2008</a>; Mezzoug et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2007</a>) or with the latter more abundant than the former (Bouchra et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2003</a>; Bakhy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>; Pavela 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2008</a>; Lamiri et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2001</a>) as in our case. Thus, our sample of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> can be defined as a carvacrol-rich chemotype (Bakhy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>).

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our experiments, 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil showed anthelmintic effects against 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> L3 larvae as well as inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Levamisole is used as an antiparasitic agent in veterinary, so we tried the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml as a control substance. One microlitre per millilitre of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil is equivalent to 1 mg/ml approximately, so levamisole was more potent. However, this treatment is not available for humans and is used only in veterinary.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and here published for the first time. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activities of this oil were already known and previously reported. 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil is considered as a strong bactericidal and fungicidal, being capable to inhibit the growth of several pathogenic strains such as 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Alternaria alternata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus niger</span> (Bouhdid et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>; Kloucek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2012</a>). The antimicrobial effects are related to the presence of monoterpene phenols thymol and carvacrol which can alter permeability of cell membrane and destabilize respiratory and enzymatic activities (Bouyahya et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2017</a>; Bakkali et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2008</a>). 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil has also shown toxic effects on 
  <span class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</span> (Bouchra et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2003</a>) as well as on wood decay fungi (Ghanmi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2015</a>), nematicidal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Ditylenchus dipsaci</span> (Zouhar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2009</a>) and insecticidal effects against larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</span> (Pavela 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2005</a>) and adults of 
  <span class="italic">Musca domestica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Mayetiola destructor</span> (Pavela 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2008</a>; Lamiri et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2001</a>). The ethyl acetate extract was highly active against the schistosomiasis-transmitting snail 
  <span class="italic">Bulinus truncatus</span> (Hmamouchi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the aim of elucidating which compounds of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil were responsible for the anti-
  <span class="italic">Anisakis</span> activities, the two main monoterpenes, carvacrol and thymol, were also assayed. According to our data, carvacrol might be one of the active principles as it exhibited a higher larvicidal activity than thymol and the oil, revealing its potential as an anthelmintic drug. This is not the first time that carvacrol has been evaluated as a nematicidal compound (Trailović et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2015</a>; Andre et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>); in fact, the larvicidal activity of this monoterpene has also been evaluated on 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> (Hierro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2004</a>). The inhibitory activity of carvacrol and thymol on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme has also been tested (Jukic et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2007</a>). Carvacrol and thymol are isomeric phenolic monoterpenes present in several aromatic medicinal and culinary plants. The different position of the hydroxyl group in the phenyl ring provides better anthelmintic and anti-cholinesterase activities for carvacrol in our case, which agrees with results of other authors (Jukic et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2007</a>; Aazza et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2011</a>; Seo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the results of the present study pointed out the importance of the traditional use of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> as a food preservative in Morocco and Spain. Its demonstrated anthelmintic properties, together with its well-known antibacterial and fungicidal effects, make it an ideal candidate as preservative agent for the prevention and treatment of food-borne diseases.
