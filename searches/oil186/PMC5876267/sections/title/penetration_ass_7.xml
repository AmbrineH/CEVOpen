 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agar block plates were prepared in 12-well plates to study the capacity of the living larvae to penetrate. The agar solution was made with the following reagents: 0.75% agar in RPMI 1640 medium solution (pH 4, Sigma, USA) with 20% FBS (Lonza, USA). One millilitre of the solution was poured into each well. Then, 100 μl of supernatant, RPMI-1640 (RPMI-1640, 20% FBS, 1% commercial pepsin, pH 4.0), was placed into each well. 
  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> L3 larvae were incubated with a sub-lethal concentration (0.125 mg/ml) of 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil for 24 h. Five larvae were placed on each control or simple well. The plates were incubated for 24 h, and the number of L3 larvae that penetrated the solid agar block was counted after that period.
