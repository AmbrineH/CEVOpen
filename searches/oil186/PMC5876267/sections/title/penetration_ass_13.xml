  <span class="italic">A. simplex</span> L3 larvae was evaluated after exposure to 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil and compared with untreated larvae. The penetration rate of control wells was constant at 100% while it decreased 25% for treated larvae with sub-lethal doses of the oil (the agar was penetrated by 75% of the larvae).
