  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil showed a dose dependent larvicidal activity at 24 and 48 h of treatments. All larvae were killed at doses of 1 μl/ml after 24 h showing a paralysis that indicates mortality. Although the efficacy of the treatment can be considered similar at 24 and 48 h because the mortality was 100% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the LD
  <sub>50</sub> of essential oil was lower after 48 h.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of carvacrol and thymol on the larvae were similar to those of the oil (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>); however, carvacrol exhibited a stronger activity than 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> and thymol, indicating that this compound might be responsible for the larvicidal effects. Levamisole induced 100% mortality at 0.1 mg/ml.
