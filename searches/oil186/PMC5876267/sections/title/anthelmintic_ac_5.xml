 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This assay was performed in 6 well plates. Ten larvae were introduced in each well of polystyrene plates with a final volume of 2 ml sterile saline solution containing different concentrations of the test solution (Gómez-Rincón et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2014</a>). 
  <span class="italic">O. compactum</span> essential oil was tested against 
  <span class="italic">Anisakis</span> in the range of 0–1 μl/ml. The major constituents carvacrol and thymol were tested in the same range of concentrations. Appropriate control wells without treatments were also carried out in each experiment. The parasites were incubated at 37 °C for 24 and 48 h. Levamisole was used as the reference antiparasitic drug. Larvae were examined at 24 and 48 h under microscope, and immobile L3 was considered dead.
