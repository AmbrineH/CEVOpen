<p id="Par4">Nowadays, the endoscopic removal of live larvae still represents the main effective treatment against anisakiasis (Sugita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2008</xref>; Pravettoni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Furthermore, protection against anisakiasis can be enhanced educating consumers about the risks linked with eating raw or undercooked seafood. From a pharmacological point of view, antibiotics, anticholinergics and/or corticosteroids have been employed for the treatment of anisakiasis, showing patchy and limited efficacy (Matsui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1985</xref>). However, a relevant exception is represented by albendazole (Dziekońska-Rynko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>; Romero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>), since it has been recently showed that this compound dose-dependently reduced (500 μg/ml led to 100% 48 h post-treatment) the survival of 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic> third instar larvae (Arias-Diaz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). However, it has been noted that acidic medium pH reduced its efficacy (Arias-Diaz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). In this scenario, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective tools and drugs for the treatment of 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic> parasitic infections (Molina-Garcia and Sanz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002</xref>; Brutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>), including the use of natural products (Hierro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>; Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>; Gómez-Rincón et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>; Valero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2015</xref>).
