<p id="Par3" class="p">Live larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">A. simplex</italic> can cause a parasitic infection of the digestive tract. In addition, they can also affect other organs causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites and perforations until granulomas and masses, if the larvae are not promptly removed. Furthermore, the presence of larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">A. simplex</italic> can lead to allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema (Asturias et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2012</xref>). Notably, the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">A. simplex</italic> can induce an immune adaptive response characterized by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (which are responsible for allergic symptoms), IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis (Park et al.
