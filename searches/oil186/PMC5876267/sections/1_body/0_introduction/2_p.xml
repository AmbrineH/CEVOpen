<p id="Par3">Live larvae of 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic> can cause a parasitic infection of the digestive tract. In addition, they can also affect other organs causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites and perforations until granulomas and masses, if the larvae are not promptly removed. Furthermore, the presence of larvae of 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic> can lead to allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema (Asturias et al.

 <italic>A. simplex</italic> can induce an immune adaptive response characterized by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (which are responsible for allergic symptoms), IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis (Park et al.
