<p id="Par22">With the aim of elucidating which compounds of 
 <italic>O. compactum</italic> essential oil were responsible for the anti-
 <italic>Anisakis</italic> activities, the two main monoterpenes, carvacrol and thymol, were also assayed. According to our data, carvacrol might be one of the active principles as it exhibited a higher larvicidal activity than thymol and the oil, revealing its potential as an anthelmintic drug. This is not the first time that carvacrol has been evaluated as a nematicidal compound (TrailoviÄ‡ et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>; Andre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>); in fact, the larvicidal activity of this monoterpene has also been evaluated on 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic> (Hierro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>). The inhibitory activity of carvacrol and thymol on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme has also been tested (Jukic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>). Carvacrol and thymol are isomeric phenolic monoterpenes present in several aromatic medicinal and culinary plants. The different position of the hydroxyl group in the phenyl ring provides better anthelmintic and anti-cholinesterase activities for carvacrol in our case, which agrees with results of other authors (Jukic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>; Aazza et al.
