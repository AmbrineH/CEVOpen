<p id="Par19">In the present work, the essential oil from 
 <italic>O. compactum</italic> was assayed for the first time against L3 larvae of 
 <italic>A. simplex</italic>. For the purpose, a commercial oil was used and analysed showing a chemical composition fully consistent with those reported in literature concerning Moroccan oregano accessions, with phenolic compounds such as carvacrol and thymol as the most abundant components, followed by their biogenetic precursors Î³-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (Bakhy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Only quantitative differences have hitherto noticed among the main essential oil constituents. Notably, the monoterpene phenols thymol and carvacrol may be detected in comparable amounts (Ghanmi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>; Kloucek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Sbayou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>; Bouhdid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>; Mezzoug et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>) or with the latter more abundant than the former (Bouchra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>; Bakhy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>; Pavela 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2008</xref>; Lamiri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>) as in our case. Thus, our sample of 
 <italic>O. compactum</italic> can be defined as a carvacrol-rich chemotype (Bakhy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>).
