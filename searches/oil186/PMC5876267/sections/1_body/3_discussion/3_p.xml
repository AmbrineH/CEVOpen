<p id="Par21">To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and here published for the first time. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activities of this oil were already known and previously reported. 
 <italic>O. compactum</italic> essential oil is considered as a strong bactericidal and fungicidal, being capable to inhibit the growth of several pathogenic strains such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (Bouhdid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Kloucek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). The antimicrobial effects are related to the presence of monoterpene phenols thymol and carvacrol which can alter permeability of cell membrane and destabilize respiratory and enzymatic activities (Bouyahya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Bakkali et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). 
 <italic>O. compactum</italic> essential oil has also shown toxic effects on 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (Bouchra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>) as well as on wood decay fungi (Ghanmi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>), nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ditylenchus dipsaci</italic> (Zouhar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2009</xref>) and insecticidal effects against larvae of 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Pavela 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>) and adults of 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> and 
 <italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic> (Pavela 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2008</xref>; Lamiri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>). The ethyl acetate extract was highly active against the schistosomiasis-transmitting snail 
 <italic>Bulinus truncatus</italic> (Hmamouchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>).
