 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">1961</xref>) with some modifications. Each well contained 25 μl of 15 mM ATCI in Millipore water, 125 μl of 3 mM DTNB in buffer C (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M MgCl2 6 H2O), 50 μl buffer B (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 0.1% bovine serum), and 25 μl of test compound or extract. Every concentration was tested in triplicates. Then, 25 μl and 0.22 U/ml AChE were added and the absorbance was measured eight times every 13 s at 405 nm. Galantamine was used as reference.
