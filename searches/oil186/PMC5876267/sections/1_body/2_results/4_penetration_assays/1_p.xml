<p id="Par18" class="p">The penetration ability of 
 <italic class="italic">A. simplex</italic> L3 larvae was evaluated after exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">O. compactum</italic> essential oil and compared with untreated larvae. The penetration rate of control wells was constant at 100% while it decreased 25% for treated larvae with sub-lethal doses of the oil (the agar was penetrated by 75% of the larvae).
