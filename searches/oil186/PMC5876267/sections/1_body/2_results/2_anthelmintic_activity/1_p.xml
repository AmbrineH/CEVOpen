 <italic>O. compactum</italic> essential oil showed a dose dependent larvicidal activity at 24 and 48 h of treatments. All larvae were killed at doses of 1 μl/ml after 24 h showing a paralysis that indicates mortality. Although the efficacy of the treatment can be considered similar at 24 and 48 h because the mortality was 100% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the LD
