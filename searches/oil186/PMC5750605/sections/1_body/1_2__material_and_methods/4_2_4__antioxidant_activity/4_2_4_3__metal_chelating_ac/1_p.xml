<p class="p">The chelation of Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> by essential oils was evaluated using the method developed earlier [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In brief, 0.1 mL of 2 mM FeCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·4H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, 0.2 mL of 5 mM ferrozine, and 4.7 mL of methanol were added to different concentrations of a test sample (5–25 μL/mL). The solutions were mixed and allowed to react for 10 min. The absorbance was determined at 562 nm; IC% = (A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = the absorbance value of the control sample and A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> = the absorbance value of the test sample. The percent of chelating ability was plotted against the concentration, and the standard curve was drawn using a standard antioxidant (EDTA). The metal chelating ability of essential oils was discussed in terms of their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values.
