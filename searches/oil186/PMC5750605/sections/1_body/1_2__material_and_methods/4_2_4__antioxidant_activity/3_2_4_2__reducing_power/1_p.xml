<p class="p">The reducing power of essential oils was determined by the method developed earlier [
 <xref rid="B36-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In brief, varying concentrations of tested samples (5–25 μL/mL) were mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (200 mM, pH = 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide, K
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> [FeCN
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>]. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 50 °C. After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid was added to the mixtures, followed by centrifugation at 650 rpm for 10 min. The upper layer (1 mL) was mixed with 5 mL distilled water and 1 mL of 0.1% ferric chloride and the absorbance of the resultant solution was measured at 700 nm. Reducing power % = (A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = the absorbance value of the control sample and A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> = the absorbance value of the test sample. The percent of chelating ability was plotted against concentrations and using a standard (gallic acid). The reducing potential of essential oils was discussed in terms of their RP
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values.
