<p class="p">The essential oil composition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> rhizomes and concomitant antibacterial and antihelmintic activity has already been reported by our group [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However keeping in mind the above statements, the present study reports the results obtained on the seasonal and altitudinal diversity of essential oil components among three accessions of 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> from the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand in India. Publishing these data will help to generate a database of this plant and facilitate its more judicious and scientific exploitation in the future.
