<p class="p">The oils were dominated by phenylpropanoids, and were detected in all the accessions in all seasons but in different quantities. Interestingly, the 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-asarone content was highest in winter (57.0–90.6%) and lowest in summer, except Bhimtal, in which spring has the lowest content; whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-asarone content was highest in summer and lowest in winter in all the accessions. On the basis of major components (phenyl propanoids) analysis by cluster analysis, as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00081-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, it was observed that there were little difference in principal components like 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-asarone, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-isoelemicin, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-asarone, etc., both altitude-wise and season-wise.
