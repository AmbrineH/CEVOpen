<p class="p">Over 78–96% of constituents were identified in both ACLEO and ACREO. The major constituents identified in both the oils in all four seasons were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-methyl isoeugenol, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-isoelimicin, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-asarone, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-asarone, etc., but with different respective yield. Both ACLEO and ACREO exhibited similar qualitative diversity in terms of terpenoid composition, but their quantity varied in different seasons. However, the constituents, viz., limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-humulene, 2,4,5-trimethoxy benzoic acid, and heptadecanol, could be detected only in ACLEO, whereas elimicin and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-calacorene were detected only in ACREO.
