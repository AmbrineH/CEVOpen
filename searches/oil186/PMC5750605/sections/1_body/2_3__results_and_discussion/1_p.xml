<p>A noticeable variation was observed in the percentage yield of the hydro distilled essential oils (EOs) samples, taken at four seasons (winter, spring, summer, and autumn), The essential oil was pale yellow with a characteristic odour, and produced an irritating sensation in the eyes. The yields of essential oils in different seasons were 0.02–1.3% for leaves and 1.2–4.8%
