<p class="p">The EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> exhibited good in vitro antioxidant activity, which might be because of the mixture of essential oils containing mono and sesquiterpenoids and the synergetic effects of the constituents. This is proven by a report that says that antioxidant capacity is affected by other bioactive compounds and could involve synergistic effects [
 <xref rid="B45-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Several reports have shown in vitro antioxidant properties of many natural products, including essential oils. Antioxidants are believed to be directly anti mutagenic. In vitro physicochemical assays characterize most of them as antioxidants. However, the published report shows that in eukaryotic cells, essential oils can act as pro-oxidants, affecting inner cell membranes and organelles like mitochondria, and are usually non-genotoxic, and hence the beneficial effects of essential oils are due to pro-oxidantsâ€™ effects on the cellular level [

 <italic class="italic">Acorus calamus</italic> extracts and essential oils have been reported to possess anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects on cancer cells [
