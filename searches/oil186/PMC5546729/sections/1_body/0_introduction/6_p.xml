 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil is traditionally obtained by mechanical pressing or treating powdered 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed with organic solvents, most commonly hexane. Conventional solvent extraction techniques produce low-quality oil that requires extensive purification operations resulting in thermal degradation and loss of valuable compounds.
 <xref rid="b25-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The use of organic solvents and the necessity of recovering the solvent have led to a move toward cleaner extraction methods, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). SFE is becoming an efficient and worldwide used technique to obtain valuable natural substances from complex materials. SFE-CO
 <sub>2</sub> has been utilized as a nontoxic alternative to hexane and other organic solvents for the extraction of oil from corn germ,

 <xref rid="b29-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thus, the main objective of this study was to compare the oil extraction efficiency and essential oil composition of Iranian and Indian 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> L. oil extracted by SFE and solvent extraction techniques.
