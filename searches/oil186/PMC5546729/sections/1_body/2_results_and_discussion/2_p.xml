<p>In general, the oil extraction efficiency obtained from SFE was higher than the extracted yield achieved by solvent extraction technique. Among the main compounds identified by GC-MS, LA (22.4%–61.85%) was the main fatty acid in the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oils extracted by both SFE and solvent extraction techniques. Besides LA, oleic acid (1.64%–18.97%), decanoic acid (7.15%), eicosadienoic acid (2.56%), palmitic acid (1.34%–1.44%), propanoic acid (0.79%), acetic acid (0.71%), heneicosanedioic acid (0.65%), and myristic acid (0.29%–0.34%) were found to be the major compounds identified in essential oils obtained from the Iranian and Indian 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed.
