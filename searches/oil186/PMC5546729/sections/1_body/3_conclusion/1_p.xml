<p>The present study shows that SFE and solvent extraction methods have both advantages and disadvantages for the extraction of the essential oil and volatile oil components. Based on the results, SFE has been proven to be an efficient method of extraction. Solvent extraction can be utilized in extraction of some compounds, such as TQ. The present study also demonstrated that SFE is more efficient for extraction of essential oil from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> L. seed compared to the solvent extraction technique. The essential oil obtained from SFE process contained more LA than that achieved by solvent extraction. It was observed that the oil extraction efficiency obtained from SFE is higher than that achieved by solvent extraction technique. According to this research, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil has some bioactive compounds such as TQ and LA.
