<p>In this study, 150 g of the powdered sample was subjected into SFE equipment (SFE-1000F, Thar US Technology, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) at extraction temperature of 40°C under 60 MPa. SFE flow rate was maintained at 20 mL/min using a variable flow restrictor. The yield was collected within 3 hours. The collected pressure and temperature were 0.1 MPa and 25°C, respectively. The extraction was carried out with pure CO
