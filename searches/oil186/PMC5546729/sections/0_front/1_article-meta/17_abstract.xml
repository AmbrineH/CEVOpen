 <p>The objective of this study was to compare the oil extraction yield and essential oil composition of Indian and Iranian 
  <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. extracted by using Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) and solvent extraction methods. In this study, a gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrophotometer detector was employed for qualitative analysis of the essential oil composition of Indian and Iranian 
  <italic>N. sativa</italic> L. The results indicated that the main fatty acid composition identified in the essential oils extracted by using SFE and solvent extraction were linoleic acid (22.4%–61.85%) and oleic acid (1.64%–18.97%). Thymoquinone (0.72%–21.03%) was found to be the major volatile compound in the extracted 
  <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil. It was observed that the oil extraction efficiency obtained from SFE was significantly (
  <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) higher than that achieved by the solvent extraction technique. The present study showed that SFE can be used as a more efficient technique for extraction of 
  <italic>N. Sativa</italic> L. essential oil, which is composed of higher linoleic acid and thymoquinone contents compared to the essential oil obtained by the solvent extraction technique.
