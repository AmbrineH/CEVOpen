  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-11-2221" href="#t1-dddt-11-2221">Table 1</a>. The gas chromatographs obtained from GC-MS analyses of oil extracted using solvent and SFE are shown in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dddt-11-2221" href="#f4-dddt-11-2221">4</a>. In total, 41 constituents were identified in the essential oils obtained from Iranian and Indian 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seeds by using SFE and solvent extraction techniques.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the oil extraction efficiency obtained from SFE was higher than the extracted yield achieved by solvent extraction technique. Among the main compounds identified by GC-MS, LA (22.4%–61.85%) was the main fatty acid in the 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oils extracted by both SFE and solvent extraction techniques. Besides LA, oleic acid (1.64%–18.97%), decanoic acid (7.15%), eicosadienoic acid (2.56%), palmitic acid (1.34%–1.44%), propanoic acid (0.79%), acetic acid (0.71%), heneicosanedioic acid (0.65%), and myristic acid (0.29%–0.34%) were found to be the major compounds identified in essential oils obtained from the Iranian and Indian 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TQ was the main volatile oil component identified in this study (0.72%–21.03%). Some noticeable compounds such as 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-butylhydroquinone (0.3%–11.5%), carvacrol (1.34%–4.83%), α-phellandrene (1.66%), longifolene (0.06%), pseudopelletierine (0.15%), neolignan (0.01%), eremophilene (0.18%), methyl palmitoleate (0.65%), limonene (0.32%),

  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> seeds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results indicate that the LA of Indian 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> oil extracted by SFE method was higher than the fatty acid contents measured for the other samples; while the essential oil extracted from Iranian 
  <span class="italic">sativa</span> seeds using solvent extraction technique (methanol) contained the highest TQ content (21.03%) compared to TQ recorded in the other samples. The present results are in agreement with the results of previous researchers
  <a rid="b21-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21-dddt-11-2221">21</a>,
  <a rid="b23-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-dddt-11-2221">23</a> who pointed out that the main compounds in the 
  <span class="italic">N. sativa</span> essential oil were TQ, carvacrol, ρ-cymene, and 4-terpineol. Regarding the extraction efficiency obtained by using SFE, this study is in accordance with Kao et al,
  <a rid="b30-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30-dddt-11-2221">30</a> who indicated that the oil extraction using SFE resulted in higher content of compounds compared to solvent extraction technique.
