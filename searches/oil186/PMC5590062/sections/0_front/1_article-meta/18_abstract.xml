  <bold>Background:</bold>
  <italic>Avicennia schaueriana</italic> Stapf &amp; Leechm. ex Moldenke (Acanthaceae) is a native species from the Brazilian mangroves presenting ecological and economic significance. This study compared the composition and the biological activities from the essential oils obtained from two 
  <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> populations collected at Jureia-Itatins and Ilha do Cardoso. 
  <bold>Methods:</bold> Essential oils were obtained by conventional means, and their compositions were analyzed by GC-MS. Screening assays for antimicrobial activity were carried out by the microdilution method and the antioxidant potential was assessed by the DPPH scavenging method. 
  <bold>Results:</bold> The GC-MS analysis indicated that the Jureia oil (
  <bold>1</bold>) was composed mostly of the fatty acids palmitic (46.5%) and myristic (11.6%) acids, while the main components for the Ilha do Cardoso oil (
  <bold>2</bold>) were eugenol (19.7%), eugenol acetate (12.9%) and palmitic acid (15.1%). The oils showed an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 0.9 ± 0.011 mg/mL for 
  <bold>1</bold> and 1.13 ± 0.028 mg/mL for 
  <bold>2</bold> in the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial assay indicated MIC &gt; 217 µg/mL for all tested microorganisms. 
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The different essential oil composition may indicate the presence of chemotypes for 
  <italic>A. schaueriana</italic>. The antioxidant activity of the oils was weak if compared with flavonoids. Despite the high MIC values, these oils presented some antibacterial potential against 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.
