<p class="p">This was the first preliminary report of the constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> essential oils and their biological activities. The oils were composed mostly of fatty acids, but the Ilha do Cardoso population also presented eugenol and eugenol acetate as major compounds. As the two 
 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> populations analyzed presented differences in their essential oil contents, this might be an indication of different chemotypes for this species. More studies with other populations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> are necessary to prove if these differences are not only due to environmental factors. Concerning the biological activities of the essential oils, these oils presented no remarkable antioxidant or antimicrobial activities for their direct use as medicines. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the antibacterial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, including synergism with other antimicrobials, due to its multidrug-resistant phenotypes and nosocomial status.
