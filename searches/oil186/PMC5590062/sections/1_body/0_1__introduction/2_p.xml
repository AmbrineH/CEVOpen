 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> Stapf &amp; Leechm ex. Moldenke, also called black mangrove or siriuba, is one of the native Brazilian mangrove species. The antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> extracts has been reported [
 <xref rid="B2-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, essential oils from this species have never been evaluated for its chemical composition or biological activities. In the genus, only the 
 <italic class="italic">A. marina</italic> leaf and fruit oils have been analyzed, presenting 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) (41.91%) and 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (24.56%) as major components for the leaf oils, and methyl palmitate (41.9%), methyl 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-vinylbenzoate (9.68%) and methyl ester (
 <italic class="italic">9Z</italic>,15
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-9,15-octadecadienoic acid (8.28%) for the fruit oils [

 <xref rid="B13-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the composition of leaf essential oils from two 
 <italic class="italic">A. schaueriana</italic> specimens and to compare their in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
