<p>The 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> essential oils presented some radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.90 mg/mL for oil 
 <bold>1</bold> and 1.13 mg/mL for oil 
 <bold>2</bold>, while quercetin, used as a positive control, showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10.47 ± 0.91 μg/mL. These results indicated that the essential oils were weaker antioxidants, when compared with quercetin. Oil 
 <bold>1</bold> contained mainly fatty acids, palmitic and myristic acid, which are an important source of reserve energy and are components of the cell membrane in all living organisms. Additionally, in plants, fatty acid metabolic pathways also play significant roles in pathogen defense [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Saturated fatty acids can act as antioxidants or prooxidants [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of fatty extracts from 10 
 <italic>Cephalaria</italic> species, containing myristic and palmitic acids, showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.77 to 15.12 mg/mL by the DPPH method [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> oils was higher than that found in 
 <italic>Cephalaria</italic> species. Although oil 
 <bold>2</bold> contained, as one of the major compounds, eugenol, a phenolic compound, the total oil activity was lower than that obtained for oil 
 <bold>1</bold>. Pure eugenol showed a stronger antioxidant capacity than the positive control α-tocopherol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 33.85 μg/mL), and presented an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 16.06 μg/mL, using the same DPPH scavenging assay [
