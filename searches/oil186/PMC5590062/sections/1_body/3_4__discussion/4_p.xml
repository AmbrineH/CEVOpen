<p>There is a large pool of publications describing the antioxidant activity of essential oils with active concentrations ranging from mg/mL to μg/mL. The antioxidant capability of 423 essential oils from 48 families by the DPPH assay was evaluated, and less than 5% of the tested oils showed antioxidant activity lower than 300 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The antioxidant capacity of essential oils is not very high compared with extracts and fractions rich in phenolic compounds. For example, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Avicennia</italic> species is reported for extracts and fractions, and the results were higher than those obtained for the 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> essential oils. The extracts from 
 <italic>A. marina</italic> pneumatophores showed high antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 21.22 μg/mL [

 <italic>A. marina</italic> barks, also rich in phenolic compounds, exhibited an important antioxidant activity with respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 112.7 μg/mL and 95.18 μg/mL [
