<p>The two 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> specimens showed some variations in the essential oil compositions, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00026-t001">Table 1</xref>. The Jureia-Itatins oil (
 <bold>1</bold>) was composed mostly of fatty acids (65.3%), having palmitic acid (46.5%) and myristic acid (11.6%) as major compounds, while in the Ilha do Cardoso oil (
 <bold>2</bold>), the main compounds were the phenylpropanoids eugenol (19.7%) and eugenol acetate (12.9%). In the second oil, fatty acids were only responsible for 18.1% of the oil composition, containing mainly palmitic acid (15.1%). The only 
 <italic>Avicennia</italic> species that has had its essential oil contents previously analyzed was 
 <italic>A. marina</italic>, and in this oil the main compounds were 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) (41.09%) and 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (24.56%) [
 <xref rid="B12-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while the fruit oils consisted mostly of methyl palmitate (41.9%) [
 <xref rid="B13-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An interesting remark about these previous studies is the considerable amounts of synthetic compounds reported for both oils, such as BHT (41.9%), methyl 
 <italic>p</italic>-vinylbenzoate (9.68%), and diethyl phthalate (1.2%) [
 <xref rid="B12-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some synthetic compounds were also found in both 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> oils, such as 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (2.4%–3.1%) and diisobutyl phthalate (0.7%), but not to the same extent as was reported for 
 <italic>A. marina</italic>. The presence of these substances in the essential oils might be related to the constant exposure of mangrove plants to sea and river pollutants. It is not usual to detect these amounts of synthetic compounds in essential oils from inland plants, even when collected close to big cities as São Paulo. For example, the essential oil 
 <italic>from Chromolaena laevigata</italic> (Lam.) R.M.King &amp; H.Rob, collected at the São Paulo Botanical Gardens, consisted only of natural compounds [
