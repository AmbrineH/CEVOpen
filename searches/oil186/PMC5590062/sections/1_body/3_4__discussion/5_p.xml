<p>The antimicrobial assay showed that both essential oils were not able to completely inhibit the growth in concentrations up to 217 Î¼g/mL for all tested microorganisms. The highest activity was achieved against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with 66.8 and 74.5 for oils 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, respectively. This result can be interesting because, firstly, Gram-negative organisms possess an outer cell membrane impeding the diffusion of the hydrophobic essential oil constituents into the cell. Secondly, this is interesting to note because 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can also become resistant to certain antibiotics due to its ability to form biofilm, which consists of bacterial communities embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix [
