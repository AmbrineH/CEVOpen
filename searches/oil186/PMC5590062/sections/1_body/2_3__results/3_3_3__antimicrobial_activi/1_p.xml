<p>The antimicrobial activities of the essential oils from the leaves of both 
 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> specimens were evaluated against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>A. brasiliensis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The growth inhibitions obtained for both oils, at the highest dose tested (217 Âµg/mL), are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00026-t003">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was the most sensitive organism for both oils, presenting the highest growth inhibition.
