 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> leaves were 0.0035% for the specimen collected at the Estação Ecológica Jureia-Itatins (
 <bold>1</bold>) and 0.0085% for that collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso (
 <bold>2</bold>). The GC-MS analysis indicated that the oils were composed of at least 27 compounds, of which 25 were identified. The compounds, their retention indices, and the percentage of each constituent for both essential oils are listed in
