<p>Qualitative analysis of essential oils from the leaves of 
 <italic>A. schacueriana</italic> collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso and Estação Ecológica da Jureia-Itatins were performed in an Agilent6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) interfaced with a 5973 series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm) (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatography conditions were as follows; over temperature: initially held at 40 °C for 1 min and subsequently increased to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature: 250 °C, electron ionization: 70 eV. The components were identified by comparing retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes) and mass spectra with those reported in the literature [
