 <italic>A. schaueriana</italic> leaves collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso (218.92 g) and Estação Ecológica Jureia-Itatins (241.12 g) were pooled and dried in a circulating air oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The essential oil was obtained from each population pool by hydrodistillation for 4 h in a 
 <italic>Clevenger</italic>-type apparatus. The essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a glass flask at −22 °C until analysis by GC-MS. The yields were calculated based on the dry weight of each plant.
