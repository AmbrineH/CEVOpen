<p>The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by the 2.2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The essential oil solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 435–13.60 µg/mL in a microplate well (sample), pure methanol (blank), and DPPH solution (202.88 µmol, control) were transferred to a 96-well microplate (Corning, New York, NY, USA). The sample solubilized in methanol without DPPH was used as a blank sample. The plate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the absorbance was read at the wavelength of 520 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The radical scavenging capacity (expressed as percentage) was calculated as the rate between [(Abs control − Abs blank) − (Abs sample − Abs blank sample)/(Abs control − Abs blank)] × 100. Quercetin was employed as a positive control. The amount of extract required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The data were compared by one-way Anova, followed by Tukey’s test, representing the mean and confidence interval (CI
 <sub>95</sub>) for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3. The results were considered statistically different when 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
