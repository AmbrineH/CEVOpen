<p class="p">Antifungal activity was assessed against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> (ATCC 16404) and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231), and antibacterial activity was evaluated against one model of Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), and two models of Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027) and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 8739). Microdilution in broth was the method used to determine the antimicrobial activity. The growth inhibitions were determined by broth microdilution method according to the protocols of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [

Microorganisms were incubated for 48 h at 28 °C on SDA (for the yeast and fungi) or for 24 h at 37 °C on TSA (for the bacteria). Following incubation, a suspension of the microorganism was prepared and standardized in saline solution (0.9%) for subsequent inoculation into liquid culture medium (SDB for the yeast and fungi; TSB for the bacteria) to give a final concentration of 2 × 10

After incubation, the growth inhibition was measured by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 630 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA); except for 
 <italic class="italic">A. brasiliensis</italic>, where the growth was evaluated only visually. Growth inhibitions (%) were determined for samples that inhibited the growth of the microorganism in the microplate well test.
