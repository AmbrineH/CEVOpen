   <span class="italic">Avicennia schaueriana</span> Stapf &amp; Leechm (Acanthaceae) leaves were collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso, São Paulo, Brazil (23°03’ to 25°19’ S and 47°53’ to 48°30’ W) and at Estação Ecológica Jureia-Itatins, São Paulo, Brazil (24°17’ to 24°35’ S and 47°00’ to 47°31’ W), from five individual plants in each location. The botanical identity was confirmed by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, Brazil). The voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, Brazil, with vouchers RSCabral 16-SP for the plant collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso and RSCabral 46 for the one collected at Estação Ecológica Jureia-Itatins.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">A. schaueriana</span> leaves collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso (218.92 g) and Estação Ecológica Jureia-Itatins (241.12 g) were pooled and dried in a circulating air oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The essential oil was obtained from each population pool by hydrodistillation for 4 h in a 
   <span class="italic">Clevenger</span>-type apparatus. The essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a glass flask at −22 °C until analysis by GC-MS. The yields were calculated based on the dry weight of each plant.

   <span class="italic">A. schacueriana</span> collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso and Estação Ecológica da Jureia-Itatins were performed in an Agilent6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) interfaced with a 5973 series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm) (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatography conditions were as follows; over temperature: initially held at 40 °C for 1 min and subsequently increased to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature: 250 °C, electron ionization: 70 eV. The components were identified by comparing retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes) and mass spectra with those reported in the literature [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by the 2.2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The essential oil solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 435–13.60 µg/mL in a microplate well (sample), pure methanol (blank), and DPPH solution (202.88 µmol, control) were transferred to a 96-well microplate (Corning, New York, NY, USA). The sample solubilized in methanol without DPPH was used as a blank sample. The plate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the absorbance was read at the wavelength of 520 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The radical scavenging capacity (expressed as percentage) was calculated as the rate between [(Abs control − Abs blank) − (Abs sample − Abs blank sample)/(Abs control − Abs blank)] × 100. Quercetin was employed as a positive control. The amount of extract required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>). The data were compared by one-way Anova, followed by Tukey’s test, representing the mean and confidence interval (CI
   <sub>95</sub>) for 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 3. The results were considered statistically different when

   <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (ATCC 9027) and

Microorganisms were incubated for 48 h at 28 °C on SDA (for the yeast and fungi) or for 24 h at 37 °C on TSA (for the bacteria). Following incubation, a suspension of the microorganism was prepared and standardized in saline solution (0.9%) for subsequent inoculation into liquid culture medium (SDB for the yeast and fungi; TSB for the bacteria) to give a final concentration of 2 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in each well of the microplate. Samples of the essential oil of each plant collected were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide:methanol 1:1 (
   <span class="italic">v</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span>) to give a final concentration of 217 μg/mL in each microplate well. After incubation, the growth inhibition was measured by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 630 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA); except for 
   <span class="italic">A. brasiliensis</span>, where the growth was evaluated only visually. Growth inhibitions (%) were determined for samples that inhibited the growth of the microorganism in the microplate well test.
