 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antifungal activity was assessed against 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus brasiliensis</span> (ATCC 16404) and 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> (ATCC 10231), and antibacterial activity was evaluated against one model of Gram-positive bacteria, 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC 6538), and two models of Gram-negative bacteria, 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (ATCC 9027) and 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC 8739). Microdilution in broth was the method used to determine the antimicrobial activity. The growth inhibitions were determined by broth microdilution method according to the protocols of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [

  <a rid="B17-medicines-04-00026" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-medicines-04-00026">17</a>]. Microorganisms were incubated for 48 h at 28 °C on SDA (for the yeast and fungi) or for 24 h at 37 °C on TSA (for the bacteria). Following incubation, a suspension of the microorganism was prepared and standardized in saline solution (0.9%) for subsequent inoculation into liquid culture medium (SDB for the yeast and fungi; TSB for the bacteria) to give a final concentration of 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in each well of the microplate. Samples of the essential oil of each plant collected were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide:methanol 1:1 (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) to give a final concentration of 217 μg/mL in each microplate well. After incubation, the growth inhibition was measured by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 630 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA); except for 
  <span class="italic">A. brasiliensis</span>, where the growth was evaluated only visually. Growth inhibitions (%) were determined for samples that inhibited the growth of the microorganism in the microplate well test.
