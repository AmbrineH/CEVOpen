 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of the DWH oil spill are gradually fading, hence the research on its impacts on indigenous microbial communities is decreasing. However, current literatures adequately address the approaches for investigating the composition and activity of microbial communities. In this review, we summarized various culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques applied in the study of microbes after the DWH oil spill. Conventional methods, such as pure culture and classical molecular biological methods (e.g., Clone Library, TRFLP, TGGE/DGGE, and RT-qPCR), provide qualitative impressions about the functional bacteria conducting biodegradation. Prevalent microbiological molecular techniques (e.g., microarrays, NGS, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-cell sequencing) have also generated a great amount data on bacterial composition and predicted potential pathways for hydrocarbon degradation. For future investigation, we recommend an informed application of prevalent NGS-based genomic technologies and microbial network reconstruction in conjunction with conventional culture-dependent approaches. Especially, integrated application of different approaches could afford a more comprehensive view of indigenous bacterial communities and their potential functions in polluted sites.</p>
