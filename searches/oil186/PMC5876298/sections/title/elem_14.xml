  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The culture-dependent and culture-independent methods discussed in this review can partially reveal the responses of indigenous bacterial communities to the DWH oil spill, whereas a full map of bacterial community composition and activity cannot be described by a single method (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Biodegradation efficiency and metabolite mechanisms can be adequately researched by obtaining pure cultures of bacterial strains. However, the uncultivability of bacteria from marine environments (&gt;99% of microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory Kaeberlein et al., 
   <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">2002</a>) is a dramatic obstacle for revealing the real executors of 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> biodegradation. The 16S rRNA gene-based culture-independent methods, including DGGE, clone libraries, and NGS, can be comprehensively used to identify the bacterial composition in oil spill sites, but these methods provide limited information on metabolism of bacterial communities. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics based on NGS can provide detailed information on a broad overview of the metabolic potentiality of bacterial communities in the polluted environment at the DNA and RNA levels, respectively. Nevertheless, these two meta-omics techniques provide limited information on the specificity of a metabolic process or the differences due to physiological or environmental conditions. The amplification bias is another obstacle in the application of these two meta-omics techniques (Lasken, 
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">2012</a>). Single-cell sequencing can provide genomic information on uncultivable bacteria, and it can help predict the potential pathways of biodegradation performed by the studied cell. However, single cell DNA/RNA sequences usually have high amplification bias. This is usually caused by some genomic regions being amplified more than others (Ning et al., 
   <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">2014</a>). Furthermore, analysis of single cell sequencing data always needs support from meta-omics data for additional analysis. In addition, the determination of metabolic products is also necessary for unraveling of environmental PAH biodegradation processes and also to describe microbial interactions effecting the biodegradation process (Vila et al., 
   <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">2015</a>). Therefore, a combination of different approaches is necessary for a full understanding of the composition and activity of bacterial communities. Application of integrated approaches could: (1) deeply describe the components of a complex community, including existing organisms, functions, and their activities at a given time point (Zimmerman et al., 
   <a rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" href="#B118">2014</a>); (2) identify key players, sometimes diverse, rare taxa instead of majority groups (Kleindienst et al., 
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">2016</a>); (3) reveal more complicated microbial interactions by determining the connections of both cultured and currently uncultured microorganisms (Abraham, 
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2014</a>); (4) predict functions of the whole community with the help of different bioinformatic tools which can improve prevention and remediation of potential perturbations (Ivshina et al., 
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">2015</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first microbial study after the oil spill, Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2010</a>) applied the PhyloChip 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) microarray and clone library to study the bacterial community composition in the oil plume. The authors successfully isolated oil-degrading bacteria by a convenient cultivation method. Additionally, multivariate analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) was applied in this study to analyze the composition of bacterial communities by identifying different assemblages of PLFA. Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2012</a>) investigated the role of the indigenous microbial community by combining different molecular methods including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-cell genomics. These methods based on NGS are currently prevalent in the field of microbial ecology, and they can provide abundant information for thorough analysis of the composition and behavior of the bacterial communities.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis based on SIP is a typical strategy for bacterial community study that combines culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. First, cultivation is necessary to obtain molecular markers (DNA, RNA, proteins, or PLFA) that are labeled with a stable isotopic element (e.g., 
   <span class="sup">13</span>C, 
   <span class="sup">15</span>N, and 
   <span class="sup">18</span>O). The labeled molecular markers can then be analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (clone library or NGS), metagenomic analysis, metatranscriptomic analysis, and mass spectrometer (MS) analysis. These methods can be used to generate data to reveal the bacterial community and activity. SIP analysis is a powerful tool for linking microbial species and metabolism (Dumont and Murrell, 
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2005</a>). By using DNA-SIP in combination with 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and T-RFLP analysis, Redmond and Valentine (
   <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2011</a>) demonstrated that bacteria in the genus 
   <span class="italic">Colwellia</span> were active in ethane and propane oxidation in oil polluted deep-sea water plumes. Mason et al. (
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2014b</a>) used surface sediments polluted by the DWH oil spill and 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C-labeled hydrocarbons to perform mineralization experiments. They successfully found that the key hydrocarbon degradation pathway by sediment microbes was as follows: propylene glycol, dodecane, toluene, and phenanthrene. By monitoring the biodegradation efficiency of 
   <span class="sup">13</span>C-labeled different hydrocarbons (aliphatic and aromatic), Gutierrez et al. (
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2013</a>) applied 16S rRNA gene-based NGS and qPCR detection to reveal the activity of bacterial communities. The results indicated that the different bacterial phyla were responsible for the degradation of different hydrocarbons. For instance, bacteria in the genera 
   <span class="italic">Alcanivorax</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Marinobacter</span> were found to be enriched in the experimental setups with the addition of aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas 
   <span class="italic">Alteromonas, Cycloclasticus</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Colwellia</span> dominated the experimental setups supplemented with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to illustrate the cooperation of different bacteria?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A global perspective calls for a deep understanding of the composition and activity of the bacterial communities in a relevant environmental context (Faust and Raes, 
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">2012</a>). We should not only focus on functional bacterial communities that are directly degrading pollutants, but also on the other biological components involved in the biodegradation or bioremediation processes via chemical and biological interactions (Head et al., 
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2006</a>). For instance, microorganisms without oil-degrading capability could also be involved in the biodegradation process by consuming the metabolites released by oil-degrading bacteria. Some non-oil-degrading microorganisms can either provide limiting nutrients or produce surfactant or emulsification of oil and water for the primary oil degraders (Head et al., 
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2006</a>). Reconstructing the microbial network might be an efficient method for investigating the complicated interactions among indigenous bacteria. Zhou et al. (
   <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">2010</a>; 
   <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">2011</a>) developed a random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework to reconstruct functional molecular ecological networks based on metagenomics and genechip data. This approach was applied to evaluate the responses of bacterial communities under long-term, free-air CO
   <sub>2</sub> enrichment (Zhou et al., 
   <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">2010</a>, 
   <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">2011</a>). The reconstructed networks revealed dramatic changes in the interactions among different phylogenetic groups/populations. The changes in network structure were significantly correlated with nutrient contents. In our previous study, we investigated the responses and activities of bacterial communities under stresses from hydrocarbons with different structures by reconstructing microbial networks and predicting the individual roles of functional bacteria in the key nodes of the networks. The interactions of different bacteria in the networks helped microbes co-acclimate to the changing environment and initiate biodegradation (Wang et al., 
   <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">2016</a>). In all, the microbial networks can provide additional information besides the composition of bacterial communities. Most importantly, the key functional bacterial phyla, including the degrading conductor and tightly associated non-degrading bacteria, could be identified (key nodes in the network). Based on this information, the bacterial communities in polluted sites can be manipulated for enhancing the abundances of beneficial species and functions for bioremediation (Faust and Raes, 
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">2012</a>). The key strategies for applications based on network reconstruction and analysis is engineering a whole community instead of a single species (Curtis et al., 
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2003</a>; Dunham, 
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2007</a>).
