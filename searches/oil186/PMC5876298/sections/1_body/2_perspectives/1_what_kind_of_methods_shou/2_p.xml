<p class="p">In the first microbial study after the oil spill, Mason et al. (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) applied the PhyloChip 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) microarray and clone library to study the bacterial community composition in the oil plume. The authors successfully isolated oil-degrading bacteria by a convenient cultivation method. Additionally, multivariate analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) was applied in this study to analyze the composition of bacterial communities by identifying different assemblages of PLFA. Mason et al. (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) investigated the role of the indigenous microbial community by combining different molecular methods including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-cell genomics. These methods based on NGS are currently prevalent in the field of microbial ecology, and they can provide abundant information for thorough analysis of the composition and behavior of the bacterial communities.
