<p>The DWH oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. The spill lasted for approximately 84 d, which was recorded the largest oil spill in United States to date (Crone and Tolstoy, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The accident yielded an unremitting flow of oil that ultimately totaled 4.9 million barrels (779 million liters, Â±10%) (Lehr et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). An oil plume that stretched for more than 35 km was observed (Camilli et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hazen et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Crude oils are composed of thousands of chemicals, which mainly include saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and the more polar, non-hydrocarbon components in resins and asphaltenes (Head et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). These four main components have different levels of toxicity to marine organisms and vary in proportion with different types of crude oil. Exposure to large amounts of oil in marine environments can cause significant negative impacts on resident organisms and human health (Grattan et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Oil spills can lead to acute and chronic environmental damage, and they can have toxic effects on the aquatic ecosystems (Campagna et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hu et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Whitehead et al.,
