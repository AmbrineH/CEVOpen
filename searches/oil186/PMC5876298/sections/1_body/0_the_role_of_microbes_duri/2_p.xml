<p>By 20 August 2010, 78% of the oil from the DWH oil spill was disposed by either human intervention (direct recovery, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> burning, skimming, and dispersal) or natural processes (naturally dispersed, evaporated, and dissolved) (Ramseur, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), whereas the fate of the remaining 22% of the oil spill was uncertain. Microorganisms, especially bacteria, are believed to act as the key players in bioremediation of residual oil (Head et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The ability to degrade hydrocarbon components of crude oil has been widely detected among different bacteria (Head et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Considering the large amount of oil released from the DWH oil spill and specific features of the rig (the broken riser pipe was at a depth of 1,500 m below the surface), the responses and roles of bacteria following the spill have drawn significant attention from scientists (Kimes et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Results from different research groups indicated that indigenous bacterial communities in different habitats (seawater, deep-sea sediment, marshes, and beach sands) responded rapidly to the spilled oil and that some bacterial groups might play significant roles in reducing the environmental contamination (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Moreover, sunlight and temperature were found to be the key factors which influenced the composition of bacterial communities and selected for oil-degrading bacteria in surface water and bottom water, respectively (Bacosa et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
