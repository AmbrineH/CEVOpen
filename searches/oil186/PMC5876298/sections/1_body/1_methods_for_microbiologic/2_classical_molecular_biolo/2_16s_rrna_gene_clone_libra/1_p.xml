<p>The 16S rRNA gene is well-known as a marker gene for the reconstruction of prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) phylogenies and for the investigation of microbial diversity (Woese and Fox, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Klindworth et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The construction of clone libraries based on 16S rRNA genes has extensively been used to investigate bacterial communities until the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS). 16S rRNA gene-based clone library analysis provides a useful, though somewhat limited, tool for capturing the diversity and composition of bacterial communities (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Schäfer et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the literature on the DWH oil spill, 16S rRNA gene-based clone library analysis was one of the most popular techniques for investigating microbial communities. Several studies using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the microbial community responses to the contamination caused by the deep-sea plumes of hydrocarbons. These communities exhibited significant differences in different habitats (plume and non-plume water, surface and deep-sea water, sediments, and beach sands; see Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and presented dramatic changes over the duration of the spill (Hazen et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Valentine et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kessler et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Redmond and Valentine, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For instance, Hazen et al. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) identified members of the order 
 <italic>Oceanospirillales</italic> in the γ
 <italic>-Proteobacteria</italic> class as dominant in deep-sea plumes. 
 <italic>Oceanospirillales</italic> were not detected in most of the plume samples in June, while 
 <italic>Cycloclasticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Colwellia</italic> were dominant (more than 95% of the sequences). This indicates that the DWH 
 <italic>Oceanospirillales</italic> bloomed initially, followed by 
 <italic>Colwellia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cycloclasticus</italic> (Redmond and Valentine, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
