<p>The majority (&gt;99%) of bacterioplankton in marine environments remains largely recalcitrant to cultivation. Applications of molecular biological methods such as 16S rRNA clone library, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), fluorescence 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are useful techniques in investigating the composition and potential functions of indigenous bacterial communities in a specific environment.
