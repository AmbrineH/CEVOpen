<p class="p">Traditional methods, such as isolation and purification of bacterial strains from various environments are essential as exemplified in microbiological studies of the DWH spill. The isolation of microbes in pure culture can provide valuable information on the functions, metabolic pathways, and physiological characteristics of bacteria that respond to an oil spill. During the DWH spill, different bacterial strains (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Alcanivorax, Alteromonas, Cycloclasticus, Halomonas, Marinobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoalteromonas</italic>) with hydrocarbon-degrading abilities were isolated from surface slicks and deep oil plumes (Gutierrez et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). With the addition of oil (or the oil dispersant Corexit) as the sole carbon source, BÃ¦lum et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) successfully isolated one hydrocarbon-degrading strain (belonging to the family 
 <italic class="italic">Colwelliaceae</italic>), which were the dominant microorganism in the oil plume.
