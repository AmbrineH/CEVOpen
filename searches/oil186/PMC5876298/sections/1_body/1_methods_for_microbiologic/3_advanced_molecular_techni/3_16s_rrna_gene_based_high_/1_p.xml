<p>The 16S rRNA gene has been applied to study the diversity of bacterial communities via cultivation, cloning, T-RFLP, and other traditional microbiological approaches. While the information generated from these approaches can preliminarily illustrate the composition of bacterial communities, their application has been restricted by limited information, high cost, and omission of “rare biospheres.” The NGS techniques, e.g., Roche's 454 GS20 pyrosequencing (Margulies et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), Illumina Hiseq/Miseq sequencing (Bennett, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), ion torrent sequencing (Rothberg et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and “single-molecule real-time” (SMRT) sequencing (Eid et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), allowed the generation of massive data sets at a much lower cost (Medini et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Armougom and Raoult, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Klindworth et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
