<p>DNA microarrays are collections of microscopic DNA spots, representing single target genes, that are attached to a chemical matrix and arrayed on a solid surface. By DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization, DNA microarrays can provide qualitative or quantitative measurements of microbial diversity and functional gene expression (Loy et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Bodrossy et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). This method has been used for nearly 20 years and has experienced several generations of improvement. By hybridizing target genes with probes attached to a specific microchip, DNA microarrays can provide a deep understanding of indigenous microbial communities because of its advantages of specificity, sensitivity, quantitative analysis, and high-throughput methods (Gentry et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Two different DNA microarray methods (PhyloChip and GeoChip) have been extensively used in the field of environmental microbiology. PhyloChip can be used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities, while the GeoChip method can be used to study the activity of functional microbes by targeting functional genes. These two different microarrays can be used together to study and compare microbial communities from different treatments or environments.
