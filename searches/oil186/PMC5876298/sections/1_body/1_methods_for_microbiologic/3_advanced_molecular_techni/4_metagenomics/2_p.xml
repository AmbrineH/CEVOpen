<p>Before NGS became prevalent, metagenomic analysis based on shotgun sequencing data was constrained by the limited data on individual genomes and environmental genetic data. The high-throughput, short runtime, and low-cost attributes of NGS have altered our overview of microbial metagenomics (Scholz et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). By applying metagenomic analysis, (Mason et al. (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>)) investigated the responses of bacterial communities in deep sea oil plumes and sediment. Metagenomic data from these two studies demonstrated that the indigenous microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service of oil remediation in the Gulf of Mexico. Functional genes encoding for the degradation of aliphatic and simple aromatics hydrocarbon were significantly enriched after the oil spill. Nevertheless, no dramatic changes were found in the abundance of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs. This indicated that recalcitrant compounds could not be actively degraded at the sampling time and that these compounds might need a longer period for biodegradation. Another study based on metagenomic analysis found that a greater number of δ
 <italic>-proteobacteria</italic> and anaerobic functional genes were present in sediments closer to the DWH blowout site, which indicated that δ
 <italic>-proteobacteria</italic> might play a dominant role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Kimes et al.,
