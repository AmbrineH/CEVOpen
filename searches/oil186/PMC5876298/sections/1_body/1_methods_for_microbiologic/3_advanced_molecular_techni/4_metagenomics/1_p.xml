<p>Metagenomics is a genetic analysis aimed at studying the genetic composition and community structure of microorganisms by directly analyzing DNA mixtures from microbial communities in different environmental samples (Warnecke and Hess, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Coyotzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Metagenomic approaches have revolutionized our ability to explore the microbial world by producing results that conventional cloning and sequencing methods have not been able to achieve (Gutierrez, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 16S rRNA gene based analysis mainly characterize a bacterial community by defining its composition, succession and the relative abundance of different groups, while metagenomics analysis can afford useful metabolic information for investigating microbe functions (Scholz et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is helpful to fully understand uncultured microbes and provide a complete understanding of microbial activity at community levels. Specifically, metagenomic approaches enable a mechanistic understanding of the bioremediating processes and can provide some hints for optimizing the efficiency of bioremediation (Techtmann and Hazen, 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For instance, by analyzing metagenomic sequence data, some overlooked but important functional executor and functional genes can be explored (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Campe√£o et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
