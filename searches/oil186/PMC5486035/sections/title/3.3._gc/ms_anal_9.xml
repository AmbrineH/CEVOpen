 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on Agilent gas chromatograph, Model 7890A, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Analytical conditions were HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm coated with 5% phenyl methyl silicone, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane, 0.25 µm film thickness) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). Injection was done in split mode (1:60), injected volume was 1 µL (10% essential oil/CH
  <sub>2</sub>Cl

  <span class="italic">v</span>), and the injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min, then increased to 240 °C at 5 °C/min and held at 240 °C for 5 min. Percentages of compounds were determined from their peak areas in the GC-FID profiles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was carried out on the same instrument described above coupled with an Agilent 5975C mass detector (Santa Clara, CA, USA), with the same column and the same operative conditions used for the analytical GC. We adjusted the ionization voltage to 70 eV, the electron multiplier to 900 V, and the ion source temperature to 230 °C. Mass spectra data were acquired in the scan mode in an 
  <span class="italic">m</span>/
  <span class="italic">z</span> range of 40–300. The compounds were identified based on: their GC retention index (relative to C9–C22 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes on the HP-5MS column), values reported in the literature, the computer matching of their mass spectral data with those of the MS library (NIST 08), the comparison of their MS fragmentation patterns with those reported in literature, and, whenever possible, the co-injection with authentic standards (α-Pinene, 2-Carene, 3-Carene, β-Myrcene and 
  <span class="sc">d</span>-limonene).
