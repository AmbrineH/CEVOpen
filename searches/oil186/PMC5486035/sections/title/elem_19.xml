  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy volunteers, who provided written medical histories through a standardized questionnaire and had not taken anti-inflammatory medication or nutritional supplements. Blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of balanced salt solution, layered over Histopaque-1077 in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400× 
   <span class="italic">g</span> for 30–40 min at 25 °C. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was removed with a pipette and washed by centrifugation. The PBMCs were passed through a Percoll gradient according to Repnik et al. [

Lymphocytes (viability &gt; 90%) were counted on a haemocytometer and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G and streptomycin.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the cytotoxicity assay, cells (1 × 10
   <span class="sup">5</span>/mL) were incubated in complete medium without or with 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 µg/mL of sample solution for 24 h in the presence of 100 µM tert-butyl hydroperoxide (
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH). The stock solution of HEO in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were conveniently diluted with phosphate saline buffer to maintain the concentration of the DMSO below 0.1% in the reaction mixture. Parallel controls were performed without 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH and in the presence of the final concentrations of HEO. After incubation, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Briefly, an aliquot of the cell suspension was diluted 1:1 (
   <span class="italic">v</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span>) with 0.4% trypan blue and the cells were counted using a haemocytometer. Results were expressed as the percentage of viable or dead cells (ratio of unstained or stained cells to the total number of cells, respectively). Cytotoxicity was also measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells into culture medium and expressed as a percentage of total cellular activity. LDH activity in the medium was determined using a commercially available kit from BioSystems S.A (Barcelona, Spain) and expressed as a function of the total amount of the enzyme present in the 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH-no treated cells obtained after total cell lysis by sonication. At the concentration tested, HEO does not show any interference with the LDH assay.
