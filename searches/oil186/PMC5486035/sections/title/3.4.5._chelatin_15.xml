 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fe
  <span class="sup">2+</span> chelating capacity was evaluated as described by Smeriglio et al. [
  <a rid="B37-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijms-18-01212">37</a>] with some modifications. Briefly, 25 µL of FeCl
  <sub>2</sub>∙4H
  <sub>2</sub>O solution (1.8 mM) was added to 50 µL of sample solution (range 60–7.5 µg/mL) and incubated at RT for 5 min. Following, 50 µL of a ferrozine solution (4 mM) was added to the reaction mixture, and the sample volume was diluted to 1.5 mL with deionized water. After that, the mixture was vortexed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was read at 562 nm using an UV/VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601). The inhibition (%) of Fe
