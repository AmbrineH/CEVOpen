 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants producing essential oils represent a large part of natural flora and an important resource in various fields such as the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries, thanks to their flavour, fragrance, and biological activities [
  <a rid="B1-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijms-18-01212">1</a>]. Essential oils are a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons arising from the isoprenoid pathways and secreted by glandular trichomes disseminated mainly onto the surface of plant organs; therefore, they have a pivotal role in the growth and colonization of plants, conferring colour and scent to reproductive organs, attracting pollinators and favouring seed dispersal [
  <a rid="B2-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijms-18-01212">2</a>]. Furthermore, they seem to mediate the plant relationship with abiotic (e.g., light, temperature, and so on) and biotic factors, playing a defensive role against herbivores, harmful insects, and microbial pathogens [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More than 250 types of essential oils are commercialized annually on the international market, some of which are employed in aromatherapy and for the treatment of several diseases including cardiovascular and neurological diseases, diabetes, and cancer [
  <a rid="B1-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijms-18-01212">1</a>]. Moreover, the antimicrobial properties of essential oils have been widely recognized [

  <a rid="B6-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijms-18-01212">6</a>] thanks to several studies which showed a synergistic effect of several components of essential oils against various human pathogens [
  <a rid="B1-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijms-18-01212">1</a>]. Essential oils have been used since ancient times, in folk medicine throughout the world, to preserve a good health status [

  <a rid="B9-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijms-18-01212">9</a>]. Presently, several properties and therapeutic effects have been ascribed to essential oils such as antibiotic, rubefacient, anaesthetic, antispasmodic, balmy-expectorant, repellent, carminative, as well as beneficial effects on the central and peripheral nervous system [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, antimicrobial drug resistance has brought researchers to evaluate novel antimicrobial lead molecules to treat various human pathogens. Synthetic drugs have often failed this goal, if not for a lack of efficacy, because of the greater risk to which the patient was exposed (acute and chronic toxicity and environmental hazard potential), leading the researchers to better explore natural remedies [
  <a rid="B1-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijms-18-01212">1</a>]. From this point of view, the study of essential oils has undergone a remarkable growth, and many new plants producing essential oil have been evaluated [
  <a rid="B16-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijms-18-01212">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijms-18-01212">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijms-18-01212">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijms-18-01212">19</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijms-18-01212">20</a>]. Among these, the authors decided to put their attention on 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> L., a nut tree that belongs to the Anacardiaceae family [
  <a rid="B21-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijms-18-01212">21</a>] cultivated in Iran, Turkey, the USA, Syria, Italy, Tunisia, and Greece.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Italy, pistachio crops are typically Sicilian, mainly grown in the territory of Bronte (CT), situated on the eastern part of Sicily and characterized by lava-rich soils and very particular climatic conditions [
  <a rid="B21-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijms-18-01212">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijms-18-01212">22</a>] which confer to the pistachio nuts superior organoleptic and nutritional characteristics. For this reason, the European Union recognized the variety Bronte as a D.O.P. (Protected Designation of Origin) product. Pistachio nuts are considered a rich source of many important biofunctional compounds that are useful for the human diet and known for their various pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and anti-nociceptive activities [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-01212">23</a>]. Recently, we analysed and described the nutraceutical, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activity of crude phenols and anthocyanins-rich extracts derived from ripe pistachio hulls (
  <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> L., variety Bronte), a by-product of the pistachio industry [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-01212">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-01212">24</a>]. These studies managed to identify this matrix as a promising source of healthy compounds. The results obtained highlighted antioxidant and cytoprotective properties directly correlated to the high total phenol content, in particular flavonols, phenolic acid, and flavan-3-ols and, among anthocyanins, to the high content of cyanidyn-3-
  <span class="italic">O</span>-galactoside [
  <a rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijms-18-01212">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-18-01212">24</a>]. The presence of these compounds makes pistachio hulls an attractive source of health-promoting compounds, which are potentially helpful against several oxidative stress-related diseases.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the well-known ethnopharmacological relevance of some essential oils derived from some species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia</span> (
  <span class="italic">P. atlantica</span> Desf and 
  <span class="italic">P. integerrima</span> J.L. Stewart ex Brandis) against several diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tract [

  <a rid="B28-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijms-18-01212">28</a>], no literature data concerning the hull essential oil composition and biological properties of 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia vera</span> L., variety Bronte, are today available.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having considered the above, we have for the first time performed, a phytochemical characterization of ripe pistachio hull essential oil followed by the evaluation of antioxidant, cytoprotective, and antiperoxidative properties through cell-free and cell-based assays. The antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative standard and clinical bacterial has also been investigated.</p>
