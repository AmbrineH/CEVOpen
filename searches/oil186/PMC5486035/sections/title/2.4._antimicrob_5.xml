 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) values of HEO against the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and clinical isolates tested bacteria are reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01212-t002" href="#ijms-18-01212-t002">Table 2</a>. Results of negative controls indicated the complete absence of inhibition of all the strains tested (data not shown). A concentration of 7.11 mg/mL inhibited the growth of all the tested strains with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> ATCC 9027. The same concentration was found to be bactericidal against all strains. Several studies have previously demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils [

The compound 4-carene, also identified amongst the main constituents of the Iranian Cymbobogon Olivieri essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast

  <span class="italic">Ferula tunetana</span> Pomel ex Batt. containing α-pinene (39.8%) was also found active against 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> LT2 DT104 and
