  <a rid="B37-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijms-18-01212">37</a>]. Briefly, the reaction mixture (4.3 mM potassium persulfate and 1.7 mM ABTS solution 1:5, 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) was incubated for 12–16 h in the dark at room temperature, and was diluted, before use, with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in order to obtain an absorbance at 734 nm of 0.7 ± 0.02. Fifty microliters (50 µL) of sample solution (range 300–50 µg/mL) was added to 1 mL of reaction mixture and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 6 min; the absorbance was then recorded at 734 nm using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601). The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).
