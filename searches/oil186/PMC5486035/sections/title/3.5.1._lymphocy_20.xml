 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy volunteers, who provided written medical histories through a standardized questionnaire and had not taken anti-inflammatory medication or nutritional supplements. Blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of balanced salt solution, layered over Histopaque-1077 in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400× 
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 30–40 min at 25 °C. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was removed with a pipette and washed by centrifugation. The PBMCs were passed through a Percoll gradient according to Repnik et al. [

Lymphocytes (viability &gt; 90%) were counted on a haemocytometer and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G and streptomycin.
