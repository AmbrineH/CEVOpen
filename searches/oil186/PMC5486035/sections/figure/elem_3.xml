  <p>Cytoprotective effects of HEO on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH) treated lymphocytes. Lymphocytes plus 100 μM of 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH were incubated for 24 h in the absence (b) or in the presence of 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 μg/mL of essential oil (c–l, respectively). Lymphocytes incubated under the same experimental condition without 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-BOOH (a). Cell vitality and integrity were analysed by trypan blue staining (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (
   <span class="bold">B</span>). The asterisks (**) indicate significant differences (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). Each value represents mean ± SD (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 3).
