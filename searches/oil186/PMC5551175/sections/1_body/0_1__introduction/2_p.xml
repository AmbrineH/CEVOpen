<p>Trypanosomiasis is transmitted by the bite of insects from the 
 <italic>Glossina</italic> spp. (Glossinidae) and is fatal in humans, if untreated. While taking a blood meal, infected 
 <italic>Glossina</italic> flies can spread extracellular protozoans from the species 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei.</italic> There are three morphologically indistinguishable subspecies of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The subspecies 
 <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> is responsible for a chronic form of the human disease, while 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> causes an acute form, which more rapidly leads to death. Both subspecies are infective to humans, whereas 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> is only infective to animals. During the early stage of the disease or the hemolymphatic phase, the parasite is restricted to the blood and lymph, and, after months or years, it invades the central nervous system, resulting in various neurological symptoms, including sleeping disturbance [
