<p>The chemical composition of the essential oils hydrodistilled from the six Cameroonian medicinal and aromatic plants is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t001">Table 1</xref>. In the essential oil obtained from neem leaves, a total of thirteen components were identified, accounting for 98.3% of the total composition. The oil was almost entirely composed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.4%), with germacrene B (74.0%) and γ-elemene (18.3%) as the predominant components. The minor constituents were (

Neem trees have been largely investigated for the oil obtained by mechanical pressure or solvent extraction from their seeds. Earlier, El-Hawary et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] studied the composition of Egyptian neem leaves, reporting β-elemene (33.39%), γ-elemene (9.89%), germacrene D (9.72%), caryophyllene (6.8%), and bicyclogermacrene (5.23%) as the major compounds, while Dastan et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found γ-elemene (20.8%), germacrene B (20.3%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene (13.5%), hexadecanal (12.8%), and methyl linoleate (10.5%) as the major compounds in neem leaf oil from Iran.
