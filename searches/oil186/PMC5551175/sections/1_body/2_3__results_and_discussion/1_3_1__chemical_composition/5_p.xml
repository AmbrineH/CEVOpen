<p>In the essential oil of 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic> seeds, a total of forty-nine volatile components were identified, accounting for 76.0% of the oilâ€™s composition. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant constituents (50.6%), with geraniol (18.2%), terpinen-4-ol (7.5%), linalool (4.0%), and umbellulone (3.8%) as the most representative compounds. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes gave a lower contribution (12.1%), with none of the identified components exceeding 1.8%. Among other components occurring in the oil, it is worth noting the presence of ligustrazin (5.1%), elemicin (3.0%), and decanoic acid (2.8%). To our knowledge, no previous research has reported the chemical composition of 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic> seed essential oil.
