<p>Based on the chemical analysis performed, they exhibited different chemical profiles characterized by diverse functionalized groups such as monoterpene hydrocarbons (African cardamom), oxygenated monoterpenes (
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic> and 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
 <italic>A. indica</italic>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic>), and phenylpropanoids (
 <italic>C. anisata</italic>). In this context, the main aim of our work was to identify the chemical scaffolds of possible natural lead compounds against trypanosomiasis.
