<p>The toxicity of monoterpene hydrocarbons against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> can be attributed to the high hydrophobicity of this class of compounds, which are able to easily cross the cell membrane, causing the destabilization of phospholipid bilayers and the alteration of their permeability, leading to cell damage and death [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Among these compounds, the most abundant was sabinene (43.9%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</xref>) which showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> of 5.96 µg/mL, which is close to that of the African cardamom essential oil (7.65 µg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</xref>). Another component of this oil with detectable antitrypanosomal activity was β-pinene, showing an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 11.4 µg/mL. The antitrypanosomal activity of sabinene was already reported in a previous study, although its mechanism of action on the protozoal cell has not been elucidated [
