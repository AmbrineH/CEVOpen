 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> as well as

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which exhibited good inhibitory properties on 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 8.25 µg/mL). However, the content of this component is only 6.3% in 
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> and can therefore not explain the good activity of this essential oil. It is rather tricyclic sesquiterpenes that are the major constituent. This is the first report documenting the antitrypanosomal activity of the tricyclic sesquiterpenes-containing 
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> essential oil. The latter was a rich source of compounds such as silphiperfol-6-ene, presilphiperfolan-8-ol, presilphiperfol-7-ene, and cameroonan-7-α-l with an unusual skeleton (

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To date, these compounds have not been biologically investigated. Previously, the tricyclic sesquiterpene ledol was suggested to be responsible for the trypanocidal properties of
