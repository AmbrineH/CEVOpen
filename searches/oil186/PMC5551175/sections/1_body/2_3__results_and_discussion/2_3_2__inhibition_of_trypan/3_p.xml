<p class="p">Testing the essential oils obtained from Cameroonian plants, we obtained various degrees of inhibition on 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic> proliferation, varying from not active (
 <italic class="italic">A. melegueta</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. anisata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">D. cinerea</italic>), to moderately active (
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. giganteus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic>). Notably, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values on 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic> were 7.65, 10.50, and 15.21 µg/mL for the essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. giganteus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the most active oils were also evaluated for the growth inhibitory effects on Balb/3T3 cells as a reference. No effect on mammalian cells was observed with concentrations as high as 100 µg/mL, showing a noteworthy selectivity against 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic> in comparison to mammalian cells, with selectivity indexes above 6.57 in all cases.
