<p>Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the leaf essential oil from the neem tree, which showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.21 µg/mL, can be a source of sesquiterpenes such as germacrene B and γ-elemene. Since this oil is completely dominated by sesquiterpenes (97.4%), it can be assumed that they are responsible for its antitrypanosomal activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate their mode of action and the possibility of them acting as lead compounds for the discovery of antitrypanosomal drugs.
