<p>The chemical constituents of the Cameroonian essential oils were analyzed on an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 N mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). For the separation of the volatile constituents, the following temperature program was used: 5 min at 60 °C then 4 °C/min up to 220 °C, then 11 °C/min up to 280 °C held for 15 min. The injector and detector temperatures were: 280 °C; carrier gas: Helium; flow rate: 1 mL/min; split ratio: 1:50; acquisition mass range: 29–400 
 <italic>m/z</italic>; and mode: electron-impact (EI, 70 eV). The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, and then 2 µL of the solution was injected into the GC-MS system. For the identification of essential oil components, co-injection with the authentic standards available in our laboratory (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was performed, together with a comparison of the retention indices and the mass spectra of those occurring in the ADAMS, NIST 08, and FFNSC2 libraries [
