<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> were collected during the dry season (January 2016) from a tree in the city of Guidiguis (north of Cameroon), about 70 km from Maroua. The leaves were air-dried in the shade for one week and kept in papers. Fruits (pods) of 
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic> were collected in a forest near Foumbam (western Cameroon) in December 2015. Once harvested, the seeds were removed from their pods and dried at room temperature over a period of three weeks in the absence of sunlight. At the end of the drying process, the seeds were placed into paper bags before hydrodistillation. Leaves of 
 <italic>C. anisata</italic> were collected in the village of Baffou, Menoua Division, Western Cameroon. Leaves of 
 <italic>A. danielli</italic> and fruits of 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic> and roots of 
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> were collected from Bamougoum and Bafoussam’s market (Cameroon, Western Region), respectively. The pericarp of 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic> was removed and the seeds used; the roots of 
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> were washed with water and sliced into small pieces. These plant parts were dried at room temperature for one week. The botanical identification of the five species was performed by a taxonomist at the Cameroon National Herbarium (Yaoundé, Cameroon), and the voucher specimens were archived with the following codes: 4447 SRFK (
 <italic>A. indica</italic>), 43117 HNC (
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic>), 43130 HNC (
 <italic>A. danielli</italic>), 44242/HNC (
 <italic>C. anisata</italic>), 42920 HNC (
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic>), and 23647 SRF (
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic>). The botanical names were also checked against The Plant List database (
