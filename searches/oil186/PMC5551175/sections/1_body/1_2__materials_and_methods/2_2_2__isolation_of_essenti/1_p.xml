 <italic>anisata</italic>; the seeds of 
 <italic>A. melegueta</italic> and 
 <italic>D. cinerea</italic>; and the roots of 
 <italic>E. giganteus</italic> were cut into small pieces and subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus until no more oil was obtained. The essential oils obtained were dried using Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and stored at −20 °C in vials sealed with teflon caps and protected from light before use. The oil yields were calculated on a dry weight basis (%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>).
