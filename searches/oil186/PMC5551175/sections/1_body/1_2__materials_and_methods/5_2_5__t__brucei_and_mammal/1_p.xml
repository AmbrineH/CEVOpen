<p>The cell culture conditions and the growth inhibition assay on 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and Balb/3T3 cells were performed as described before [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> TC221 bloodstream forms and mouse embryonic fibroblast Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC no CCL-163) were cultivated in vented plastic flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. For 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the growth medium was HMI-9 [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] supplemented with 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), whereas the Balb/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (0.584 g/L), and 10 mL/L 100× penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).
