<p>The essential oils or pure compounds identified from these oils were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and serially diluted with growth medium in white 96-well microtiter plates. 20,000 bloodstream forms of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> or Balb/3T3 cells were added to each well in a final volume of 200 Î¼L. In the case of mammalian cells, we also tested 2000 cells/well with similar results. To avoid any damage to the cells, the concentration of DMSO in the solution was never higher than 1% (no cell growth inhibition was observed with this concentration of DMSO). Cell viability was verified by a drug-free control for each compound.
