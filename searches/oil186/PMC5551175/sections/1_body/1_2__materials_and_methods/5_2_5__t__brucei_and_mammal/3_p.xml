<p class="p">The plates were incubated for 48 h in the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator; then 20 μL of 0.5 mM resazurine (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h before the fluorescence was measured with an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan group, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) equipped with 540 and 590 nm excitation and emission filters. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) values were calculated on a log inhibitor versus the response curves by non-linear regression using the GraphPad prism 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
