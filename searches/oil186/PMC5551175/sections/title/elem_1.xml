  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of 
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span> were collected during the dry season (January 2016) from a tree in the city of Guidiguis (north of Cameroon), about 70 km from Maroua. The leaves were air-dried in the shade for one week and kept in papers. Fruits (pods) of 
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> were collected in a forest near Foumbam (western Cameroon) in December 2015. Once harvested, the seeds were removed from their pods and dried at room temperature over a period of three weeks in the absence of sunlight. At the end of the drying process, the seeds were placed into paper bags before hydrodistillation. Leaves of 
   <span class="italic">C. anisata</span> were collected in the village of Baffou, Menoua Division, Western Cameroon. Leaves of 
   <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> and fruits of 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> and roots of 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> were collected from Bamougoum and Bafoussam’s market (Cameroon, Western Region), respectively. The pericarp of 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> was removed and the seeds used; the roots of 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> were washed with water and sliced into small pieces. These plant parts were dried at room temperature for one week. The botanical identification of the five species was performed by a taxonomist at the Cameroon National Herbarium (Yaoundé, Cameroon), and the voucher specimens were archived with the following codes: 4447 SRFK (
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span>), 43117 HNC (
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span>), 43130 HNC (
   <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>), 44242/HNC (
   <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>), 42920 HNC (
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), and 23647 SRF (
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>). The botanical names were also checked against The Plant List database (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the identification of volatiles, the following analytical standards purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy) were used: α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, camphene, myrcene, α-phellandrene, δ-3-carene,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical constituents of the Cameroonian essential oils were analyzed on an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 N mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). For the separation of the volatile constituents, the following temperature program was used: 5 min at 60 °C then 4 °C/min up to 220 °C, then 11 °C/min up to 280 °C held for 15 min. The injector and detector temperatures were: 280 °C; carrier gas: Helium; flow rate: 1 mL/min; split ratio: 1:50; acquisition mass range: 29–400 
   <span class="italic">m/z</span>; and mode: electron-impact (EI, 70 eV). The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane, and then 2 µL of the solution was injected into the GC-MS system. For the identification of essential oil components, co-injection with the authentic standards available in our laboratory (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was performed, together with a comparison of the retention indices and the mass spectra of those occurring in the ADAMS, NIST 08, and FFNSC2 libraries [

   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> TC221 bloodstream forms and mouse embryonic fibroblast Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC no CCL-163) were cultivated in vented plastic flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. For 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span>, the growth medium was HMI-9 [
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-14-00737">45</a>] supplemented with 10% (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils or pure compounds identified from these oils were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and serially diluted with growth medium in white 96-well microtiter plates. 20,000 bloodstream forms of 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> or Balb/3T3 cells were added to each well in a final volume of 200 μL. In the case of mammalian cells, we also tested 2000 cells/well with similar results. To avoid any damage to the cells, the concentration of DMSO in the solution was never higher than 1% (no cell growth inhibition was observed with this concentration of DMSO). Cell viability was verified by a drug-free control for each compound.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plates were incubated for 48 h in the CO
   <sub>2</sub> incubator; then 20 μL of 0.5 mM resazurine (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h before the fluorescence was measured with an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan group, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) equipped with 540 and 590 nm excitation and emission filters. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) values were calculated on a log inhibitor versus the response curves by non-linear regression using the GraphPad prism 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
