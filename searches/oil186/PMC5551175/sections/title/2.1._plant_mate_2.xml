 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of 
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span> were collected during the dry season (January 2016) from a tree in the city of Guidiguis (north of Cameroon), about 70 km from Maroua. The leaves were air-dried in the shade for one week and kept in papers. Fruits (pods) of 
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> were collected in a forest near Foumbam (western Cameroon) in December 2015. Once harvested, the seeds were removed from their pods and dried at room temperature over a period of three weeks in the absence of sunlight. At the end of the drying process, the seeds were placed into paper bags before hydrodistillation. Leaves of 
  <span class="italic">C. anisata</span> were collected in the village of Baffou, Menoua Division, Western Cameroon. Leaves of 
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span> and fruits of 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> and roots of 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> were collected from Bamougoum and Bafoussam’s market (Cameroon, Western Region), respectively. The pericarp of 
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> was removed and the seeds used; the roots of 
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> were washed with water and sliced into small pieces. These plant parts were dried at room temperature for one week. The botanical identification of the five species was performed by a taxonomist at the Cameroon National Herbarium (Yaoundé, Cameroon), and the voucher specimens were archived with the following codes: 4447 SRFK (
  <span class="italic">A. indica</span>), 43117 HNC (
  <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span>), 43130 HNC (
  <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>), 44242/HNC (
  <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>), 42920 HNC (
  <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), and 23647 SRF (
  <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>). The botanical names were also checked against The Plant List database (
