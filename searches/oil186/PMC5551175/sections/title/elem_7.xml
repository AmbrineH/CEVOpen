  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Chemical Composition of Essential Oils from Cameroonian Plants</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the essential oils hydrodistilled from the six Cameroonian medicinal and aromatic plants is reported in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t001">Table 1</a>. In the essential oil obtained from neem leaves, a total of thirteen components were identified, accounting for 98.3% of the total composition. The oil was almost entirely composed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.4%), with germacrene B (74.0%) and γ-elemene (18.3%) as the predominant components. The minor constituents were (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (2.4%) and β-elemene (0.9%). This work represents one of the few studies on the chemical composition of neem leaf essential oils. Neem trees have been largely investigated for the oil obtained by mechanical pressure or solvent extraction from their seeds. Earlier, El-Hawary et al. [
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-14-00737">46</a>] studied the composition of Egyptian neem leaves, reporting β-elemene (33.39%), γ-elemene (9.89%), germacrene D (9.72%), caryophyllene (6.8%), and bicyclogermacrene (5.23%) as the major compounds, while Dastan et al. [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-14-00737">47</a>] found γ-elemene (20.8%), germacrene B (20.3%), 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-caryophyllene (13.5%), hexadecanal (12.8%), and methyl linoleate (10.5%) as the major compounds in neem leaf oil from Iran.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of fifty-nine components were identified in the essential oil of alligator pepper, accounting for 99.4% of the total composition. The oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (83.3%), with 1,8-cineole (58.5%) and α-terpineol (19.4%) as the major compounds. Monoterpene hydrocarbons gave a minor contribution (14.9%), with β-pinene (7.1%) and α-pinene (2.0%) as the most representative compounds. Interestingly, sesquiterpenoids, which are reported as volatile marker compounds of alligator pepper, were detected in only low levels here (0.6%). The chemical composition of the 
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> seed essential oil showed a significant variability depending on the geographic origin and genetic characteristics of the samples. For example, samples from Nigeria exhibited humulene (26.23%), (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-ocimene (23.22%), (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (19.17%), and (
   <span class="italic">S</span>)-2-heptyl acetate (16.22%) as the major volatile constituents [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-14-00737">24</a>]. On the other hand, the seeds from the Central African Republic contained high levels of β-pinene (&gt;30%) and about 50% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons [
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-14-00737">48</a>], and an oil sample from Cameroon was made up of β-caryophyllene (8.5%), α-humulene (31.3%), and their epoxides (17.9% and 27.7%, respectively) [
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-14-00737">49</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the essential oil from African cardamom leaves, accounting for 99.3% of the total composition. This oil was mainly made up of monoterpene hydrocarbons (59.8% in leaves), accompanied by lower amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (20.0%), oxygenated monoterpenes (11.0%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (8.4%). The major compounds were sabinene (43.9%) and (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (16.6%), whereas other components occurring at noteworthy levels were β-pinene (5.8%), terpinen-4-ol (3.7%), and α-pinene (2.4%). This study was the first report on the leaf essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">A. daniellii</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
   <span class="italic">C. anisata</span> was characterized by high levels of phenylpropanoids (84.0%), which were mainly represented by (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-anethole (64.6%), with minor contributions by (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-methyl isoeugenol (16.1%) and methyl chavicol (2.0%). Terpenoids constituted a minor part of this oil, being represented mostly by 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (2.9%), γ-terpinene (2.4%), myrcene (2.0%), and germacrene D (2.2%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the essential oil of 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> seeds, a total of forty-nine volatile components were identified, accounting for 76.0% of the oil’s composition. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant constituents (50.6%), with geraniol (18.2%), terpinen-4-ol (7.5%), linalool (4.0%), and umbellulone (3.8%) as the most representative compounds. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes gave a lower contribution (12.1%), with none of the identified components exceeding 1.8%. Among other components occurring in the oil, it is worth noting the presence of ligustrazin (5.1%), elemicin (3.0%), and decanoic acid (2.8%). To our knowledge, no previous research has reported the chemical composition of 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> seed essential oil.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirty-five volatile compounds, all belonging to the sesquiterpene class (94.3%), were identified in the root essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> (54.7% sesquitepene hydrocarbons and 39.6% oxygenated sesquiterpenes). The major compounds were tricyclic sesquiterpenoids, which are characterized by multiple rearrangements of the caryophyllene cation [
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-14-00737">50</a>,

   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (6.3%). The cameroonan-7-α-l, is responsible for the patchouli-like smell of the root oil [
   <a rid="B52-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-14-00737">52</a>]. The reported composition was quite consistent with that previously reported by Menut et al. [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds with multitarget actions, the antitrypanosomal effects of which are largely unknown and barely explored. On this basis, we decided to test the in vitro inhibitory effects of a pool of essential oils taken from medicinal and aromatic plants growing in Cameroon. Some of them are known for their traditional uses in the treatment of infectious diseases and malaria [
   <a rid="B53-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-14-00737">53</a>,
   <a rid="B54-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-14-00737">54</a>] and, in the case of the Neem tree, also against 
   <span class="italic">T. b. brucei</span> [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-14-00737">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the chemical analysis performed, they exhibited different chemical profiles characterized by diverse functionalized groups such as monoterpene hydrocarbons (African cardamom), oxygenated monoterpenes (
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span>), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>), and phenylpropanoids (
   <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>). In this context, the main aim of our work was to identify the chemical scaffolds of possible natural lead compounds against trypanosomiasis. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Testing the essential oils obtained from Cameroonian plants, we obtained various degrees of inhibition on 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> proliferation, varying from not active (
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span>, 
   <span class="italic">C. anisata</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span>), to moderately active (
   <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>, 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span>). Notably, the IC
   <sub>50</sub> values on 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> were 7.65, 10.50, and 15.21 µg/mL for the essential oils from 
   <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>, 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span>, respectively (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>). Furthermore, the most active oils were also evaluated for the growth inhibitory effects on Balb/3T3 cells as a reference. No effect on mammalian cells was observed with concentrations as high as 100 µg/mL, showing a noteworthy selectivity against 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> in comparison to mammalian cells, with selectivity indexes above 6.57 in all cases.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inhibitory effects on 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> exhibited by the three essential oils highlights three classes of active compounds, i.e., monoterpene hydrocarbons (for 
   <span class="italic">A. danielli</span>) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (for 
   <span class="italic">A. indica</span> and 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span>) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>). 
   <span class="italic">E giganteus</span> also contains high amounts of oxygenated compounds.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The toxicity of monoterpene hydrocarbons against 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> can be attributed to the high hydrophobicity of this class of compounds, which are able to easily cross the cell membrane, causing the destabilization of phospholipid bilayers and the alteration of their permeability, leading to cell damage and death [
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-14-00737">44</a>,
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-14-00737">55</a>]. Among these compounds, the most abundant was sabinene (43.9%) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>) which showed an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value against 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> of 5.96 µg/mL, which is close to that of the African cardamom essential oil (7.65 µg/mL) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>). Another component of this oil with detectable antitrypanosomal activity was β-pinene, showing an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 11.4 µg/mL. The antitrypanosomal activity of sabinene was already reported in a previous study, although its mechanism of action on the protozoal cell has not been elucidated [
   <a rid="B56-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-14-00737">56</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> as well as 
   <span class="italic">A. daniellii</span> essential oils contained the bicyclic sesquiterpene (
   <span class="italic">E</span>)-caryophyllene (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>), which exhibited good inhibitory properties on 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> (IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 8.25 µg/mL). However, the content of this component is only 6.3% in 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> and can therefore not explain the good activity of this essential oil. It is rather tricyclic sesquiterpenes that are the major constituent. This is the first report documenting the antitrypanosomal activity of the tricyclic sesquiterpenes-containing 
   <span class="italic">E. giganteus</span> essential oil. The latter was a rich source of compounds such as silphiperfol-6-ene, presilphiperfolan-8-ol, presilphiperfol-7-ene, and cameroonan-7-α-l with an unusual skeleton (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00737-f001" href="#ijerph-14-00737-f001">Figure 1</a>) [
   <a rid="B26-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-14-00737">26</a>]. To date, these compounds have not been biologically investigated. Previously, the tricyclic sesquiterpene ledol was suggested to be responsible for the trypanocidal properties of 
   <span class="italic">Hagenia abyssinica</span> (Bruce ex Steud.) J.F.Gmel. essential oil [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-14-00737">13</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the other pure compounds, 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol were inactive against 
   <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> (IC
   <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00737-t002" href="#ijerph-14-00737-t002">Table 2</a>), and this also explained the lack of activity of the 
   <span class="italic">A. melegueta</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D. cinerea</span> essential oils, which are dominated by these compounds.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the leaf essential oil from the neem tree, which showed an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 15.21 µg/mL, can be a source of sesquiterpenes such as germacrene B and γ-elemene. Since this oil is completely dominated by sesquiterpenes (97.4%), it can be assumed that they are responsible for its antitrypanosomal activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate their mode of action and the possibility of them acting as lead compounds for the discovery of antitrypanosomal drugs.
