 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For centuries, people living in Africa have been facing various infectious tropical illnesses, among which African trypanosomiases are some of the most frequent relevant parasitic diseases. African trypanosomiases, commonly called sleeping sickness in humans (HAT; Human African Trypanosomiasis) and Nagana in domestic livestock, affect a huge number of people living in poverty in 36 sub-Saharan countries and hence have a key socioeconomic impact [

  <a rid="B3-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-14-00737">3</a>]. After a century of outbreaks, due to political instability and a lack of funding, around 70 million people and 50 million cattle are still at risk of exposure in Africa [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-14-00737">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trypanosomiasis is transmitted by the bite of insects from the 
  <span class="italic">Glossina</span> spp. (Glossinidae) and is fatal in humans, if untreated. While taking a blood meal, infected 
  <span class="italic">Glossina</span> flies can spread extracellular protozoans from the species 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma brucei.</span> There are three morphologically indistinguishable subspecies of 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span>. The subspecies 
  <span class="italic">T. b. gambiense</span> is responsible for a chronic form of the human disease, while 
  <span class="italic">T. b. rhodesiense</span> causes an acute form, which more rapidly leads to death. Both subspecies are infective to humans, whereas 
  <span class="italic">T. b. brucei</span> is only infective to animals. During the early stage of the disease or the hemolymphatic phase, the parasite is restricted to the blood and lymph, and, after months or years, it invades the central nervous system, resulting in various neurological symptoms, including sleeping disturbance [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As for other neglected tropical diseases, the chemotherapeutical arsenal against HAT is based on limited, expensive, and often toxic medicines that are administered parentally in a context of poverty and a lack of qualified personnel in healthcare centers. The few drugs that are available are pentamidine and suramin for the early stage of the disease and eflornithine (also in combination with nifurtimox) and melarsoprol, an organoarsenic compound, for the late stage, when the parasite infects the brain. Although melarsoprol can cause severe reactive encephalopathy, it remains a first line treatment for infections by 
  <span class="italic">T. b. gambiense</span> in many rural areas because of the high cost of eflornithine [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-14-00737">1</a>]. Overall, the scenario described above highlights the critical nature of the current situation and the urgent need to explore new sources of potentially effective and safe compounds for therapy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been estimated that a large part of the African population relies on herbal medicines as the first-line treatment for different ailments. In this regard, the African flora represents a valuable source of anti-infectious compounds to be exploited as drugs [
