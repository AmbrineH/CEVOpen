 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cell culture conditions and the growth inhibition assay on 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> and Balb/3T3 cells were performed as described before [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-14-00737">44</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> TC221 bloodstream forms and mouse embryonic fibroblast Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC no CCL-163) were cultivated in vented plastic flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub>. For 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span>, the growth medium was HMI-9 [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-14-00737" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-14-00737">45</a>] supplemented with 10% (
  <span class="italic">v/v</span>) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), whereas the Balb/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (
  <span class="italic">v/v</span>) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (0.584 g/L), and 10 mL/L 100× penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils or pure compounds identified from these oils were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and serially diluted with growth medium in white 96-well microtiter plates. 20,000 bloodstream forms of 
  <span class="italic">T. brucei</span> or Balb/3T3 cells were added to each well in a final volume of 200 μL. In the case of mammalian cells, we also tested 2000 cells/well with similar results. To avoid any damage to the cells, the concentration of DMSO in the solution was never higher than 1% (no cell growth inhibition was observed with this concentration of DMSO). Cell viability was verified by a drug-free control for each compound.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plates were incubated for 48 h in the CO
  <sub>2</sub> incubator; then 20 μL of 0.5 mM resazurine (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h before the fluorescence was measured with an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan group, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) equipped with 540 and 590 nm excitation and emission filters. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) values were calculated on a log inhibitor versus the response curves by non-linear regression using the GraphPad prism 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
