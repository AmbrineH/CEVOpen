 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dried kernels (ca. 1 g) were finely chopped and extracted with chloroform and methanol (2:1) followed by agitation at room temperature for one hour. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 3500 rpm and the whole process was repeated twice. The lipid extracts were mixed with boron trifluoride (BF
  <sub>3</sub>)-methanol reagent (20%) and fatty acids were derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters [
  <a rid="B20-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00060">20</a>]. The methyl esters of the fatty acids were dissolved in heptane and analyzed by GC-MS (Shimadzu QP2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The GC conditions were as follows: Restek stabilwax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.5 µm film thickness) (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA); oven temperature program: the column held initially at 100 °C after injection and the final temperature was increased to 250 °C, total program time was 39:00 min; injector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: Helium; linear gas velocity: 42.7 cm/s; column flow: 1.10 mL/min; split ratio: 50.00; injection volume: 1.0 µL. MS conditions were regulated as follows: ion source temperature: 200 °C; interface temperature: 250 °C; mass range: 35–500 atomic mass units. Identification of the compounds was carried out by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with corresponding data from a standard food industry FAME Mix (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA). A total of 32 individual compounds were analyzed and only the detected ones were recorded along with their quantity compared with the standard.
