  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> is the second-largest genus of the combretaceae family, with approximately 250 species growing in tropical and subtropical countries around the world [
  <a rid="B1-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-foods-07-00060">1</a>]. More than 30 species of 
  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> occur in northern regions of Australia [
  <a rid="B2-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-foods-07-00060">2</a>]. More than 50 species of 
  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> have found utility as ingredients in foods and beverages worldwide, as preservatives, raw material for wine and palm sugar, eaten raw and as food supplements [
  <a rid="B3-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-foods-07-00060">3</a>]. The nutritional and therapeutic properties of 
  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> genus can be attributed to the presence of a wide range of phytochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, which encompasses phenolic acids, gallotannins, ellagitannins, proanthocyanidins and other flavonoids [

  <span class="italic">Terminalia ferdinandiana</span>, popularly known as Kakadu plum, is native to Australia. Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal people) have been using this plant as a food and medicine for centuries, for example, refreshing drinks are made from fresh or dried fruits in Western Australia [
  <a rid="B2-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-foods-07-00060">2</a>]. Fruits are traditionally used as an antiseptic, soothing balm, in colds and flu and in treating a headache [
  <a rid="B4-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-foods-07-00060">4</a>]. A number of research outcomes have been reported on the antioxidant [

  <a rid="B11-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-07-00060">11</a>] of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> fruits and leaves. Phytochemical analysis has revealed that 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> fruit is a rich source of Ellagic acid and its hydrolysable tannins, ellagitannins [
  <a rid="B12-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-foods-07-00060">12</a>]. Recently, a food safe extraction method of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> fruits for commercial use in the food industry has been suggested [
  <a rid="B4-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-foods-07-00060">4</a>]. Additionally, a systematic evaluation of the changes in quality and bioactivity of the fruits of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> during processing, packaging and storage has been performed, and key chemical markers have been identified to enable standardized products to be delivered to the consumer [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last two decades, seeds and kernels from the 
  <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> genus have been researched and reported for their nutritional properties and health-promoting activities [
  <a rid="B13-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-07-00060">13</a>,

  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. To understand the relationship between the internal quality and genotype of the plant, studies of nut and kernels characteristics and composition are very common. During the industrial processing of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> fruits, the seeds are treated as waste products and have been discarded. Recent studies on many fruit seeds or kernels have shown that they have the potential to be utilized as ingredients for value addition, they are very nutritious and could be used as alternate sources of essential minerals, fatty acids, and proteins [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, no reports have been published on the utilization of the by-products of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> and there is no investigation on the chemical and nutritional composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of the by-product of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> in the industry by determining proximate, mineral and fatty acid compositions to ascertain its nutritional value and potential as a source of food supplement ingredients for the food industry.
