 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Proximate Composition</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proximate composition of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t001" href="#foods-07-00060-t001">Table 1</a>. Moisture content is an important parameter in terms of the physicochemical properties of plant parts, due to the fact that low moisture content is beneficial for retaining the quality and shelf life of seeds, and this also decreases the susceptibility for microbial growth, premature seed germination, unwarranted fermentation and undesirable biochemical changes. The moisture content is only 4% in the kernels of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span>, presenting minimum risk for microbial growth and undesirable biochemical changes upon storage. A comparable moisture content of 5.5% was reported for 
  <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels [
  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. Furthermore, the results of the present study showed that the kernels were abundant in proteins, with a content of 32% relative to the standard. Protein content of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> is higher than that of 
  <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels (20.1%) [
  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">T. sericea</span> kernels contain 46.2% proteins [
  <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>], which is higher than 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for protein are 56 g for a 70 kg man [
  <a rid="B24-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-foods-07-00060">24</a>]. As the protein content of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is high, it could be used as an alternative source or dietary supplement for consumers with restricted and compromised protein intake from other sources. Ash content is 4% and dietary fiber 21.2% in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Ash content signifies the presence of minerals in the kernel, tissue and the high content of fiber can help in improving the gut health and digestion. The lipid content in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was found to be 35.1%, with less than 1% in the trans form. The WHO recommends that no more than 1% of our daily energy intake come from trans-fatty acids (TFAs). Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the fat content of 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is devoid of any trans-fat-associated health risk. The fat content in 
  <span class="italic">T. sericea</span> seed is 32.5% [
  <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>], 64.7% in 
  <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels [
  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>], and in 
  <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> seed it is 32.7% [
  <a rid="B14-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00060">14</a>], while in 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels it is 35.1%. 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels can supply 50% of the RDA of fat with saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fats are in the order of 5.8%, 9.8%, and 19.4%. These proportions are similar to the fatty acid profile determined by GC-MS (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t002" href="#foods-07-00060-t002">Table 2</a>). A diet rich in PUFA is important for the structure and function of proteins, receptors, enzymes and transport molecules whereas the MUFA content may lower blood cholesterol levels, modulate immune function and can improve the fluidity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) [
  <a rid="B25-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-07-00060">25</a>]. The results of our present study thus suggest that 
  <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels have the potential to be used as an alternative source of MUFA and PUFA.
