  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Proximate Composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proximate composition of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is summarized in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t001" href="#foods-07-00060-t001">Table 1</a>. Moisture content is an important parameter in terms of the physicochemical properties of plant parts, due to the fact that low moisture content is beneficial for retaining the quality and shelf life of seeds, and this also decreases the susceptibility for microbial growth, premature seed germination, unwarranted fermentation and undesirable biochemical changes. The moisture content is only 4% in the kernels of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span>, presenting minimum risk for microbial growth and undesirable biochemical changes upon storage. A comparable moisture content of 5.5% was reported for 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels [
   <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. Furthermore, the results of the present study showed that the kernels were abundant in proteins, with a content of 32% relative to the standard. Protein content of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> is higher than that of 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels (20.1%) [
   <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">T. sericea</span> kernels contain 46.2% proteins [
   <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>], which is higher than 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for protein are 56 g for a 70 kg man [
   <a rid="B24-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-foods-07-00060">24</a>]. As the protein content of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is high, it could be used as an alternative source or dietary supplement for consumers with restricted and compromised protein intake from other sources. Ash content is 4% and dietary fiber 21.2% in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Ash content signifies the presence of minerals in the kernel, tissue and the high content of fiber can help in improving the gut health and digestion. The lipid content in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was found to be 35.1%, with less than 1% in the trans form. The WHO recommends that no more than 1% of our daily energy intake come from trans-fatty acids (TFAs). Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the fat content of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is devoid of any trans-fat-associated health risk. The fat content in 
   <span class="italic">T. sericea</span> seed is 32.5% [
   <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>], 64.7% in 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> kernels [
   <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>], and in 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> seed it is 32.7% [
   <a rid="B14-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00060">14</a>], while in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels it is 35.1%. 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels can supply 50% of the RDA of fat with saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fats are in the order of 5.8%, 9.8%, and 19.4%. These proportions are similar to the fatty acid profile determined by GC-MS (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t002" href="#foods-07-00060-t002">Table 2</a>). A diet rich in PUFA is important for the structure and function of proteins, receptors, enzymes and transport molecules whereas the MUFA content may lower blood cholesterol levels, modulate immune function and can improve the fluidity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) [
   <a rid="B25-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-07-00060">25</a>]. The results of our present study thus suggest that 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels have the potential to be used as an alternative source of MUFA and PUFA.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Mineral and Trace Element Composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The macro and trace element composition of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels evaluated in this study is presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003" href="#foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</a>, and the non-essential and heavy metal composition is presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004" href="#foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</a>. Minerals are essential for proper functioning of the body, and a deviation from the appropriate amounts can cause numerous diseases, clinical syndromes, and illnesses associated with the deficient intake, as well as overuse over time or at a certain time period of life. Hence, reference values are established and reviewed periodically to stipulate the mineral levels that will meet the needs of healthy human individuals. The RDA of the evaluated minerals for a healthy male adult of 70 kg body weight are also presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003" href="#foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004" href="#foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</a>. The high macro-mineral contents were found to be phosphorus 872.8 mg/100 g DW, and calcium at 538.5 mg/100 g DW, while sodium was 120.3 mg/100 g DW and magnesium 421.1 mg/100 g DW (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003" href="#foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</a>). These results indicated that the kernels could significantly contribute to the mineral intake in humans. Mineral composition analysis of kernels from 
   <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> genus is scarce and one report on the mineral composition of 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> seeds included phosphorus (10), calcium (36.1), magnesium (26.4), iron (375), sodium (5) and potassium (350), in mg/100 g [
   <a rid="B14-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00060">14</a>]. Kernels from bayberry (
   <span class="italic">Myrica rubra</span>) were reported as an abundant source of potassium, containing 780 mg/100 g [
   <a rid="B26-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-foods-07-00060">26</a>]. The potassium content of white Chinese olive (
   <span class="italic">Canarium album</span>) is also high, at 587 mg/100 g [
   <a rid="B19-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-foods-07-00060">19</a>]. In our study, 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels contained 669.3 mg/100 g of potassium, which can be compared to the potassium content of bayberry, Chinese olive, and black Chinese olive. Moreover, the phosphorus levels of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels (872.8 mg/100 g DW) seemed to be much higher compared to the levels of bayberry (32.9 mg/100 g) [
   <a rid="B16-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-foods-07-00060">16</a>]. Important trace elements found in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> were zinc, manganese, copper and iron at levels of 6, 9.1, 2.5 and 6.1 mg/100 g, respectively, and are within the RDA and AI values. It can be suggested that 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels can be a valuable dietary source of these trace elements. These trace elements are important constituents of various proteins and enzymes of our body which are involved in macronutrient metabolism [
   <a rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00060">15</a>]. The levels of molybdenum, arsenic, mercury, cadmium were found at less than 0.1 mg/kg in the kernels, while the lead level was found at 0.13 mg/kg (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004" href="#foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</a>). Heavy metal exposure poses significant health risks, which can cause life-threatening diseases, and the toxic effects are influenced by chemical forms, absorption rate, and solubility in body fluids. The toxicity of arsenic depends on the chemical form. The inorganic form of arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic [
   <a rid="B21-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-foods-07-00060">21</a>]. Mercury can be readily absorbed and incorporated into tissue proteins and can cause detrimental effects on health. The bioaccessibility and bioavailability of the exposed heavy metals can again vary depending on the chemical forms, time and route of exposure, duration, and concentration of the exposed metals. However, the levels of heavy metals found in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels were within the regulatory limits, suggesting that they may not impose any health risk.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Fatty Acid Composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acids can be considered the main constituent of all oils and may include saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids [
   <a rid="B25-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-foods-07-00060">25</a>]. Besides providing high-quality food, vegetable oils can also provide essential nutrients that have a particular clinical significance. PUFA are present in membrane phospholipids in some tissues and can also act as precursors for prostaglandin hormones [
   <a rid="B28-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-foods-07-00060">28</a>]. On the other hand, SFA are reported to increase cardiovascular disease risk and sometimes can potentiate the risk of cancer and autoimmune disorders [
   <a rid="B29-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-foods-07-00060">29</a>]. The principal fatty acid components in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels were palmitic (SFA, 12%); oleic (MUFA, 29.3%); and linoleic (PUFA, 50.2%) acids (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t002" href="#foods-07-00060-t002">Table 2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SFA are reported to impact human health by increasing the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, some of the SFA are also reported to increase the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and some of them have little or no significant role in increasing or decreasing the LDL and HDL cholesterol levels [
   <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. The main SFA found in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are myristic (0.09%), palmitic (12%), stearic (7.2%), arachidic (0.76%) and behenic (0.4%) acid. The level of myristic acid in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is only 0.09%. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unsaturated fatty acids can exist in 
   <span class="italic">cis</span>- or 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-configuration. 
   <span class="italic">Cis</span>-configuration is found in naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, while 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-configuration is the result of processing. 
   <span class="italic">Cis</span>-unsaturated fatty acids are known as potent inducers of adiposomes also referred to as lipid droplets and they have important roles in cell signaling, regulation of lipid metabolism and control of the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators [
   <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. The MUFA present in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are palmitoleate (0.2%), oleate (29.3%) and ecosenoate (0.11%). Among the MUFA, oleic acid is the most abundant one found in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels. Oleic acid has been reported to act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. The anti-inflammatory mechanism includes down-regulating cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase through the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B [
   <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. Oleic acid may promote insulin resistance which is contrary to the PUFA which protects from insulin resistance [
   <a rid="B30-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-foods-07-00060">30</a>]. Oleic acid has also been reported to attenuate blood pressure and risk of developing hypertension [
   <a rid="B32-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-foods-07-00060">32</a>]. The potential use of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels as a dietary source of oleic acid in reducing the risk and attenuating hypertension requires further investigation. Previous reports on some of the seeds and kernels of the family Combretaceae had reported oleic acid as the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid found in this family [
   <a rid="B33-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-foods-07-00060">33</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential PUFA are α-linolenic (18:3, 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-3) and linoleic acid (18:2, 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-6), from which other important PUFA are derived. Recently, essential fatty acids (EFA) have been considered as functional food components and nutraceuticals [
   <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. Documented roles of EFA include cardioprotective effect (due to their considerable antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic effects), the fluidity of biological membranes, the function of membrane enzymes and receptors, modulation of eicosanoids production, blood pressure regulation and metabolism of minerals [
   <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. EFA are also reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and some other serious diseases due to their complex effects on concentrations of lipoproteins [
   <a rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-foods-07-00060">31</a>]. Linoleic acid is an unsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that plays a critical role in the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the central nervous system (CNS) and retina [
   <a rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-foods-07-00060">23</a>]. A deficiency can cause skin scaling and hair loss [
   <a rid="B34-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-foods-07-00060">34</a>]. Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the only PUFA found in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels (50.2%). Therefore, it can be suggested that 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels can be used as a potential dietary source of linoleic acid which can increase the systemic pool and subsequently help nourish the CNS and retina. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WHO recommends that total daily energy intake derived from omega-6 PUFA should be 5–8% and from omega-3 PUFA 2% for an adult male. Studies on the seeds of 
   <span class="italic">T. bellirica</span> have reported that 40% of the seed is oil and 35% is protein and major fatty acids were linoleic (31%), palmitic (35%) and oleic (24%) acids and the authors have suggested that kernels could be used as a dietary source of linoleic acid [
   <a rid="B35-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-foods-07-00060">35</a>]. Reported studies on various plants of 
   <span class="italic">Terminalia</span> genus included that 
   <span class="italic">T. glucausens</span> contains palmitic acid (34.9%), myristic acid (0.1%) and stearic acid (4.8%), seed oil of 
   <span class="italic">T. superba</span> contains behenic acid (C22:0; 1.2%) and the oil of 
   <span class="italic">T. catappa</span> contains stearic acid (5.8%), myristic acid (1.21%) and arachidic acid (1.3%) [
   <a rid="B33-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-foods-07-00060">33</a>]. Variations in the fatty acid composition is very common in plants and may be due to a number of reasons including but not limited to soil composition, climate, and specific geographical locations etc. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutritionally, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in edible oils and fats is very important. High levels of saturated fatty acids are desirable to increase oil stability. However, SFA become nutritionally undesirable, because high levels of saturated fatty acids are considered to increase the concentration of LDL, affecting the ratio of LDL to HDL and promoting vascular smooth muscle proliferation [
   <a rid="B36-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-foods-07-00060">36</a>,
   <a rid="B37-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-foods-07-00060">37</a>]. The ratio of UFA/SFA for 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is 4, which can be considered favorable for reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications [
   <a rid="B36-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-foods-07-00060">36</a>]. Again, the relationship between saturated and polyunsaturated FA content is an important parameter for determination of the nutritional value of oils which is expressed as P/S index. Oils and fats with a P/S index &gt; 1 are considered to have nutritional value. Several studies indicate that a higher P/S index means a smaller deposition of lipids in the body. The P/S indexes of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels and some other common oils and fats are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t005" href="#foods-07-00060-t005">Table 5</a>. The P/S index of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was 2.45, while safflower oil is 10.55 and coconut fat is 0.005. The fatty acid composition of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels is comparable to the composition of soya bean oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t005" href="#foods-07-00060-t005">Table 5</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are suggestions to reduce the SFA in the diet to suppress the risk of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, it is important to note that SFA reduction itself cannot suppress the risk. Mostly, reduction of SFA and TFA with their simultaneous replacement by PUFA could lead to a reduction of the risk of CHD. The SFA content of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels was 20.4%, having a very low amount of myristic acid. Based on our results, it can be concluded that the SFA of 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels are unlikely to have detrimental health effects by increasing the LDL cholesterol level. Moreover, the kernels were a good source of linoleic acid suggesting 
   <span class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</span> kernels as a valuable source of EFA that can be used in feed and food.
