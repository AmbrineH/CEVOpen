The digested samples were diluted and made up to 40 mL with high-purity water (Milli-Q Element system, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The levels of minerals and trace elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista AX, Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), to measure lower levels and for greater sensitivity the analysis was carried out using ICP-MS (7500a, Agilent, Tokyo, Japan). The ICP-MS was equipped with an auto-sampler, integrated sample introduction system and a helium octopole reaction cell to remove polyatomic interferences (

The standard reference materials were used for the quality control and assurance and treated similarly to the samples throughout the study. The data of quality control and assurance are presented in the
