<p>Accurately weighed 0.3 g of dried 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels were taken into teflon vessels of microwave digestion system (MarsXpress, CEM, Matthews, NC, USA) and high-purity nitric acid (70%

The levels of minerals and trace elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista AX, Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), to measure lower levels and for greater sensitivity the analysis was carried out using ICP-MS (7500a, Agilent, Tokyo, Japan). The ICP-MS was equipped with an auto-sampler, integrated sample introduction system and a helium octopole reaction cell to remove polyatomic interferences (

 <sup>35</sup>Cl on 
 <sup>75</sup>As). The operating conditions were as follows: radio frequency (RF) power 1350W, argon carrier gas 0.8 L/min and helium reaction cell gas flow rate 4.5 mL/min. The standard reference materials were used for the quality control and assurance and treated similarly to the samples throughout the study. The data of quality control and assurance are presented in the
