<p>The frozen seeds were thawed, washed and cleaned manually several times to remove the pulp residues with double distilled water. The seeds were then dried in the oven for 48 h at 40 °C. After drying, the seeds were individually cracked using an Engineers’ vice size 125 (DAWN, Melbourne, Australia) to release the kernels from the seedcoats. The seedcoats and kernels were kept, processed and analyzed separately. The kernels were kept in air-tight containers and placed at −20 °C for further analysis. A flowchart depicting the processing of the seeds is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00060-f002">Figure 2</xref>. During the processing of fruits in the industry in a batch of 100 kg of fruits, 22 kg of seeds can be obtained as by-product. The average weight of a dry seed is 0.5 g and the moisture content is 2.8%. Average weight of a kernel is 0.04 g. The kernel is 8% of the weight of the seed. 1 kg of dry seeds can deliver 80 g of kernels.
