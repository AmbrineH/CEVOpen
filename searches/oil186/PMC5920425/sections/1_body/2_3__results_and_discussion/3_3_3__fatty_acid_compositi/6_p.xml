<p>Nutritionally, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in edible oils and fats is very important. High levels of saturated fatty acids are desirable to increase oil stability. However, SFA become nutritionally undesirable, because high levels of saturated fatty acids are considered to increase the concentration of LDL, affecting the ratio of LDL to HDL and promoting vascular smooth muscle proliferation [

 <xref rid="B37-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The ratio of UFA/SFA for 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels is 4, which can be considered favorable for reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Again, the relationship between saturated and polyunsaturated FA content is an important parameter for determination of the nutritional value of oils which is expressed as P/S index. Oils and fats with a P/S index &gt; 1 are considered to have nutritional value. Several studies indicate that a higher P/S index means a smaller deposition of lipids in the body. The P/S indexes of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels and some other common oils and fats are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t005">Table 5</xref>. The P/S index of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels was 2.45, while safflower oil is 10.55 and coconut fat is 0.005. The fatty acid composition of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels is comparable to the composition of soya bean oil (
