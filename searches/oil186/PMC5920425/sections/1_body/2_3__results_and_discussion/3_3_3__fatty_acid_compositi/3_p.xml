<p class="p">Unsaturated fatty acids can exist in 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>- or 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-configuration. 
 <italic class="italic">Cis</italic>-configuration is found in naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, while 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-configuration is the result of processing. 
 <italic class="italic">Cis</italic>-unsaturated fatty acids are known as potent inducers of adiposomes also referred to as lipid droplets and they have important roles in cell signaling, regulation of lipid metabolism and control of the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The MUFA present in 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels are palmitoleate (0.2%), oleate (29.3%) and ecosenoate (0.11%). Among the MUFA, oleic acid is the most abundant one found in 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels. Oleic acid has been reported to act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. The anti-inflammatory mechanism includes down-regulating cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase through the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B [

 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels as a dietary source of oleic acid in reducing the risk and attenuating hypertension requires further investigation. Previous reports on some of the seeds and kernels of the family Combretaceae had reported oleic acid as the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid found in this family [
