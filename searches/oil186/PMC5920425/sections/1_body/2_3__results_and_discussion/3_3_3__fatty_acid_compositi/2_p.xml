<p class="p">SFA are reported to impact human health by increasing the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, some of the SFA are also reported to increase the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and some of them have little or no significant role in increasing or decreasing the LDL and HDL cholesterol levels [
