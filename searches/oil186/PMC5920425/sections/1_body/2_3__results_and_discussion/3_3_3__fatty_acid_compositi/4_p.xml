<p class="p">Essential PUFA are Î±-linolenic (18:3, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3) and linoleic acid (18:2, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6), from which other important PUFA are derived. Recently, essential fatty acids (EFA) have been considered as functional food components and nutraceuticals [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Documented roles of EFA include cardioprotective effect (due to their considerable antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic effects), the fluidity of biological membranes, the function of membrane enzymes and receptors, modulation of eicosanoids production, blood pressure regulation and metabolism of minerals [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. EFA are also reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and some other serious diseases due to their complex effects on concentrations of lipoproteins [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Linoleic acid is an unsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that plays a critical role in the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the central nervous system (CNS) and retina [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A deficiency can cause skin scaling and hair loss [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the only PUFA found in 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels (50.2%). Therefore, it can be suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels can be used as a potential dietary source of linoleic acid which can increase the systemic pool and subsequently help nourish the CNS and retina.
