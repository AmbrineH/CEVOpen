<p>The WHO recommends that total daily energy intake derived from omega-6 PUFA should be 5â€“8% and from omega-3 PUFA 2% for an adult male. Studies on the seeds of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> have reported that 40% of the seed is oil and 35% is protein and major fatty acids were linoleic (31%), palmitic (35%) and oleic (24%) acids and the authors have suggested that kernels could be used as a dietary source of linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Reported studies on various plants of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> genus included that 
 <italic>T. glucausens</italic> contains palmitic acid (34.9%), myristic acid (0.1%) and stearic acid (4.8%), seed oil of 
 <italic>T. superba</italic> contains behenic acid (C22:0; 1.2%) and the oil of 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> contains stearic acid (5.8%), myristic acid (1.21%) and arachidic acid (1.3%) [
