<p>The proximate composition of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t001">Table 1</xref>. Moisture content is an important parameter in terms of the physicochemical properties of plant parts, due to the fact that low moisture content is beneficial for retaining the quality and shelf life of seeds, and this also decreases the susceptibility for microbial growth, premature seed germination, unwarranted fermentation and undesirable biochemical changes. The moisture content is only 4% in the kernels of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic>, presenting minimum risk for microbial growth and undesirable biochemical changes upon storage. A comparable moisture content of 5.5% was reported for 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> kernels [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the results of the present study showed that the kernels were abundant in proteins, with a content of 32% relative to the standard. Protein content of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> is higher than that of 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> kernels (20.1%) [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> kernels contain 46.2% proteins [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is higher than 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels. Recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for protein are 56 g for a 70 kg man [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As the protein content of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels is high, it could be used as an alternative source or dietary supplement for consumers with restricted and compromised protein intake from other sources. Ash content is 4% and dietary fiber 21.2% in 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels. Ash content signifies the presence of minerals in the kernel, tissue and the high content of fiber can help in improving the gut health and digestion. The lipid content in 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels was found to be 35.1%, with less than 1% in the trans form. The WHO recommends that no more than 1% of our daily energy intake come from trans-fatty acids (TFAs). Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the fat content of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels is devoid of any trans-fat-associated health risk. The fat content in 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> seed is 32.5% [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], 64.7% in 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> kernels [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and in 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> seed it is 32.7% [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while in 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels it is 35.1%. 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels can supply 50% of the RDA of fat with saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fats are in the order of 5.8%, 9.8%, and 19.4%. These proportions are similar to the fatty acid profile determined by GC-MS (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t002">Table 2</xref>). A diet rich in PUFA is important for the structure and function of proteins, receptors, enzymes and transport molecules whereas the MUFA content may lower blood cholesterol levels, modulate immune function and can improve the fluidity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results of our present study thus suggest that 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels have the potential to be used as an alternative source of MUFA and PUFA.
