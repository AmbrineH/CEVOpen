<p>The macro and trace element composition of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels evaluated in this study is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</xref>, and the non-essential and heavy metal composition is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</xref>. Minerals are essential for proper functioning of the body, and a deviation from the appropriate amounts can cause numerous diseases, clinical syndromes, and illnesses associated with the deficient intake, as well as overuse over time or at a certain time period of life. Hence, reference values are established and reviewed periodically to stipulate the mineral levels that will meet the needs of healthy human individuals. The RDA of the evaluated minerals for a healthy male adult of 70 kg body weight are also presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</xref>. The high macro-mineral contents were found to be phosphorus 872.8 mg/100 g DW, and calcium at 538.5 mg/100 g DW, while sodium was 120.3 mg/100 g DW and magnesium 421.1 mg/100 g DW (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t003">Table 3</xref>). These results indicated that the kernels could significantly contribute to the mineral intake in humans. Mineral composition analysis of kernels from 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> genus is scarce and one report on the mineral composition of 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> seeds included phosphorus (10), calcium (36.1), magnesium (26.4), iron (375), sodium (5) and potassium (350), in mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Kernels from bayberry (
 <italic>Myrica rubra</italic>) were reported as an abundant source of potassium, containing 780 mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The potassium content of white Chinese olive (
 <italic>Canarium album</italic>) is also high, at 587 mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our study, 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels contained 669.3 mg/100 g of potassium, which can be compared to the potassium content of bayberry, Chinese olive, and black Chinese olive. Moreover, the phosphorus levels of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels (872.8 mg/100 g DW) seemed to be much higher compared to the levels of bayberry (32.9 mg/100 g) [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Important trace elements found in 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> were zinc, manganese, copper and iron at levels of 6, 9.1, 2.5 and 6.1 mg/100 g, respectively, and are within the RDA and AI values. It can be suggested that 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels can be a valuable dietary source of these trace elements. These trace elements are important constituents of various proteins and enzymes of our body which are involved in macronutrient metabolism [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The levels of molybdenum, arsenic, mercury, cadmium were found at less than 0.1 mg/kg in the kernels, while the lead level was found at 0.13 mg/kg (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00060-t004">Table 4</xref>). Heavy metal exposure poses significant health risks, which can cause life-threatening diseases, and the toxic effects are influenced by chemical forms, absorption rate, and solubility in body fluids. The toxicity of arsenic depends on the chemical form. The inorganic form of arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-07-00060" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mercury can be readily absorbed and incorporated into tissue proteins and can cause detrimental effects on health. The bioaccessibility and bioavailability of the exposed heavy metals can again vary depending on the chemical forms, time and route of exposure, duration, and concentration of the exposed metals. However, the levels of heavy metals found in 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> kernels were within the regulatory limits, suggesting that they may not impose any health risk.
