 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> is a deciduous tree belonging to the family of Moringaceae. It is a fastest growing tree among the other 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> species (Abd El-Wahab, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>) with 3–10 m height and grayish green bark adapted to high aridity. The leaves are 30–40 cm long, alternate, obovate and deciduous. One of the unique features of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> is the falling of their leaflets when the leaves mature, leaving leaf rachises naked (Robiansyah et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Olson et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The plant has axillary inflorescence with much branched panicle (18–30 cm long). Flowers are 10–15 mm long, hermaphrodite, zygomorphic, pentamerous, and pinkish white in color with white sepals. A single tree of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> may produce up to 1,000 pods per year and length of the pods may vary from 20 to 40 cm. Each pod contains 8–15 ovoid, un-winged, trigonous seeds (Afsharypuor et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Another unique feature of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> is the formation of root tuber in the seedling phase (Munyanziza and Yongabi, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>).
