<p>A study was made to quantify the total phenol and flavonoid contents in hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> leaves. The total content of phenols in chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol were 75.53, 81.26, and 94.56 GAE/g of dry extract, respectively. The results on the total content of flavonoids revealed that 6.55, 8.39, and 20.81 mg of QE/g were present in chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> leaves, respectively. On the other hand, phenol and flavonoid contents were not detected in the hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic>. Also hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> leaves were analyzed by GC-MS to identify the presence of chemical compounds. A total of 32 compounds were identified in all the extracts and all the major chemical compounds namely ethanone, 1-cyclohexyl- (27.26%), pentacosane (17.11%), hexacosane (16.57%), tetracosane (15.45%), heptacosane (13.02), tricosane (11.79%), octacosane (9.10%), cyclopentanol, 1-methyl (8.08%), and 2-heptanone, 3-methyl (7.36%) were identified in hexane extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> leaf extracts except p-xylene (10.67%) which was identified in methanol extract (Al-Owaisi et al.,
