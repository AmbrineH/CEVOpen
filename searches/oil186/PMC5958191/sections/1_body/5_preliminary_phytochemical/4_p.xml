<p class="p">Saleh et al. (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported the presence of oleic acid-3 hydroxy propyl ester in oily aqueous extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> seeds. Though, the authors claimed to successfully purify the compound by GLC and TLC techniques and identified by IR, NMR, and GC-MS, the structure details were not provided. Total flavonoid and phenol content of young leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> were quantified by Juhaimi et al. (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The extracts had 35.50 mg catechol gDW
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of total flavonoid and 45.90 mg gallic acid gDW
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of total phenolic compounds. Moreover, the phenolic compounds such as gallic acid (0.930 mg/100 g/DW), protocatechuic acid (0.070 mg/100 g/DW), catechin (0.120 mg/100 g/DW), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.740 mg/100 g/DW), caffeic acid (0.250 mg/100 g/DW), syringic acid (0.08 mg/100 g/DW), rutin trihydrate (0.020 mg/100 g/DW), trans p-coumaric acid (0.140 mg/100 g/DW), chlorogenic acid (0.030 mg/100 g/DW), trans-ferulic acid (0.19 mg/100 g/DW), fisetin (0.030 mg/100 g/DW), trans-resveratrol (0.11), quercetin (0.020 mg/100 g/DW), trans-cinnamic acid (0.270 mg/100 g/DW), naringenin (0.050 mg/100 g/DW), and isorhamnetin (0.330 mg/100 g/DW) were also deducted in 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extracts.
