<p>Essential oil obtained from the medicinal and aromatic plants gained attention as a potential source in pharmaceutical and food industry due to its efficacy and safety. The volatile oils of leaf and seed kernel of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> were analyzed by GC and GC-MS for its chemical composition. Isobutyl isothiocyanate was identified as a major chemical constituent in both leaf and seed kernel oil with 88.5 and 94%, respectively. Other chemical compounds in leaf oil were isopropyl isothiocyanate (10.2%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-butyl isothiocyanate (0.4%), and hexadecanoic acid (0.2%). Trace amount of sec-butyl isothiocyanate was also deducted in the leaf volatile oil of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic>. In seed kernel oil, 4.9% of isopropyl isothiocyanate, 0.5% of sec-butyl isothiocyanate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butyl isothiocyanate were identified. In addition, trace amount of n-tridecane, dihydro-Î±-curcumene, benzyl isothiocyanate, 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentadecane and hexadecanoic acid were also identified in the volatile oil of seed kernel. These compounds were not present in leaf volatile oil of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> except hexadecanoic acid (Afsharypuor et al.,
