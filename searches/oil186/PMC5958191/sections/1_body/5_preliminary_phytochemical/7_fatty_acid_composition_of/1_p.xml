<p class="p">The seed oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> was studied by several researchers for its characteristics and chemical composition, mainly on fatty acid. GC analysis of fatty acid methyl esters of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> seed oil showed the presence of 9 fatty acids 
 <italic class="italic">viz.</italic>, myristic acid (trace), palmitic acid (9.3%), lauric acid (2.4%) stearic acid (3.5%), oleic acid (78.0%), linoleic acid (0.6%), linolenic acid (1.6%), arachidic acid (1.8%), and behenic acid (2.6%). Among the fatty acids detected, 84.7% were unsaturated fatty acids and 14.7% were saturated fatty acids (Somali et al., 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>). Gas-liquid Chromatography analysis of aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> revealed the presence of 13 fatty acids. Palmitic acid was recorded as the major fatty acid (24.68%) followed by myristic acid (16.43%) and linoleic acid (13.60%). Heptadecanoic acid was identified as the lowest (1.38%) fatty acid content. The unsaponifiable matter analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> indicated that Î²-sitosterol as the major (28.79%) steroidal component (Elbatran et al.,
