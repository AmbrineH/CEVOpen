<p>The hydro-alcoholic extract from the dried leaves of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> showed inhibitory potential against three 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model enzyme assays 
 <italic>viz</italic>. α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (Ullah et al., 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The results on pancreatic α-amylase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> extract suggested that the enzyme responded to the extract when the concentration was increased. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the extract was 1335.89 μg/mL. 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> extract demonstrated moderate mammalian intestinal α-Glucosidase enzyme inhibitory potential with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3256.68 μg/mL. Whereas, the extract gradually inhibited the activity of mammalian DPP IV enzyme in a dose dependent manner (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1218.12 μg/mL).
