 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract demonstrated moderate mammalian intestinal α-Glucosidase enzyme inhibitory potential with the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 3256.68 μg/mL. Whereas, the extract gradually inhibited the activity of mammalian DPP IV enzyme in a dose dependent manner (IC
