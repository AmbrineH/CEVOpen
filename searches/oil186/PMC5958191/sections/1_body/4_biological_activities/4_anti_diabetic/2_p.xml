<p>El-Haddad et al. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) reported the antidiabetic activity of hydroalcoholic extract fraction of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> seeds on streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. The administration of hydroalcoholic extract decreased the blood glucose level significantly at the dose of 200 mg/kg b.w. Also the chloroform and petroleum ether fractions decreased the blood glucose level. Furthermore, the histopathological study indicated that the hepatocytes of chloroform treated rats were non toxicated and regenerated the streptozotocin induced diabetic effect. The antidiabetic effect of aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> ethanolic extract on streptozotocin induced diabetic rats was reported by Elbatran et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The extract significantly decreased the levels of serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Also the administration of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> has decreased the serum triglycerides, cholesterol and low density lipoprotein. Whereas, the extract increased the level of high density lipoprotein. In toxicological study, the 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> extract increased the respiration rate, general depression, mucous membrane cyanoses, righting reflex loss, convulsion and death. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of alcoholic extract was 113.4 mg/100 g body weight.
