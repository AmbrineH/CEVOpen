<p class="p">The ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> seeds were studied for their anti-diabetic potential in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats through tissue lipid peroxides and enzymatic antioxidant (Koheil et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Both the extracts were treated by oral administration at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. The results indicated that the blood glucose levels were reduced in the rats administrated with 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> seed extracts and glibenclamide (anti-diabetic drug) when compared to untreated diabetic rats. The results on the levels of thiobarbaturic acid reactive substances, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione and hydroperoxides in liver and kidney of treated rats proved that the administration of aqueous ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> and glibenclamide were tend to bring down the nitric oxide and reduced glutathione values near to the normal level. The enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase were significantly low in liver and kidney of diabetic control rats when compared to the diabetic rats administrated with ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> seeds and glibenclamide. The diabetic rats administrated with the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> and glibenclamide showed a decreased level of glycosylated hemoglobin, increased levels of total hemoglobin and plasma insulin when compared to the diabetic control level.
