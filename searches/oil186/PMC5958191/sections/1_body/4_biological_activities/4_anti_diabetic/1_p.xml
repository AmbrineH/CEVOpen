<p>Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorders that resulted in significant morbidity and mortality rate (Deshpande et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with prolonged dysfunction, damage, and failure of different organs particularly kidneys, heart, eyes, and blood vessels. There is an increasing demand for traditionally used medicinal plants to manage the diabetes mellitus and its complications since the use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents are associated with side effects (Holman and Turner, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Rao et al., 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Furthermore, medicinal plants are inexpensive, easily accessible and less or no toxic. Previously, many medicinal plants including 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> were reported for hypoglycemic properties (Ahmed et al.,
