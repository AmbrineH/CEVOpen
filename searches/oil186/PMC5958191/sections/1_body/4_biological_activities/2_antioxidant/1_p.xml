<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the initiation and progression of number of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, aging, and cirrhosis (Taniyama and Griendling, 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). The previous studies indicated that, extracts from plants could prevent or delay the above mentioned diseases owing to their redox properties, which allow them to act as free radical scavengers, reducing agents, and hydrogen donors (Robards et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Govindarajan et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Along these lines, various extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> were studied for their antioxidant potential. Marwah et al. (

 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>, which are edible and used for wound healing activity. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of the plant showed a good DPPH scavenging potential with the inhibition up to 87.8% and the IC

 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> was 814 mg/g. Though, DPPH scavenging potential assay was widely accepted to determine the antioxidant activity of plant extracts, different test methods should be adopted to confirm the potential of the extracts. This single assay can give only a reductive suggestion, because the crude extracts may contain multiple number of compounds with different functional groups (Sacchetti et al.,
