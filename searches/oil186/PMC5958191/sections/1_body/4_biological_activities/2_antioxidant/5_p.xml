<p>In comparative study, antioxidant activity (
 <italic>viz</italic>. DPPH free radical scavenging potential and total antioxidant capacity) of methanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> were studied and compared with 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> (El-Awady et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Among the extracts studied, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> showed high DPPH scavenging activity (165.49 mg ascorbic acid equivalent g extract) and high reducing power potential (335.89 mg ascorbic acid equivalent/g extract). The leaf extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> showed good DPPH free radical scavenging potential in concentration dependent manner. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the leaf extract was 7.1 μg/ml. While the positive control, ascorbic acid showed the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.6 μg/ml (Azim et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> young leaves showed 74.78% of DPPH free radical inhibition (Juhaimi et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is evident that the reduction of ROS might have helped the management of degenerative diseases (Valko et al., 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
