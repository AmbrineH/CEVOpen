<p class="p">Hypertension is a cardio vascular disease and it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Various anti-hypertensive drugs have been developed for the treatment of hypertension. But the drugs showed efficacy along with associated side effects (Alamgeer et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Investigations on edible and medicinal plants remain important since it has potential benefits (Kalia, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Based on the edible importance as well as the traditional uses, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> was investigated on blood pressure and oxidative status in hypertensive rats induced with dexamethasone. Systolic blood pressure, thymus weight, body weight, plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration, plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power were measured after the treatment. The results of the prevention study proved that the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> prevents the rise of systolic blood pressure at 400 mg/kg dose level. Whereas, the reversal study indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract failed to lower the SBP in dexamethasone induced hypertension in rats. The oral administration of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract had no significant effect on the loss of thymus weight and also the extract was botched to prevent the body weight changes. In contrast, Rouhi-Broujeni et al. (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported that the hydroalcoholic extract from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> decreased the mean body weight. In the prevention study, treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg of extract prevented the rise of H

 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract reduced the elevated plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration. In prevention as well as reversal study, the rats administrated with 400 mg/kg of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract significantly reduced the plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power (Safaeian et al., 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). So, the antihypertensive activity might be linked with the availability of antioxidant molecules present in 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. The antioxidant molecules showed significant role in reducing the level of blood pressure (Duarte et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Jalili et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>).
