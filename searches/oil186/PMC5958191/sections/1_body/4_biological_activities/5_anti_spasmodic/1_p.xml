<p class="p">Antispasmodic drugs are prescribed frequently for numerous gastrointestinal illnesses (N'Guessan et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Most of the antispasmodic drugs contain antimuscarinic compounds and calcium channel blockers (Farhadi et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Pasricha, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) and the consumption of these drugs may associate with unwanted side effects. Medicinal plants which are used in folk and traditional medicine for gastrointestinal disorders have been validated through pharmacological studies for antispasmodic activity (Hajhashemi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Sadraei et al., 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). The results showed that the investigated medicinal plants recorded significant antispasmodic potential (Cortés et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Cechinel-Filho et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Similarly, the anti-spasmodic potential of hydroalcoholic extract from the leaves and seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> was studied by Sadraei et al. (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) by ileum contractions induced by 80 mM KCl, 250 μM of acetylcholine (ACh) and electrical field stimulation (EFS). Both the extracts have an inhibitory potential on ileum contractions. The seeds extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> had more potential inhibitory effect of ileum contraction induced by KCl (IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 87 ± 18 μg/ml); ACh (IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 118 ± 18 μg/ml), and EFS (I IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 230 ± 51 μg/ml). Whereas, the leaf extract also showed inhibitory effect of ileum contraction (KCl—IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 439 ± 108 μg/ml; ACh—IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 365 ± 61 μg/ml; EFS—IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> = 314 ± 92 μg/ml). Further investigation on bio assay guided isolation is required to identify the active molecule which could be an alternative and safer anti-spasmodic molecule for future use.
