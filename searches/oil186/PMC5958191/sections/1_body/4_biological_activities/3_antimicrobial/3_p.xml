<p>Disk diffusion method and the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations were employed to study the antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> seed oil against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. The activities were compared with the standard antibiotics. The results indcated that the oil was effective against all the tested microorganisms. 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> was observed as a most resistant strain among the bacterial and fungal strains. The MIC values of the above mentioned microorganisms were 3.35, 3.50, 4.95, 4.38, 4.80, 4.30, 5.70, 3.30, and 3.25 mg/ml, respectively (Lalas et al.,
