<p class="p">In 1997, Mehdi et al. studied the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> anti hepatitis B viral activity of ethanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> together with 18 other plants parts against HepG2.2.15 cell line (Mehdi et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). The results showed that the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> did not inhibit the cell line and survival rate was 100%. Whereas, Soltan and Zaki (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) screened 42 Egyptian medicinal plants including 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> for their antiviral activity and the authors found that the hydro-alcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> demonstrated antiviral potential against herpes simplex-1 virus at concentrations range between 50 and 100 μg/mL with Rf 104. But, the extract inhibited the host cells growth though the experiment was conducted at the maximum concentration of 100 μg/mL. 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> extract was found to be inactive against poliomyelitis-1 and vesicular stomatitis viruses.
