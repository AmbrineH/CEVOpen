 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hyperlipidemia is closely associated with the coronary heart disease. Hence, lipid lowering therapy alone with the management of other risk factors is advised to prevent the cardiovascular diseases (Jessani et al., 
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">2006</a>). Several drugs are available in the market for lipid related disorders. However, maintenance of lipid homeostasis after the treatment and avoidance of it's the side effect is not an easy task (Pahan, 
  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">2006</a>). Thus, plants with medicinal importance are the promising source of lipid lowering active molecule. Hydroalcoholic extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seeds were studied for lipid lowering activity on hyperlipidemic rats (Rouhi-Broujeni et al., 
  <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">2013</a>) by determining the profile of serum lipid, malondyaldehide, level of thiol, antioxidant capacity, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ferritin and atherogenic index. The results revealed that the extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> significantly reduced the lipid levels such as total cholesterol of plasma, level of LDL-C and VLDL and increased the level of HDL-C in hyperlipidemic rats which is comparable with the lipid lowering activity of the control drug, atorvastatin. Also the level of thiol and carbonyl in the rats administrated with 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract were same as drug treated rats. The high level of antioxidant capacity and a decreased atherogenic index were also observed in the rats treated with 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> extract.
