 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants play a vital role in cultural, social, religious, environmental, and nutritional aspects. Among all other purposes, the use of plants as medicine for human health originated ~60,000 years ago in the mid-Paleolithic age (Solecki, 
  <a rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" href="#B129">1975</a>). To date, 391,000 vascular plants had been identified (Willis and Bachman, 
  <a rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" href="#B145">2016</a>). Of these, only about 6% of plants were screened for their biological activity and 15% for their phytoconstituents (Verpoorte, 
  <a rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" href="#B142">2000</a>). Among those, 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> is one of the most important genuses with outstanding economic importance. This genus is potentially used in traditional medicine, pharmacological screening and chemical constituents identification. The genus 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> consist of 13 species viz., 
  <span class="italic">M. arborea, M. borziana, M. concanensis, M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii, M. longituba, M. oleifera, M. ovalifolia, M. peregrina, M. pygmaea, M. rivae, M. ruspoliana</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">M. stenopetala</span>. The history of 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> dates back to 150 BC. The taxon name 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> was derived from the Tamil word “murunggi” or the Malayalam word “muringa” (Quattrocchi, 
  <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">2000</a>). Historical proof showed that various civilizations viz., Indian, Greek, and Egyptian were using Moringa for thousands of years for several purposes. They preferred to take the leaves and fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> in their diet to maintain their skin health and mental fitness. In the warfront, the ancient Maurian warriors of India were fed the leaf extracts of 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> as it was believed that the decoction relieves them from the pain and stress incurred during the war. Moreover, the drink provides added energy in the war field (Jahn, 
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">1996</a>; Fuglie, 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2001</a>; Manzoor et al., 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2007</a>). Edible oil with pleasant taste (Ben oil) from the seeds of 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> was highly valued by the civilizations of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian for protecting their skin and making perfume. Since the middle and old kingdoms (3000–2000 BC), the ben oil was used by the Egyptians (Miller and Morris, 
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">1988</a>; ICUN, 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">2005</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previous studies on the 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> genus were mainly concentrated on 
  <span class="italic">M. oleifera</span> (Gilani et al., 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">1994</a>; Pal et al.,

  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">2017</a>) since the species is common in Africa and Asia where the common people are search for nutritional foods in an inexpensive way to meet their demand of food sources (Wangcharoen and Gomolanee, 
  <a rid="B144" ref-type="bibr" href="#B144">2011</a>). Recently, 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> is gaining more attention due to traditional, nutritional, industrial and medicinal values. As this plant has wide range of medicinal uses, it has been screened for various pharmacological activities in the past few decades (Marwah et al., 
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">2007</a>; Soltan and Zaki,

  <a rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" href="#B119">2017</a>). Few active molecules were also isolated, identified and reported for various pharmacological activities. An overview of health applications and salient modes of actions of phytoconstituents from 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> are illustrated in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>. Recently, Robiansyah et al. (
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">2014</a>) reviewed the current status of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> on its nutrient content, medicinal properties, phenotypic and genetic variation and conservation status. But there was no much information about traditional medicinal values, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of this plant. Therefore, the present review is aimed to summarize the up-to-date information on the traditional uses, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>.
