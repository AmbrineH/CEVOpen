 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The desirable therapeutic effects of plant extracts may typically result from the combination of two or more compounds. So, the preliminary phytochemical quantification is essential to correlate the biological activity and it may also help to conduct further studies to discover the particular classes of secondary metabolites. Ullah et al. (
  <a rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139">2015</a>) screened the hydro alcoholic extract from the dried leaves of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> for its phytochemical compounds. The preliminary quantification analyses showed the presence of major classes of compounds such as alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, and saponins at different concentrations. These phytochemicals are considered to possess extensive range of biological activities (Ramawat et al., 
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">2009</a>). Saponin was recorded in high concentration in the hydroalcoholic extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> when compared to other compounds. Dehshahri et al. (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2012</a>) reported the presence of flavonoid glycoside (rutin) in the air dried methanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. But the authors were abortive to provide the detailed spectral and structure information.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study was made to quantify the total phenol and flavonoid contents in hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaves. The total content of phenols in chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol were 75.53, 81.26, and 94.56 GAE/g of dry extract, respectively. The results on the total content of flavonoids revealed that 6.55, 8.39, and 20.81 mg of QE/g were present in chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaves, respectively. On the other hand, phenol and flavonoid contents were not detected in the hexane extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. Also hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaves were analyzed by GC-MS to identify the presence of chemical compounds. A total of 32 compounds were identified in all the extracts and all the major chemical compounds namely ethanone, 1-cyclohexyl- (27.26%), pentacosane (17.11%), hexacosane (16.57%), tetracosane (15.45%), heptacosane (13.02), tricosane (11.79%), octacosane (9.10%), cyclopentanol, 1-methyl (8.08%), and 2-heptanone, 3-methyl (7.36%) were identified in hexane extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaf extracts except p-xylene (10.67%) which was identified in methanol extract (Al-Owaisi et al.,

Isobutyl isothiocyanate was identified as a major chemical constituent in both leaf and seed kernel oil with 88.5 and 94%, respectively. Other chemical compounds in leaf oil were isopropyl isothiocyanate (10.2%),
