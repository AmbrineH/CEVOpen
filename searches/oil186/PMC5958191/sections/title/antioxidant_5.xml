 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the initiation and progression of number of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, aging, and cirrhosis (Taniyama and Griendling, 
  <a rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137">2003</a>). The previous studies indicated that, extracts from plants could prevent or delay the above mentioned diseases owing to their redox properties, which allow them to act as free radical scavengers, reducing agents, and hydrogen donors (Robards et al., 
  <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">1999</a>; Govindarajan et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>). Along these lines, various extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were studied for their antioxidant potential. Marwah et al. (
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">2007</a>) studied the antioxidant potential of some plants growing in Sultanate of Oman including 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>, which are edible and used for wound healing activity. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of the plant showed a good DPPH scavenging potential with the inhibition up to 87.8% and the IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 7.6 μg/ml. The total antioxidant potential as gallic acid equivalents of ethanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was 814 mg/g. Though, DPPH scavenging potential assay was widely accepted to determine the antioxidant activity of plant extracts, different test methods should be adopted to confirm the potential of the extracts. This single assay can give only a reductive suggestion, because the crude extracts may contain multiple number of compounds with different functional groups (Sacchetti et al., 
  <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">2005</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Koheil et al. (
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2011</a>) studied the antioxidant potential of aqueous and ethanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seeds. Reducing power, chelating effect of ferrous ions, DPPH free radical scavenging potential, superoxide anion scavenging potential, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability were investigated to find out the antioxidant ability of both ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. It was observed that the reducing power of the extracts was proportionally increased when the concentration was increased equally. At a concentration of 20 μg/ml, the ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed similar reducing power potential similar to that of positive control α-tocopherol (20 μg/ml). The results of the chelating potential of the extracts showed that the activity increased when the concentration was enhanced and chelating activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts were 60 and 37%, respectively at the dose level of 1.50 mg/ml at 90 mts. However, at 1.0 mg/ml concentration the chelating activity of ethanol extract was nearly equal to the positive control EDTA. The ethanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity at the concentration of 6 mg/ml when compared to control. Whereas, 6 mg/ml concentration of aqueous extract showed free radical scavenging potential which was nearly equal to trolox. Superoxide anion scavenging potential of ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were studied at different concentrations 
  <span class="italic">viz</span>. 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml and the activity was compared at the same concentration of BHA, ascorbic acid, and trolox. The results revealed that both the extracts showed good superoxide anion scavenging ability than BHA and nearly equal activity to ascorbic acid and trolox. Hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging potential of both the extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> indicated that the activity was in the manner of concentration dependent. Ethanol and aqueous extracts scavenged 79 and 65% of hydrogen peroxide radicals respectively at a dose of 100 μg/ml. Whereas, at the same concentration, control α-tocopherol, BHA, and BHT scavenged 75, 35, and 28%, respectively. It was observed that, both the extracts showed same hydroxyl radical scavenging potential at the concentration of 20 and 40 μg/ml. On the other hand, 20–40 μg/ml concentration of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> ethanol extract showed good hydroxyl radical scavenging potential than the ascorbic acid.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaves was studied for DPPH free radical and superoxide anion scavenging potential (Dehshahri et al., 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2012</a>). The results revealed that the extract scavenged the DPPH radical and superoxide anion radicals with the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 8.06 and 47.93 μg/ml, respectively. 
  <span class="italic">In vitro</span> antioxidant activity of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaves was studied through the DPPH and H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> scavenging potential. All the extracts showed dose dependent DPPH scavenging potential with the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 22.36 (hexane), 17.44 (chloroform), 21.87 (ethyl acetate), and 17.07 μg/mL (methanol). The hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed significant H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> potential when compared to control. The highest H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> radical scavenging potential was observed at 100 μg/mL of all extracts (Al-Owaisi et al., 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2014</a>). The antioxidant activity of the plant samples may also be influenced by the solvents used (Abrahim et al., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2012</a>). Furthermore, polar paradox and polar antioxidants are more potent in lipophilic media whereas nonpolar antioxidants are more active in the polar media (Ramadan and Moersel, 
  <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">2006</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moustafa et al. (
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">2014</a>) studied the antioxidant activity of methanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> along with 199 other wild and cultivated plants in Egypt. DPPH free radical scavenging assay was used to screen the extracts for preliminary antioxidant potential. The methanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed good antioxidant potential (EC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 4.4 μg/mL). Antioxidant activity of hydro-alcoholic extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was reported by Ullah et al. (
  <a rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139">2015</a>). The extract scavenged the ABTS
  <span class="sup">∙+</span> radical in dose dependent manner and the IC
  <sub>50</sub> value was 20.56 μg/mL. Elabd et al. (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2017</a>) reported that the seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed DPPH scavenging potential at 172 mMol Trolox equivalent/kg.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In comparative study, antioxidant activity (
  <span class="italic">viz</span>. DPPH free radical scavenging potential and total antioxidant capacity) of methanol and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were studied and compared with 
  <span class="italic">M. oleifera</span> (El-Awady et al., 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2016</a>). Among the extracts studied, the methanol extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed high DPPH scavenging activity (165.49 mg ascorbic acid equivalent g extract) and high reducing power potential (335.89 mg ascorbic acid equivalent/g extract). The leaf extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> showed good DPPH free radical scavenging potential in concentration dependent manner. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of the leaf extract was 7.1 μg/ml. While the positive control, ascorbic acid showed the IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 4.6 μg/ml (Azim et al., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2017</a>). The extract of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> young leaves showed 74.78% of DPPH free radical inhibition (Juhaimi et al., 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">2017</a>). It is evident that the reduction of ROS might have helped the management of degenerative diseases (Valko et al., 
  <a rid="B140" ref-type="bibr" href="#B140">2006</a>).
