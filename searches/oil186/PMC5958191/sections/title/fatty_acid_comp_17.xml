 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was studied by several researchers for its characteristics and chemical composition, mainly on fatty acid. GC analysis of fatty acid methyl esters of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seed oil showed the presence of 9 fatty acids 
  <span class="italic">viz.</span>, myristic acid (trace), palmitic acid (9.3%), lauric acid (2.4%) stearic acid (3.5%), oleic acid (78.0%), linoleic acid (0.6%), linolenic acid (1.6%), arachidic acid (1.8%), and behenic acid (2.6%). Among the fatty acids detected, 84.7% were unsaturated fatty acids and 14.7% were saturated fatty acids (Somali et al., 
  <a rid="B132" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132">1984</a>). Gas-liquid Chromatography analysis of aerial parts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> revealed the presence of 13 fatty acids. Palmitic acid was recorded as the major fatty acid (24.68%) followed by myristic acid (16.43%) and linoleic acid (13.60%). Heptadecanoic acid was identified as the lowest (1.38%) fatty acid content. The unsaponifiable matter analysis of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> indicated that β-sitosterol as the major (28.79%) steroidal component (Elbatran et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2005</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1998, Tsaknis reported the full characterization and chemical composition of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregria</span> seed oil collected from the Kondom of Saudi Arabia (Tsaknis, 
  <a rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" href="#B138">1998</a>). The degummed oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregria</span> had ten fatty acids namely capric acid (0.08%), myristic acid (0.10%), palmitic acid (8.90%), stearic acid (3.82%), oleic acid (70.52%), linoleic acid (0.62%), arachidic acid (1.94%), paullinic acid (1.50%), behenic acid (2.36%), and erucic acid (0.49%). Similar results were obtained with the oil of the seeds collected from Wadi Fenan, Jordan (Al-Dabbas et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2010</a>). The analysis of the seed oil showed the presence of high amount of unsaturated fatty acids (83.5%) than saturated fatty acids (16.53%). Among that oleic acid was identified as the major one (74.81%) followed by palmitic acid (8.95), oleic acid (3.72%), stearic acid (3.08%), behenic acid (2.59%), palmitoleic acid (2.28%), arachidic acid (1.73%), eicosenoic acid (1.62%), lingnoceric acid (0.46%), linoleic acid (0.46%), margaric acid (0.12%), myristic acid (0.08%), margaroleic acid (0.08%), and linolenic acid (0.05%). Furthermore, sterol composition analysis of both the oils showed that β-sitosterol as the major one followed by stigmasterol, campesterol and δ-5-avenasterol.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC analysis showed that the seed oil of Iranian 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> contains 82.6% of unsaturated and 17.2% of saturated fatty acid contents. Oleic acid (77.9%) was found to be the major fatty acid followed by palmitic acid (9.3%), stearic acid (3.5%), behenic acid (2.6%) acid, palmitoleic acid (2.5%), arachidic acid (1.8%), linolenic acid (1.6%), and linoleic acid (0.6%) (Gharibzahedi et al.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid composition analysis of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> seed oil by Al-Rawashdeh et al. (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2013</a>) revealed that a total of 13 fatty acids were detected in the oil. Oleic acid (78.79%) was identified as the dominant fatty acid, followed by palmitic acid (8.17%), stearic acid (3.85%), behenic acid (2.60%), arachidoic acid (1.99%), palmitoleic acid (1.87%), gadoleic acid (1.57%), linoleic acid (0.47%), lignoceric acid (0.42%), heptadecanoic acid (0.11%), myristic acid (0.07%), heptadecenoic acid (0.07%), and linolenic acid (0.02%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid composition of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> leaf oil was investigated along with two other 
  <span class="italic">Moringa</span> species (Al-Juhaimi et al., 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2016</a>). A total of 12 fatty acids were detected in the leaf oil and linolenic acid recorded the highest (32.53%). Furthermore, considerable amount of linoleic acid (19.5%), palmitic acid (17.6%), oleic acid (7.14%), and arachidic (4.85%) were also detected by GC analysis. Other fatty acids present in the leaf oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were myristic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid, lignoceric acid, behenic acid, and erucic acid with 2.27, 1.96, 1.42, 1.37, 1.19, and 0.76%, respectively. The fatty acid composition analysis (Elabd et al., 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2017</a>) revealed that the seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> contained palmitic acid (10%), linoleic acid (0.42%), oleic acid (78.33%), linolenic acid (2.75%), stearic acid (4.85%), arachidic acid (1.42%), and behenic acid (2.15%).
