 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resistance in cancer therapy is a serious issue and it remains as a major cause of death (Batist et al., 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2011</a>). The resistance can be developed through various biological mechanisms including reduced drug uptake, increased drug efflux and cellular pathway changes (Tan et al., 
  <a rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136">2016</a>). It is well-known that plant molecules can be an alternative to the synthetic anticancer drugs to overcome its resistance. Globally, more than 3000 plants have been studied for anticancer properties (Solowey et al., 
  <a rid="B130" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130">2014</a>) including 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span>. 
  <span class="italic">In vitro</span> anti-cancer properties of seed oil of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> was studied on various cell lines such as MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), HepG2 (liver cancer cell line), CACO-2 (colon cancer cell line), HeLa (cervical cancer cell line), and L929 (mouse fibroblasts). A significant cytotoxic potential was observed against all the cell lines tested and activity was dose dependent manner. One milligram of the seed oil showed the highest cytotoxic potential against the tested cell lines. Cell viability decreased to 24.65, 24.18, 42.51, 46.57, and 32.11% and the IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of the oil were 366.3, 604.3, 850.9, 721.7, and 935.8 Î¼g/mL for HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, CACO-2, and L929 cell lines, respectively (Elsayed et al., 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2016</a>). Based on these results, extensive investigation on the isolation of anticancer molecule is recommended. It could help to overcome the resistance issue as well the lowering the treatment cost.
