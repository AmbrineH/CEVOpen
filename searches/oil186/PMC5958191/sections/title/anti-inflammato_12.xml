 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many physiological processes, inflammation is an essential part in response to host defense and the damage of tissues. After injury, the wound healing process starts immediately and the processes comprise of three phases 
  <span class="italic">viz</span>. inflammation, proliferation, and maturation. The first phase provides resistance to the microbial contaminations (Kondo, 
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">2007</a>) and the anti-inflammatory activity is essential to minimize the healing period (Shimizu et al., 
  <a rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126">2000</a>). Ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
  <span class="italic">M. peregrina</span> were studied for anti-inflammatory potential using fresh egg albumin induced inflammation (oedema) in rats (Koheil et al., 
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2011</a>). The results revealed that the aqueous and ethanol extracts significantly reduced the acute inflammation induced by fresh egg albumin. At a dose level of 300 mg/kg, aqueous and ethanol extracts reduced the inflammation by 72.96 and 81.01%, respectively at the third hour after the oedema was induced. Whereas, the control drug diclofenac at the dose level of 100 mg/kg reduced the inflammation by 100% at the third hour.
