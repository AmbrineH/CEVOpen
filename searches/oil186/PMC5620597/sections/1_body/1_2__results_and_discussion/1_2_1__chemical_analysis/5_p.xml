<p class="p">Despite the observation that in the field conditions the total essential oil yield was decreasing after successive harvests the individual components, prevalent in basil, like linalool and eugenol seem to follow an opposite pattern. Linalool in var. latifolia was beyond 32.2% in all harvests and in the last harvest reached 49.5% while in var. minimum the percentage of linalool was in all harvests above 30.0% and in the second harvest reached 52.0% in the total essential oil concentration. Furtermore, although the concentrations of linalool in var. lettuce for both cultivation conditions were similar, compound methyl-chavicol showed a remarkable difference reaching 54.1% of the EO in the second harvest in the field conditions, whereas in the greenhouse conditions the higher concentration measured, was 17.5% in the first harvest (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). These data suggest that changes in the environmental conditions can alter the biosynthesis of individual essential oils’ components. Ložienė et al. (2004) have reached similar conclusion while studying the influence of environmental and genetic factors in

Moreover, the combination of the harvest stress with the unstable field conditions seems to promote the biosynthesis of individual components. In addition to this, the observed decrease in the EO yield in the field conditions during harvests can be attributed to the partial evaporation of the essential oil from the plant surface.
