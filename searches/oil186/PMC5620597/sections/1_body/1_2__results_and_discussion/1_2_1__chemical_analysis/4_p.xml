<p>In the field conditions, the main constituents of var. latifolia were linalool (32.2–49.5%), eugenol (19.8–34.9%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-bergamontene (5.9–9.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.2–6.7%). In var. minimun linalool (30.2–52.0%) and eugenol (28.8–36.0%), were the dominating compounds. Var. lettuce has as major components linalool (20.4–26.0%) and methyl-chavicol (45.4–54.1%). The latter constituent was dominating also in the essential oil of var. cinnamon in a range 61.2–75.1% among harvests (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</xref>). Between harvests and cultivation sites, the main compounds of the essential oils displayed varying concentrations. The highest concentration for linalool (52.0%) was measured in var. minimum in the field cultivation, in the second harvest in contrast to what has been stated from Zheljazkof et al. (2008) that measures a higher content of linalool in the third cutting of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> varieties [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interesting is the fact that eugenol showed the highest concentration in var. minimum in the first harvest in the field conditions. Noteworthy, from var. minimum methyl-chavicol is lacking or is present in small amounts. Given that methyl-chavicol has a structural resemblance to potential carcinogenic phenylpropanoids such as safrole, chemotypes rich in linalool are preferred for cultivation when used in food and perfume industries [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Methyl-chavicol showed the highest concentration (75.1%) in var. cinnamon in the field conditions from the first harvest followed by var. lettuce (54.1%) from the first harvest in the same conditions. In addition, it has been observed that the intensity of purple leaf colour is positively correlated in varieties rich in methyl chavicol [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, in compliance with Liber et al. (2011), our results show that the biosynthesis of phenylopropanoids e.g., methyl chavicol, is not characteristic exclusively for the purple morfotypes. Also, green morfotypes (var. lettuce and cinnamon) are rich sources of methyl chavicol as well. [
