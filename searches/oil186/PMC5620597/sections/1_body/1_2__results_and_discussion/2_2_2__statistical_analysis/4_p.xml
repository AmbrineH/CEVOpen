<p>Considering that in both field and greenhouse the conditions were same for all of the varieties, the observed variations can be attributed to the ability of each variety to react to the stressing factor of harvesting. The grouping obtained for the examined basil varieties in greenhouse and field conditions, provides significant data about the effect of harvesting and cultivation site in the chemical composition of basil essential oils. A comparison of Cluster 1 between field and greenhouse conditions reveals that in var. latifolia, between harvests, shifts are observed in the chemotype by alterations in the biosynthesis of essential oils’ components. These results are in compliance with the study of Božović et al. (2017), in EOs obtained from 
 <italic>Calamintha nepeta</italic> (L.) Savi subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosa,</italic> indicating that the main compounds were stable, but the ratio between them varied greatly according to the growth stage [

Especially in var. lettuce it is obvious that apart from the harvest factor, the cultivation site also affects the chemical profile of the obtained EO. Observation of cluster 3 from field cultivation and cluster 4 from greenhouse cultivation reveals a different chemical profile in the EOs obtained for the same variety. As such, these results imply that the cultivation site should also be considered as factor affecting the composition of EOs, apart from the number of harvests. The variations of the chemical profile of the five basil varieties are in accordance with the results of Verma et al. (2013) where different 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> populations belonging to the “basilicum” group are distributed to different clusters [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The alteration in the chemical profile of the essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Miller between harvests was also indicated by Garzoli et al. (2017). Researchers showed that while 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>a</italic>-phellandrene were dominating compounds in the first two harvests, EO from the last harvest was characterized by a high content of methyl-chavichol (estragole) [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cluster analysis has been proved as a useful tool in the attempt of an evaluation of chemotypes among essential oil bearing plants. However, in 
 <italic>O. basilicum’s</italic> case, the numerous synonymous names, varieties, and inerspecific hybridization along with the several factors that affecting essential oils’ composition make this process extremely difficult [
