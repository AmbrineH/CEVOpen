<p>Taking into account the EO content similarities between harvests for the varieties cultivated in the greenhouse, four clusters were formed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Cluster 1 consists of samples OCK1, OCK3, and OCP4, with linalool, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamontene, and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 2 consists of samples OCP5, OCS6, and OCS7, with linalool and eugenol as the dominant components. Cluster 3 is “simplicifolious” and consists of OCK2 with major constituents linalool and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamontene. Finally, cluster 4 consists of OCM8, OCM9, and OCM10 with major components linalool, methyl chavichol, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamontene (
