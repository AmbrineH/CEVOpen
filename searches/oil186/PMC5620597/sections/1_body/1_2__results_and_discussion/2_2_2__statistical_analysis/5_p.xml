<p>The obtained data can serve as a guide for cultivation conditions and the harvesting of basil varieties in this geographical region in order to obtain maximum essential oil yield along with certain metabolites or mixtures of them in the composition of the essential oil. Comparing to the literature data about basil chemical composition, current results are in accordance about the yield of essential oil produced. Additionally, they are very promising concerning the composition of them to important constituents like linalool, eugenol, and methyl chavicol. Environmental conditions, like temperature, humidity, and soil conditions, in the island of Kefalonia affect the chemical profile of the cultivated basil varieties and favor the production of bioactive compounds like linalool [
