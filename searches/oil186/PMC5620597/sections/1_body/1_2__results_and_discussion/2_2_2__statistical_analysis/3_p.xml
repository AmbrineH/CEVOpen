<p>Cultivation conditions in the field defined the dominant constituents for the formation of four clusters in the dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-06-00041-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The similarities observed between harvests and varieties characterized the clusters as: Cluster 1 consisting of samples OCP11, OCP12, OCP13, OCS15, and OCS17 with linalool, eugenol, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamontene as major components. Cluster 2 consists of OCP14 and OCS16 with linalool and eugenol as major components. Cluster 3 consists of OCM18, OCM19, and OCM20, with methyl chavicol and linalool as major components. Finally, cluster 4 is “simplicifolious” and consists of samples OCC21, OCC22, and OCC23, with methyl-chavicol as the dominant component (
