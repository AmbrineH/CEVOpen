<p class="p">GC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5973-6890 system operating in EI mode (70 eV) equipped with a split/splitless injector (220 °C), a split ratio 1/10, using a fused silica HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d.), film thickness: 0.25 μm). The temperature program for HP-5 MS column was from 60 °C (5 min) to 280 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injection volume for all samples, diluted as previously described, was 2 μL.</p>
