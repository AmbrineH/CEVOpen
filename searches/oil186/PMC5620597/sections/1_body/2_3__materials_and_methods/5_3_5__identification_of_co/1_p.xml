<p class="p">Retention indices for all compounds were determined according to the Van der Dool approach [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] with reference to a homologous series of normal 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes from C
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9</sub> to C
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">23</sub>. The identification of the components was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley and NBS Libraries and those described by Adams (2007), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with literature data [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Component relative percentages were calculated based on GC-FID peak areas without using correction factors.
