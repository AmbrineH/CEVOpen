 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5. Identification of Components</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Retention indices for all compounds were determined according to the Van der Dool approach [
  <a rid="B32-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-plants-06-00041">32</a>] with reference to a homologous series of normal 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes from C
  <sub>9</sub> to C
  <sub>23</sub>. The identification of the components was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley and NBS Libraries and those described by Adams (2007), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with literature data [
  <a rid="B33-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-plants-06-00041">33</a>]. Component relative percentages were calculated based on GC-FID peak areas without using correction factors.
