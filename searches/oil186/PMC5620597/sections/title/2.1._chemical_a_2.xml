 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the greenhouse conditions the essential oil (EO) content of varieties violetto, latifolia, and minimum increased in the second and/or third harvest, whereas in var. lettuce the second harvest produced less essential oil content when comparing to the first and third harvest where the essential oil content was in the same levels. Noteworthy is the fact, that in the field conditions, the essential oil content in the varieties of latifolia, minimum and lettuce decreased gradually after the successive harvests while in var. cinnamon sequential harvests didn’t affect overall essential oil yield (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t001" href="#plants-06-00041-t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results indicate that different cultivation conditions affect plant’s response to successive harvests and consequently the essential oil content, even of the same variety. As such controlled greenhouse conditions favor or have no impact to the total production of essential oil in the varieties latifolia, minimum, and lettuce when comparing to the field conditions. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All obtained essential oils were analyzed with GC/FID and GC/MS. In total, 96 individual constituents were identified representing 98.0–99.9% of the total essential oil. The detailed chemical analysis of the essential oils of the greenhouse samples showed that the major constituents, in var. violetto, were linalool (22.5–26.5%) and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (15.2–20.0%), followed by eugenol (4.5–11.9%). Variety latifolia has as major compounds linalool (17.1–35.6%), eugenol (10.1–23.3%) and 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (8.8–16.1%). In var. minimum linalool (27.4–28.3%) and eugenol (14.5–23.4%) were the main constituents while in var. lettuce linalool (21.0–23.6%), methyl chavicol (12.1–17.5%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (11.4–12.9%) and 
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-α-cadinol (6.0–9.2%) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t002" href="#plants-06-00041-t002">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the field conditions, the main constituents of var. latifolia were linalool (32.2–49.5%), eugenol (19.8–34.9%), 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-bergamontene (5.9–9.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.2–6.7%). In var. minimun linalool (30.2–52.0%) and eugenol (28.8–36.0%), were the dominating compounds. Var. lettuce has as major components linalool (20.4–26.0%) and methyl-chavicol (45.4–54.1%). The latter constituent was dominating also in the essential oil of var. cinnamon in a range 61.2–75.1% among harvests (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). Between harvests and cultivation sites, the main compounds of the essential oils displayed varying concentrations. The highest concentration for linalool (52.0%) was measured in var. minimum in the field cultivation, in the second harvest in contrast to what has been stated from Zheljazkof et al. (2008) that measures a higher content of linalool in the third cutting of 
  <span class="italic">O. basilicum</span> varieties [
  <a rid="B9-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-plants-06-00041">9</a>]. Interesting is the fact that eugenol showed the highest concentration in var. minimum in the first harvest in the field conditions. Noteworthy, from var. minimum methyl-chavicol is lacking or is present in small amounts. Given that methyl-chavicol has a structural resemblance to potential carcinogenic phenylpropanoids such as safrole, chemotypes rich in linalool are preferred for cultivation when used in food and perfume industries [
  <a rid="B15-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-plants-06-00041">15</a>,
  <a rid="B20-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-plants-06-00041">20</a>]. Methyl-chavicol showed the highest concentration (75.1%) in var. cinnamon in the field conditions from the first harvest followed by var. lettuce (54.1%) from the first harvest in the same conditions. In addition, it has been observed that the intensity of purple leaf colour is positively correlated in varieties rich in methyl chavicol [
  <a rid="B21-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-plants-06-00041">21</a>]. However, in compliance with Liber et al. (2011), our results show that the biosynthesis of phenylopropanoids e.g., methyl chavicol, is not characteristic exclusively for the purple morfotypes. Also, green morfotypes (var. lettuce and cinnamon) are rich sources of methyl chavicol as well. [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the observation that in the field conditions the total essential oil yield was decreasing after successive harvests the individual components, prevalent in basil, like linalool and eugenol seem to follow an opposite pattern. Linalool in var. latifolia was beyond 32.2% in all harvests and in the last harvest reached 49.5% while in var. minimum the percentage of linalool was in all harvests above 30.0% and in the second harvest reached 52.0% in the total essential oil concentration. Furtermore, although the concentrations of linalool in var. lettuce for both cultivation conditions were similar, compound methyl-chavicol showed a remarkable difference reaching 54.1% of the EO in the second harvest in the field conditions, whereas in the greenhouse conditions the higher concentration measured, was 17.5% in the first harvest (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t002" href="#plants-06-00041-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). These data suggest that changes in the environmental conditions can alter the biosynthesis of individual essential oils’ components. Ložienė et al. (2004) have reached similar conclusion while studying the influence of environmental and genetic factors in 
  <span class="italic">Thymus pulegioides</span>’ essential oil [
  <a rid="B23-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-plants-06-00041">23</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached also by Awadh Ali et al. (2017) while studying the EO content of 
  <span class="italic">O. forskolei</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium yemense</span> collected from different regions of Yemen [
  <a rid="B24-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-plants-06-00041">24</a>]. In parallel, var. cinnamon grown in the field conditions has methyl-chavicol as major constituent reaching 75.1% of the EO content, in the first harvest (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="plants-06-00041-t003" href="#plants-06-00041-t003">Table 3</a>). It seems that the unstable field conditions, in combination with successive harvests affect and promote the metabolic pathway of L-phenylalanine and cinnamic acid [
  <a rid="B25-plants-06-00041" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-plants-06-00041">25</a>], in var. latifolia, minimum and lettuce that leads to the production of methyl chavicol and eugenol. Moreover, the combination of the harvest stress with the unstable field conditions seems to promote the biosynthesis of individual components. In addition to this, the observed decrease in the EO yield in the field conditions during harvests can be attributed to the partial evaporation of the essential oil from the plant surface.
