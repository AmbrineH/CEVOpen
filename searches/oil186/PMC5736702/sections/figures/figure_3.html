 <p class="p" xmlns=""> Nanoscale geochemical and geomechanical characterization. Inertinite ( a), solid bitumen ( b), and Tasmanites ( c) in stiffness images are identified by comparison with photomicrograph of the same field (Figs.  1a and  2a). Areas outside of regions of interest are masked with opaque color to screen out irrelevant contact resonance (CR) frequency measurements. CR frequency histogram for 130.74 μm 2 area of inertinite ( d), 272.97 μm 2 area of solid bitumen ( e), and 201.67 μm 2 area of Tasmanites ( f).
