  <p>Compositional trends in the maturation of individual macerals. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Average localized infrared (IR) spectra from three or more different solid bitumen particles in untreated and artificially matured New Albany Shale samples, with solid bitumen reflectance (BR
   <sub>o</sub>) ranging from 0.25% to 1.17%. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Average localized IR spectra from different locations in 1–2 inertinite particles in samples with BR
   <sub>o</sub> of 0.25 and 0.90%. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Average localized IR spectra from different locations in 1–2 
   <span class="italic">Tasmanites </span>particles in samples with BR
   <sub>o</sub> of 0.25 and 0.65%. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Pseudo van Krevelen diagram, constructed by plotting the IR proxy for H/C and O/C atomic ratios of 
   <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span>, solid bitumen, and inertinite at different maturities. Solid bitumen reflectance values are indicated adjacent to calculated IR ratios (T, 
   <span class="italic">Tasmanites</span>; B, solid bitumen; and I, inertinite)
