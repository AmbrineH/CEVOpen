 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and Rock-Eval II (a programmed pyrolysis method) are routine source rock geochemistry characterization methods, allowing evaluation of the amount, type and thermal maturity of organic matter present. TOC and Rock-Eval were carried out in a commercial laboratory following methods previously described in Barker

  </span> and Peters et al.
  <span class="sup">

  </span> Leco TOC measurements were performed by combustion of acidified pulverized rock to quantify organic richness. Rock-Eval II pyrolysis measures hydrocarbon generating potential and thermal maturity. Rock-Eval heats samples in programmed stages ranging from 100 to 850 °C, yielding four parameters: S1 measures the amount of vaporized free hydrocarbons, S2 measures the amount of hydrocarbons generated through thermal cracking of nonvolatile organic matter, S3 measures the amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> produced during pyrolysis, and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>max</sub> (pyrolysis temperature during maximum generation of hydrocarbons). S1, S2, and S3 are used to compute hydrogen, oxygen, and production indices [HI: 100 × S2/TOC; OI: 100 × S3/TOC; PI: S1/(S1 + S2)]. HI and OI determine the organic matter type, whereas

  <sub>max</sub> and PI represent the thermal maturity of organic matter.
