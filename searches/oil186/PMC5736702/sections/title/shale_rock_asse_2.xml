 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An OM-rich shale sample from Middle Devonian-Lower Mississippian New Albany Shale is chosen because it holds abundant, distinct, and readily identified macerals. The New Albany Shale sample is organic-rich, with total organic carbon (TOC) content of 14.2 wt.% (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The computed hydrogen index (HI) and oxygen index (OI) from Rock-Eval show the OM contains relatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio and low oxygen/carbon ratio. The sample is immature, with 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>max</sub> &lt; 435 °C and production index (PI) &lt; 0.10, suggesting it is at the onset of oil generation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. This assessment agrees with solid bitumen reflectance (BR
  <sub>o</sub>) of 0.25% as measured by optical microscopy. Solid bitumen reflectance is used here instead of conventional maturity indicators (e.g., vitrinite reflectance) owing to scarcity and difficulty in identification of vitrinite particles

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrous pyrolysis of organic-rich shale at high temperature (320–360 °C) is used to simulate thermal maturation that takes place over millions of years in a sedimentary basin, providing a direct test of the impact of maturity, uncomplicated by other factors such as variation in mineralogy

  </span>. To understand how OM composition evolves with maturity, the immature New Albany Shale sample is pyrolyzed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 360 °C for 72 h, resulting in BR
  <sub>o</sub> values ranging from 0.41 to 1.17%. A linear relationship between pyrolysis temperature and BR
  <sub>o</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) indicates BR
  <sub>o</sub> can be used to represent thermal maturity. The samples range from immature to late mature, including the onset of oil generation, early/peak oil generation, and late oil/early wet gas generation. TOC and Rock-Eval tests (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) on the original New Albany Shale and its hydrous pyrolysis residues show systematic decrease in TOC, S2, and HI, as well as increase in 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>max</sub> and PI, with increasing hydrous pyrolysis temperature, indicating systematic increase in thermal maturity and conversion of OM to petroleum.
