<p id="Par20" class="p">Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and Rock-Eval II (a programmed pyrolysis method) are routine source rock geochemistry characterization methods, allowing evaluation of the amount, type and thermal maturity of organic matter present. TOC and Rock-Eval were carried out in a commercial laboratory following methods previously described in Barker

 </sup> Leco TOC measurements were performed by combustion of acidified pulverized rock to quantify organic richness. Rock-Eval II pyrolysis measures hydrocarbon generating potential and thermal maturity. Rock-Eval heats samples in programmed stages ranging from 100 to 850 °C, yielding four parameters: S1 measures the amount of vaporized free hydrocarbons, S2 measures the amount of hydrocarbons generated through thermal cracking of nonvolatile organic matter, S3 measures the amount of CO

S1, S2, and S3 are used to compute hydrogen, oxygen, and production indices [HI: 100 × S2/TOC; OI: 100 × S3/TOC; PI: S1/(S1 + S2)]. HI and OI determine the organic matter type, whereas
