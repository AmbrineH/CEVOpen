 </sup>. The parameters are fitted to the experimental envelope by a least squares iterative procedure. All peaks centers, peak amplitudes, peak half-widths, relative fraction of Lorentzian character for the fit are allowed to vary from initial guesses. Generally, the solved peak centers are typically within a few centimeters from the initialization. The IR structural parameters, namely, Aromaticity, CH
