<p id="Par23">Localized IR spectra were collected and analyzed using Analysis Studio software (version 3.11.5883, Anasys Instruments) and MATLAB program. IR focus is optimized at 1450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> prior to the data collection and all IR spectra are normalized to the incident power. IR spectra are acquired from 1300 to 1800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2800 to 3100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with an interval of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and averaging each data point over 256 pulses. The spectral acquisition time is around 5 min. The localized IR spectra is first smoothed using a three-point average in Analysis Studio, followed by linear baseline removal, normalized, and plotted in MATLAB.
