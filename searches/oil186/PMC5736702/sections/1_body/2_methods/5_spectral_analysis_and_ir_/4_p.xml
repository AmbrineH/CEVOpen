<p id="Par26">The 1500–1800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region contains overlapping absorbance bands associated with oxygenated and aromatic carbon groups. The broad absorbance 1600–1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to aromatic carbon–carbon stretching, and it can be resolved as two distinct peaks in the spectra of organic materials centered at 1610 and 1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. A
 <sub>1600–1630</sub> represents the integrated peak intensity of the aromatic C=C vibrations centered at 1610 and 1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The 1450 and 1375 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> absorption signals are due to aliphatic C–H bending. C-factor represents the intensity ratio of the oxygenated versus aromatic functional groups. A-factor is the intensity ratio of aliphatic/ (aliphatic + aromatic) bands. A-factor is calculated slightly different from Craddock’s method

 </sup>. The integrated peak area under 1450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is used instead of the area under 2857 and 2925 as the aliphatic absorption bands. This is because the pulsed optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser used in the nano-IR instrument has two distinct stages. The laser spot size and focus is different in the different stages, thus it is difficult to compute quantitative IR ratios using intensity values from two different stages.
