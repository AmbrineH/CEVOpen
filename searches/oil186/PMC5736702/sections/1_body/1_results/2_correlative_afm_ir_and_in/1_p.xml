<p id="Par9">Macerals of interest in the New Albany Shale are imaged and identified by incident light microscopy and then registered and imaged by AFM-IR. In the unpyrolyzed (immature) sample, abundant solid bitumen (gray solid hydrocarbon residue from amorphous organic matter conversion) and 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> (a unicellular planktonic marine alga) are present, along with minor inertinite (remains of carbonized wood) fractions. For example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the incident white light microscopy image, illustrating discrete solid bitumen and inertinite macerals from the unpyrolyzed immature New Albany Shale sample. The field of view in this image is 30 × 30 µm
 <sup>2</sup>, comparable to a single pixel in a traditional micro-FTIR instrument. The AFM-IR measurements are performed in the same area, including images of high-resolution topography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), IR absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), and mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), all acquired with pixel size of 100 × 100 nm
 <sup>2</sup>. The three AFM-IR images were simultaneously acquired by irradiating the sample with the IR fixed at 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, characteristic of absorption by OM aliphatic C–H stretching. This feature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup> is conveniently distant from common absorption bands in inorganic phases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>, so imaging at this wavenumber enables interference-free mapping of OM. The topography image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) shows relatively little contrast, indicating a smooth surface after mechanical polishing, such that OM cannot be identified. Instead, the discrete macerals are readily identified as having intense 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and low mechanical stiffness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) relative to the surrounding mineral matter. The closely matching spatial distributions seen in the white light microscopy image and AFM-IR images confirm accurate registration.
