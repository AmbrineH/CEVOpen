<p id="Par10">In addition to the solid bitumen and inertinite macerals, the 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> maceral in the immature New Albany Shale is identified and located by organic petrography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As before, the topography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), IR absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), and stiffness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) images of the same area are collected with the AFM-IR by fixing the IR wavelength at 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Topography again indicates a well polished surface, with little distinction between OM and the inorganic matrix. IR mapping shows that 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> strongly absorbs at 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, whereas the small inorganic particle (~1 μm across) entrained inside (indicated by the gray arrow) does not absorb. The stiffness image reveals significant contrast between 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic>, the embedded particle, and surrounding mineral matrix. The embedded particle has similar stiffness to the mineral matrix and does not absorb at 2920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, confirming its assignment as mineral matter. These observations demonstrate the capability of documenting spatial variability in chemistry and mechanical properties of shale at nanoscale with AFM-IR.
