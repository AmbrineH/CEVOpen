<p id="Par17">In conclusion, here we demonstrate AFM-IR as a powerful new tool to examine organic chemical and mechanical heterogeneity in shale at nanoscale. AFM-IR images can be registered with traditional optical microscopy images, allowing geochemical and geomechanical characterization of individual macerals assigned by organic petrography. The measurement provides chemical and mechanical mapping at a spatial resolution orders of magnitude finer than provided by traditional diffraction-limited IR microscopy, enabling interrogation of chemical and mechanical heterogeneity at the submicron length scales relevant for shale. Using this approach, we examined the evolution of OM composition during petroleum generation at the maceral level. Immature shale contains several different macerals and the average composition of each maceral type differs widely, although the compositional variation between different locations belonging to the same maceral type is limited. The composition of the macerals controls their mechanical properties, with macerals enriched in aromatic carbon (and lean in aliphatic carbon) having relatively high mechanical stiffnesses. During maturation, both the abundance and the composition of the individual macerals evolve. Organic petrology revealed that originally present macerals, such as 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic>, are depleted during petroleum generation, and the OM in shale is dominated by the solid bitumen maceral at maturities above the peak oil level. AFM-IR revealed that the composition of each maceral evolves as well, as each maceral becomes enriched in aromatic carbon and depleted in oxygenated carbon during maturation, similar to the trend commonly observed for bulk analysis of OM. The results suggest the maturation process involves an evolution in both the abundance of individual macerals and in the composition of those macerals.
