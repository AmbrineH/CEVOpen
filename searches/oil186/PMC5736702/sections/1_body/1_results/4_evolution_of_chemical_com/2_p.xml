<p id="Par15">Initially, immature New Albany Shale holds abundant solid bitumen and 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic>, with a small fraction of intertinite. During maturation, the abundance of inertinite remains qualitatively unchanged. However, the abundance of 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> and solid bitumen change dramatically during maturation. Similar to petrographic observations in other shale plays

 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> is observed to decrease in abundance throughout the process, finally disappearing at HP temperatures ≥340 °C, while solid bitumen becomes the dominant maceral at high temperatures.
