<p id="Par16">AFM-IR is used to measure to composition of individual macerals, such as solid bitumen, at different maturities (see example of correlative imaging of micron-scale solid bitumen particles in pyrolyzed shale in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Localized IR spectra averaged over three or more different solid bitumen particles in each of the original New Albany Shale sample and its hydrous pyrolysis derivatives are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> (those individual spectra are plotted in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The A-factor (aliphatic versus aromatic) and C-factor (oxygenated versus aromatic functional groups) are calculated from the average spectra and used as IR proxies for atomic H/C and O/C ratios, respectively

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> plots these parameters similar to a standard van Krevelen diagram, with green points labeled by maturity as measured by solid bitumen reflectance (BR
 <sub>o</sub>). The plot illustrates the evolution path of solid bitumen during thermal alteration, showing early loss of oxygenated functional groups followed by loss of aliphatic content at higher pyrolysis tempreatures, consistent with trends observed previously in bulk OM

 </sup>. A similar analysis was perfomed to investigate the chemical evolution of inertinite (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) and 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) with maturity. Direct comparison of the compositional evolution of all macerals is shown in the pseudo van Krevelen diagram (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Significant differences between the composition of these macerals are seen at low maturity, but those compositional differences become less significant at higher maturity when the composition of each maceral type tends toward graphite-like (high aromatic content and low aliphatic and oxygenated content). Macerals that are rich in aliphatic/oxygenated content at low maturity (such as 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic>) undergo relatively large compositional changes with maturity, while macerals that are already dominated by aromatic carbon at low maturity (such as inertinite) undergo relatively small compositional changes with maturity. For example, a relatively large difference is found between the composition of 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> at 0.25% BR
 <sub>o</sub> and at 0.65% BR
 <sub>o</sub> (the highest maturity at which 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> is detected), consistent with the high petroleum generation potential of 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic>. Inertinite, on the other hand, is mostly unaffected by maturation, with little change in its abundance or composition. Moreover, the range of compositions spanned by a single maceral at different thermal maturities is comparable to the range of compositions spanned by different macerals at a single (low) thermal maturity. This observation suggests that the impact of maturation in OM composition is driven by both an evolution of the abundance of different macerals and a variation in the composition of individual macerals.
