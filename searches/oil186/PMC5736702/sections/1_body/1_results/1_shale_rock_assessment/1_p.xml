<p id="Par7">An OM-rich shale sample from Middle Devonian-Lower Mississippian New Albany Shale is chosen because it holds abundant, distinct, and readily identified macerals. The New Albany Shale sample is organic-rich, with total organic carbon (TOC) content of 14.2 wt.% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The computed hydrogen index (HI) and oxygen index (OI) from Rock-Eval show the OM contains relatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio and low oxygen/carbon ratio. The sample is immature, with
