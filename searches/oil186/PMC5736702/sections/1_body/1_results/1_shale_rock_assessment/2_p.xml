<p id="Par8">Hydrous pyrolysis of organic-rich shale at high temperature (320–360 °C) is used to simulate thermal maturation that takes place over millions of years in a sedimentary basin, providing a direct test of the impact of maturity, uncomplicated by other factors such as variation in mineralogy

 </sup>. To understand how OM composition evolves with maturity, the immature New Albany Shale sample is pyrolyzed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 360 °C for 72 h, resulting in BR
 <sub>o</sub> values ranging from 0.41 to 1.17%. A linear relationship between pyrolysis temperature and BR
 <sub>o</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) indicates BR
 <sub>o</sub> can be used to represent thermal maturity. The samples range from immature to late mature, including the onset of oil generation, early/peak oil generation, and late oil/early wet gas generation. TOC and Rock-Eval tests (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) on the original New Albany Shale and its hydrous pyrolysis residues show systematic decrease in TOC, S2, and HI, as well as increase in

 <sub>max</sub> and PI, with increasing hydrous pyrolysis temperature, indicating systematic increase in thermal maturity and conversion of OM to petroleum.
