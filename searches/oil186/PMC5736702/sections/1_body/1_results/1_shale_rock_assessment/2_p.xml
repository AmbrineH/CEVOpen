<p id="Par8" class="p">Hydrous pyrolysis of organic-rich shale at high temperature (320–360 °C) is used to simulate thermal maturation that takes place over millions of years in a sedimentary basin, providing a direct test of the impact of maturity, uncomplicated by other factors such as variation in mineralogy
