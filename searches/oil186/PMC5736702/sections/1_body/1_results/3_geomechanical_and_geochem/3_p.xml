 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) show that the various OM types in the New Albany Shale are distinct in terms of their chemical composition. 
 <italic class="italic">Tasmanites</italic> is relatively rich in oxygenated functional groups and aliphatic carbon, with relatively long chains and little aromatic carbon. Inertinite lies on the other extreme, dominated by aromatic carbon with relatively short chains and relatively little oxygenated functional groups or aliphatic carbon. Solid bitumen is intermediate in all regards, with moderate amounts of aliphatic carbon, aromatic carbon, oxygenated fuctional groups, and chain length. The mechanical stiffness (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) is correlated with the chemical composition of OM, showing increasing stiffness with higher aromaticity, similar to other findings
