<p id="Par13">IR ratios from the average localized IR spectra from inertinite, solid bitumen, and 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> in immature New Albany Shale are computed to evaluate quantitatively the chemical differences between OM types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Four IR ratios are computed, similar to those defined in the bulk IR literature

 <sub>2</sub> (methyl-to-methylene ratio, an indicator of aliphatic chain length and/or the degree of branching of aliphatic moieties), C-factor (proportional to the oxygenated character), and A-factor (proportional to the aliphatic character). Results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) show that the various OM types in the New Albany Shale are distinct in terms of their chemical composition. 
 <italic>Tasmanites</italic> is relatively rich in oxygenated functional groups and aliphatic carbon, with relatively long chains and little aromatic carbon. Inertinite lies on the other extreme, dominated by aromatic carbon with relatively short chains and relatively little oxygenated functional groups or aliphatic carbon. Solid bitumen is intermediate in all regards, with moderate amounts of aliphatic carbon, aromatic carbon, oxygenated fuctional groups, and chain length. The mechanical stiffness (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) is correlated with the chemical composition of OM, showing increasing stiffness with higher aromaticity, similar to other findings
