 </sup> as well as environmental and political concerns. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, composed of solid organic matter (OM) scattered in a mineral framework. This solid OM is the source of petroleum, as the OM breaks down into oil and gas under high temperatures during a process known as maturation. The solid OM remaining after maturation develops a network of nanoscale pores responsible for hydrocarbon storage and transport during petroleum production and migration over geologic time

 </sup>. Additionally, OM partially controls shale’s geomechanical properties as it is the softest component, affecting both fracturing efficiency and flow of petroleum to the wellbore
