TOC and Rock-Eval were carried out in a commercial laboratory following methods previously described in Barker

   </span> Leco TOC measurements were performed by combustion of acidified pulverized rock to quantify organic richness. Rock-Eval II pyrolysis measures hydrocarbon generating potential and thermal maturity. Rock-Eval heats samples in programmed stages ranging from 100 to 850 °C, yielding four parameters: S1 measures the amount of vaporized free hydrocarbons, S2 measures the amount of hydrocarbons generated through thermal cracking of nonvolatile organic matter, S3 measures the amount of CO
   <sub>2</sub> produced during pyrolysis, and 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>max</sub> (pyrolysis temperature during maximum generation of hydrocarbons). S1, S2, and S3 are used to compute hydrogen, oxygen, and production indices [HI: 100 × S2/TOC; OI: 100 × S3/TOC; PI: S1/(S1 + S2)]. HI and OI determine the organic matter type, whereas

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The localized nanoscale mid-IR spectra and images were carried out using the commercial NanoIR2 AFM-IR instrument (Anasys Instruments). The AFM-IR technique is accomplished by coupling a pulsed tunable IR source with an AFM. The IR source covers a broad range of the mid-IR region, produced by a tunable optical parametric oscillator laser system (EKSPLA) with ~ 10 ns pulse length at a repetition rate of 1 kHz.</p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The topography, IR absorption, and contact resonance frequency image (stiffness map) are collected simultaneously at a fixed wavenumber of interest.

The images are acquired at a scan rate of 0.2 Hz and averaged over 8 pulses, with a 100 nm × 100 nm spatial resolution. The image acquisition time is ~25 min for a 30 × 30 μm area or 11 min for a 20 × 20 μm area. The spatial resolution of IR absorption imaging is affected by sample thermomechanical properties such as thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity

   </span>. The integrated peak area under 1450 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> is used instead of the area under 2857 and 2925 as the aliphatic absorption bands. This is because the pulsed optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser used in the nano-IR instrument has two distinct stages. The laser spot size and focus is different in the different stages, thus it is difficult to compute quantitative IR ratios using intensity values from two different stages.
