 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is a very simple extraction method with the disadvantage of long extraction time and low extraction efficiency. It could be used for the extraction of thermolabile components.</p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ćujić et al. achieved high yields of total phenols and total anthocyanins from chokeberry fruit at an optimized condition with 50% ethanol, a solid–solvent ratio of 1:20 and particle size of 0.75 mm, which suggested that maceration was a simple and effective method for the extraction of phenolic compounds from chokeberry fruit [

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) from 
  <span class="italic">Arbutus unedo</span> L. fruits using maceration, microwave-assisted and ultrasound extraction techniques showed that microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was the most effective, but a lower temperature was applied in maceration with nearly identical extraction yields, which can be translated into economic benefits [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Jovanović et al. evaluated the extraction efficiency of polyphenols from 
  <span class="italic">Serpylli herba</span> using various extraction techniques (maceration, heat assisted extraction and ultrasonic-assisted extraction). Based on the content of total polyphenols, ultrasonic-assisted extraction produced the highest total flavonoids yield and no statistically significant difference were found between maceration and heat assisted extraction [

  <span class="italic">Cajanus cajan</span> leaves are used in Chinese folk medicine for the treatment of hepatitis, chickenpox and diabetes. Flavonoids are the bioactive compounds. Jin et al. compared extraction rates of orientoside (
  <span class="bold">2</span>), luteolin (
  <span class="bold">3</span>), and total flavonoids from 
  <span class="italic">C. cajan</span> leaves by microwave-assisted method, reflux extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, and maceration extraction. The extraction efficiency of orientoside, luteolin, and total flavonoids was found to be the lowest in the extract from maceration method [
