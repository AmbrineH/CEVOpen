 <p id="Par87" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gas chromatography (GC) with high separation efficiency and fast separation and analysis makes it potentially the ideal preparative method for the separation of volatile compounds. The injection port, column, split device and trap device of GC equipment must be modified for preparative separation due to a lack of commercial Prep-GC [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>].

 <p id="Par88" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five volatile compounds, namely, curzerene (
  <span class="bold">98</span>) (6.6 mg), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-elemene (
  <span class="bold">100</span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig12">12</a>) (5.1 mg), curzerenone (
  <span class="bold">126</span>) (41.6 mg), curcumenol (
  <span class="bold">127</span>) (46.2 mg), and curcumenone (
  <span class="bold">128</span>) (21.2 mg) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig17">17</a>), were separated from the methanol extract of Curcuma Rhizome by Prep-GC over a stainless steel column packed with 10% OV-101 (3 m × 6 mm, i.d.) after 83 single injections (20 μl) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. Prep-GC was also applied for the separation of natural isomers. A total of 178 mg of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-asarone (
  <span class="bold">129</span>) and 82 mg of 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-asarone (
  <span class="bold">130</span>) were obtained from the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Acorus tatarinowii</span> after 90 single injections (5 μl) on the same column as above [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>]. Prep-GC has become an important separation method for natural volatile compounds; however, a heavier sample load and the large-diameter preparative column employed decreased the efficiency [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>]. Meanwhile, the disadvantages of Prep-GC, including the lack of commercial Prep-GC equipment, consumption of a large volume of carrier gas, the decomposition of thermolabile compounds under high operation temperature, the difficulties of fraction collection, and low production, still restrict the usage of Prep-GC.
