<p id="Par69">Silica gel is the most widely used adsorbent in phytochemical investigation. It was estimated that nearly 90% of phytochemical separation (preparative scale) was based on silica gel. Silica gel is a polar absorbent with silanol groups. Molecules are retained by the silica gel through hydrogen bonds and dipole–dipole interactions. Thus, polar natural products are retained longer in silica gel columns than nonpolar ones. Sometimes, certain polar natural products might undergo irreversible chemisorption. The deactivation of silica gel by adding water before use or using a water-containing mobile phase will weaken the adsorption. Severe tailing may occur when separating alkaloids on silica gel, and the addition of a small amount of ammonia or organic amines such as triethylamine may reduce the tailing. Twelve alkaloids belonging to the methyl chanofruticosinate group including six new alkaloids, prunifolines A–F (
