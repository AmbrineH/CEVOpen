<p id="Par73">Silver nitrate is another useful solid support in the separation of natural products. Those natural products containing the π electrons reversibly interact with silver ions to form polar complexes. The greater the number of double bonds or aromaticity of the natural product, the stronger the complexation forms. Silver nitrate is typically impregnated on silica gel (SNIS) or alumina for separation. Several research groups reported the separation of fatty acids on SNIS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Some research groups also applied silver nitrate in the two-phase system in high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) to improve the separation. Xanthochymol (

 <sub>3</sub>-HSCCC. The elution order of the π bond isomers in this AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>-HSCCC separation is internal π bond (earlier) &lt; terminal, which is identical to that observed from SNIS column chromatography [
