 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>) (5.1 mg), curzerenone (

 <bold>128</bold>) (21.2 mg) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>), were separated from the methanol extract of Curcuma Rhizome by Prep-GC over a stainless steel column packed with 10% OV-101 (3 m × 6 mm, i.d.) after 83 single injections (20 μl) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Prep-GC was also applied for the separation of natural isomers. A total of 178 mg of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-asarone (
 <bold>129</bold>) and 82 mg of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-asarone (
 <bold>130</bold>) were obtained from the essential oil of 
 <italic>Acorus tatarinowii</italic> after 90 single injections (5 μl) on the same column as above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Prep-GC has become an important separation method for natural volatile compounds; however, a heavier sample load and the large-diameter preparative column employed decreased the efficiency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Meanwhile, the disadvantages of Prep-GC, including the lack of commercial Prep-GC equipment, consumption of a large volume of carrier gas, the decomposition of thermolabile compounds under high operation temperature, the difficulties of fraction collection, and low production, still restrict the usage of Prep-GC.
