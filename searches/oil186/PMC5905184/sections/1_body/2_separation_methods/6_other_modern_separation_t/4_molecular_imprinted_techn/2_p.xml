<p id="Par92">Ji et al. developed multi-template molecularly imprinted polymers using DL-tyrosine and phenylpyruvic acid as the template molecules to separate dencichine (
 <bold>143</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>) from the water extract of 
 <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic>. Both dencichine and the template molecule of DL-tyrosine (
 <bold>144</bold>) contain an amino (NH
 <sub>2</sub>) group and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group, and the other template molecule, phenylpyruvic acid (
 <bold>145</bold>), has an α-keto acid (COCOOH) group that can also be found in the structure of dencichine [

 <bold>146</bold>) from tobacco leaves by flash chromatography based on MIP. The MIP was prepared with methyl methacrylate as the monomer, solanesol as the template molecule and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker by a suspension polymerization method. A total of 370.8 mg of solanesol with 98.4% purity was separated from the extract of tobacco leaves with a yield of 2.5% of the dry weight of tobacco leaves [

 <bold>147</bold>), demethoxycurcumin (
 <bold>148</bold>), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (
 <bold>149</bold>), from the TCM Curcumae Longae Rhizoma (the rhizome of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>). The designed thermo-responsive magnetic MIP showed good imprinting factor for curcuminoids in a range between 2.4 and 3.1, thermo-responsiveness [lower critical solution temperature at 33.71 °C] and rapid magnetic separation (5 s) [
