<p id="Par92" class="p">Ji et al. developed multi-template molecularly imprinted polymers using DL-tyrosine and phenylpyruvic acid as the template molecules to separate dencichine (
 <bold class="bold">143</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig" class="xref">19</xref>) from the water extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Panax notoginseng</italic>. Both dencichine and the template molecule of DL-tyrosine (
 <bold class="bold">144</bold>) contain an amino (NH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>) group and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group, and the other template molecule, phenylpyruvic acid (
 <bold class="bold">145</bold>), has an α-keto acid (COCOOH) group that can also be found in the structure of dencichine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. Ma et al. developed a preparative separation method to separate solanesol (
 <bold class="bold">146</bold>) from tobacco leaves by flash chromatography based on MIP. The MIP was prepared with methyl methacrylate as the monomer, solanesol as the template molecule and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker by a suspension polymerization method. A total of 370.8 mg of solanesol with 98.4% purity was separated from the extract of tobacco leaves with a yield of 2.5% of the dry weight of tobacco leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>]. You et al. used the thermo-responsive magnetic MIP to separate the three major curcuminoids, curcumin (
 <bold class="bold">147</bold>), demethoxycurcumin (
 <bold class="bold">148</bold>), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (
 <bold class="bold">149</bold>), from the TCM Curcumae Longae Rhizoma (the rhizome of 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic>). The designed thermo-responsive magnetic MIP showed good imprinting factor for curcuminoids in a range between 2.4 and 3.1, thermo-responsiveness [lower critical solution temperature at 33.71 °C] and rapid magnetic separation (5 s) [
