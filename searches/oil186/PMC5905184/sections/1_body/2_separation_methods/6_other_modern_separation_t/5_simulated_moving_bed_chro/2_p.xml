 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Kang et al. developed a tandem SMB process consisting of two four-zone SMB units in a series with the same adsorbent particle sizes in Ring I and Ring II to separate paclitaxel (taxol,

 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>), 13-dehydroxybaccatin III (
 <bold>152</bold>), and 10-deacetylpaclitaxel (
 <bold>153</bold>). Paclitaxel was recovered in the first SMB unit while 13-dehydroxybaccatin III and 10-deacetylpaclitaxel were separated in the second SMB unit [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Supercritical fluids can also be used as the desorbent in SMB chromatography. Liang et al. successfully applied supercritical carbon dioxide with ethanol as the desorbent for a three-zone SMB to separate resveratrol (
