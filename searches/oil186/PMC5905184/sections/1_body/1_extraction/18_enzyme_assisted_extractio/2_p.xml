<p id="Par64">Polysaccharide is one of the bioactive ingredients in the TCM Astragali Radix. Chen et al. studied the EAE of polysaccharide from the radix of 
 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> using various enzymes and found that glucose oxidase offered better performance in extracting polysaccharide than the other seven enzymes tested (amyloglucosidase, hemicellulase, bacterial amylase, fungal amylase, pectinase, cellulose and vinozyme). The polysaccharide yield under the optimized EAE condition using glucose oxidase increased more than 250% compared with that from non-enzyme treated method [

 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) from 
 <italic>Eucommia ulmoides</italic> leaves was greatly improved when using cellulase and ionic liquids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Strati el al. found that carotenoid and lycopene (
 <bold>67</bold>) extraction yields from tomato waste were increased by the use of pectinase and cellulase enzymes. Compared to the non-enzyme treated solvent extraction method, sixfold and tenfold higher yields of the two target compounds were obtained in samples treated with cellulase and pectinase, respectively [
