 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and puerarin (
 <bold>51</bold>) from a TCM compound composing seven herbs with two different methods, decoction and reflux. The reflux method was found to be better than the decoction method and the highest yields of baicalin and puerarin were obtained from the reflux method with 60% ethanol as the extraction solvent [
