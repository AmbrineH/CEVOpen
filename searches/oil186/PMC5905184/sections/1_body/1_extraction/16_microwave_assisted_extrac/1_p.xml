<p id="Par59">Microwaves generate heat by interacting with polar compounds such as water and some organic components in the plant matrix following the ionic conduction and dipole rotation mechanisms. The transfers of heat and mass are in the same direction in MAE, which generates a synergistic effect to accelerate extraction and improve extraction yield. The application of MAE provides many advantages, such as increasing the extract yield, decreasing the thermal degradation and selective heating of vegetal material. MAE is also regraded as a green technology because it reduces the usage of organic solvent. There are two types of MAE methods: solvent-free extraction (usually for volatile compounds) and solvent extraction (usually for non-volatile compounds) [
