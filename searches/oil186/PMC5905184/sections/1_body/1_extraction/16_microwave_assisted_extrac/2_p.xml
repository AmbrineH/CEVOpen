 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) from the TCM Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix (the rhizome and radix of 
 <italic class="italic">Polygonum cuspidatum</italic>) by orthogonal experiment. An extraction yield of 1.76% of resveratrol was obtained from the optimized conditions as follows: extraction time 7 min, 80% ethanol, ratio of liquid to solid 25:1 (ml:g), microwave power 1.5 kw [

 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. seeds at atmospheric pressure without any addition of solvent or water. The yield and aromatic profile in the enhanced solvent-free MAE extract was similar to those extracted by hydro distillation and cost only one-sixth of the time of hydro distillation [

 <bold class="bold">62</bold>), isoliensinine (
 <bold class="bold">63</bold>), dauricine (

 <bold class="bold">65</bold>), from the TCM Nelumbinis Plumula (lotus plumule, the green embryo of 
 <italic class="italic">Nelumbo nucifera</italic> seeds) using univariate approach experiments and central composite design. The MAE conditions was optimized as follows: 65% methanol as the extraction solvent, microwave power of 200 W and extraction time of 260 s [
