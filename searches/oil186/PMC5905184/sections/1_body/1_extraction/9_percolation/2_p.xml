<p id="Par46" class="p">Zhang et al. compared the percolation and refluxing extraction methods to extract

Fu et al. used the whole alkaloids content determined by acid–base titration as the index and optimized the ethanol percolation method as soaking the medicine with 55% alcohol for 24 h and then percolating with 12 times the amount of 55% alcohol [

 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) and ephedrine hydrochloride (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>) as the index, Gao developed another optimized percolation method: soaking the medicine with 70% ethanol for 24 h and then percolating with 20 times the amount of 70% ethanol. The transfer rates of sinomenine and ephedrine hydrochloride were 78.23 and 76.92%, respectively [
