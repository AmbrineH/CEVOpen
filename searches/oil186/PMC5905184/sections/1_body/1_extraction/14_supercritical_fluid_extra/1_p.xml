<p id="Par55">Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) uses supercritical fluid (SF) as the extraction solvent. SF has similar solubility to liquid and similar diffusivity to gas, and can dissolve a wide variety of natural products. Their solvating properties dramatically changed near their critical points due to small pressure and temperature changes. Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO
 <sub>2</sub>) was widely used in SFE because of its attractive merits such as low critical temperature (31 °C), selectivity, inertness, low cost, non-toxicity, and capability to extract thermally labile compounds. The low polarity of S-CO
 <sub>2</sub> makes it ideal for the extraction of non-polar natural products such as lipid and volatile oil. A modifier may be added to S-CO
 <sub>2</sub> to enhance its solvating properties significantly.
