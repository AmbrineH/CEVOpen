<p id="Par51" class="p">The Soxhlet extraction method integrates the advantages of the reflux extraction and percolation, which utilizes the principle of reflux and siphoning to continuously extract the herb with fresh solvent. The Soxhlet extraction is an automatic continuous extraction method with high extraction efficiency that requires less time and solvent consumption than maceration or percolation. The high temperature and long extraction time in the Soxhlet extraction will increase the possibilities of thermal degradation.</p>
