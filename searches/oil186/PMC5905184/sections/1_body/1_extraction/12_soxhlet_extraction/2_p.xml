 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) from the TCM Cynomorium (Cynomorii Herba) with a yield of 38.21 mg/g by Soxhlet extraction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The degradation of catechins in tea was also observed in Soxhlet extraction due to the high extraction temperature applied. The concentrations of both total polyphenols and total alkaloids from the Soxhlet extraction method at 70 °C decreased compared to those from the maceration method applied under 40 °C [
