<p id="Par58">Jovanović et al. achieved a higher yield of polyphenols from 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> L. by UAE at an optimized condition (50% ethanol as solvent; 1:30 solid-to-solventratio; 0.3 mm particle size and 15 min time) than maceration and heat-assisted extraction methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Wu et al. found that there was no statistically significant difference for extracting ginsenosides, including ginsenosides Rg1 (

 <bold>58</bold>), from the TCM Panacis Japonici Rhizoma between UAE and reflux using 70% aqueous methanol to extract for 30 min [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Guo et al. found both the reflux method and UAE had the advantages of time-saving, convenient operation and high extract yield and that UAE is relatively better than reflux methods for TCM Dichroae Radix using the extract yield and content of febrifugine (
