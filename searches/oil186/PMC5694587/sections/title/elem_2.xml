 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As widely known, the chemical composition of plant EOs is principally represented by mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives, along with aliphatic aldehydes, alcohols, and esters [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. It is also of great interest to highlight that the chemical profile of any EO is closely related to the extraction procedure carried out and therefore the selection of suitable extraction method is very important.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the characteristics of each plant material, some specific extraction techniques can be applied such as steam distillation, solvent extraction, soxhlet extraction, microwave-assisted hydrodistillation, dynamic headspace, static headspace, solvent flavor evaporation, solid-phase microextraction, and direct thermal desorption [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, the traditional classical techniques for analysis EOs were mainly focused on the quality aspects of oil, concerning mainly two properties, namely, identity and purity [
    <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. The following techniques are commonly applied to assess the physical properties of any EO: specific gravity, optical rotation, and determination of the refractive index [
    <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Another test is for assessment of EO purity such as the presence of polar substances, like alcohols, glycols, and their esters and glycerin acetates. In addition to the solubility test of an EO in ethanol this reveals much on its quality [
    <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. The measurement of melting and congealing points as well as the boiling range of an EO is also of great importance for identifying its purity [
    <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Another test usually performed in EO analysis is the evaporation residue, in which the percentage of the oil that is not released at 100Â°C is determined.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, classical methodologies have been widely applied to assess the chemical properties of EOs [
    <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
    <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], such as the determination of halogenated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. The determination of esters derived from phthalic acid is also of great interest for the toxicity evaluation of an EO [
    <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. In most of the cases, the classical methods are generally focused on chemical groups and also the quantification method by titration such as the acidimetric determination of saponified terpene esters. A further test is the determination of terpene alcohols by acetylating with acetic anhydride [
    <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Aldehydes and ketones could be estimated through different tests like bisulfite method which is recommended for aldehyde-rich oils such as lemongrass, bitter almond, and cassia, while the neutral sulfite test is more suitable for ketone-rich oils such as spearmint, caraway, and dill oils [
    <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. The chromatographic methods are considered as one of the most common and easily analytical techniques in EOs analysis. The principle of chromatography is based on the distribution of the constituents to be separated between two immiscible phases [
    <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a fast and inexpensive method for identifying substances and testing their purity [
    <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of the above-mentioned traditional analytical techniques for the systematic study of EOs is generally applied for the assessment of pure compounds as well as some major compounds. Classical methods need to be combined with some modern analytical techniques, such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1.2. Modern Analytical Techniques</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the modern analytical techniques of EOs depend on chromatographic procedures. The main objective in any chromatographic separation is always the complete resolution of the compounds in the minimum time; for that, the most appropriate analytical chromatographic column with a specific dimension and stationary phase has to be used under adequate chromatographic conditions.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, the GC analysis can be summarized as the evaporation of the compound and the elution by the mobile gas phase, the carrier gas, through the column. The different substances are separated on the basis of their relative vapor pressures and affinities for the stationary bed. On the other hand, the liquid chromatographic analysis depends on the elution of the compound by a liquid mobile phase consisting of a solvent or a mixture of solvents and the different substances are separated according to their affinities for the stationary bed.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mass Spectrometry (MS) can be defined as the study of systems through the formation of gaseous ions, with or without fragmentation, which are then characterized by their mass-to-charge ratios (
    <span class="italic">m</span>/
    <span class="italic">z</span>) and relative abundances [
    <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. GC-MS is an analytical method that combines the features of Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample [
    <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applications of GC-MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, and identification of unknown samples. GC-MS is composed of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions and the phase properties. The difference of the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote their separation. Different molecules are retained by the column and then are eluted from the column at different retention times [
