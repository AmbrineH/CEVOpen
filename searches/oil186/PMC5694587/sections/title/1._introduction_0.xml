 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils (EOs) are one of the most important natural products derived from plants for their various biological properties and medicinal uses [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. EOs have been utilized in different domestic aspects such as in perfumery, cosmetics, feed, food, and beverages. Several researchers demonstrated the possibility of utilizing EOs in cooking, where they give a pleasant taste to food and are utilized mostly in processed food. Recently, there has been great interest in the use of EOs for their curative effects in aromatherapy [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current review intends to discuss some aspects of plant EOs and their main single constituents ranging from an overview of historical perspective, analytical techniques for chemical analysis (classical and modern methods), bioactivity of single substances (mode of action, factors affecting their bioactivity, and common families of aromatic Mediterranean plants), medical uses for human health and biological characterization including pharmacological aspects (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic effects), and antimicrobial effects (antibacterial and antifungal activities).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review gives also an insight into the chemical composition of some important EOs and their principal bioactive single constituents. Detailed information focuses on the mechanism of bioactivity action of the main bioactive single constituents of some important plant EOs such as sage, oregano, thyme, marjoram, and vervain related to different families such as Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Rutaceae, and Verbenaceae.</p>
