 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, the traditional classical techniques for analysis EOs were mainly focused on the quality aspects of oil, concerning mainly two properties, namely, identity and purity [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. The following techniques are commonly applied to assess the physical properties of any EO: specific gravity, optical rotation, and determination of the refractive index [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Another test is for assessment of EO purity such as the presence of polar substances, like alcohols, glycols, and their esters and glycerin acetates. In addition to the solubility test of an EO in ethanol this reveals much on its quality [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. The measurement of melting and congealing points as well as the boiling range of an EO is also of great importance for identifying its purity [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Another test usually performed in EO analysis is the evaporation residue, in which the percentage of the oil that is not released at 100Â°C is determined.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, classical methodologies have been widely applied to assess the chemical properties of EOs [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], such as the determination of halogenated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. The determination of esters derived from phthalic acid is also of great interest for the toxicity evaluation of an EO [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. In most of the cases, the classical methods are generally focused on chemical groups and also the quantification method by titration such as the acidimetric determination of saponified terpene esters. A further test is the determination of terpene alcohols by acetylating with acetic anhydride [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Aldehydes and ketones could be estimated through different tests like bisulfite method which is recommended for aldehyde-rich oils such as lemongrass, bitter almond, and cassia, while the neutral sulfite test is more suitable for ketone-rich oils such as spearmint, caraway, and dill oils [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. The chromatographic methods are considered as one of the most common and easily analytical techniques in EOs analysis. The principle of chromatography is based on the distribution of the constituents to be separated between two immiscible phases [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a fast and inexpensive method for identifying substances and testing their purity [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of the above-mentioned traditional analytical techniques for the systematic study of EOs is generally applied for the assessment of pure compounds as well as some major compounds. Classical methods need to be combined with some modern analytical techniques, such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).</p>
