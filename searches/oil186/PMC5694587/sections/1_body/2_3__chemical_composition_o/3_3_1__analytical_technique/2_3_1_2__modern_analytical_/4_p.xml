<p class="p">Applications of GC-MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, and identification of unknown samples. GC-MS is composed of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions and the phase properties. The difference of the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote their separation. Different molecules are retained by the column and then are eluted from the column at different retention times [
