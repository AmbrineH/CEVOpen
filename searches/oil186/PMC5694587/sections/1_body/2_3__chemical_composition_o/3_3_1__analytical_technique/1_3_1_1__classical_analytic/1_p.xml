<p>Generally, the traditional classical techniques for analysis EOs were mainly focused on the quality aspects of oil, concerning mainly two properties, namely, identity and purity [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The following techniques are commonly applied to assess the physical properties of any EO: specific gravity, optical rotation, and determination of the refractive index [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another test is for assessment of EO purity such as the presence of polar substances, like alcohols, glycols, and their esters and glycerin acetates. In addition to the solubility test of an EO in ethanol this reveals much on its quality [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The measurement of melting and congealing points as well as the boiling range of an EO is also of great importance for identifying its purity [
