<p>Elshafie et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] evaluated the
 <italic> in vitro </italic>antibacterial activity of three EOs extracted from
 <italic> Schinus terebinthifolius</italic> Raddi (leaves and fruits) against two strains of G+ve bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus megaterium </italic>de Bary and
 <italic> Clavibacter michiganensis</italic> Smith) and 4 strains of Gâˆ’ve bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>,
 <italic> Xanthomonas campestris </italic>Pammel,
 <italic> Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> Janse, and
 <italic> P. syringae </italic>pv.
 <italic> phaseolicola </italic>Van Hall) compared with the synthetic antibiotic tetracycline. They resulted in the fact that the above-mentioned EOs were able to significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacterial strains especially against G+ve bacteria.
