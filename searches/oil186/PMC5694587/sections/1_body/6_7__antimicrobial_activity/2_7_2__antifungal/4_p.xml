<p>Elshafie et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] evaluated the antifungal effect of the single components of
 <italic> O. vulgare </italic>EO (carvacrol, thymol, linalool, and
 <italic> trans</italic>-caryophyllene) against the postharvest pathogens
 <italic> M. laxa, M. fructigena, </italic>and
 <italic> M. fructicola</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fungicidal activity assay of the above four single components has been carried out
 <italic> in vitro</italic> according to the method of Soylu et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the antifungal activity was expressed by measuring the diameter of mycelium growth [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. They concluded that carvacrol and thymol have exhibited the highest activity in
 <italic> in vitro </italic>tests against all studied postharvest
 <italic> Monilinia </italic>pathogens. Linalool and
 <italic> trans-</italic>caryophyllene showed low antifungal activity against all studied pathogens. However, thymol showed a fungitoxic effect while carvacrol and citral showed a fungistatic effect against the previous tested fungi.
