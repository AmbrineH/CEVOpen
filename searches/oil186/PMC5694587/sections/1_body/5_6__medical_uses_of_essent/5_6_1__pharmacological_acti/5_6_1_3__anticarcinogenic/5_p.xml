<p>The general mechanism of cytotoxic effect of plant EOs is mostly due to the presence of phenols, aldehydes, and alcohols. In particular, the toxicity towards mammalians decreases significantly with the increase of average lipophilicity of EO components [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], while the toxicity against bacteria and fungi simultaneously increases significantly with increasing lipophilicity [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This mode of action refers to the extraordinary role of EOs among natural compounds, especially of their highly lipophilic constituents. The cellular mechanisms of carcinogenic prevention by EO treatments were also considered to be due to the induction of cell-apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There is also a suggestion that the pathway of cancer cells is sensitive to the inhibitory actions of plant isoprenoids by reducing tumour cell-size in patients [
