<p>Some EOs showed a potential anticancer activity against liver, lung, colon, and prostate cancer such as

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] found that
 <italic> C. limettioides</italic> Tan EO inhibited colon cancer (SW480) by inducing the cells-apoptosis. Zu et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] noted that the
 <italic> T. vulgaris</italic> EO exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards three human cancers: PC-3 from human prostate, A549 from human lung, and MCF-7 from breast adenocarcinoma.
