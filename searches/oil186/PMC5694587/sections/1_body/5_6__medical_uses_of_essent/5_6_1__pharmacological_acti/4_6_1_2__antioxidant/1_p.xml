<p>Antioxidant activity can be defined as the molecules able to react with radicals or having a reducing power to counteract the oxidative stress caused by radicals. Antioxidant properties play an essential role in some of EOs' biological activities, which is justified by the involvement of oxidative stress in pathology. In addition, the botanical source of aromatic plants and the environmental factors such as climate may affect the actual composition of extracted EOs and thus reflect different antioxidant activities. Oregano EO is able to protect extra virgin olive oil from oxidation during storage and is able to extend the shelf life of sea bream and to reduce the formation of volatile amines and of TBAR compounds [
