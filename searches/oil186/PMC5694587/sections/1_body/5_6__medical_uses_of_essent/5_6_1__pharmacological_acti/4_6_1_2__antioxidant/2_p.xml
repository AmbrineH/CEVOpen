<p>The antioxidant effect of many EOs is due to the inherent ability of some of their components, particularly phenols, to stop or delay the aerobic oxidation of organic matter [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. On the other hand, there are phenol-free EOs that express antioxidant behaviour and this is due to the radical chemistry of some terpenoids and other volatile constituents (e.g., sulfur-containing components) [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In general, phenolic compounds, both natural (e.g., 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol) or synthetic (e.g., BHA), act as antioxidants due to their high reactivity with peroxyl radicals, which are disposed of by formal hydrogen atom transfer [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The antioxidant chemistry of sulfur-containing EOs from
 <italic> Allium</italic> and related genera is due to a direct chain-breaking activity that is expressed only upon conversion of the inactive components into thiosulfinates that ultimately yields the “active” sulfonic acid [
