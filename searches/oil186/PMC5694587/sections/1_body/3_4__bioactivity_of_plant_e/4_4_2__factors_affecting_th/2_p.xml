<p class="p">For improving the antimicrobial outfindings of many plant EOs, several factors either biological and experimental should be taken into consideration such as (i) appropriate and exact standardized microbiological test; (ii) available standard strains from different collections; (iii) assays including a variety of microorganisms either gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, phytopathogens and human pathogens and yeasts; (iv) exact botanical identification of the plant EOs origin; (v) biochemical characterization of the extracted EOs as well as their production, storage conditions, and age. In addition, the distinctive water solubility and volatility of many EOs enable them to reveal a broadband spectrum of activity in various
