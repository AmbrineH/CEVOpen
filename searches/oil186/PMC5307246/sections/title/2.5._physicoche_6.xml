 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Official methods of the American Oil Chemists' Society were used for the determination of melting point (method Cc 1-25), refractive index (method Cc 7-25), iodine value (method Cd 1-25), peroxide value (method Cd 8-53), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-anisidine value (Cd 18-90), acid value (method Ca 3a-63), and saponification value (method Cd 3-25) [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. The total oxidation (TOTOX) value was calculated using determined values for peroxide and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-anisidine (2Px + Av) [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. Stability was measured with a 743 Rancimat instrument (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) using an oil sample of 3 g, warmed to 120°C and an air flow rate of 20 L/h. Stability was expressed as induction time (h).
