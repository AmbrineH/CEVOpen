 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of proximate analysis of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seeds are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. The moisture content of seeds was 3.61%, which is low and therefore beneficial for prolonging the shelf life of the seeds. The seeds contained significant amounts of crude oil (57.85 g/100 g), crude protein (26.39 g/100 g), and ash (2.08 g/100 g). The ash and crude protein were in the range of those reported for
  <span class="italic"> Arachis hypogaea</span> L. and
  <span class="italic"> Pentaclethra macrophylla</span> Benth. [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. The crude oil content was higher than those of some commercial seed oils, namely, soybean, cotton seeds, and rubber seeds [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>].
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seeds also contained significant amounts of minerals. The most abundant was potassium followed by magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, and sodium. These results showed that
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seeds can be regarded as a good source of oil, protein and minerals.
