 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fatty acid profile of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. The oil mainly contained saturated fatty acids (42.14%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (41.09%) and a low amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (13.05%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most abundant fatty acids of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil were oleic (38.45%) and palmitic (33.20%) acids followed by linoleic (12.75%) and stearic (7.43%) acids, which together comprised 91.83% of the total fatty acid. The fatty acid composition of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil was comparable to that of palm oil and like that one, the
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil can be regarded as an oleic-palmitic oil [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Therefore,
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil can be considered as an alternative to palm oil in food industries.
