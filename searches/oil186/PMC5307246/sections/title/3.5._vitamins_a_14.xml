 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vitamin E includes four isomers (
  <span class="italic">α</span>, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>, 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>) of tocopherol and four isomers (
  <span class="italic">α</span>, 
  <span class="italic">β</span>, 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>) of tocotrienol. The contents of total and individual tocopherols and tocotrienols of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. The results revealed the presence of the three tocopherols (
  <span class="italic">α</span>, 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>). Β-Tocopherol and tocotrienols were not detected in the oil. Total amount of tocopherols was 578.60 mg/kg, which was similar to that reported for
  <span class="italic"> L. microcarpa</span> and higher than that recorded in grapeseed oil (140.60 mg/kg), peanut oil (398.60 mg/kg), and olive oil (216.80 mg/kg) [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">28</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-Tocopherol was the most abundant, with a value of 82% of the total tocopherol content, followed by 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-tocopherol (12%) and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>-tocopherol (6%). The antioxidant activity of tocopherols decreased in the order of 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">δ</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">α</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">β</span> [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">29</a>]. The significant quantity of 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>-tocopherols found in
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil could contribute to its high oxidative stability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carotenoids together with tocopherols are involved in the oxidative stability of the oil and have a protective role against cancer and cardiovascular diseases [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">30</a>]. More than 700 carotenoids have been identified in 89 plant foods and in the human body, but the overwhelming majority (ca. 90%) in the human diet is represented by 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene, 
  <span class="italic">α</span>-carotene, lycopene, lutein, cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">31</a>]. The carotenoid content of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil was 4.62 mg/kg of oil (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>). This value was similar to that reported for
  <span class="italic"> Capparis spinosa</span> L. (4.57 mg/kg of oil) and lower than those of
  <span class="italic"> Phoenix canariensis</span> seed oil (55.10 mg/kg of oil) and
  <span class="italic"> Rubus idaeus</span> L. seed oil (230.00 mg/kg of oil) [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">29</a>]. The forms of carotenoids found in
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil were lutein and 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-carotene. Lutein was the most abundant form, accounting for 80% of the total carotenoids.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sterols constitute the major fraction of the unsaponifiable matter in many oils. More than 40 phytosterols were identified; from them 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol account for more than 95% of total phytosterols dietary intake [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">32</a>]. They are of interest due to their antioxidant activity and beneficial impact on human health [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">33</a>]. The sterol content of
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil is illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. The total sterol content was 929.50 mg/kg of oil. 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-Sitosterol was the major form (93%), followed by campesterol (7%). The presence of high 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-sitosterol was found to limit TG polymer formation in triolein, refined canola, high oleic sunflower, and flaxseed oils heated at frying temperature [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">34</a>]. This suggests that
  <span class="italic"> L. kerstingii</span> seed oil could be used as frying oil.
