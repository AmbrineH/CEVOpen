  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]: moisture by vacuum oven (method 925.10), crude fat by Soxhlet method (method 960.39), total nitrogen or crude protein by Kjeldahl, using 6.25 as a conversion factor to calculate protein content (method 979.09), and ash by ignition (method 923.03). Carbohydrate content was estimated by difference of mean values, that is, 100 (sum of percentages of moisture, protein, lipid, and ash) [
