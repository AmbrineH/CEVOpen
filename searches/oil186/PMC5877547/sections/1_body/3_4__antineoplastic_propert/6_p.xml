<p>Olive oil can also protect against carcinogenic agents that are abundant in the environment and food. Again, the most important protection mechanism is alleviation of oxidative stress phenomena. It is worth mentioning that oleic acid being the major fatty acid present in olive oil TAGs is much less susceptible to oxidation than polyunsaturated acids that are abundant in seed oils. High content of antioxidant polyphenols (hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein) makes virgin olive oil relatively stable and resistant to oxidation, and thus minimizing the risk of formation of potentially carcinogenic products of lipid peroxidation upon storage. Moreover, olive oil polyphenols have been reported to induce beneficial epigenetic modifications [
