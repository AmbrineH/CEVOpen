<p>Research has shown that some natural plant-derived polyphenols can directly or indirectly prevent cells from the initiation of neoplastic transformation due to xenobiotics and carcinogenic factors, and thus contribute to a lower risk of developing cancer. Carcinogenesis is characterized by a change in the transcriptional activity of many genes, and consequently in the biological function of the proteins that are encoded by those genes. There are many studies pointing out an essential role of polyphenolic compounds as derived from vegetables, fruits, or herbs in the regulation of epigenetic modifications, resulting in the antiproliferative protection [
