Interestingly, olive oil polyphenols were proven to protect biological membranes against oxidative modification and losing structural integrity. Similarly, polyphenolic compounds decreased oxidative damage to cellular DNA effectively decreasing promotion of colon cancer. In addition to that, HT inhibited lipooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for leukotriene synthesis, and thus modulating the inflammatory response. An alteration of the hormonal status was also observed, specifically due to antiestrogenic effects of lignans that are present in virgin olive oil [
