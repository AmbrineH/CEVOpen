<p>The studies on the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line have shown that HT stimulates mitochondrial biosynthesis which is reduced in the course of diabetes mellitus. Most likely, HT increases mitochondrial biosynthesis pathway via upregulation of PGC-1Î±. Relatively low concentrations of hydroxytyrosol in adipocytes increase the expression of all mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, including ATP synthase. HT protects mitochondria against the reduction of mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and modulates activity of the critical transcription factors, such as Nrf1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1) and Tfam (transcription factor A, mitochondrial). All of these unique properties of HT are attributed to a potential risk reduction for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [
