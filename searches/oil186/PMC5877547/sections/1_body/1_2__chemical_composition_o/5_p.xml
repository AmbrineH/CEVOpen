<p class="p">The flesh of healthy olives contains about 2â€“3% of phenolic substances in the form of glucosides and esters. Virgin olive oil contains about 500 mg/L of polyphenols. The quantity and quality of polyphenols in olive oil is closely related to the process of olive milling and further processing. Therefore, virgin olive oils have substantially higher amounts of polyphenols than refined olive oils [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The phenolic compounds in olive oil are mostly glycides (e.g., oleuropein), alcohols and phenols (tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol), and also flavonoids [

Phenolic compounds are mainly responsible for the characteristic gustatory property of virgin olive oil, namely the bitter taste. Some micro constituents of olive oil are soluble in water, and thus, the content of phenolic compounds that are present in olive oil depends to a large extent on the extraction process [
