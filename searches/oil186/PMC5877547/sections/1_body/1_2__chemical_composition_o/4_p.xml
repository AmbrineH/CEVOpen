<p class="p">Olive oil mostly consists of triacylglycerols (98â€“99%). Triacylglycerols (TGA) are a diverse group of glycerol esters with different fatty acids. The predominant fatty acid present in olive oil TGAs is monounsaturated oleic acid (up to 83%

There is a plethora of lipophilic or amphiphilic microconstituents present in virgin olive oil, among them, phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, phenolic compounds, terpenic acid derivatives, etc. [

In olive oil, the content of polyphenols ranges from 50 to 1000 mg/kg. As a matter of fact, it depends on the agronomic factors, the ripeness of olives, as well as extraction technology, along with storage or packaging processes [
