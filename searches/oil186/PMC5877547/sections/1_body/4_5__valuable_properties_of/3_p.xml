<p>Resveratrol, as observed in animal models with chemically induced tumor lesions, showed anti-tumor and anti-atherogenic properties. On the other hand, in human tumor cell line models, resveratrol inhibited cell proliferation (cell cycle blockage) with no apoptosis induction [

 <italic>Zingiber officinale Roscoe</italic>) to contain numerous chemical constituents of potential health benefits. According to some, pulp and peel of ginger rhizomes exhibit in vitro antiproliferative activity against colon cancer cells. They also show anti-inflammatory properties due to inhibition of cellular nitric oxide production. The anticancer activity of ginger rhizome against colorectal carcinoma is attributed to the main compound of the extract—α-zingiberene and its derivatives [

Studies confirm that 6-shogaol exerts significant anticancer activity both in vivo and in vitro, and at present is concerned as an efficacious immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment [
