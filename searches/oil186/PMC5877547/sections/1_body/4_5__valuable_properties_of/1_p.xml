<p>Except from the European olive, known as 
 <italic>Olea europea</italic>, there are many other plants rich in invaluable polyphenols. Epigallocatechin and genistein, present in tea and soy, contribute to the DNA hypomethylation, and thus reactivation of the previously suppressed suppressor genes such as 
 <italic>p16</italic>, 
 <italic>RARbeta</italic>, 
 <italic>MGMT</italic>, resulting in the inhibition of cancer induction or growth [
