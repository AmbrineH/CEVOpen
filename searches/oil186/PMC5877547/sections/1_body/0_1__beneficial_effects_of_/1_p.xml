<p>As the name suggests, polyphenols are natural, synthetic, or semisynthetic organic compounds with multiple phenolic groups in the structure. It means that polyphenols typically contain one or more aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups attached to them [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There is a growing body of evidence for beneficial roles of natural plant polyphenols in the human body. Natural bioactive polyphenols are compounds of varied chemical structures. Polyphenols are arguably the largest group of chemical substances in the plant kingdom. There are more than 8000 different polyphenolic structures known, including several hundred isolated from edible plants [

Their sources are, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, roots, bark, leaves of different plants, herbs, whole grain products, processed foods, as well as tea, coffee, and red wine. These compounds are characterized by a broad spectrum of biological activities. The beneficial impact of vegetables, fruits, and herbs on human health has been well known for centuries. Today, we understand the reasons for that as many plant-derived products are rich in nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and very importantly, bioactive polyphenols. Some vitamins as well as polyphenols present powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that make them natural and efficient anticancer agents to be found in a well-balanced diet. Unlike vitamins and minerals, polyphenols are not the essential elements of the primary plant metabolism. Natural polyphenolic compounds are rather products of the secondary plant metabolism. Anyhow, they do play critical metabolic roles in the human organism [
