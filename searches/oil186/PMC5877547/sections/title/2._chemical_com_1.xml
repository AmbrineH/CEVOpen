 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of olive oil varies depending on the extraction technology that is applied in order to obtain oil form the fruits (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-00686-f001" href="#ijms-19-00686-f001">Figure 1</a>). The process of extraction of olive oil depends on crushing olives and then separating the oil from the fruit pulp under elevated pressure. Additionally, olive oil can be extruded, post-pressured, re-pressed with or without the use of hot water. The olive oil obtained from this kind of process is usually characterized by stronger color intensity, weaker aroma, and a higher content of free fatty acids [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oil obtained by chemical extraction can be used for consumption only after refining. A refining process is meant to purify the extracted oil from any residual solvent and other impurities. Refined olive oil is devoid of vitamins, polyphenols, phytosterols, and other low molecular natural ingredients [
  <a rid="B15-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijms-19-00686">15</a>]. Extra virgin olive oil by its low yield is more expensive than other types of olive oil, but it contains the highest level of polyphenols [
  <a rid="B16-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijms-19-00686">16</a>]. Due to the removal of free fatty acids, extra virgin olive oil has a delicate flavor, aroma, and light color [

  <a rid="B24-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijms-19-00686">24</a>]. Another interesting feature affecting virgin olive oil properties is filtration. Unfiltered olive oil preserves additional polyphenols of higher polarity that are typically lost with small amounts of water that are removed upon filtration.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to multiple technological processes, the content of polyphenols may vary in olive oil. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-00686-f001" href="#ijms-19-00686-f001">Figure 1</a> represents the level of polyphenols in olive oil dependent on the technological process of olive oil production.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Olive oil mostly consists of triacylglycerols (98–99%). Triacylglycerols (TGA) are a diverse group of glycerol esters with different fatty acids. The predominant fatty acid present in olive oil TGAs is monounsaturated oleic acid (up to 83% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>). There is also palmitic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitoleic acid making up the remainder of olive oil TGAs. There is a plethora of lipophilic or amphiphilic microconstituents present in virgin olive oil, among them, phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, phenolic compounds, terpenic acid derivatives, etc. [

  <a rid="B28-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijms-19-00686">28</a>]. Phenolic compounds occur in the form of: phenolic acids or alcohols, oleuropein derivatives, lignans, and flavonoids. In olive oil, the content of polyphenols ranges from 50 to 1000 mg/kg. As a matter of fact, it depends on the agronomic factors, the ripeness of olives, as well as extraction technology, along with storage or packaging processes [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flesh of healthy olives contains about 2–3% of phenolic substances in the form of glucosides and esters. Virgin olive oil contains about 500 mg/L of polyphenols. The quantity and quality of polyphenols in olive oil is closely related to the process of olive milling and further processing. Therefore, virgin olive oils have substantially higher amounts of polyphenols than refined olive oils [

Phenolic compounds are mainly responsible for the characteristic gustatory property of virgin olive oil, namely the bitter taste. Some micro constituents of olive oil are soluble in water, and thus, the content of phenolic compounds that are present in olive oil depends to a large extent on the extraction process [
