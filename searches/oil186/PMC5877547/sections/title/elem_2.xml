In clinical studies including patients with first-degree hypertension treated with olive leaf extract, the tendency to lowering the blood pressure was observed. Twice-daily dosing of 500 mg (1 g/day) of the olive leaf extract was as effective as an alternative medicine that is typically prescribed in order to lower blood pressure [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, a chemopreventive activity of olive oil has been attributed to its unique phenolic compounds represented by phenolic alcohols like hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol: 3,4-DHPEA) and tyrosol (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydroxytyrosol (HT) belongs to polyphenols, which are abundant in olives (
   <span class="italic">Olea europea</span> L.) and consequently in virgin olive oil. Its beneficial properties for human health are strongly related to the ability of the molecule to scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species as well as to activate endogenous antioxidant systems in the body. Free radical scavenging properties of HT have been convincingly confirmed in studies on rats with alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studies on the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line have shown that HT stimulates mitochondrial biosynthesis which is reduced in the course of diabetes mellitus. Most likely, HT increases mitochondrial biosynthesis pathway via upregulation of PGC-1α. Relatively low concentrations of hydroxytyrosol in adipocytes increase the expression of all mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, including ATP synthase. HT protects mitochondria against the reduction of mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and modulates activity of the critical transcription factors, such as Nrf1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1) and Tfam (transcription factor A, mitochondrial). All of these unique properties of HT are attributed to a potential risk reduction for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [
