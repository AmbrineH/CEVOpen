 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the name suggests, polyphenols are natural, synthetic, or semisynthetic organic compounds with multiple phenolic groups in the structure. It means that polyphenols typically contain one or more aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups attached to them [

  <a rid="B2-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijms-19-00686">2</a>]. There is a growing body of evidence for beneficial roles of natural plant polyphenols in the human body. Natural bioactive polyphenols are compounds of varied chemical structures. Polyphenols are arguably the largest group of chemical substances in the plant kingdom. There are more than 8000 different polyphenolic structures known, including several hundred isolated from edible plants [

  <a rid="B4-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijms-19-00686">4</a>]. Their sources are, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, roots, bark, leaves of different plants, herbs, whole grain products, processed foods, as well as tea, coffee, and red wine. These compounds are characterized by a broad spectrum of biological activities. The beneficial impact of vegetables, fruits, and herbs on human health has been well known for centuries. Today, we understand the reasons for that as many plant-derived products are rich in nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and very importantly, bioactive polyphenols. Some vitamins as well as polyphenols present powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that make them natural and efficient anticancer agents to be found in a well-balanced diet. Unlike vitamins and minerals, polyphenols are not the essential elements of the primary plant metabolism. Natural polyphenolic compounds are rather products of the secondary plant metabolism. Anyhow, they do play critical metabolic roles in the human organism [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polyphenols were determined to reduce morbidity and/or slow down the progression of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer diseases. The mechanism of action of polyphenols strongly relates to their antioxidant activity. Polyphenols are known to decrease the level of reactive oxygen species in the human body. Other than that, health-promoting properties of plant polyphenols comprise anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-atherogenic, anti-thrombotic, and anti-mutagenic effects [

There is a body of research presenting their ability to modulate the human immune system by affecting the proliferation and activity of white blood cells, as well as the production of cytokines or other factors that participate in the immunological defense [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A daily intake of polyphenols ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 g per day [
  <a rid="B10-ijms-19-00686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijms-19-00686">10</a>] with the main dietary source being fruits and vegetables, as well as herbs, spices, seasonings, coffee, tea, or wine [

The polyphenols of olive oil are especially interesting with respect to their well-established beneficial effects on human health and metabolism, as well as the popularity of olive oil in many different diets, and specifically the Mediterranean cuisine. Herein, we mostly focus on the anticancer properties of polyphenols available from olive oil.
