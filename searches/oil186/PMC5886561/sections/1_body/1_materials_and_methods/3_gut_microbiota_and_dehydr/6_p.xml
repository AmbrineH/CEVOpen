<p>The effect of dehydration on decay was investigated using both untreated wild-type flies and antibiotic treated flies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195482.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Three states of dehydration were tested: not dehydrated; dehydrated at 50°C for three days while entrapped on the resin surface, but before entombment; and dehydrated isolated from the resin at 50°C for three days before entombment.
