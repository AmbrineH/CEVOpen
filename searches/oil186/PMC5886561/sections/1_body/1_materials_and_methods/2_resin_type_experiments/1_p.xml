<p>Two species of resin-producing trees, with distinct resin chemistries, were used: 
 <italic>Wollemia nobilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>. 
 <italic>Wollemia nobilis</italic> is an Araucariacean, a family of trees whose resin (belonging to Class 1b in the mass spectroscopy resin chemistry classification scheme) is generally characterized by the presence of labanoid terpenoids and the absence of succinic acid [
