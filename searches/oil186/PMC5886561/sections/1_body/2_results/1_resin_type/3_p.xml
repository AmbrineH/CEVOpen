<p>Retention of internal tissues and the presence of bubbles were the decay features that were most significantly different between the flies embedded in different resins (p-values = 1.5E-08 for internal tissue preservation, and 4.1E-04, for bubble presence). Flies in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin were significantly more likely to have internal bubbles and to lack internal soft tissue preservation, indicating that decay proceeds more quickly in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin than in 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>nobilis</italic> resin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resin type influences decay.
