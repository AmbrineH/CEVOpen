<p class="p">These results are consistent with the idea that the composition of the gut microbiota influences the decay process, and therefore preservation potential. However, the idea that dehydration prior to entombment inhibits decay is not supported. Flies dried isolated from resin show more decay than those dried on the resin, where some of the fly is in contact with the resin. This is best explained because any delay in embedding a fly in resin allows decay to proceed. A corollary being that resin does have a prohibitive effect on decay.</p>
