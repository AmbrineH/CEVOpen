<p>Many volatile compounds commonly found in essential oils have been assessed for antibacterial activity, but their effectiveness varies depending on the bacterium. For example, (-)-limonene (which is found in similar amounts in both resins used in this study), inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, but does not inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> or 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). This significantly reduces the amount of data we have to determine the antibacterial activity of the two resins: only six of the 23 compounds of interest—carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene, (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and α-pinene—have been studied, and their antibacterial effectiveness has only been assessed against 1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s012">S6 Table</xref>). In our analysis, we only identified the gut microbiota bacteria to the genus level; however the genus

 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> resin is enriched relative to 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>nobilis</italic> resin in carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene: carvacrol and carvacrol methyl ether inhibit 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>plantarum</italic>; and 3-carene does not inhibit

 <italic>Wollemia nobilis</italic> resin is enriched relative to 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>sylvestris</italic> resin in (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and α-pinene: (-)-terpin-4-ol inhibits 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>plantarum</italic>; sabinene and α-pinene do not inhibit 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>plantarum</italic>. These results only illustrate a tiny fraction of the complex chemical interactions between the resin and gut microbiota activity, and they are therefore inconclusive. Based on this we once again cannot determine which resin should have a stronger influence on decay due to the interaction of volatile compounds and gut microbiota activity.
