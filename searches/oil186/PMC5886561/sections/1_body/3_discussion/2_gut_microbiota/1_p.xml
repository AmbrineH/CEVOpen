<p>Our experimental results indicate that very small variations in the gut microbiota influence decay. This is important because gut microbiota in fruit flies are easily altered, allowing for the potential to create a systematic biases in the amber fossil record. Wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiome between populations, which may be based on the food available in the region [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; this could result in different populations of the same species having different fossilization potential when entombed in amber. In addition, because the gut microbiota must be constantly replenished through eating [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] an organism that has not fed for recently may have no gut biota. In fact, in laboratory analyses of gut microbiota, simply switching flies to a new food medium is enough to significantly reduce the density of gut bacteria, even without a period of starvation [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, even within the same species the types, consistency and quantities of food available in a certain environment, or across different environments may influence its preservation potential in amber. A gut microbiota bias could explain preservational variation between amber sites that are geographically localized and chemically similar, but which vary in presence or absence of an entombed fauna. For example, only 17 of over 300 Lebanese amber outcrops contain fossils [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; and only seven out of more than 100 Spanish amber outcrops contain fossils [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The similarities in amber chemistry suggest that resin chemistry was not sufficiently different between these sites to explain preservation variation. It is possible that gut microbiotas may have varied between these populations, and this might explain the presence or absence of fossils.
