<p>Fossil assemblages in amber provide a unique and exceptionally-well preserved record of small, soft-bodied organisms that are not typically preserved through other mechanisms of fossilization [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The importance of this fossil reserve is best illustrated in what it has revealed about the evolutionary history of insects: for example, it provides evidence for macroevolutionary patterns such as a mid-Cretaceous transition between two major insect evolutionary faunas, which corresponds with the gymnosperm-angiosperm shift [
 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, preservation fidelity in amber is such that insects retain micron-scale morphological details allowing for accurate comparative anatomical studies with extant taxa: many fossil insects preserved in amber can be confidently placed into modern taxonomic groups on this basis.
