<p>Both resin type and the degree of dehydration of partially-entrapped insects prior to their full entombment have been suggested to affect preservation quality in amber [

 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is why we test these variables here. We add the gut microbiome as an addition variable in our experiments for two reasons: first, in sediment-hosted exceptionally-preserved fossils it has been demonstrated to be an important control in decay and/or preservation [

 <xref rid="pone.0195482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; and second, wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiota between populations [
