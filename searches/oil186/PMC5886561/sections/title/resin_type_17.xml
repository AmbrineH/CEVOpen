 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrate experimentally that resin type operates a strong control on the decay of fruit flies: over identical time periods, flies in 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin retained anatomical details including non-cuticular internal features, whereas flies in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> showed poor preservation or loss of most features, including cuticle. This suggests that resin type does impart a preservational bias in the amber fossil record. This is the first, but important, step in developing a more complete understanding of the resin-type bias in the amber fossil record. To add to this we need to determine which specific characteristics of these two resins were responsible for the differences in decay. Then, different ambers could be assessed on the basis of these characteristics to determine how successfully they could inhibit the decay of labile tissues or organisms.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resins influence decay in a number of ways: physically blocking scavengers and external microbes from the entombed carcass, dehydrating tissues to indirectly inhibit microbial activity, and/or or directly inhibiting microbial activity through antiseptic properties. The two resins used in these experiments could differ in any of these factors, for example, different permeability could vary microbe access to the carcass, and different resin chemistry could result in differential dehydration or decay-inhibition rate. There are three potential lines of evidence to understand how the volatile and semi-volatile chemical compounds that differ between the two experimental resins might influence gut microbiota activity: (1) identifying key antibiotic volatile compounds that differ between the two resins; (2) investigate the antibiotic effects of all the 23 compounds of interest on the specific bacteria present in the gut microbiotas of the fruit flies used in these experiments; and (3) comparing the overall volatile composition of the two resins to other essential oils that are more or less effective at inhibiting the activity of bacteria found in fruit fly gut microbiotas. Here we examine the literature on all three lines of evidence.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In essential oils, phenolic compounds such as thymol and carvacrol are considered to be key compounds for robust antibacterial activity [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref050">50</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref052">52</a>]. These compounds in isolation show strong antibacterial properties, and are effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref050">50</a>]; they are also often enriched in essential oils that have strong antibacterial effects [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref051">51</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref052">52</a>]. Carvacrol is one of the 23 compounds that differ between 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin and 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s007" href="#pone.0195482.s007">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s008" href="#pone.0195482.s008">S2</a> Tables). It is present in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin but not in 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin, which seems to suggest that 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin is more effective at inhibiting gut bacteria activity than 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin. However, carvacrol only makes up 0.07% of the 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin, whereas it is a major component of antibacterial essential oils (e.g. it makes up 81.4% of thyme essential oil [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref052">52</a>]) and its antibacterial effects in isolation have been tested at 100% concentration. Therefore, the presence of trace amounts of carvacrol in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin is unlikely to be significant for decay inhibition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many volatile compounds commonly found in essential oils have been assessed for antibacterial activity, but their effectiveness varies depending on the bacterium. For example, (-)-limonene (which is found in similar amounts in both resins used in this study), inhibits the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, but does not inhibit the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref050">50</a>] (two bacteria commonly found in fruit fly gut microbiotas [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref019">19</a>]). This significantly reduces the amount of data we have to determine the antibacterial activity of the two resins: only six of the 23 compounds of interest—carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene, (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and α-pinene—have been studied, and their antibacterial effectiveness has only been assessed against 1 (
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum)</span> of the many bacteria (at least 44 genera) found in our fruit fly gut microbiotas (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s012" href="#pone.0195482.s012">S6 Table</a>). In our analysis, we only identified the gut microbiota bacteria to the genus level; however the genus 
  <span class="italic">Lactobacillus</span> was found in our samples and 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span> is a very common species in a fruit fly gut [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref019">19</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> resin is enriched relative to 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin in carvacrol, carvacrol methyl ether, and 3-carene: carvacrol and carvacrol methyl ether inhibit 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>; and 3-carene does not inhibit 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Wollemia nobilis</span> resin is enriched relative to 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin in (-)-terpin-4-ol, sabinene, and α-pinene: (-)-terpin-4-ol inhibits 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>; sabinene and α-pinene do not inhibit 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>. These results only illustrate a tiny fraction of the complex chemical interactions between the resin and gut microbiota activity, and they are therefore inconclusive. Based on this we once again cannot determine which resin should have a stronger influence on decay due to the interaction of volatile compounds and gut microbiota activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mixtures of volatile compounds may also inhibit bacterial activity, and so we compared the resin composition to the composition of essential oils that do or do not inhibit the activity of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>. As with investigating the compounds individually, this only reflects a small proportion of the complexity: only 10 compounds were included to describe the chemical composition of each sample; and the samples were tested against only one component of the fruit fly gut microbiota (
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum)</span>. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) does completely separate the essential oil samples into those that do and do not inhibit 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span> activity (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s006" href="#pone.0195482.s006">S6 Fig</a>). However, the two resin samples do not fall into either of these groups. Moreover, it is not clear which group the samples resemble more closely; depending on whether inhibiting activity increases along coordinate 1 or at a slight angle to coordinate 1 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195482.s006" href="#pone.0195482.s006">S6 Fig</a>), either 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin or 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin is more closely allied with the essential oils that inhibit 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span> activity. So once again, the results are inconclusive as to which resin should more effectively inhibit decay. In summary, only a small subset of the resin chemical compounds, and a small subset of the fruit fly gut microbiota, have been previously investigated, and therefore the published literature does not capture the full complexity of the interactions between resin chemistry and gut microbiota activity. Moreover, even at this oversimplified level, the results of our experiments are inconclusive as to which chemical compounds and which gut bacteria have the strongest influence on decay.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we cannot explain how specific compounds within resins alter decay trajectory, we can illuminate some of the ways in which resin chemistry is influenced that likely contributes to resin-chemistry biases in the amber fossil record. Resin chemistry is most obviously influenced by the taxonomy of the tree and environmental factors [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref053">53</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref054">54</a>]. But, even small chemical differences in resin chemistry between closely related trees may be important. Such chemical distinction is thought to be strongly controlled by herbivore faunal composition, [
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref038">38</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195482.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195482.ref053">53</a>], suggesting that even the make-up of plant-eating animals in an ecosystem may influence whether or not that fauna is preserved in amber.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That resin type strongly influences preservation potential means that the diversity of taxa recorded by amber is likely to be related to the tree/resin type at any locality; this may explain the major preservational patterns (such as which sites have fossils, and which sites have the best preserved fossils) in the amber fossil record, in both the presence/absence of fossils or the presence/absence of labile internal tissues [
