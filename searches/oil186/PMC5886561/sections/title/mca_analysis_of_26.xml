 <div class="title">MCA analysis of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> and 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin and various essential oils whose antibacterial properties are known.
 </div>
 <p>Note that the MCA does separate the essential oils into those that do and do not inhibit the activity of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>. However, the resins do not fall clearly into either group. (A) MCA, assuming that coordinate 1 represents the antibacterial effectiveness of the compound against 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">plantarum</span>, in which case 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">sylvestris</span> resin seems to be more likely to effectively inhibit decay. (B) MCA assuming that antibacterial effectiveness corresponds to a vector intermediate between coordinates 1 and 2, in which case 
  <span class="italic">W</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nobilis</span> resin seems likely to be slightly more effective at inhibiting decay.
