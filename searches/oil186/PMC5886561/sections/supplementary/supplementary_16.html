 <p xmlns=""> Influence of resin chemical compounds on the components of the fruit fly gut microbiota. Only six of the 23 potentially important compounds have been studied for their antibacterial effects, and only on one species of the 44 identified bacteria genera from the fruit fly gut microbiotas. No research has been done on how these compounds would influence the fungi or the Wolbachia, both of which also are present in fruit fly guts; Wolbachia dominates the fruit fly microbiota.
