  <title class="title">NMDS clustering of fruit flies based on various measures of gut microbiota similarity.</title>
  <p class="p">(A) Weighted UniFrac distance. The untreated and antibiotic treated gut microbiota communities are all dominated by one genus, 
   <italic class="italic">Wolbachia</italic>, and therefore they cannot be distinguished in a weighted NMDS analysis. (B) Unweighted UniFrac distance. The two treatment groups are distinct in an unweighted NMDS analysis using the UniFrac distance, because there are meaningful differences in the less abundant components of the gut microbiotas. (C) Jaccard distance. Once again, an unweighted distance metric also distinguishes the two gut microbiota treatment groups.
