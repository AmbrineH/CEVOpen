Instead the body margins are filled with a medium of the same density as the resin (compare the areas indicated by black circles) and which connects to the resin (black arrow), indicating that this is resin, not soft tissues.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antibiotic treated flies had fewer bubbles and ruptured abdomens than the wild-type flies. Flies subjected to dehydration showed a greater incidence of bubbles and ruptured abdomens than flies that were not dehydrated, and this was most frequently observed in flies dehydrated in isolation prior to entombment, then in flies that were dried while entrapped on resin, and least in non-dehydrated flies (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most complete anatomical preservation, and lowest frequency of bubbles and ruptured abdomens was seen in antibiotic treated flies which were freshly embedded without dehydration. The most anatomical loss and highest frequency of bubbles and ruptured abdomens was seen in untreated flies that were dehydrated while isolated from the resin before entombment (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results are consistent with the idea that the composition of the gut microbiota influences the decay process, and therefore preservation potential. However, the idea that dehydration prior to entombment inhibits decay is not supported. Flies dried isolated from resin show more decay than those dried on the resin, where some of the fly is in contact with the resin. This is best explained because any delay in embedding a fly in resin allows decay to proceed. A corollary being that resin does have a prohibitive effect on decay.</p>
