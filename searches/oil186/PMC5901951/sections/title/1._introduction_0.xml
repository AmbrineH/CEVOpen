 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In modern society, forest plants and their products have been increasingly viewed as useful resources, which have prompted research on applications of plant-based products and utilization of associated organic compounds with diverse physiological activities [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Given the potential utility of plant-based products, in particular plant-based oils, it is surprising that relatively few studies have been conducted on oil resources of forest trees, which may be an important source of functional chemical substances. In general, vegetable oils are obtained from grains, and their major components are fatty acids, accounting for over 90% of ester forms. Vegetable fats contain more unsaturated fatty acids than animal fats, and unsaturated fatty acids have important nutritional and functional properties. In particular, many seed oils contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Of them, the n-6 series of linoleic acid (C18 : 2) generate conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), through microbial or chemical reactions, which is an isomer known to have useful functions in the human body [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. In addition, the n-3 series of alpha-linolenic acid (C18 : 3, n-3), which are particularly representative fatty acids of perilla oil, can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20 : 5, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22 : 6, n-3) by desaturation and chain elongation in human bodies [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. These n-3 series of fatty acids are essential to synthesize brain phospholipids and are known to improve brain function, including learning ability [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. Vegetable fats also contain high levels of phytosterols and vitamin E, thus have antioxidant activity; these constituents confer oxidative stability for food processing, storage, and distribution [

  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among vegetable oils that are known as sources of fat-soluble components, there have been many studies on seed oils of legumes and nuts [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>], but there have been few studies on seed oils derived from tree-borne seeds [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at characterizing chemical characteristics of tree-borne seed oils: mastic-leaf prickly ash (MPA, Zanthoxylum schinifolium Siebold &amp; Zucc), Japanese camphor tree (JCT, 
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum yabunikkei</span> H.Ohba), Korean evodia (KOE, 
  <span class="italic">Euodia daniellii</span> (Benn.) Hemsl.), Japanese lacquer tree (JLT, 
  <span class="italic">Rhus verniciflua</span> Stokes), Tung tree (TUT, 
  <span class="italic">Vernicia fordii</span> (Hemsl.) Airy Shaw), and oriental raisin tree (ORT, 
  <span class="italic">Hovenia dulcis</span> Thunb.). Although these are plants commonly found in the wild, there has been little research on fat-soluble components of their seed oils. In fact, most literature on the use of plant-based products tend to report pharmacological effects of beverage or root components using leaves or fruits of trees, whereas reports on oils tended to focus on simple topics, such as fatty acid composition. As a follow-up study of our recent report about physicochemical properties of tree-borne seed oils [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>], here we identified physicochemical properties of oils extracted from 6 trees, by which we evaluated their potentials as oil resources, and provided fundamental data for their use as oil resources.
