  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trees from which we obtained tree-borne seed oils for this study were MPA, JCT, KOE, JLT, TUT, and ORT. Samples were harvested and collected by Southern Forest Resources Research Center, Jinju, Republic of Korea, in 2016, and oils were extracted from seed endosperm, for which seed coats and impurities were removed manually. For solvent extraction, samples were mixed with

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify fatty acid composition of the extracted tree-borne seed oils, the seed oils were derivatized to methyl ester using boron trifluoride- (BF3-) methanol before analysis [
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Approximately 0.1 g of tree-borne seed oils were collected in test tubes, to which 0.5 mL heptadecanoic acid (C17 : 0) (1 mg/mL hexane) was added as an internal reference. After adding 2 mL of 0.5 M NaOH methanol to the test tubes, the tube was heated at 110°C for 10 min using a Reacti-Therm III Heating/Stirring Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Rockford, IL, USA), which was then cooled to room temperature, and heated again at 110°C after adding 4 mL BF3-methanol for 1 h. After cooling, 2 mL hexane was added to the sample mix and vortexed for 1 min, followed by collection of the hexane layer. Solvent was removed from the hexane layer collected through three repetitions of hexane addition and extraction using nitrogen gas, and then the remaining residue was dissolved with 1 mL hexane again, which was used as the sample for fatty acid analysis. Fatty acids of tree-borne seed oils were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using Agilent Technologies 6890N (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). An SP-2560 capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>m film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used as the column for analysis, and nitrogen (2.7 mL/min) was used as carrier gas. Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 250°C. The sample ratio to the inlet was set to 10 : 1, and rates of hydrogen and air for flame ionization at the detector were set to 40 mL and 450 mL/min, respectively. The initial oven temperature was 130°C for 5 min and gradually increased to 240°C by 4°C/min, and maintained at 240°C for 15 min. Analyzed results were identified by retention time on the basis of 37 fatty acids reference standards (Supelco 37 FAME, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).

For extraction, 10 mL distilled water and 7 mL hexanes were added to the sample mix and then the supernatant corresponding to the hexane layer was separated. Extraction of the hexane layer was repeated three times. The solvent was completely evaporated from the separated hexane layer under nitrogen gas to concentrate the residue. Weight of the completely concentrated residue was measured and compared with input sample amount, by which residue weight was calculated as the ratio of unsaponifiables.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For phytosterol analysis, derivatization was performed by using the trimethylsilyl group. Unsaponifiables were mixed with 0.5 mL of BSTFA (N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + trimethylchlorosilane) that contained 1% trimethylsilyl chloride and 1 mL pyridine, and dissolved again, followed by induction of reaction at 80°C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were slowly cooled at room temperature and filtered with a 0.45

Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 300°C and 320°C, respectively, and the split ratio was 10 : 1. Detection was performed by a flame ionization detector. For identification and measurement of phytosterols, each reference standard, campesterol, stigmasterol, and
