 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acid value of tree-borne seed oils was measured using the American Oil Chemist's Society (AOCS) method [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. After adding 1 g oil to a 150 mL conical flask, 30 mL of the solution was mixed with ethanol-ether in 1 : 1 (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) ratio to dissolve oils. To this solution, we added (and mixed well) 100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>L of 1% phenolphthalein as an indicator and then the mix was titrated with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH)/ethanol solution until it became light red. Acid value was finally identified through a mock experiment without sample.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peroxide value of seed oils were measured using the AOCS method [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. After collecting 1 g oil in a 250 mL conical flask, oil samples were dissolved with 25 mL of solution mixed with acetic acid-chloroform in 3 : 2 (
  <span class="italic">v</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) ratio, to which 1 mL saturated potassium iodide (KI) solution was added. The mix was then shaken for 1 min, incubated in a dark condition for 10 min, and mixed well with 75 mL distilled water. Then, 1 mL of 1% starch solution was added, and the solution was titrated with 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate (Na
  <sub>2</sub>S
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub>) solution until it became transparent. Peroxide value was finally identified through a mock experiment without sample.

  <span class="italic">p</span>-AV was utilized. After mixing 100 mg oil with 25 mL isooctane, optical density (OD) was measured at 350 nm. Following reaction of 2.5 mL of this solution with 0.5 mL of 0.25% (
