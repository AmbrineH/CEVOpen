 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytosterol contents within tree-borne seed oils are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. Phytosterol contents ranged from 117.77 ± 1.32 mg/100 g in TUT to 479.45 ± 4.27 mg/100 g in JLT. Of phytosterols, campesterol was found at the highest level (59.43 ± 0.31 mg/100 g) in MPA, and JLT had the highest levels of stigmasterol (20.20 ± 0.17 mg/100 g), 
  <span class="italic">β</span>-sitosterol (388.84 ± 3.19 mg/100 g), and Δ5-avenasterol (34.54 ± 0.74 mg/100 g). According to a literature [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>], comparisons of phytosterols extracted from coriander and seed oils of caraway, anise, nutmeg, and white mustard showed that their phytosterol contents ranged between 283.64 and 859.79 mg/100 oil, based on which it was considered that phytosterol contents in tree-borne seed oils except JLT oil were lower than those reported in the literature. Phytosterols refer to sterols originated from plants, and over 250 phytosterols have been reported to date. A clinical trial confirmed that phytosterols lowered cholesterol [
