  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Fatty Acid Composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid analysis results of tree-borne seed oils are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. A total of 15 kinds of fatty acids were identified from six tree-borne seed oils, which included seven types of saturated fatty acids, four types of monounsaturated fatty acids, and four types of polyunsaturated fatty acids. For saturated fatty acids, JCT had 97.94 ± 0.04%, corresponding to the highest level, and the remaining five seed oils contained in the range between 6.76 ± 0.02% and 16.24 ± 0.07%. In particular, JCT showed a high medium-chain fatty acid content (&gt;96%) which is interesting given health implications of these fatty acids. Specially, fatty acids of edible oils are long-chain triglycerides composed of 14–20 carbons, which are absorbed by lymph vessels through a fat-specific digestive process, including emulsification and chylomicron formation. Owing to this long digestion process, long-chain triglycerides are relatively less utilized for energy than are carbohydrates or proteins and are likely to be stored in the body, thus likely causing obesity [
   <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. In contrast, medium-chain triglycerides that have short fatty acids with 8–12 carbons are absorbed by the liver, through the hepatic portal vein, without formation of chylomicron (the general characteristic of fat digestion) and can be digested without bile or lipase. The medium-chain triglycerides are mostly obtained through hydrolysis of coconut oil, butter, and palm oil and are also found in human breast milk, in which they account for approximately 20% of milk. Because medium-chain triglycerides do not need proteins such as fatty acid binding protein, fatty acid transport protein, and fatty acid translocase for their processing, their oxidation rate is faster than that of long-chain fatty acids, and thus, they tend to be used as an energy source rather than being accumulated in the body [
   <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>, 
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. According to previous reports, diets with medium-chain fatty acids had a better thermic effect of food than those with long-chain fatty acids [
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>–
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Another study also reported that medium-chain fatty acids had a higher thermic effect of food than long-chain fatty acids, reduced appetite, and increased satiety during a 2-week study, resulting in weight loss [
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. In respect to the practicality of cooking with medium-chain fatty acids, their smoke point is low and bubbles are generated when mixed with other vegetable oils or when they are used for frying. To solve these issues, a study on medium- and long-chain triglycerides that contain a certain amount of long-chain triglycerides with essential fatty acids has been ongoing [
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>].

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For monounsaturated fatty acids, the highest level was 53.34 ± 1.21% found in TUT, and its level ranged from 1.82 ± 0.01% in TUT to 37.19 ± 0.02% in MPA. Oleic acid, although not an essential fatty acid, is known to lower cholesterol levels in the body, contributing to prevention of cardiovascular disease, so that it is a nutritionally significant fatty acid [
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. In addition, monounsaturated fatty acids have possessed a higher oxidative stability than polyunsaturated fatty acids, showing a higher convenience and stability in oil processing [
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were high in JLT and KOE (62.01 ± 0.14% and 60.39 ± 0.06%). While MPA, ORT, and TUT also had over 40% of polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, their levels in JCT were as low as 0.73 ± 0.01%. Linoleic acid, which is the representative of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is mostly found in plant grains, and it lowers blood cholesterols and inhibits arterial thrombus formation. Linoleic acid levels in JLT were as high as 60.41 ± 0.12%. As omega-6 fatty acids are generally unable to be synthesized in humans and mammals, they are classified as essential fatty acids [
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Omega-3 fatty acids, which are represented by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linolenic acid, have various nutritional functions. ORT was found to have a high linolenic acid content with 35.13 ± 0.05%, and TUT had 28.21 ± 1.20% of DHA (C22 : 6
   <span class="italic">ω</span>3). Omega-3 fatty acids that are represented by DHA and linolenic acid have various nutritional functions, which not only serve as a fuel of metabolism but also protect and maintain cells and play important roles in maintenance and apoptosis of heart cells [
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. In addition, linolenic acid helps blood circulation by lowering blood cholesterol levels, affecting prevention or improvement of vascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, obesity, diabetes, and atopy [
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. The six tree-borne seed oils in this study showed various fatty acid compositions. Some seed oils had a high level of medium-chain fatty acids, others had a high level of monounsaturated fatty acids, and yet others had a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to function as various biological membranes and are involved in cell metabolism, the human body often fails to synthesize sufficient amounts; therefore, such deficiency needs to be supplemented by an external source (food) [
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Most seed oils, except JCT oil, contained high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. While contributing to nutritional functions, such high unsaturation levels are vulnerable to acidification. Thus, prevention of acidification for oil storage and processing needs to be studied in order to enable tree-borne seed oils to be used as food and functional food materials.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Tocopherol Contents</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tocopherol contents of tree-borne seed oils are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. A total of three tocopherol isomers (
   <span class="italic">α</span>-T, 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>-T, and 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>-T) were identified, whereas tocotrienols were undetected. Vitamin E contents in the six tree-borne seed oils ranged from 3.82 ± 0.04 mg/100 g to 101.98 ± 1.34 mg/100 g. KOE oil had the lowest level of tocopherols, whereas oil from ORT had the highest content. Vitamins are organic compounds that support nutrient functions in the body, and tocopherols have antiaging effects due to their antioxidant activity [
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Tocopherols occur as a viscous, pale-yellow, oily substance in nature and are defined as a derivative group of 2-methyl-6-hydroxy-chroman; in this group, there are four types of tocopherols—
   <span class="italic">α</span>, 
   <span class="italic">β</span>, 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>—depending on the degree of the methyl group bound to the chroman-ring [
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>, 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. For 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-T, JCT oil had the highest level (10.88 ± 0.43 mg/100 g) among the six tree-borne seed oils. 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-T has the highest vitamin E activity. 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-T is present in a trace amount in general vegetable oils but was undetected in all the tree-borne seed oils. 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>-T is used as antioxidant in major foods and was present in the highest proportion of all tocopherols in the tree-borne seed oils. For 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>-T, ORT (95.59 ± 1.24 mg/100 g) had the highest level. 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>-T, which is, like 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-T, mostly present as a trace element in plants, was found to be at the highest level in JLT (33.92 ± 0.47 mg/100 g), whereas the other oils had only trace amounts of 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>-T. Tocopherol activity reduces in the order 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-T &gt; 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-T &gt; 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>-T &gt; 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>-T; tocopherols mainly inhibit oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and fat-soluble vitamin A, preventing arteriosclerosis, cataract, and cancer that are caused by lipid peroxide that is generated during lipid acidification. Thus, tocopherols are important vitamins for modern humans [
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Individual contents in fat-soluble vitamin analysis may vary depending on the extraction method. When Miraliakbari and Shahidi extracted tocopherols from tree nut oils, extraction using chloroform/methanol as solvent showed a significantly higher yield than that of hexane (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. It was postulated that such difference in contents could be attributable to a higher solubility in the chloroform/methanol system. While we used hexane in this study, it would vary in tocopherol content depending on the extraction solvent system. As Miraliakbari and Shahidi reported 6.18–19.87 mg/100 g as the range of tocopherol contents in seven tree nut oils [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>], it seemed that tocopherol contents of tree-borne seed oils, except that of KOE, should not be less than those of tree nut oils that are used in food.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytosterol contents within tree-borne seed oils are listed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab3" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. Phytosterol contents ranged from 117.77 ± 1.32 mg/100 g in TUT to 479.45 ± 4.27 mg/100 g in JLT. Of phytosterols, campesterol was found at the highest level (59.43 ± 0.31 mg/100 g) in MPA, and JLT had the highest levels of stigmasterol (20.20 ± 0.17 mg/100 g), 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-sitosterol (388.84 ± 3.19 mg/100 g), and Δ5-avenasterol (34.54 ± 0.74 mg/100 g). According to a literature [
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>], comparisons of phytosterols extracted from coriander and seed oils of caraway, anise, nutmeg, and white mustard showed that their phytosterol contents ranged between 283.64 and 859.79 mg/100 oil, based on which it was considered that phytosterol contents in tree-borne seed oils except JLT oil were lower than those reported in the literature. Phytosterols refer to sterols originated from plants, and over 250 phytosterols have been reported to date. A clinical trial confirmed that phytosterols lowered cholesterol [
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. As phytosterols are not synthesized in the human body, they need to be provided through diet. The human body has an extremely low level of phytosterol in the blood, which is because of a low intestinal absorption rate of phytosterols [

   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab4" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>. ORT and JLT had the highest level of unsaponifiables in tree-borne seed oils, which seemed to be proportional to the high tocopherol level (101.98 ± 1.34 mg/100 g oil; 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>) and a high phytosterol content (479.45 ± 4.27 mg/100 g oil;

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contents of AV, POV, and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-AV in tree-borne seed oils are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab5" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. Acid value indicates acidity when fatty acids of oils bound to glycerol were separated to free fatty acids, by the change in quality; a high acid value means a high proportion of free fatty acids or a low quality of oils. Of the oil resources, MPA had the highest acid value with (38.94 ± 0.24), whereas TUT had the lowest value (0.79 ± 0.01). Additional research is needed to determine if the high acid value of MPA was due to acidification or due to preexisting free fatty acids. For POV, JCT oil showed the lowest value (3.53 ± 0.21 meq/kg) among the tree-borne seed oils, whereas MPA oil showed a relatively high value (127.67 ± 1.79 meq/kg). Although POV is a basic method to measure primary oxidation products, it is difficult to use in cases of high temperature or increasing acidification. POV is obtained by measuring lipid hydroperoxide, the primary oxidation product, which is used for detection of acidification in oils or for the measurement of the induction period. At levels of 60 meq/kg or lower (the reference value for POV content of vegetable oils for frying), it is possible that acidification by generation of primary oxidation products (e.g., in tree-borne seed oils except MPA oil) might not have been completed yet [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oil acidification leads to elevation of aldehyde levels, and

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.6. Brown Color Intensity and Color Scale</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measured brown color intensities of tree-borne seed oils using as an indicator of oil oxidation are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab6" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>. To measure browning intensity, we used the absorption of wavelength at 420 nm that specifically absorbs brown colors. Highest browning intensities were observed in JCT and ORT oils (2.84 ± 0.23 and 2.29 ± 0.06), whereas TUT oil had the lowest browning intensity (0.20 ± 0.01). Color scales identified at 420 nm not only included brown color intensity from browning but also reflected changes by each oil's own brown pigment. Further, color scales of oils of tree-borne seed were measured by a color difference meter, and the results are shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab6" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>. Although there was no significant difference in 
   <span class="italic">L</span>
   <span class="sup">∗</span> values that reflected brightness in the colorimeter, TUT oil had the highest color scale (41.03 ± 0.02). Overall, 
   <span class="italic">a</span>
   <span class="sup">∗</span> values of color scale had negative values, indicating greenness. ORT oil showed a relatively high greenness (−4.25 ± 0.01). As for the 
   <span class="italic">b</span>
   <span class="sup">∗</span> values in the color scale, a higher positive value indicates an increase in yellowness, and ORT oil (10.47 ± 0.01) had a relatively high yellowness. Such high yellowness was consistent with browning intensity (2.29 ± 0.06). In addition, TUT oil also was consistent in terms of the lowest browning intensity (0.20 ± 0.01) and the lowest yellowness (0.04 ± 0.01).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.7. Oxidative Stability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxidative stability of tree-borne seed oils was measured by the rancimat test, and the results are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab7" href="#tab7">Table 7</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Lipids can produce oxidative compounds such as volatile organic acids (mainly formic acid and acetic acid) during oxidation processes. Oxidation-induction period refers to the time when oxygen absorption rate reached the maximum immediately before acidification. Volatile dicarboxylic acids are generated from acidification of tree-borne seed oils, and they produce secondary oxidative compounds including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and low molecular weight products causing electrical conductivity to increase within the rancimat system, by which the oxidation-induction period was assessed. The oxidation-induction period is known to be an indicator of antioxidative activity and oxidative stability of oils [
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. In general, a longer oxidation-induction period means a higher oxidative stability in oils. Of the six types of tree-borne seed oils in this study, JLT oil had the longest oxidation-induction period of 6.12 ± 0.04 h, whereas the shortest oxidation-induction period was observed in MPA oil (0.02 ± 0.01 h). Fatty acid profiles are an important parameter for oxidative stability in oils, but this study shows somewhat different patterns for the induction time compared to the general principle of rancimat method. JLT oil represented a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (68%) as well as excellent oxidative stability; in contrast, MPA oil had 49% of polyunsaturated fatty acid yet showed relatively low oxidative stability, these inconsistent trends indicate that induction time cannot be simply explained by a degree of polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions. In fact, the induction times for MPA (0.02 hr) and JCT (0.03 hr) were too short to produce oxidative compounds from the fatty acid decomposition (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). These induction times can be caused by other naturally occurring volatile compounds in oils prior to oxidation. Chemical parameters of MPA are consistent with these patterns; high AV (38.94 ± 0.24 mg KOH/g), POV (127.67 ± 1.79 meq/kg), and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-AV (9.67 ± 0.25) values. Moreover, MPA oil had lower tocopherol content (6.01 ± 0.06 mg/100 g) than others. Therefore, the short oxidation-induction period in MPA oil seemed reasonable. Hidalgo and others demonstrated that the addition of phospholipid to edible oils can increase their induction times [
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. The effect of phospholipid was similar to that of BHT (a synthetic antioxidant) when added [
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. For the comparison between low unsaturated fatty acids and high unsaturated fatty acid, edible oils should be refined because crude oils can contain free fatty acids, phospholipid, and various fat-soluble components which can affect the measurement of induction time. One study reported the various oxidation-induction period of olive oil from 65 to 140 h at low temperatures, demonstrating that edible oil with similar fatty acid profiles may represent varying induction times [
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. The report showed a large difference in the induction time (65–140 h) even though identical oil sample was used; hence, subtle differences in nutrients could result in a broad range of oxidation-induction period lengths. Taken together, it seems that the range of oxidation-induction periods in the six types of tree-borne seed oils may be due to both innate differences in oxidative stability and a reduced quality and stability caused by changes during extraction.
