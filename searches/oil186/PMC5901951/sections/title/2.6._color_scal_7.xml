 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following transfer of 5 g tree-borne seed oils to Petri dishes for color scale analysis, color scale was measured by a color difference meter (CR-300, Konica Minolta Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Each of

  <span class="sup">∗</span> (±, yellowness/blueness) in the Hunter scale were measured three times, from which mean values were calculated. Values of the standard plate, used as a reference, were
