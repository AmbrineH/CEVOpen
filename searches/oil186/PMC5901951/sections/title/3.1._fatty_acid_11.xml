 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid analysis results of tree-borne seed oils are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. A total of 15 kinds of fatty acids were identified from six tree-borne seed oils, which included seven types of saturated fatty acids, four types of monounsaturated fatty acids, and four types of polyunsaturated fatty acids. For saturated fatty acids, JCT had 97.94 ± 0.04%, corresponding to the highest level, and the remaining five seed oils contained in the range between 6.76 ± 0.02% and 16.24 ± 0.07%. In particular, JCT showed a high medium-chain fatty acid content (&gt;96%) which is interesting given health implications of these fatty acids. Specially, fatty acids of edible oils are long-chain triglycerides composed of 14–20 carbons, which are absorbed by lymph vessels through a fat-specific digestive process, including emulsification and chylomicron formation. Owing to this long digestion process, long-chain triglycerides are relatively less utilized for energy than are carbohydrates or proteins and are likely to be stored in the body, thus likely causing obesity [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. In contrast, medium-chain triglycerides that have short fatty acids with 8–12 carbons are absorbed by the liver, through the hepatic portal vein, without formation of chylomicron (the general characteristic of fat digestion) and can be digested without bile or lipase. The medium-chain triglycerides are mostly obtained through hydrolysis of coconut oil, butter, and palm oil and are also found in human breast milk, in which they account for approximately 20% of milk. Because medium-chain triglycerides do not need proteins such as fatty acid binding protein, fatty acid transport protein, and fatty acid translocase for their processing, their oxidation rate is faster than that of long-chain fatty acids, and thus, they tend to be used as an energy source rather than being accumulated in the body [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. According to previous reports, diets with medium-chain fatty acids had a better thermic effect of food than those with long-chain fatty acids [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>–
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Another study also reported that medium-chain fatty acids had a higher thermic effect of food than long-chain fatty acids, reduced appetite, and increased satiety during a 2-week study, resulting in weight loss [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. In respect to the practicality of cooking with medium-chain fatty acids, their smoke point is low and bubbles are generated when mixed with other vegetable oils or when they are used for frying. To solve these issues, a study on medium- and long-chain triglycerides that contain a certain amount of long-chain triglycerides with essential fatty acids has been ongoing [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For monounsaturated fatty acids, the highest level was 53.34 ± 1.21% found in TUT, and its level ranged from 1.82 ± 0.01% in TUT to 37.19 ± 0.02% in MPA. Oleic acid, although not an essential fatty acid, is known to lower cholesterol levels in the body, contributing to prevention of cardiovascular disease, so that it is a nutritionally significant fatty acid [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. In addition, monounsaturated fatty acids have possessed a higher oxidative stability than polyunsaturated fatty acids, showing a higher convenience and stability in oil processing [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were high in JLT and KOE (62.01 ± 0.14% and 60.39 ± 0.06%). While MPA, ORT, and TUT also had over 40% of polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, their levels in JCT were as low as 0.73 ± 0.01%. Linoleic acid, which is the representative of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is mostly found in plant grains, and it lowers blood cholesterols and inhibits arterial thrombus formation. Linoleic acid levels in JLT were as high as 60.41 ± 0.12%. As omega-6 fatty acids are generally unable to be synthesized in humans and mammals, they are classified as essential fatty acids [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Omega-3 fatty acids, which are represented by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linolenic acid, have various nutritional functions. ORT was found to have a high linolenic acid content with 35.13 ± 0.05%, and TUT had 28.21 ± 1.20% of DHA (C22 : 6
  <span class="italic">ω</span>3). Omega-3 fatty acids that are represented by DHA and linolenic acid have various nutritional functions, which not only serve as a fuel of metabolism but also protect and maintain cells and play important roles in maintenance and apoptosis of heart cells [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. In addition, linolenic acid helps blood circulation by lowering blood cholesterol levels, affecting prevention or improvement of vascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, obesity, diabetes, and atopy [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. The six tree-borne seed oils in this study showed various fatty acid compositions. Some seed oils had a high level of medium-chain fatty acids, others had a high level of monounsaturated fatty acids, and yet others had a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to function as various biological membranes and are involved in cell metabolism, the human body often fails to synthesize sufficient amounts; therefore, such deficiency needs to be supplemented by an external source (food) [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Most seed oils, except JCT oil, contained high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. While contributing to nutritional functions, such high unsaturation levels are vulnerable to acidification. Thus, prevention of acidification for oil storage and processing needs to be studied in order to enable tree-borne seed oils to be used as food and functional food materials.
