<p>Contents of unsaponifiables in tree-borne seed oils, particularly phytosterols, the representative unsaponifiables, were analyzed by an alkaline saponification method [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We mixed 0.5 g of extracted seed oils with 0.5 mL 5
 <italic>α</italic>-cholestane (1 mg/mL hexanes), an internal reference, followed by addition of 8 mL of 3% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) pyrogallol-ethanol solution for antioxidative capacity and 1 mL saturated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, which was then well mixed, saponified at 80°C for 1 h, and cooled in an ice bucket. For extraction, 10 mL distilled water and 7 mL hexanes were added to the sample mix and then the supernatant corresponding to the hexane layer was separated. Extraction of the hexane layer was repeated three times. The solvent was completely evaporated from the separated hexane layer under nitrogen gas to concentrate the residue. Weight of the completely concentrated residue was measured and compared with input sample amount, by which residue weight was calculated as the ratio of unsaponifiables.
