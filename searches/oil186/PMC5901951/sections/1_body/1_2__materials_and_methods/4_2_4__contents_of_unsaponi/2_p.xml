<p class="p">For phytosterol analysis, derivatization was performed by using the trimethylsilyl group. Unsaponifiables were mixed with 0.5 mL of BSTFA (N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + trimethylchlorosilane) that contained 1% trimethylsilyl chloride and 1 mL pyridine, and dissolved again, followed by induction of reaction at 80°C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were slowly cooled at room temperature and filtered with a 0.45 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m filter to remove particles, which were used as samples for phytosterol analysis. Phytosterol was analyzed by gas chromatography, for which HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m in film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used, and helium (2.7 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was 260°C at the beginning, increased to 300°C by 3°C/min, and then maintained at 300°C for 15 min. Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 300°C and 320°C, respectively, and the split ratio was 10 : 1. Detection was performed by a flame ionization detector. For identification and measurement of phytosterols, each reference standard, campesterol, stigmasterol, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., and retention time and peak area were used for identification. Phytosterol quantification was performed using 5
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-cholestane as the internal standard. To accurately quantify the phytosterols in oils, relative response factors (RRFs) to 5
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-cholestane were determined based on three replicate analyses. The RRFs were determined according to the following equation:
