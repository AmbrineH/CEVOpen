<p>To identify tocopherol contents in tree-borne seed oils, the solvent extraction method was used [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For pretreatment of samples, 1 g oil was mixed with hexane up to 50 mL and homogenized for 30 s, and this mixture was passed through a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m nylon membrane filter (GE Osmonics Lab Store, Minnetonka, MN, USA). A normal-phase HPLC system (Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies) with a fluorescence detector was used for analysis. The column for separation was LiChrosorb Si-60 column (4 mm × 250 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m particle size; Hibar® Fertigsäule RT, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a normal phase condition. Mobile phase was 0.85% isopropanol/hexane, and flow rate was set as 1 mL/min. Wavelengths of the detector for vitamin E analysis were 290 nm for excitation and 330 nm for emission. For quantification of tocopherol, reference standards for 
 <italic>α</italic>-, 
 <italic>β</italic>-, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-tocopherol were used. To assess purity of each tocopherol, the reference standards were dissolved in 25 mL ethanol, and then extinction coefficients were measured by a UV-spectrophotometer (DU-62, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Wavelengths for each isomer were 294 (
 <italic>α</italic>-T), 297 (
 <italic>β</italic>-T), 298 (
 <italic>γ</italic>-T), and 298 (
 <italic>δ</italic>-T) nm. Purity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-, 
 <italic>β</italic>-, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-tocopherol was 99.07%, 82.47%, 98.71%, and 89.16%, respectively. When judged based on purity of the reference standards, concentrations of stock solutions for 
 <italic>α</italic>-, 
 <italic>β</italic>-, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-tocopherols were 1.96, 1.65, 3.65, and 1.80 mg/mL, respectively, and the standard solutions were stored at −40°C for further use. For the calibration of each tocopherol, concentrations range for 
 <italic>α</italic>-, 
 <italic>β</italic>-, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-tocopherols were 0.25–1.96, 0.21–1.65, 0.46–3.65, and 0.23–1.80 mg/mL, respectively.
