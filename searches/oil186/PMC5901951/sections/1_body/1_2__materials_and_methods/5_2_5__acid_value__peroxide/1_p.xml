<p>Acid value of tree-borne seed oils was measured using the American Oil Chemist's Society (AOCS) method [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After adding 1 g oil to a 150 mL conical flask, 30 mL of the solution was mixed with ethanol-ether in 1 : 1 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) ratio to dissolve oils. To this solution, we added (and mixed well) 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1% phenolphthalein as an indicator and then the mix was titrated with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH)/ethanol solution until it became light red. Acid value was finally identified through a mock experiment without sample.
