<p class="p">To evaluate oxidative stability depending on physicochemical properties of tree-borne seed oils, a rancimat (892 Professional rancimat, Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) instrument was used. After 3 g of oil was transferred to a rancimat tube, air was injected to the tube with oil at a rate of 20 L/h and a reaction was performed at 120°C in order to induce forced oxidation. Oxidation products such as formic acid, ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids were measured through an oxidation-detecting sensor, based on which oxidation-induction periods were investigated [
