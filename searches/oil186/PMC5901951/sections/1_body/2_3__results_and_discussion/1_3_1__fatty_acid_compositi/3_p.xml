<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, which are represented by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linolenic acid, have various nutritional functions. ORT was found to have a high linolenic acid content with 35.13 ± 0.05%, and TUT had 28.21 ± 1.20% of DHA (C22 : 6

Some seed oils had a high level of medium-chain fatty acids, others had a high level of monounsaturated fatty acids, and yet others had a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to function as various biological membranes and are involved in cell metabolism, the human body often fails to synthesize sufficient amounts; therefore, such deficiency needs to be supplemented by an external source (food) [

While contributing to nutritional functions, such high unsaturation levels are vulnerable to acidification. Thus, prevention of acidification for oil storage and processing needs to be studied in order to enable tree-borne seed oils to be used as food and functional food materials.
