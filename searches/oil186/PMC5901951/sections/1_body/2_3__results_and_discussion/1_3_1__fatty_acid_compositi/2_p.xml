<p>For monounsaturated fatty acids, the highest level was 53.34 ± 1.21% found in TUT, and its level ranged from 1.82 ± 0.01% in TUT to 37.19 ± 0.02% in MPA. Oleic acid, although not an essential fatty acid, is known to lower cholesterol levels in the body, contributing to prevention of cardiovascular disease, so that it is a nutritionally significant fatty acid [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were high in JLT and KOE (62.01 ± 0.14% and 60.39 ± 0.06%). While MPA, ORT, and TUT also had over 40% of polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, their levels in JCT were as low as 0.73 ± 0.01%. Linoleic acid, which is the representative of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is mostly found in plant grains, and it lowers blood cholesterols and inhibits arterial thrombus formation. Linoleic acid levels in JLT were as high as 60.41 ± 0.12%. As omega-6 fatty acids are generally unable to be synthesized in humans and mammals, they are classified as essential fatty acids [
