<p>Fatty acid analysis results of tree-borne seed oils are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. A total of 15 kinds of fatty acids were identified from six tree-borne seed oils, which included seven types of saturated fatty acids, four types of monounsaturated fatty acids, and four types of polyunsaturated fatty acids. For saturated fatty acids, JCT had 97.94 ± 0.04%, corresponding to the highest level, and the remaining five seed oils contained in the range between 6.76 ± 0.02% and 16.24 ± 0.07%. In particular, JCT showed a high medium-chain fatty acid content (&gt;96%) which is interesting given health implications of these fatty acids. Specially, fatty acids of edible oils are long-chain triglycerides composed of 14–20 carbons, which are absorbed by lymph vessels through a fat-specific digestive process, including emulsification and chylomicron formation. Owing to this long digestion process, long-chain triglycerides are relatively less utilized for energy than are carbohydrates or proteins and are likely to be stored in the body, thus likely causing obesity [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, medium-chain triglycerides that have short fatty acids with 8–12 carbons are absorbed by the liver, through the hepatic portal vein, without formation of chylomicron (the general characteristic of fat digestion) and can be digested without bile or lipase. The medium-chain triglycerides are mostly obtained through hydrolysis of coconut oil, butter, and palm oil and are also found in human breast milk, in which they account for approximately 20% of milk. Because medium-chain triglycerides do not need proteins such as fatty acid binding protein, fatty acid transport protein, and fatty acid translocase for their processing, their oxidation rate is faster than that of long-chain fatty acids, and thus, they tend to be used as an energy source rather than being accumulated in the body [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another study also reported that medium-chain fatty acids had a higher thermic effect of food than long-chain fatty acids, reduced appetite, and increased satiety during a 2-week study, resulting in weight loss [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In respect to the practicality of cooking with medium-chain fatty acids, their smoke point is low and bubbles are generated when mixed with other vegetable oils or when they are used for frying. To solve these issues, a study on medium- and long-chain triglycerides that contain a certain amount of long-chain triglycerides with essential fatty acids has been ongoing [
