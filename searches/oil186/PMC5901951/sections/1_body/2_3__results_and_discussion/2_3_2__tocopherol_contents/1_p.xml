<p>Tocopherol contents of tree-borne seed oils are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. A total of three tocopherol isomers (
 <italic>α</italic>-T, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-T, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-T) were identified, whereas tocotrienols were undetected. Vitamin E contents in the six tree-borne seed oils ranged from 3.82 ± 0.04 mg/100 g to 101.98 ± 1.34 mg/100 g. KOE oil had the lowest level of tocopherols, whereas oil from ORT had the highest content. Vitamins are organic compounds that support nutrient functions in the body, and tocopherols have antiaging effects due to their antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Tocopherols occur as a viscous, pale-yellow, oily substance in nature and are defined as a derivative group of 2-methyl-6-hydroxy-chroman; in this group, there are four types of tocopherols—
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>γ</italic>, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>—depending on the degree of the methyl group bound to the chroman-ring [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For 
 <italic>α</italic>-T, JCT oil had the highest level (10.88 ± 0.43 mg/100 g) among the six tree-borne seed oils. 
 <italic>α</italic>-T has the highest vitamin E activity. 
 <italic>β</italic>-T is present in a trace amount in general vegetable oils but was undetected in all the tree-borne seed oils. 
 <italic>γ</italic>-T is used as antioxidant in major foods and was present in the highest proportion of all tocopherols in the tree-borne seed oils. For 
 <italic>γ</italic>-T, ORT (95.59 ± 1.24 mg/100 g) had the highest level. 
 <italic>δ</italic>-T, which is, like 
 <italic>β</italic>-T, mostly present as a trace element in plants, was found to be at the highest level in JLT (33.92 ± 0.47 mg/100 g), whereas the other oils had only trace amounts of 
 <italic>δ</italic>-T. Tocopherol activity reduces in the order 
 <italic>α</italic>-T &gt; 
 <italic>β</italic>-T &gt; 
 <italic>γ</italic>-T &gt; 
 <italic>δ</italic>-T; tocopherols mainly inhibit oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and fat-soluble vitamin A, preventing arteriosclerosis, cataract, and cancer that are caused by lipid peroxide that is generated during lipid acidification. Thus, tocopherols are important vitamins for modern humans [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Individual contents in fat-soluble vitamin analysis may vary depending on the extraction method. When Miraliakbari and Shahidi extracted tocopherols from tree nut oils, extraction using chloroform/methanol as solvent showed a significantly higher yield than that of hexane (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It was postulated that such difference in contents could be attributable to a higher solubility in the chloroform/methanol system. While we used hexane in this study, it would vary in tocopherol content depending on the extraction solvent system. As Miraliakbari and Shahidi reported 6.18–19.87 mg/100 g as the range of tocopherol contents in seven tree nut oils [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it seemed that tocopherol contents of tree-borne seed oils, except that of KOE, should not be less than those of tree nut oils that are used in food.
