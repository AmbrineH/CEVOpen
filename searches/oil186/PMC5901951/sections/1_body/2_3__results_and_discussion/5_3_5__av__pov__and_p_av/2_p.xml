<p>Oil acidification leads to elevation of aldehyde levels, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisidine forms yellow complexes by reacting with aldehydes in the presence of acetic acid, so that the degree of acidification is assessed through measurement of such complexes [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]: 2-alkenal or 2,4-alkadienal aldehydes. In general, 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV is a measure for the level of secondary oxidation products among primary and secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV ranged from 2.07 ± 0.51 to 9.67 ± 0.25. Except MPA oil, all tree-borne seed oils had stable values from 2.07 ± 0.51 to 4.18 ± 0.50. In a study of Miraliakbari and Shahidi, oxidative stability of seven tree nut oils were measured, in which 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV ranges of tree nut oils after being freshly collected and after 12 days of storage were between 0.24 and 0.55 and from 9.36 to 48.83, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Considering 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV of tree-borne seed oils, it is likely that aldehydes were formed in all the oils to some degree; thus, it seems to be necessary to block oxygen or maintain low temperature during oil extraction in order to prevent oxidation in future.
