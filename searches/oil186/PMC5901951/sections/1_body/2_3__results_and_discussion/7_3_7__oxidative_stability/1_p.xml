<p>Oxidative stability of tree-borne seed oils was measured by the rancimat test, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab7">Table 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Lipids can produce oxidative compounds such as volatile organic acids (mainly formic acid and acetic acid) during oxidation processes. Oxidation-induction period refers to the time when oxygen absorption rate reached the maximum immediately before acidification. Volatile dicarboxylic acids are generated from acidification of tree-borne seed oils, and they produce secondary oxidative compounds including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and low molecular weight products causing electrical conductivity to increase within the rancimat system, by which the oxidation-induction period was assessed. The oxidation-induction period is known to be an indicator of antioxidative activity and oxidative stability of oils [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In general, a longer oxidation-induction period means a higher oxidative stability in oils. Of the six types of tree-borne seed oils in this study, JLT oil had the longest oxidation-induction period of 6.12 ± 0.04 h, whereas the shortest oxidation-induction period was observed in MPA oil (0.02 ± 0.01 h). Fatty acid profiles are an important parameter for oxidative stability in oils, but this study shows somewhat different patterns for the induction time compared to the general principle of rancimat method. JLT oil represented a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (68%) as well as excellent oxidative stability; in contrast, MPA oil had 49% of polyunsaturated fatty acid yet showed relatively low oxidative stability, these inconsistent trends indicate that induction time cannot be simply explained by a degree of polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions. In fact, the induction times for MPA (0.02 hr) and JCT (0.03 hr) were too short to produce oxidative compounds from the fatty acid decomposition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These induction times can be caused by other naturally occurring volatile compounds in oils prior to oxidation. Chemical parameters of MPA are consistent with these patterns; high AV (38.94 ± 0.24 mg KOH/g), POV (127.67 ± 1.79 meq/kg), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV (9.67 ± 0.25) values. Moreover, MPA oil had lower tocopherol content (6.01 ± 0.06 mg/100 g) than others. Therefore, the short oxidation-induction period in MPA oil seemed reasonable. Hidalgo and others demonstrated that the addition of phospholipid to edible oils can increase their induction times [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The effect of phospholipid was similar to that of BHT (a synthetic antioxidant) when added [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For the comparison between low unsaturated fatty acids and high unsaturated fatty acid, edible oils should be refined because crude oils can contain free fatty acids, phospholipid, and various fat-soluble components which can affect the measurement of induction time. One study reported the various oxidation-induction period of olive oil from 65 to 140 h at low temperatures, demonstrating that edible oil with similar fatty acid profiles may represent varying induction times [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The report showed a large difference in the induction time (65–140 h) even though identical oil sample was used; hence, subtle differences in nutrients could result in a broad range of oxidation-induction period lengths. Taken together, it seems that the range of oxidation-induction periods in the six types of tree-borne seed oils may be due to both innate differences in oxidative stability and a reduced quality and stability caused by changes during extraction.
