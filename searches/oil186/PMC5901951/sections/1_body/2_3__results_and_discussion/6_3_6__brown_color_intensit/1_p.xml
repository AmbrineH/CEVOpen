<p>Measured brown color intensities of tree-borne seed oils using as an indicator of oil oxidation are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab6">Table 6</xref>. To measure browning intensity, we used the absorption of wavelength at 420 nm that specifically absorbs brown colors. Highest browning intensities were observed in JCT and ORT oils (2.84 ± 0.23 and 2.29 ± 0.06), whereas TUT oil had the lowest browning intensity (0.20 ± 0.01). Color scales identified at 420 nm not only included brown color intensity from browning but also reflected changes by each oil's own brown pigment. Further, color scales of oils of tree-borne seed were measured by a color difference meter, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab6">Table 6</xref>. Although there was no significant difference in

 <sup>∗</sup> values that reflected brightness in the colorimeter, TUT oil had the highest color scale (41.03 ± 0.02). Overall, 
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sup>∗</sup> values of color scale had negative values, indicating greenness. ORT oil showed a relatively high greenness (−4.25 ± 0.01). As for the 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sup>∗</sup> values in the color scale, a higher positive value indicates an increase in yellowness, and ORT oil (10.47 ± 0.01) had a relatively high yellowness. Such high yellowness was consistent with browning intensity (2.29 ± 0.06). In addition, TUT oil also was consistent in terms of the lowest browning intensity (0.20 ± 0.01) and the lowest yellowness (0.04 ± 0.01).
