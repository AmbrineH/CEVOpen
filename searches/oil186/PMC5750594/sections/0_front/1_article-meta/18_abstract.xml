  <bold>Background:</bold>
  <italic>Protium</italic> species (Burseraceae) have been used in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as ulcers and wounds. 
  <bold>Methods:</bold> The essential oil from the oleoresin of 
  <italic>Protium amazonicum</italic> was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID, and chiral GC-MS. 
  <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> oleoresin oil was screened for antifungal activity against 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
  <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, and 
  <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. 
  <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 54 components representing 99.6% of the composition were identified in the oil. The essential oil was dominated by δ-3-carene (47.9%) with lesser quantities of other monoterpenoids α-pinene (4.0%), 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), α-terpineol (5.5%) and 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (4.8%). Chiral GC-MS revealed most of the monoterpenoids to have a majority of 
  <italic>levo</italic> enantiomers present with the exceptions of limonene and α-terpineol, which showed a 
  <italic>dextro</italic> majority. 
  <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> oleoresin oil showed promising activity against 
  <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, with MIC = 156 μg/mL. 
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This account is the first reporting of both the chemical composition and enantiomeric distribution of the oleoresin essential oil of 
  <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> from Ecuador. The oil was dominated by (−)-δ-3-carene, and this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely accounts for the observed antifungal activity of the oil.
