  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> was analyzed by GC-MS using a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), with a scan range of 40–400 atomic mass units (amu), a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s, and the GC-MS Solution software (Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra, Columbia, MD, USA). The GC column was ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) (30 mL × 0.25 mm ID) with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase with a film thickness of 0.25 μm. The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 551.6 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed for 50 °C initial temperature, the temperature increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 5%
