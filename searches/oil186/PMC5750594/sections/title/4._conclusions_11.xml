 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the first reported chemical analysis of the oleoresin essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Protium amazonicum</span>. The 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> resin oil collected in Ecuador was dominated by (−)-δ-3-carene and is therefore, an excellent source of this enantiomer. The abundance of this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely account for the observed antifungal activity of the oil. The activity against 
  <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> indicates promise against these opportunistic fungal pathogens. Additional research into this tree species and other 
  <span class="italic">Protium</span> species, their chemistry and their biological activities, is needed.
