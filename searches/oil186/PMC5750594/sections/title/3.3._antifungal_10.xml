 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oleoresin essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> demonstrated antifungal activity against 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span>. 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span> was most potently inhibited with a promising MIC of 156 μg/mL. Inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> (MIC = 313 μg/mL) was also rather promising whereas inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">A. niger</span> was relatively weak (MIC = 1250 μg/mL). The major component in 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> oil, δ-3-carene, has shown antifungal activity against several fungi, including 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> [
  <a rid="B47-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-medicines-04-00070">47</a>]. In addition, minor monoterpenoid components in the oil, α-pinene [
  <a rid="B48-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-medicines-04-00070">48</a>], limonene [
  <a rid="B49-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-medicines-04-00070">49</a>], and α-terpineol [
  <a rid="B50-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-medicines-04-00070">50</a>], have also shown antifungal activities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antifungal mechanisms of activity of monoterpenoids are poorly understood. It has been suggested that these hydrophobic compounds disrupt the cytoplasmic membranes or membrane proteins of fungal cells, leading to cytoplasmic leakage, cell lysis, and death [
  <a rid="B51-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-medicines-04-00070">51</a>]. Chirality of monoterpenoids, therefore, may not play a critical role in antimicrobial activity. Nevertheless, Kusumoto and co-workers have shown that (+)-α-pinene showed significantly better antifungal activity against 
  <span class="italic">Heterobasidion parviporum</span> than (−)-α-pinene [
  <a rid="B52-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-medicines-04-00070">52</a>]. Likewise, Filipowicz et al. showed (−)-β-pinene to be slightly more active than (+)-β-pinene against 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> [
  <a rid="B53-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-medicines-04-00070">53</a>], and Omran and co-workers found that (−)-limonene had better antifungal activity than (+)-limonene [
  <a rid="B54-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-medicines-04-00070">54</a>]. (+)-δ-3-Carene has shown antifungal activity against several fungal strains [
  <a rid="B47-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-medicines-04-00070">47</a>], but there are apparently no reports on antifungal activity of (−)-δ-3-carene, which is not commercially available. Overall, these findings indicate that 
  <span class="italic">P. amazonicum</span> resin oil has promising potential for further antifungal consideration, in particular against 
  <span class="italic">C. neoformans</span> and potentially other yeast-like fungi.
