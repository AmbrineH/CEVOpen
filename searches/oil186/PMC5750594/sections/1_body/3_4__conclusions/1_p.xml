<p>This is the first reported chemical analysis of the oleoresin essential oil of 
 <italic>Protium amazonicum</italic>. The 
 <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> resin oil collected in Ecuador was dominated by (−)-δ-3-carene and is therefore, an excellent source of this enantiomer. The abundance of this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely account for the observed antifungal activity of the oil. The activity against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> indicates promise against these opportunistic fungal pathogens. Additional research into this tree species and other 
 <italic>Protium</italic> species, their chemistry and their biological activities, is needed.
