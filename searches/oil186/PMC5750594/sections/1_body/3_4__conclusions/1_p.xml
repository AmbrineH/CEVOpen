<p class="p">This is the first reported chemical analysis of the oleoresin essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Protium amazonicum</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">P. amazonicum</italic> resin oil collected in Ecuador was dominated by (−)-δ-3-carene and is therefore, an excellent source of this enantiomer. The abundance of this compound, along with other monoterpenoids, likely account for the observed antifungal activity of the oil. The activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> indicates promise against these opportunistic fungal pathogens. Additional research into this tree species and other 
 <italic class="italic">Protium</italic> species, their chemistry and their biological activities, is needed.
