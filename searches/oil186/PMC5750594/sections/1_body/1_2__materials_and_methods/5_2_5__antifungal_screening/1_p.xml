<p class="p">The broth microdilution method was performed to determine antifungal activity as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Briefly, cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 18804) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">neoformans</italic> (ATCC 24067) were initially grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates for 72 h at 37 °C. A single colony was used to inoculate approximately 5 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB) which was subsequently grown for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> (ATCC 16888) cultures were grown on PDA plates for 5 days at room temperature (RT, 22 °C). 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> conidia were collected, placed in PDB, and filtered through sterile cheesecloth into fresh PDB. The absorbance of the fresh solution was read at 625 nm and adjusted accordingly with PDB to an absorbance of 0.15. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in triplicate using 96-well plates. 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> were diluted in 3-(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffered Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium to 2000 cells/mL whereas 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> was diluted with PDB to an OD
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">625</sub> of 0.15. Initially, 50 μL of MOPS buffered RPMI was added to each well of the plate. In the first row, 50 μL of essential oil was added and mixed well, then 50 μL of this mixture was removed and then added to the medium in the next row. This serial dilution process was repeated for each row of the plate, with the removed volume from the last row being discarded. To each well was added 50 μL of cells to achieve a final volume of 100 μL. 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> plates were incubated at RT for 6 days. The MIC was determined from turbidity or growth on the plates in comparison to positive and negative controls. In order to verify the results, MIC determinations were carried out in nine replicates. A combination of Cyprodinil and Fludioxonil served as the positive control with MOPS buffered RPMI serving as the negative control.
