<p class="p">The gas chromatograph was a Shimadzu GC 2010 (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector, a split/splitless injector, and autosampler AOC-20i (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA). The capillary column was a ZB-5MS (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) with a film thickness of 0.25 μm. The column temperature was programmed, 50–250 °C at 2 °C/min, the injector temperature was 250 °C, the detector temperature was 280 °C, the carrier gas was nitrogen, and the flow rate was maintained at 1.0 mL/min. Injection mode split with a split ratio of 1:100. The injected volume was 0.3 µL of diluted oil (1:10
