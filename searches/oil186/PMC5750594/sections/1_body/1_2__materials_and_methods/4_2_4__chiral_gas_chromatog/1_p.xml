<p>Chiral analysis of the 
 <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> oil was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 amu, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s. GC equipped with a Restek B-Dex 325 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film) (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA). Oven temperature was started at 50 °C, and then gradually raised to 120 °C at 1.5 °C/min. The oven was then raised to 200 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 5 min. Helium was the carrier gas and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min. The sample was diluted 3%

 <italic>v</italic> with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> and then a 0.1 µL sample was injected in a split mode with a split ratio of 1:45. The enantiomers of each monoterpene were identified by comparison of retention times to authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
