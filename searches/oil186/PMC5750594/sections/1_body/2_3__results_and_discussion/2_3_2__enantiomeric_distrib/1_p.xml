<p>Chiral GC-MS analysis was performed to evaluate the enantiomeric distribution of the monoterpenes present in 
 <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> essential oil (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t003">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The levorotatory (−)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was found to be the exclusive stereoisomer while the (−)-enantiomers of α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene predominated over the (+)-isomers. The (+)-enantiomers of limonene and α-terpineol, on the other hand, were dominant. The hexane root extract of 
 <italic>Angelica archangelica</italic> showed predominantly (+)-δ-3-carene, but the (−)-enantiomer was detected [
 <xref rid="B36-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Only the (+)-enantiomer of δ-3-carene was detected in 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> (Pinaceae) essential oils, while (−)-limonene predominated [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The (+)-enantiomer of limonene is the more common, especially in 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> (Rutaceae) essential oils [
 <xref rid="B38-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. 
 <italic>Micromeria fruticosa</italic> (Lamiaceae) essential oil showed exclusively (+)-α-terpineol while (−)-α-terpineol was found in 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> (Lauraceae) essential oil [
 <xref rid="B43-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Analysis of the essential oil from the unripe fruits of 
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> showed a predominance of (+)-α-pinene, (+)-limonene, (+)-β-pinene, and exclusively (−)-α-terpineol [
 <xref rid="B44-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although δ-3-carene was relatively abundant in this oil (2.7%), the enantiomeric distribution was unfortunately not reported. The oleoresin of 
 <italic>Boswellia carterii</italic> (Burseraceae) from Ethiopia was composed of (+)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene, but the enantiomeric distribution of δ-3-carene was not determined [
 <xref rid="B45-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> resin oil from Somalia showed (−)-α-thujene, (−)-α-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating, while 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> resin oil from Oman had (+)-α-thujene, (+)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene, and (−)-limonene predominating [
