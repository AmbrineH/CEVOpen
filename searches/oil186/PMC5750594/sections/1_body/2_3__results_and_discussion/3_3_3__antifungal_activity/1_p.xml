<p>The oleoresin essential oil of 
 <italic>P. amazonicum</italic> demonstrated antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> was most potently inhibited with a promising MIC of 156 μg/mL. Inhibition of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MIC = 313 μg/mL) was also rather promising whereas inhibition of 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> was relatively weak (MIC = 1250 μg/mL). The major component in
