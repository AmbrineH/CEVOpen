<p class="p">Various sperm motility parameters were analyzed using a CASA (Sperm class analyzer, SCA Microptic, S.L., Version 3.2.0, Barcelona, Spain). The measured parameters were: Percentage of motile spermatozoa (Mob T %), percentage of progressive spermatozoa (Prog T %), curvilinear velocity (VCL μm/s), straight line velocity (VSL μm/s), average path velocity (VAP μm/s), amplitude of the lateral head displacement (ALH μm), and frequency to which the sperm head crosses the mean trajectory (beat-cross frequency [BCF]/Hertz).</p>
