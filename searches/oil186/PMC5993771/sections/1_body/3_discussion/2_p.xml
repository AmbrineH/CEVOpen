<p>In this study, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil and the effects on rooster sperm motility during 4°C short-term were studied. Phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil (using the GC–MS analysis) allowed the identification of 25 active compounds. According to the results, the major constituents were camphor (18.88%), 1,8-cineole (7.85%), β-thujone (13;66%), chrysanthenone (12.05%), and β-cubenene (7.97%). Similar results were reported by Zermane 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] when investigating the chemical analysis of Algerian essential oil under optimal conditions. The analyzed essential oil presented some differences when compared to Moroccan 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> essential oil. The latter showed high proportions of pinene (37-40%), cineole (58.7-63.7%), and camphor (41.7-53.8%) and 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>officinali</italic>s essential oil from Tunisia is rich in cineole and contained usual monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> essential oil composition might be influenced by various factors such as the genotype of the plant, soil type, bioclimatic conditions, or the extraction method [
