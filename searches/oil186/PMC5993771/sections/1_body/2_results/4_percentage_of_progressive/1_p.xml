<p>Progressive motility is a qualitative parameter representing gametes with forwarding motility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>). As for total motility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1</xref>), the lowest progressive gametes were observed in 870 µg/ml treatment corresponding to the highest essential oil concentration. From 6 h of storage, progressive motility was significantly preserved in 87 and 8.7 µg/ml treatments. After 24 h of storage, 87 and 8.7 µg/ml treatments showed 43.25±2.43 and 63.08±5.33% of progressive gametes compared to 26.86±2.36% of the control group (p&lt;0.05).
