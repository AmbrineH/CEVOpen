<p>In this respect, numerous studies, using rosemary leaves extract, containing rich fractions of polyphenols, have reported positive effects on frozen semen in several species including boar [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], dog [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and ram [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, no protective effect was reported when using 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil, and recently, Elmi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] observed similar motilities when comparing the control to sperm treated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with 0.2 mg/ml of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil. Overall, all the reported data independently on the considered plant showed an obvious spermicidal activity.
