<p class="p">For essential oil extraction, a Clevenger-type apparatus was used for the hydrodistillation of dried ground leaf samples for 1 h, then the oil was dried, filtered, and finally kept at 4°C in dark conditions (Elansary et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The essential oils were subjected to Thermo Scientific Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer equipped with TG-1MS column. The carrier gas was helium, and temperature ramped from 45–165°C at 4°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 2 min, then gradual increase to end temperature of 280°C for 15 min. The same column and temperatures were used for GC-FID analysis. Chemical compounds were identified using their retention time and retention indices of

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Adams, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). For the preparation of leaf extracts, ground dried leaves were dissolved in methanol (99%, 3 mL), maintained on a shaker in dark conditions for 1 h, then centrifuged for 5 min (4°C, 7,000x 
 <italic class="italic">gr</italic>) and the supernatant was kept at −80°C for further analyses.
