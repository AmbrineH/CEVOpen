<p>The enzymes activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified in leaves tissues according to Zhang and Kirkham (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and Elansary et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). ROS accumulation was determined by quantifying H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> composition in leaves following Elansary et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and using the Beyotime Colorimetric Assay Kit (Beyotime, China).
