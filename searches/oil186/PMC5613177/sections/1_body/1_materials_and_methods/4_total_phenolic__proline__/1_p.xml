<p class="p">Total phenolics were quantified in leaves according to Amerine and Ough (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>) and Singleton and Rossi (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1965</xref>) using a Folin-Ciocalteau method. The proline was quantified in 0.5 g (% of dry matter) following Bates et al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1973</xref>) spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. The chemical constituents of the soil (sandy) used were quantified following Jackson (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1958</xref>) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). Total chlorophyll content was determined following Moran and Porath (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>). Total carbohydrates (%) in the leaves was determined according to Dubios et al. (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1956</xref>). Sodium and chloride contents (mg g
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup>) in the leaves were determined according to Piper (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1947</xref>).
