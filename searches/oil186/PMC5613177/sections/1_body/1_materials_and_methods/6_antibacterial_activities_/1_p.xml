<p>To explore the antibacterial activities of SA treated compared to control plants under saline conditions, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial were screened against essential oils of different treatments (season 2016). 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (clinical isolate), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 14579), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), 
 <italic>Micrococcus flavus</italic> (ATCC 10240), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 35210), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) were examined against essential oils of different treatments using the micro-dilution method (Elansary et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In microtiter plates, known concentration of essential oil was mixed with bacterial inoculum in Triptic Soy broth, then kept at 37°C for 24 h in a rotary shaker to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MICs and MBCs). The MBC was determined using serial sub-cultivation of each essential oil (2 μL) with each bacterium then incubated 24 h at 37°C and the MBC was defined as the minimum concentration of the essential oil indicated killing off 99.5% of the of the inoculum. The density was determined at 655 nm and all experiments were performed twice in triplicates. Positive control (streptomycin and ampicillin, 0.01–10 mg/ mL) as well as the DMSO (5%) negative controls were used.
