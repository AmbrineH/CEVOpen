<p class="p">The use of saline water (2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl) in irrigation of rosemary plants caused significant increases in the phenolic, chlorophyll, proline, Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, and Cl
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> compositions of leaves. Interestingly, SA treatments at 200–300 ppm caused alleviation of stress effects resulting in significant increases in the total phenolic, chlorophyll, carbohydrates, and proline compositions of leaves along with reduction in Cl
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> and Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. The phenolic composition of rosemary leaves increased as a response to salinity as well as SA treatments which support previous investigations (Gupta and Huang, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Bagherifard et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Bagherifard et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that salinity and SA may increase the flavonoid composition (phenolic compartment) and the antioxidant activity in artichoke (
 <italic class="italic">Cynara Scolymus</italic> L.). In the current study, under saline irrigation, salt accumulation was found due to the increased ratios of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and Cl
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> in the leaves which are in agreement with previous studies (Munns, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Proline is one of the major compatible solutes that accumulate following salt stress to protect the cell and maintain continuous water influx (Hoque et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The increase in the accumulation of proline in rosemary subjected to salinity (2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl) and SA sprays (200–300 ppm) shows the promising effect of SA during stress conditions. The accumulation of carbohydrates following SA treatments under saline irrigation indicates enhanced stress tolerance which agrees with previous investigations that reported carbohydrate accumulation as an indicator of osmotic adjustment, carbon storage, scavenging of reactive oxygen and stress tolerance in plants (Yin et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Gupta and Huang, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Several investigations indicated that SA is a strong regulator of photosynthesis and chlorophyll composition in leaves by influencing chlorophyll content (Fariduddin et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>), carotenoid composition (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and stomatal closure (Khokon et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). SA may play a role in enhancing plant stress tolerance (Horváth et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kovácik et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, few reports studied the antioxidant mechanism driving SA-mediated stress tolerance in plants. Gholamnezhad et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported that SA may affect the activities of some enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase in infected wheat plants. Mutlu et al. (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported that SA alleviated cold damage in barley subjected to cold stress by stimulating the activities of SOD and POD enzymes. Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) reported that SA may influence hydrogen peroxide production in chilled cucumber subjected. This is the first study which proves that SA may stimulate the antioxidant mechanism pathway in rosemary plants subjected to salinity by stimulating antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, APX, and CAT). These results are in agreement with that reported by He and Zhu (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) who found that the exogenous salicylic acid decreases NaCl toxicity and enhance antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, APX, and CAT) in tomato. However, it has been long accepted that salicylic acid enhances H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content by inactivation of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-removing enzymes such as APX and CAT and the increase of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-producing enzymes such as SOD (Durner and Klessig, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Rao et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). Moreover, the exogenous salicylic acid not always has a positive effect in ameliorating the oxidative stress imposed by salinity (Barba-Espín et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). These variable results might explain that the effect of exogenous salicylic acid on antioxidant enzymes activities and stress alleviation depends on plant species. The APX and 3 SOD genes revealed higher levels in SA-treated rosemary under salt stress, when compared to non-sprayed plants, indicating the important roles of salicylic acid and antioxidants under salinity and abiotic stresses. Moreover, in order to study the effect of SA treatment at the transcriptional level, a number of important genes conferring salt tolerance such as DREB2 (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), bZIP62 (Liao et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), ERF3 (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), and OLPb (osmotin-like protein b; Tachi et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) has been selected and analyzed in this study. These specific genes were selected due to their potential use as models to study the changes at the transcriptional level under salt stress (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Therefore, this study investigated whether SA will modulate the expression of such genes in rosemary under salt stress. The expression levels of these genes were enhanced in SA-treated rosemary under saline conditions, indicating that SA treatment resulted in the modulation of such genes expression which in turn enhanced rosemary tolerance to salinity stress.
