<p class="p">The essential oils showed obvious antibacterial activities against several bacteria and such results agreed with previous investigations (Fu et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Zaouali et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In the current study, it was noted that increasing salinity levels as well as SA concentrations are associated with increased antibacterial activities. In most recent studies, there were a clear correlation between the nature and proportion of the main oil constitutes and the antibacterial activities found. Olfa et al. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported specific higher antibacterial activities of the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum majorana</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) plants subjected to saline conditions compared to normally grown plants. Pribalouti et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) suggested that stress conditions (e.g., water stress) may affect the amounts of phenolic compounds in the essential oils. In the current study, we found significant increases in specific constitutes of the essential oil of plants subjected to salinity and SA such as linalool, camphor, borneol, and caryophyllene oxide. For example, Federman et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported that the major oil constitute of the orange was the linalool responsible for inhibiting growth and biofilm formation in
