<p>Compared to control, salinity conditions of 2,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA showed apparent changes in many major oil constitutes such as the great reductions in α-pinene, β-pinene, and cineole along sharp increases in linalool, camphor, borneol, and verbenone in both growing seasons. Interestingly, the applications of SA at 100–300 ppm largely ameliorated the effects of salinity at 2,000 ppm NaCl. The notable saline mitigation effects were found in plants treated with SA at 100 ppm such as that found in α-pinene which increased from 0.9% in 2,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA treated plants to 8.26% in 2,000 NaCl and 100 ppm SA treated plants in 2016. The value of 8.26% α-pinene is comparable to 8.56% found in control plants in 2016. Both seasons of 2016 and 2017 had comparable values.</p>
