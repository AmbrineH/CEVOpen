<p class="p">Under 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA, the reduction in specific oil constitutes including α-pinene and linalool were comparable to that found in plants treated with 2,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA in both seasons. However, SA sprays at 100–300 ppm had significant effects in reversing reductions in specific essential oil compositions such as α-pinene, β-pinene, camphen, cineol, and terpinolen. SA applications reduced specific essential oils constitutes such as the linalool (from 7.89% in 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA treated plants to 5.91% in 4,000 NaCl and 200 ppm SA treated plants in 2016) and the verbenone (from 12.68% in 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA treated plants to 3.95% in 4,000 NaCl and 200 ppm SA treated plant in 2016). Essential oil ratio showed significant variations related to saline irrigation and SA sprays (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>). Significant increases were recorded in the essential oil ratio following 640 ppm NaCl and SA sprays at 100–300 ppm compared to SA-untreated plants. Under saline conditions of 2,000–4,000 ppm NaCl, there were significant reduction in the essential oil ratio in 2,000 and 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA treatments compared to 2,000 and 4,000 NaCl and 100–300 ppm SA plants.
