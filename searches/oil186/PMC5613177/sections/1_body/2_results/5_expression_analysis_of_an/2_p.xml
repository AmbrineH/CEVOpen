<p>Moreover, the expression levels of the genes conferring tolerance to salinity (bZIP62, DREB2, ERF3, and OLPb) were evaluated using qRT-PCR. All the genes revealed higher levels in SA-treated rosemary under salt stress, as compared to non-sprayed plants (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). SA treatment at 3,000 ppm showed the highest expression level for all the stress-related genes. This indicates that SA treatment modulated the abiotic stress responsive gene expression in rosemary which in turn enhanced its tolerance to salinity stress.
