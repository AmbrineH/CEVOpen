<p>Total chlorophyll contents showed significant increases following SA sprays at 100–300 ppm under 640, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm NaCl compared to SA-untreated plants (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The highest chlorophylls were found in 640 ppm NaCl and 200–300 ppm SA treated plants in both growing seasons. In addition, 0 ppm SA treatments showed the lowest values of chlorophyll contents compared to SA treated plants under 640, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm. For example, the plants treated with 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA had 18.93 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> FW of total chlorophyll compared to 21.75 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> FW in 200 ppm SA treatment. The total carbohydrates showed significant increases in the leaves of SA treated plants with 640, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm NaCl and 200–300 ppm SA compared to 0 ppm SA treated plants in both seasons. The proline composition of leaves showed significant increases associated with increased salinity levels in both season (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).
