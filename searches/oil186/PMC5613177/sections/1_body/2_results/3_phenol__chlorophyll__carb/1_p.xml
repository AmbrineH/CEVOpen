<p class="p">Leaves total phenolic, chlorophyll, carbohydrate, and proline contents varied among treatments (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>). Under 640 ppm NaCl, SA sprays at 100–300 ppm significantly increased the phenolic composition of treated plants compared to 0 ppm SA in both seasons. Saline treatment at 2,000 ppm NaCl increased the phenolic composition compared to control plants. Also, under 2,000 ppm NaCl, SA treatments at 100–300 ppm significantly increased the phenolic compositions compared to 2,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm salicylic acid treated plants. Under 4,000 ppm NaCl, SA sprays at 100–300 ppm increased the phenolic composition compared to 4,000 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA treated plants.
