<p>The use of irrigation water (tap water) that has 640 ppm NaCl and 3 doses of SA (100, 200, and 300 ppm) indicated that SA had significant effects on enhancing all studied morphological parameters in both seasons compared to the 640 ppm NaCl and 0 ppm SA (control) as shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Increasing NaCl concentration from 640 to 2,000 and 4,000 ppm significantly reduced number of branches, plant height, fresh and dry weights in plants received 0 ppm SA (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For example, plant height was reduced from 31.16 to 19.33 cm when increasing NaCl concentration from 640 to 4,000 ppm without using SA (0 ppm SA). On the other hand, SA significantly alleviated the morphological stress effects of salinity by increasing number of branches, plant height and fresh and dry weights in both seasons. Higher SA doses (200 and 300 ppm) were more effective in enhancing the overall morphological parameters during salinity stress (2,000 and 4,000 ppm NaCl). For example, plant heights increased from 22.33 to 28.33 cm and from 19.33 to 27.33 cm when treated with 300 ppm SA whereas 100 ppm SA showed lower values in 2016 season. Additionally, under saline conditions, the number of branches per plants showed significant increases following SA in both seasons. The fresh and dry weights showed parallel pattern for that found in number of branches and plant height.
