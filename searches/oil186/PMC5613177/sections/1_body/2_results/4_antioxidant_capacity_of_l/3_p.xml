<p>Significant increases were found in activities of CAT, SOD, and APX following SA sprays at 100–300 ppm. SA sprays at 300 ppm showed the highest activities of the enzymes compared to lower doses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). There were significant reductions in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> compositions in leaves following SA sprays compared to non-sprayed plants (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Additionally, free ascorbate showed significantly higher increases following SA treatments at 200–300 ppm, and slight increases in the total ascorbate were also found (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).
