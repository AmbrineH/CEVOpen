<p class="p">The total antioxidant capacity of essential oils as well as leaf extracts were determined in all treated plants, and significant differences were found among plants as responses to different levels of salinity (640–4,000 ppm NaCl) and SA treatments (0–300 ppm) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" class="xref">5</xref>). The plants treated with saline conditions (2,000 and 4,000 ppm) without SA treatment showed significantly higher antioxidant capacity compared to control plants. For example, the IC

The plants treated with SA at 100–300 and 640–4,000 ppm NaCl showed higher antioxidant capacity than 0 ppm SA treated plants. Using both methods of DPPH and linoleic acid assays, the highest antioxidant capacity among essential oils was found in plants treated with 4,000 ppm NaCl and 100–300 ppm SA in both seasons of 2016 and 2017.
