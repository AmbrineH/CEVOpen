 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For essential oil extraction, a Clevenger-type apparatus was used for the hydrodistillation of dried ground leaf samples for 1 h, then the oil was dried, filtered, and finally kept at 4°C in dark conditions (Elansary et al., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2016</a>). The essential oils were subjected to Thermo Scientific Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer equipped with TG-1MS column. The carrier gas was helium, and temperature ramped from 45–165°C at 4°C min
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 2 min, then gradual increase to end temperature of 280°C for 15 min. The same column and temperatures were used for GC-FID analysis. Chemical compounds were identified using their retention time and retention indices of 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes (C
  <sub>10</sub>–C
  <sub>36</sub>) and computer matching using NIST mass spectra ver. 2.0 and WILEY libraries as well as literature references (Chalchat et al., 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">1993</a>; Adams, 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2007</a>). For the preparation of leaf extracts, ground dried leaves were dissolved in methanol (99%, 3 mL), maintained on a shaker in dark conditions for 1 h, then centrifuged for 5 min (4°C, 7,000x 
  <span class="italic">gr</span>) and the supernatant was kept at −80°C for further analyses.
