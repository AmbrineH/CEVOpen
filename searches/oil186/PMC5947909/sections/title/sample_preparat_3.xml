 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are four methods commonly used for producing desi ghee: direct cream method, pre-stratification, cream butter method and milk butter/desi method. Desi method or milk butter method[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref001">1</a>] have been adopted for the preparation of desi ghee (a local name of the clarified butter in Pakistan and India) which was extracted from the butter obtained from the buffalo milk by adding yogurt culture. By adopting desi method, fresh buffalo milk samples were obtained at the time of lactation from the local dairy farm situated in country side of Mian Channu (Punjab, Pakistan). These milk samples were boiled and cooled to the room temperature. Yogurt culture was added and left the milk to incubate from 08 to 12 hours at room temperature. After incubation time milk changed in to

  <span class="italic">Dahi</span> and after churning it, desi butter with butter milk was produced in a clean metal vessel[

  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref002">2</a>]. Obtained desi butter was heated slowly at low temperature in an open pan under continuous stirring to allow evaporation of the water without charring the proteins. At a temperature of around 110°C, desi ghee with a very pleasant fragrance and light greenish hue got fully separated from the rest of the ingredients of the butter and it took around 15 minutes. The temperature used for separation of desi ghee from cream or butter is reported from 105 to 120°C[

  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref002">2</a>]. There are several traditional methods to extract desi ghee in different parts of the world. In Egypt, 2% salt is added in the butter while heating under continuous stirring and a handful of maize or other cereal flour is added in ghee made in Ethiopia[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref002">2</a>]. Similarly, in our study, 1% of wheat flour was added in the melted butter at about 100°C in order to separate ghee from residue solids present in butter material. It is an ancient practice in subcontinent to add flour in heated butter which helps caramelise nonfat butter solids. The quantity of flour added was very small which does not have any effect on the molecular composition of desi ghee due to increased difference in density between fat and non-fat phases. The ghee was filtered and stored at low temperature for further analysis. Temperature variations were monitored by a K type thermocouple which measure temperature with an uncertainty of ±2°C.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to make heated sample of buffalo ghee, an experiment was performed in which an egg was fried with desi ghee in a frying pan with a controlled heat supply. Gas burner was used for the heat supply and the flame was kept at low value so as to achieve a possible constant heat supply to the frying pan and to avoid rapid temperature changes. The frying pan was moved up and down slowly in an effort to maintain the required temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to monitor the time and temperature taken by an egg to get fried. 100 grams of buffalo ghee was heated in a frying pan up to a temperature of 140°C and an egg was poured in pan at this temperature. Before pouring egg in frying pan, heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled for acquiring its fluorescence spectra. Immediately, after pouring the egg, the temperature of ghee dropped down to around 120°C and it took around one minute to rise back to 140°C and then continued towards 150°C. A temperature ranges from 140–150°C was maintained to get the egg fully fried and whole process took around five minutes. After five minutes frying at this temperature range, egg got fully fried and its corners turned light brown and at 150°C heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled again for acquiring fluorescence spectra. Further heating of ghee with egg in frying pan causes the egg to turn dark brown from light brown around temperature 180°C and then black around temperature of 200°C. It shows that food cooked at this temperature and above loses its nutritional values and got oxidized.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For detail study, separate samples of 100 grams each of desi ghee were heated in frying pan without any cooking material with same conditions and temperatures at 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C for a time period of five minutes for acquiring their fluorescence spectra. At 250°C, desi ghee started to smoke and is labelled as its smoke point. In order to confirm the fluorescence bands of ghee samples, the fluorescence spectra of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (Nature’s Bounty, Inc. Bohemia NY 11716 U.S.A.), vitamin K (Munawar Pharma Lahore, Pakistan), vitamin D (SAMI Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) and vitamin A (Matrix Pharma Karachi, Pakistan), vitamin E (Tocopherol (Evion capsules) Merck pharma, Pakistan) were purchased from the local market of Islamabad, Pakistan and their spectra were recorded and compared.</p>
