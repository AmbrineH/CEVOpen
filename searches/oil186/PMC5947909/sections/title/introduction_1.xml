 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Desi ghee is a type of liquid butter obtained from cow/buffalo milk by adding yogurt culture[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref001">1</a>]. It has been widely used in subcontinent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) and across the world at large from centuries and a best source of lipid nutrients, fat soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref002">2</a>]. Composition of desi ghee mainly consists of 62% monounsaturated fats and is rich in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vitamin A[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref004">4</a>]. CLA is a blend of linoleic acid isomers which accounts for 75–90% of total CLA isomers[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref005">5</a>]. Due to enriched content of CLA, desi ghee has been reported as an antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and antiadipogenic properties[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref003">3</a>]. It has also been reported for anticancer characteristics and for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, strengthening the immune function and modifying body composition to treat obesity or build lean body mass[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cooking and frying of food in oil or ghee is common to human and preservation of their natural ingredients during frying/cooking of food is an important issue. The molecular structures of vitamins, antioxidants, saturated and unsaturated fats in edible oils and desi ghee are very sensitive to temperature and it causes the degradation of above said nutritional ingredients. Therefore, it becomes very necessary to investigate temperature effects on molecular composition of desi ghee.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence spectroscopy has proved itself as an excellent nondestructive analytical technique with high specificity and sensitivity for the characterization of edible oils, thermal effects on olive oil during heating and storage, thermal processing of milk fats and dry milk storage effects[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref017">17</a>]. A number of research papers have been published for the investigation of temperature effects on edible oils using Fluorescence spectroscopy[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref020">20</a>] but no study has been made so far reporting such effects on the molecular composition of desi ghee. Cheikhousman et al. employed Fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the thermal deterioration of olive oil by heating the samples at 170°C and reported possible deterioration of different ingredients including vitamin E[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref016">16</a>]. Microwave and conventional heating effects have been studied by applying fluorescence spectroscopy on mixtures of olive oil samples[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref018">18</a>]. It has also been used on heated samples of olive oil mixed with sunflower oil for their discrimination[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref015">15</a>]. F.G. Vila reported detailed molecular composition of olive oil and the effects of temperature using fluorescence spectroscopy[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref011">11</a>]. Similarly, evolution of fluorescence compounds has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy during the thermal deterioration of olive oil[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref017">17</a>]. Temperature effects on extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have been suggested a temperature range from 140 to 190°C where minimum variations in its molecular composition have been observed[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref019">19</a>]. Literature review indicates that only a few article appear regarding desi ghee attributes[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref021">21</a>], where gas chromatography has been employed to investigate the effects of storage on chemical properties of desi ghee[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref021">21</a>]. In another study explained molecular composition of desi ghee along with margarines and different edible oils[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref022">22</a>]. Recently, Saleem et al. defined a safe cooking temperature range for EVOO where it almost retains its nutritional values[
  <a rid="pone.0197340.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197340.ref023">23</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, Fluorescence spectroscopy has been utilized as a tool to investigate molecular composition of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk and heating effects on its natural ingredients. In addition, fluorescence spectra of vitamins A, E, D, K and CLA are recorded and compared with the fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee. Results suggested a temperature range that can be used for cooking/frying with desi ghee without destroying its valuable ingredients.</p>
