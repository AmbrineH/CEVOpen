 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the fluorescence spectra of ghee samples were pre-processed before analysis using Savitzky-Golay smoothing method (order 5, 13-point window) in MATLAB (Mathworks, release 2014) environment through a self-written code. This has been employed to remove random noise evolving during recording the spectra. After smoothing, the emission spectra highlighted peaks confirming the presence of different molecular structures in the buffalo ghee. In addition, all emission spectra were vector normalization for the better comparison and analysis of different molecular bands. Further, classification of small spectral variations induced as a result of heating was obtained by applying principal component analysis (PCA), a widely used statistical tool through a MatLab built-in routine. As a result of PCA, resulting classification in the heated and non-heated ghee samples are explained by scatter plots between first two principal components PC1 and PC2 in the relevant sections.</p>
