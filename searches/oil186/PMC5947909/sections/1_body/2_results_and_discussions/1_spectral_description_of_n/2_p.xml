 <xref rid="pone.0197340.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fluorescence spectra of CLA at λ
 <sub>ex</sub>: 280 nm gives a broad band emission spectra form 350–600 nm centered roughly at 460 nm, which may be assigned for Isomers of CLA. Spectra of CLA completely overlaps with the desi ghee spectra giving rise to the fact that CLA isomers are widely present in buffalo ghee which is in accordance with literature[
