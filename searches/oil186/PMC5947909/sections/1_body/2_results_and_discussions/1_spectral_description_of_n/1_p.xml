<p>Fluorescence spectra of non-heated buffalo ghee recorded with different excited wavelengths from 250–430 nm is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Analysis of ghee spectra evidently suggests the selection of excitation wavelengths at 280 and 410 nm where they fluoresce maximum spectral information for studying the heating effects on its molecular composition. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows prominent fluorescence bands at 380, 440, 490, 552, 635, 660, 671 and 708 nm. The fluorescence band at 380 nm in buffalo ghee accounts for fat soluble vitamins and also shows traces of carotenoids and this band also appears in buffalo milk so verifying the presence of these ingredients [

 <xref rid="pone.0197340.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Bands at 440 and 490 nm are associated to isomers of CLA and vitamin A respectively. Fluorescence band at 552 nm is assigned to oxidation product which evolved due to heating during extraction process. The region from 620–700 nm can be assigned to chlorophyll[
