 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows a nice comparison between fluorescence emission spectra of non-heated buffalo ghee with vitamin A, D, E, K and CLA excited at λ
 <sub>ex</sub>: 410 nm. Fluorescence emission band positions of non-heated desi ghee and vitamins are different from emissions excited at 280 nm. This shift/change in emission bands possibly explain the wavelength dependence behaviour of fluorophores present in buffalo ghee under different excitation wavelengths. With excitation wavelength of 410 nm, non-heated buffalo ghee shows prominent fluorescence bands at 450, 460, 476, 490, 635, 660 and 671 nm. These emission spectra can be divided into two regions: region one can be assigned to emission band from 430–560 nm centered roughly at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin-A, bands at 450 and 460 nm are assigned to vitamin E and D, band at 476 assigned to Vitamin-K contents and band at 490 nm is assigned to vitamin A respectively. In second region from 620–700 nm, the peaks at 635, 660, 671 and 700 nm are assigned to chlorophyll contents.
