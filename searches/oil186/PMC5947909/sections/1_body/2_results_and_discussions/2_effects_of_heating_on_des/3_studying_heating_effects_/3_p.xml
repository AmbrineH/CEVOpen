 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g008">Fig 8</xref> is a PCA scatter plot where non-heated ghee samples clustered with samples heated at 140°C. Samples heated at 150 and 160°C clustered nearer to the non-hated ones as compared to samples heated at 150°C with egg. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more deterioration as compared to heated at 140–160°C due to possible contamination during frying process. Ghee samples heated above 170°C shows a separating trend from the rest. Samples heated at 180, 200 and 250°C clustered away from the rest showing prominent deterioration in the natural molecular structure of desi ghee. These finding confirms the oxidation of desi ghee that started at a temperature of 170°C and induces small spectral variations up to 180°C. Buffalo ghee loses most of its natural ingredients at a temperature of 200°C and turned to rancid material like aldehydes and ketones as final products at 250°C as clearly visible in PCA plot. Therefore, temperature range from 140–170°C is defined as safe for cooking/frying purposes using desi ghee and up to 180°C with small deterioration in its natural ingredients.
