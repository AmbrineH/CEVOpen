<p>For more detailed analysis, two heated samples at 150 and 200°C were selected to produce their fluorescence spectra, PCA scatter plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 and loading vectors as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9A–9D</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9A</xref> shows fluorescence spectra between samples heated at 150 and 200°C for a time period of 5 minutes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9B</xref> shows PCA score plot where samples heated at 150°C clustered in the positive side while samples heated at 200°C are clustered in the negative side of the PC1 axis which follows from the spectral features associated with the former are loaded positively, while those of the later are loaded negatively as shown in loadings of PC1. Evidently, positive loadings can be observed at fluorescence bands appearing at 460 and 660 nm and negative loadings at 545 nm. PC1 explains the maximum variance (100%) between two data set. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g009">Fig 9D</xref> shows PC2 as compared to PC1 where maximum variance has been explained. These features show a relative intensity change with the rise of temperature which is due to the oxidation of valuable lipid nutrients, vitamins and isomers of CLA at high temperatures of 200°C as compared to 150°C. The spectral changes associated with PC1 and PC2 are not correlated, therefore score plot between PC1 &amp; PC2 completely separate both data set. This explanation therefore suggested that the classification of different data groups shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g008">Fig 8</xref> is based on the molecular changes which appeared due to heating of ghee samples. These findings suggest that temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be used for safe frying/cooking with buffalo ghee without undergoing appreciable changes in its natural molecular structure and food ingredients also remain safe under proper heating conditions.
