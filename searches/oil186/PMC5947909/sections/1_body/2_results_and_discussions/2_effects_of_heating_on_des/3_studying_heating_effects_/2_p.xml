 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> shows comparison of fluorescence spectra of non-heated and heated desi ghee samples with all the vitamins and CLA. Desi ghee samples were heated from 140–250°C along with ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. It can be observed that samples heated at 140, 150°C without egg, 150°C with egg and 160°C are not separable apparently from non-heated samples in the first region from 430–550 nm. This observation leads to the fact that desi ghee retains its vitamins and CLA composition up to a temperature of 160°C for a heating time of 5 minutes. In second region 620–700 nm samples hated at 140°C are not separable from non-heated ones. Samples heated at 150°C with egg shows more oxidation of chlorophyll as compared to samples heated at 150°C without egg and 160°C which appear mainly in the form of change in color of desi ghee. This increase in oxidation corresponds to the contamination induced by egg during frying process. Samples heated at 170°C shows rise in intensity in first region and decrease in the second region. An appreciable spectral change occurs for the samples heated at 180°C with a shift in whole band towards higher wavelength values in the first region and a complete oxidation of chlorophyll contents in the second region. The natural ingredients undergo thermal oxidation which fluoresce in the form of broad bands and shifted towards higher wavelength values. In fact, valuable ingredients of buffalo ghee start to deteriorate as temperature rise above 150°C as a result of thermal oxidation with the initiation of primary to secondary oxidation products and finally end at final products like ketones and aldehydes at smoke temperature[
 <xref rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Spectral changes at 180°C possibly explain the evolution of secondary oxidative products and this trend continues for the temperatures of 200 and 250°C as can be observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>. Fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee heated at 200°C shows a prominent shift towards higher wavelength showing maximum oxidation of valuable contents like vitamins and isomers of CLA as compared to non-heated ghee samples. Heating of desi ghee at temperature of 250°C induces further changes in the molecular composition of ghee leading to the evolution of final products like ketones and aldehydes with rancid smell. It shows a complete deterioration of natural molecular ingredients of desi ghee.
