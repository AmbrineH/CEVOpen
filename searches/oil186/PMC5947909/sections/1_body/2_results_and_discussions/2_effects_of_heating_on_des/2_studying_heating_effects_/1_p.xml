 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows spectra of non-heated and heated samples of desi ghee excited at λ
 <sub>ex</sub>: 280 nm. In this figure, standard deviation is plotted at each fluorescence spectrum of heated samples which appears as shaded area and its small value confirms the repeatability of data. The samples were heated at a temperature of 140, 150 with egg, 150 without egg, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C for a time period of 5 minutes for each sample. The purpose of this experiment was to find possible changes in fluorescence spectra of desi ghee heated at different temperatures for 5 minutes during which cooking/frying of food is usually carried out but it also depends upon the quantity of the material and heating sources.
