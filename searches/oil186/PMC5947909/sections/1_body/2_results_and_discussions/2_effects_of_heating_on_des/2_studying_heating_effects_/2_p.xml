<p class="p">It is clear from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> that vitamins A, E and CLA contents apparently present from 380–500 nm sustained with heating at temperature of 140–150°C and started to deteriorate for further heating as a result of thermal oxidation. The spectral variations in the molecular composition of desi ghee heated at 150°C with egg and without egg are almost same which explains that the presence of egg for frying does not affect its molecular composition to a large extent. At temperatures above 150°C band at 552 nm which is assigned to oxidative products[
 <xref rid="pone.0197340.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] shows a gradual upward increase in its intensity with an increase in temperature starting from 160°C and becomes maximum at 250°C. Similarly, fluorescence band at 620 nm may also be assigned to oxidative products because its trend of intensity rise is similar as observed in case of fluorescence emission band at 552 nm however, it is not reported in literature. Actually, as temperature goes above 150°C primary oxidation products produced which are unstable and immediately decomposes to secondary oxidation products with the rise in temperature like alcohols, saturated &amp; unsaturated aldehydes and epoxy compounds are reported[
 <xref rid="pone.0197340.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In case of desi ghee heating in present study, possibly similar type of compounds appear with heating as temperature goes above 150°C, primary oxidation products started to appear with heating and decomposes to secondary oxidation products at 180–200°C with prominent spectral variations indicating severe damage to the natural ingredients of desi ghee. When temperatures increase from 200–250°C final oxidation products such as aldehydes and ketones produced with a rancid smell form the desi ghee and spectra at this temperature appear to be different from all the rest. Fluorescence bands at 390, 440, 460 and 490 nm show a gradual decrease in intensity as temperature goes above 150°C indicating the thermal oxidation of monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and CLA isomers. Also, In the first region of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> from 350–490 nm, an overall decrease in intensity of the peaks can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of fat soluble vitamins K, D and E and while in the later region from 490–650 nm an overall increase in the intensity can be observed which can be associated to the oxidation of vitamin-A isomers with the vital evolution of oxidative products at 552 and 620 nm. Isomers of CLA present in large concentration shows deterioration in both regions with the rise in temperature.
