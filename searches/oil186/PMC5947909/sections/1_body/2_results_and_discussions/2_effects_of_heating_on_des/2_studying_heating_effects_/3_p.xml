<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed to classify different overlapping spectral signatures which are hard to observe by naked eye. PCA is a non-supervised statistical procedure which uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of uncorrelated variables named principal components. These principle components are not correlated and are orthogonal to one another. These principal components are calculated based on the variance in the data and when plotted as a scatter plot, they nicely separate different set of data. First two or three components usually give maximum information about the variance in the data[

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g004">Fig 4</xref>, heated samples from 140–150°C are not separable from the non-heated one which show stability of buffalo ghee for said temperature range for a heating time period of 5 minutes. Ghee samples heated at 150°C with egg clustered a little away from samples heated at 150°C without egg near samples heated at 160°C which explains the possible oxidation of ghee samples due to egg contamination. But it does not show a very strange behavior and lies near the samples heated from 140–150°C without egg. Even samples heated at 160 and 170°C are lying close to non-heated or heated from 140–150°C samples. In contrast, samples heated at 180°C and above clustered far from the non-heated or heated from 140–150°C and can be observed in the fluorescence spectra in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197340.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Therefore, the temperature ranges from 140–170°C may be considered as safe for frying/cooking in order to preserve molecular composition of desi ghee during cooking.
