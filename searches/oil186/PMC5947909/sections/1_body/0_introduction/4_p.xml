<p>In the present study, Fluorescence spectroscopy has been utilized as a tool to investigate molecular composition of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk and heating effects on its natural ingredients. In addition, fluorescence spectra of vitamins A, E, D, K and CLA are recorded and compared with the fluorescence spectra of buffalo ghee. Results suggested a temperature range that can be used for cooking/frying with desi ghee without destroying its valuable ingredients.</p>
