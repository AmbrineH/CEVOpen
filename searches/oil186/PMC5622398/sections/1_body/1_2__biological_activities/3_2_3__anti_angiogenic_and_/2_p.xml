<p>Recently, certain EOs have been proposed as non-toxic anti-angiogenic agents. Bonstancioglu et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported the capacity of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> EOs to inhibit cancer cell viability and angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The EOsâ€™ constituents carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and thymol [
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have been reported to have cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines. Liang and Lu [
 <xref rid="B27-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported the pro-apoptotic activity of carvacrol, considered the main bioactive compound for pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic effects [
 <xref rid="B25-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
