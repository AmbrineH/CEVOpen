<p>When considering the antioxidant activity of different EOs, it is important to mention that the variety of the plants, the agronomic practices and the processing can affect the chemical profile and the effective inhibitory concentrations of EOs; Delaquis et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that antioxidant, antimicrobial, and sensory properties differed between EOs of different origins. A higher antioxidant capacity is shown when the EOs contain a fair number of components, such as Î³-terpinene (cyclohexadiene), and fair amounts of phenolics [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. EOs with a higher proportion of phenolic sesquiterpenes and/or monoterpenes have been recognized for their antioxidative capacity [
