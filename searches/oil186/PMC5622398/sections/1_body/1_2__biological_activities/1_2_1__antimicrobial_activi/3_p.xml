<p>EOs are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, phytochemicals such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, phenolics, esters, and other complex aromatic and aliphatic compounds. These phytochemicals possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, and antiviral properties [

 <xref rid="B13-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The different biological effects of EOs are due to the concentration and proportion of their chemical constituents. For example, EOs with higher concentrations of terpenoids exhibit higher antifungal activity compared with EOs rich in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [
