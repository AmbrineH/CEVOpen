<p class="p">However, the incorporation of single EOs as antimicrobial agents in certain foods (for example in meat) may produce favourable conditions promoting the growth of undesirable microorganisms, due to possible changes in the ecology of the microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B17-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, individual constituents of EOs may not be able to inactivate meat spoilage by microorganisms. In this situation, a combination of different EOs may help by causing an additive antimicrobial effect. For example, Gutierrez et al. [
