<p>Several benefits of using this EO as a food preservative have been identified: extended shelf life, hypoallergenicity, the improvement of aroma and taste, and possible health benefits to consumers due to its antioxidant and anticancer effects [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although there is considerable literature exploring the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of EOs derived from numerous plants, for most EOs, the in vitro results do not easily translate into actual use as meat preservatives. EOs are more effective when they come into direct contact with organisms; however, direct contact affects the organoleptic properties of the meat. Essentials oils tend to have an intense aroma even at low concentrations.
