<p class="p">The main components of common essential oils can be classified into two structural families with respect to hydrocarbon skeleton: terpenoids, formed by the combination of two (monoterpene), three (sesquiterpene) or four (diterpene) isoprene units, and phenylpropanoids. Both terpenoid and phenylpropanoid families comprise phenolic compounds, sometimes identified as principal components of several EOs.</p>
