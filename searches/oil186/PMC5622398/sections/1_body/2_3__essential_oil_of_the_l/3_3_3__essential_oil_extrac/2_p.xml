 <italic>T
  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic> contains more than 60 components, most of which possess important beneficial effects; for example, antiseptic, carminative, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The most important compounds of 
 <italic>T
  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic> are the phenols thymol (68.1%) and carvacrol (3.5%), which constitute the major and most active constituents, as well as the monoterpene hydrocarbons 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (11.2%) and Î³-terpinene (4.8%), which are known to have antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial properties of these compounds are, in part, associated with their lipophilic character, leading to their accumulation in membranes and to subsequent membrane-associated events, such as energy depletion [

(Poly)phenolic compounds are characterized by having redox properties, which allow them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, singlet oxygen quenchers, and metal chelators. Several researchers have carried out assessments of antioxidant activity based on the DPPH assay in different 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species. These studies showed that the chemical structure of the phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>T
  <sub>EOs</sub>

 <italic>Thymus</italic> extracts and partial digestion, the cellular reduced glutathione content significantly increased and prevented H
