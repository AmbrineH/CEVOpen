<p>The main compounds identified in the different essential oil of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> (
 <italic>O
  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic>) are carvacrol and thymol, which are responsible for the characteristic odour and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. These compounds can donate hydrogen atoms to free radicals and convert them to more stable non-radical products. The oilâ€™s effects are the result of various possible mechanisms of action involving transition-metal chelating activity, singlet-oxygen-quenching capacity, and free-radical scavenging activity [
