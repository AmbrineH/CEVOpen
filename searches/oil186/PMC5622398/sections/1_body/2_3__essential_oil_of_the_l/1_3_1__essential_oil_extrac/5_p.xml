<p>The antimicrobial effect of

  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic> has been reported in several studies testing its antibacterial activity. Gomez-Estaca et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported that rosemary essential oil totally inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesuis</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, and 
 <italic>Photobacterium phosphoreum</italic>. These bacteria are common food pathogens and bacteria contributing to food spoilage. In addition, Burt [
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] also reported a good inhibitory in vitro effect of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic> against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In general, Gram-negative bacteria are less sensitive to essential oils (due to the hydrophilic cell wall structures which block the penetration of hydrophobic components through the cell membrane) than are Gram-positive bacteria [
