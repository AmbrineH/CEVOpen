<p>The acceptance among consumers of the use of essential oils is growing, and more than 150 essential oils are listed as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the protective effects of natural antioxidants, such as essential oils, against protein oxidation have been little investigated, as recognized by Nieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who studied the mechanisms behind the protection of protein against oxidation by natural antioxidants in meat patties. For this study, two levels (0.05% and 0.4%) of rosemary essential oil were added to pork patties, and their effects on the protein oxidation occurring in the patties during storage were studied. The oxidative stability of the meat proteins was evaluated by the loss of thiols and the formation of myosin cross-links. These authors reported that essential oils of rosemary retarded protein oxidation.
