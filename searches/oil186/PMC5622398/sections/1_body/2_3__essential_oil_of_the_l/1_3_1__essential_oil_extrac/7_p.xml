 </italic> on the oxidative stability of frankfurters depended partly on the level of essential oil used and partly on the origin of the meat used to make frankfurters (made either from Iberian or non-Iberian pork). An antioxidant effect was observed when 150 ppm of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>EO</sub>
 </italic> were added to the frankfurters made with non-Iberian pork, and no effect was observed on lipid oxidation with doses of 300 and 600 ppm. In contrast, rosemary essential oil inhibited the development of lipid and protein oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner in frankfurters made with Iberian pork.
