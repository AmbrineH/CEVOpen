 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EOs as natural antioxidants is a strategy of growing interest in the food industry, because consumers do not consider synthetic antioxidants healthy. The reason for introducing synthetic antioxidants into food is to prolong these products’ shelf life; therefore, as substitutes for these compounds, EOs’ addition in active packaging or direct mixing is an alternative by which to extend the shelf life of edible foods [
  <a rid="B28-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-medicines-04-00063">28</a>]. The EOs’ overall performance as antioxidants is, in fact, the result of the complex interplay among the EO components and the oxidizable material to be protected. An antagonistic and synergistic effect is also expected between individual components of EOs [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The capacity of EOs to act as antioxidants is due to the fact that phenols are chain-breaking antioxidants. They donate an H-atom from the phenolic hydroxyl group to peroxyl radicals (ROO which are responsible for the propagation of the oxidative radical chain). Therefore, they can slow down the peroxidation of unsaturated lipids.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering the antioxidant activity of different EOs, it is important to mention that the variety of the plants, the agronomic practices and the processing can affect the chemical profile and the effective inhibitory concentrations of EOs; Delaquis et al. [
  <a rid="B30-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-medicines-04-00063">30</a>] reported that antioxidant, antimicrobial, and sensory properties differed between EOs of different origins. A higher antioxidant capacity is shown when the EOs contain a fair number of components, such as γ-terpinene (cyclohexadiene), and fair amounts of phenolics [
  <a rid="B31-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-medicines-04-00063">31</a>]. EOs with a higher proportion of phenolic sesquiterpenes and/or monoterpenes have been recognized for their antioxidative capacity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant property of essential oils and their components has often been verified in vitro by physical–chemical determination. In this respect, Kulisic et al. [
  <a rid="B33-medicines-04-00063" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-medicines-04-00063">33</a>] studied the oxidation of lard in the presence/absence of some EOs (
  <span class="italic">Origanum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Thymus</span>) or their components. These EOs showed a strong phenolic profile characterized by the presence of the phenolic monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol. The antioxidant capacity of the essential oils was lower in comparison to α-tocopherol, synthetic antioxidants (BHA and BHT), and ascorbic acid. Different cases of synergism between EO components were reported, for example oregano EO (containing 67% thymol + carvacrol and ~14% terpinene). In contrast, for 
  <span class="italic">Thymus</span> EOs (80% thymol + carvacrol and ~5.5% γ-terpinene), an intermediate behaviour was reported. Regarding the application of essential oils in food systems, different studies have reported that EOs prevented unwanted oxidation and controlled oxidative spoilage in bakery products [
