 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Angiogenesis is a normal and vital physiological process which, in a non-pathological situation, involves the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. However, this process also participates in the fundamental step of tumour transition from a dormant to a malignant state. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibitors are used in the treatment of cancer.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, certain EOs have been proposed as non-toxic anti-angiogenic agents. Bonstancioglu et al. [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies have indicated that intake of foods with high levels of flavonoids may have the potential to decrease the risk of certain cancers, such as pancreatic, breast, and colon cancers. The treatment of cancer cells is performed with drugs which induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. EOs act in chemoprevention and cancer suppression. EOs from different plants have been reported to have anticancer potential against mouth, breast, lung, prostate, liver, colon, and brain cancers, and even against leukaemia [
