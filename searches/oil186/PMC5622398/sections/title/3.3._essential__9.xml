 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thymus (thyme) belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which comprises about 110 species. It has been used for its medicinal effects (digestive, anti-inflammatory, etc.) and is one of the most valuable food preservatives in the food industry [

  </span> contains more than 60 components, most of which possess important beneficial effects; for example, antiseptic, carminative, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The most important compounds of 
  <span class="italic">T
   <sub>EO</sub>
  </span> are the phenols thymol (68.1%) and carvacrol (3.5%), which constitute the major and most active constituents, as well as the monoterpene hydrocarbons 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-cymene (11.2%) and Î³-terpinene (4.8%), which are known to have antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial properties of these compounds are, in part, associated with their lipophilic character, leading to their accumulation in membranes and to subsequent membrane-associated events, such as energy depletion [

(Poly)phenolic compounds are characterized by having redox properties, which allow them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, singlet oxygen quenchers, and metal chelators. Several researchers have carried out assessments of antioxidant activity based on the DPPH assay in different 
  <span class="italic">Thymus</span> species. These studies showed that the chemical structure of the phenolic compounds of 
  <span class="italic">T

  <span class="italic">Thymus</span> extracts and partial digestion, the cellular reduced glutathione content significantly increased and prevented H
