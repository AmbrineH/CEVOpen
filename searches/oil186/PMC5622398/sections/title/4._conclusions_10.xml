 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oils have great potential as food preservatives, due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Taking into account these properties, some essential oils may be considered for applications to different food systems such as meat, dairy, oils, and dressing. Many previous studies focussed on technological rather than nutritional aspects, and most studies on the biological activities of EOs were carried out in vitro, but not in vivo. Therefore, more studies in human systems are necessary to understand the effects of EOs on human health and their potential contribution to the nutrient and safety characteristics of food systems. It is critical to understand the effect of EOs and to optimize their combinations for use in food preservation to better exploit their possible synergistic effects in preventing both lipid oxidation and spoilage by pathogenic organisms. These considerations warrant the search for new medicinal plant species with high phenolic compound contents for beneficial applications in the food industry.</p>
