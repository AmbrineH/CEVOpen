<p id="Par68">Treatment of rats with MpEO prior to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> exposure resulted in a dramatically protective effect against acute hepato and renotoxicity and oxidative stress, which was further also confirmed by the hepatic histopathological examinations. The stimulation of hepatic regeneration makes the liver more resistant to damage by the toxin [
