<p id="Par69">In the present study, the two fold increase in the TBARS levels and reduce activity of SOD, CAT and GPx observed in liver and kidney homogenate of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-intoxicated rats. Silymarin significantly reversed CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced TBARS levels elevation but values obtained with MpEO at the highest dose was comparable in attenuation of TBARS levels in liver and kidney. Silymarin reversed CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced SOD, CAT and GPx activities decrease but values obtained with MpEO at the highest dose (40Â mg/kg) was comparable in attenuation of SOD, CAT and GPx activities in liver and kidney.
