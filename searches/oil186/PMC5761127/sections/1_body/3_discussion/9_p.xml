<p id="Par71" class="p">In the present study, the rats of group 2 served as CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-hepato and renotoxicity control and rats of groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 were injected with 1 ml/kg BW of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and olive oil mixture on day seven (a single intraperitoneal injection). It has already been shown that a single dose of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> initiates lipid peroxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] that results in the disruption of cellular and organelle membrane integrity and subsequent leakage of cellular contents into the blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is further well known to induce fibrosis of the hepatic tissue that may further progress to cirrhosis if the stimuli persists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Thus, a single CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> injection in mice can be used as an attractive and highly reproducible model of liver regeneration after toxic injury. The first appearance of histological fibrosis and scarring fibers is usually observed after repeated CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> treatment for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the dosage and mouse strains used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. In the present work, the hepatic histoarchitecture of the CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-treated rats resulted large numbers of inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes along with hepatic sinusoidal inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis and devastating liver architecture The highest dose of MpEO (40 mg/kg) or silymarin (50 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the damaged liver depicting marked focal regenerative changes which are illustrated by presence of actively dividing cells with a prominent nucleolus. The administration of MpEO reducing the histological alterations in liver provoked by CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was quite noticeable. In fact, the histological changes seen in the kidney of rats treated with CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> were characterized by some nephrotoxic lesions, as evidenced by the glomerular and tubular necrosis. Our results confirmed previous findings of Ozturk et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>] who had found degenerative changes in kidney of rats exposed to CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. The results suggest that MpEO treatment prior to CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> intoxication could prevent the CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-induced alterations in kidney tissues of treated animals.
