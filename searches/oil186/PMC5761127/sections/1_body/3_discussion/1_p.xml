<p id="Par63" class="p">Chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from MpEO was determined by GC-MS analysis. The compounds, their percentages as well as the retention indices are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The essential oil is a complex mixture with 26 compounds representing 98.17% of the total oil composition. The major component of the essential oil is menthol (33.59%) followed by iso-menthone (33.00%). In lower amounts we found a variety of compounds including limonene (8.00%), piperitone (3.20%), 1,8-cineole (2.80%), linalool (2.64%), iso-pulegol (2.40%), caryophyllene (1.95%) and pulegone (1.60%). The obtained results are in accordance with previous studies of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> oils from Turkey, Spain (Barcelona), Norway and Poland that also had menthone and menthol as their most important components [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. On the other hand, the composition of the essential oil from Iran is totally different, with α-terpinene (19.70%), isomenthone (10.30%), trans-carveol (14.50%), pipertitinone oxide (19.30%) and β-caryophyllene (7.60%) as the major compounds, and also the oil from the Girona region (Spain) is different, where limonene and 1.8-cineole, eucalyptol are the main compounds (33.37% and 30.75%, respectively) [
