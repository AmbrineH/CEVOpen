<p id="Par70">These results suggested that MpEO could exert its antioxidant and/or radical scavenging activities thus preventing the formation of the carbon free radicals originated from CCl
 <sub>4</sub> metabolism as well as ROS and peroxidation products. This hypothesis is supported by the recent findings on the in vitro antiradical and antioxidative activities of MpEO [
