<p id="Par56">Pretreatment with the MpEO at doses of 15 or 40 mg/kg significantly reduced levels of ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, γGT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL urea and creatinine and increased the level of HDL compared to the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group. It is worth noting that the treatment with 5 mg/kg MpEO did not induce any significant changes in the biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, γGT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, urea, creatinine or HDL) when compared to the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group. Treatment of rats with only MpEO (40 mg/kg BW) did not result in significant alterations in biochemical parameters compared to control rats.
