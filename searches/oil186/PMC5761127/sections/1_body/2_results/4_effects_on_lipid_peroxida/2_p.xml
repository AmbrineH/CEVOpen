<p id="Par59" class="p">Pre-treatment with the MpEO at doses of 15 and 40 mg/kg BW significantly reduced levels of TBARS in liver and kidney tissues as compared to CCl
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> group. There was a dose effect; treatment with MpEO at 5 mg/kg BW did not induce any significant decrease in the levels of TBARS in liver and kidney as compared to CCl
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> group. When rats were treated with only MpEO (40 mg/kg BW), no significant differences in the TBARS values was observed compared to control rat. Pretreatment with silymarin (50 mg/kg) significantly decreased the elevated levels of TBARS in both liver and kidney compared to CCl
