<p id="Par60">Results presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> showed a significant decrease in the levels of CAT, SOD, GPx in liver and kidney in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group when compared to control group. The decrease in hepatic and kidney CAT, SOD and GPx levels induced by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> injection were significantly restored (elevated) in the MpEO and silymarin groups, and this effect was more pronounced with the increase of essential oil concentration. Pretreatment with MpEO at doses of 15 and 40 mg/kg significantly increased levels of hepatic and kidney CAT, SOD and GPx as compared to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group. It is worth noting that the treatment with MpEO at a dose 5 mg/kg did not induce any significant increase in the levels of hepatic and kidney CAT, SOD and GPx as compared to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group. No significant differences in the values were observed in rats treated with MpEO only (40 mg/kg) compared to control rat values. Moreover, the effect of silymarin (50 mg/kg) was comparable in attenuation of levels of hepatic and kidney CAT, SOD and GPx with highest dose of MpEO (40 mg/kg).
