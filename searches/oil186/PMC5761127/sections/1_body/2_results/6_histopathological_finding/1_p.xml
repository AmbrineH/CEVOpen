<p id="Par61">The normal liver architecture was observed in liver histology of control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Large numbers of inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes together with hepatic sinusoidal inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis and devastating liver architecture were observed in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). However, pretreatment with MpEO (40 mg/kg, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) can remarkably ameliorate the histopathological hepatic lesions induced by administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>. MpEO 15 mg/kg showed very few inflammatory cells along with prominent nucleolus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The highest dose of MpEO (40 mg/kg) and silymarin (50 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the damaged liver depicting marked focal regenerative changes which are illustrated by presence of actively dividing cells with a prominent nucleolus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). In addition, silymarin at the dose of 50 mg/kg has shown to produce hepatoprotection evidenced by area of regeneration and dark nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The histological pattern was almost normal in rats treated with MpEO oil alone. By analyzing the histopathological scoring attributed to the liver tissues it is possible to note that the highest dose of MpEO (40 mg/kg) or silymarin (50 mg/kg) pretreatment just conferred good protection on CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver damage (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>).
