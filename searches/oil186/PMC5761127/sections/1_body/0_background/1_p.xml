<p id="Par23" class="p">Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are various forms of activated oxygen. A disproportion of the reactive oxygen species and the absence of their scavenge systems in cells lead to oxidative stress and increases the risk of several human chronic diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. ROS contributes to the development of various diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, liver cirrhosis and the aging process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The liver plays a central role in the maintenance of systemic lipid homeostasis and is especially susceptible to ROS damage. CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is now of greatest concern as an environmental contaminant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. It was reported that CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was one of the most commonly used toxins in the experimental study of liver diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Abraham et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] showed that the nephrotoxic effects of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> were also associated with free radical production.
