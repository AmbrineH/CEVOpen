<p id="Par49">Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was estimated according to Beyer and Fridovich [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM of tissue homogenates in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 13 mM L-methionine, 2 mM riboflavin and 75 mM nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). The developed blue color in the reaction was measured at 560 nm. Units of SOD activity were expressed as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of NBT by 50% and the activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, at 25 °C. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was measured by the procedure of Flohe and Gunzler [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One milliliter of reaction mixture containing 0.3 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 0.2 ml of 2 mM glutathione (GSH), 0.1 ml of sodium azide (10 mM), 0.1 ml of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mM) and 0.3 ml of liver and kidney supernatant were prepared. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml 5% TCA. Tubes were centrifuged at 1500×g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 0.1 ml of this reaction supernatant, 0.2 ml of (0.1 M pH 7.4) and 0.7 mL of 5,5 dithiobis-(2-Nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 0.4 mg/ml) were added. After mixing, absorbance was recorded at 420 nm and the enzyme activity was calculated as μmol of GSH oxidized/min/mg protein.
