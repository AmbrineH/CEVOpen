<p id="Par47">Malondialdehyde concentrations (marker for lipid peroxidation) in liver and kidney tissues were determined spectrophotometrically according to Draper &amp; Hadley [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, an aliquot of liver and kidney extracts supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 2500×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. One ml of thiobarbituric acid reagent (0.67%) was added to 500 μl of supernatant and heated at 90 °C for 15 min. The mixture was cooled and the absorbance measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (Jenway UV-6305, Essex, England). The malondialdehyde values were calculated using 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane as standard and expressed as nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of protein.
