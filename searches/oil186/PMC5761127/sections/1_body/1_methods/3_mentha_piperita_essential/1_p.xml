<p id="Par30">MpEO compositional analysis of the volatile constituents was performed on a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph GC: 5890 series II. The fused HP-Innowax capillary column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m, 0.25 μm, ID, 0.25 mm film thickness) was directly connected to the mass spectrometer. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Oven temperature was initially set at 50 °C (1 min) and gradually raised to 250 °C (5 min) at 7 °C/min. The temperatures of the injection port and detector were maintained at 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated (full scan-mode) in the EI-mode at 70 eV.</p>
