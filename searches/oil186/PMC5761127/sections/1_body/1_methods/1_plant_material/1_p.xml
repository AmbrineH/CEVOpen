 <italic>M. piperita</italic> L. samples were harvested from the local market at Sfax (Tunisia) (N: 34.4426°, E: 10.4537°) during the vegetative stage in June 2013. The samples were identified and authenticated by a senior botanist, Pr. Ferjani Ben Abdallah, at the Faculty of Science of Sfax, University of Sfax (Tunisia). From 50 individual 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> L. plants each, a total of 80–100 leaves (≈ 12 cm
 <sup>2</sup> in size) were randomly collected from the base to the apex. The fresh leaves were mixed and immediately dried in the shade away from light at room temperature. After drying, the samples were grounded to a fine powder that was used for the extraction of essential oil.
