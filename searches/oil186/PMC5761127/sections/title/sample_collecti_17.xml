  <span class="italic">g</span>, 15 min, 4 °C; Beckman-Coulter, Marseille, France) and stored at −80 °C for further biochemical assays. The liver and kidney tissues were immediately removed and dissected over ice-cold glass slides and a part was homogenized (10% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer in ice-cold, 1.15% KCl-0.01 M sodium, potassium phosphate buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10000×
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were used for immediate lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation determination. Homogenate aliquots were stored at −80 °C for further biochemical assays. Other parts of these livers and kidney tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and processed for paraffin sectioning and histological studies.
