  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malondialdehyde concentrations (marker for lipid peroxidation) in liver and kidney tissues were determined spectrophotometrically according to Draper &amp; Hadley [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Briefly, an aliquot of liver and kidney extracts supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 2500×
   <span class="italic">g</span> for 10 min. One ml of thiobarbituric acid reagent (0.67%) was added to 500 μl of supernatant and heated at 90 °C for 15 min. The mixture was cooled and the absorbance measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (Jenway UV-6305, Essex, England). The malondialdehyde values were calculated using 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane as standard and expressed as nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of protein.

  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was estimated according to Beyer and Fridovich [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM of tissue homogenates in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 13 mM L-methionine, 2 mM riboflavin and 75 mM nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). The developed blue color in the reaction was measured at 560 nm. Units of SOD activity were expressed as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of NBT by 50% and the activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, at 25 °C. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was measured by the procedure of Flohe and Gunzler [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. One milliliter of reaction mixture containing 0.3 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 0.2 ml of 2 mM glutathione (GSH), 0.1 ml of sodium azide (10 mM), 0.1 ml of H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> (1 mM) and 0.3 ml of liver and kidney supernatant were prepared. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml 5% TCA. Tubes were centrifuged at 1500×g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 0.1 ml of this reaction supernatant, 0.2 ml of (0.1 M pH 7.4) and 0.7 mL of 5,5 dithiobis-(2-Nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 0.4 mg/ml) were added. After mixing, absorbance was recorded at 420 nm and the enzyme activity was calculated as μmol of GSH oxidized/min/mg protein.

  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of sacrifice, the liver and kidney tissues were removed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and washed. The tissues were dehydrated in increasing gradient of ethanol, finally cleared in toluene and embedded in molten paraffin wax. Sections were cut at 4–5 μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The slides were photographed with an Olympus UTU1X-2 camera connected to an Olympus CX41 microscope (Tokyo, Japan).</p>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The histological damage in liver was quantified by measuring the index of tissue large numbers of inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes together with hepatic sinusoidal inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis and devastating liver architecture. Moreover, the histological damage in kidney was quantified by measuring the index of tissue the glomerular and tubular necrosis. To evaluate the severity of lesions, the degree of liver and kidney damage was graded according to a zero to four-point scoring system [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], where 0 indicates no damage, I indicates slight damage (1–25%), II indicates discrete damage (26–50%), III indicates moderate damage (51–75%) and IV indicates severe damage (76–100%).The tabulation of data and the statistical analysis were made in accordance with the number of animals with established scores. All the parameters were quantified by a single observer who was not aware of the treatment groups.
