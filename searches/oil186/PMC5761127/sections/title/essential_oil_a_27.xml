 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of MpEO was compared to that of silymarin, a well-known antioxidant, using two different assays, namely DPPH and superoxide oxygen radicals inhibition, the results are reported in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. DPPH showed for MpEO an IC50 value around 3 times higher than the one recorded for silymarin indicating that antioxidant activity of MpEO was lower than that of silymarin.
