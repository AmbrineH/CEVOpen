 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extensive use of chemical antimicrobial and antiseptic agents in human mediation as well as in animal breeding led to the selection of resistant strains permitting the development of resistance, which is a biological phenomenon very hard to remove. There are a few decades; several diseases appeared under control using antibiotics. Scientific and technological progress believed in a possible eradication of many diseases;[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] however, the resistance developed increasingly by microorganisms and the regular emergence of new infectious agents have denied this optimistic prognosis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Faced with this phenomenon, the discovery of new antibacterial molecules that could provide an alternative to the use of conventional antibiotics which became ineffective seems an absolute necessity. The research tracks are numerous, but the exploration of natural resources appears to be more promising because they constitute, by their biodiversity, the largest reserve of active substances and especially the medicinal and aromatic plants, which are the source of high-value products, such as essential oils (EOs).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus 
  <span class="italic">Mentha</span>, known as peppermint, is a cultivated natural hybrid of 
  <span class="italic">Mentha aquatic</span> L. (water mint) and 
  <span class="italic">Mentha spicata</span> L. (spearmint). Although being a native genus of the Mediterranean region, it is cultivated all over the world and the EO of this plant has been reported by other works for its insecticidal,[
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>] antimicrobial,[
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>] antioxidant effects.[

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study aims to investigate the chemical composition of Moroccan 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> EO, to assess its antimicrobial activity against seven bacteria and two fungi causing spoiling and pathogenicity, in an attempt to contribute to the use of these as alternative products for microbial control and food preservation.
