 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study has demonstrated the potential of 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> EO as an antimicrobial agent in the liquid phase.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis results of 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> EO showed that its chemical composition is broadly similar to EO of 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> from Turkey regarding menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, and menthofuron as main compounds.[
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, it is clear that menthol is the principal major component of the studied EO, which is in agreement with several other works.[
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">10</a>] Regarding other components, our results diverge from those published by other authors; in fact, the team research of Laghouiter 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">11</a>] has found that 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> from South Algeria is composed by trans-carveol (58.98%), D-limonene (19.94%), carvone (2.07%), and 4-terpineol (3.01%); hence, Yadegarinia 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">12</a>] showed that EO of 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> from Iran presented a significantly different chemical composition, consisting of a-terpinene (19.7%), isomenthone (10.3%), trans-carveol (14.5%), piperitenone oxide (19.3%) and Î²-caryophyllene (7.6%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, the compositions of EO vary significantly because of different species and chemotypes, geographical origin, plant's age and maturity season, and extraction procedure.[
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">13</a>
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">14</a>
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">15</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> EO is known for its antimicrobial properties which have been reported in several studies.[
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>] These antibacterial activities could be mainly attributed to its chemical composition, which is very rich with oxygenated monoterpenes (92.95%) known for their higher efficiency and broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, Bakkali 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.[
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">17</a>] stipulate that the major compounds determine the biological EO activity. However, the antimicrobial power might also be attributed to the synergy between the various components of this oil.[
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">18</a>] Furthermore, the influence of minor compounds on antimicrobial activity should be also taken into consideration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, among the identified compounds, some were previously reported to have antimicrobial activity including menthol and menthone that have been proven effective against human pathogenic[
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>
  <a rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref19">19</a>] and also 1,8-cineole[
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">20</a>] and menthofuran.[
  <a rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref21">21</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the antimicrobial effects of an EO can be attributed to its action mechanisms at cytoplasmic membrane level. In fact, EOs are selectively absorbed and interfered with the functions of biological cell membrane which involve lysis and loss of membrane integrity, causing damage to essential processes for cell survival.[
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, the antibacterial activity of EO tested in this study was more marked against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria, which can be explained by the structure of the cell envelope. In fact, Gram-negative bacteria possess an additional membrane which gives them a double protection against toxic agents and hydrophobic compounds. However, the absence of this structure in Gram-positive bacteria makes them sensitive to attacks from external agents.[
