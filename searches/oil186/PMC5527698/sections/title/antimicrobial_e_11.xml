  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>, the EO of 
  <span class="italic">M. piperita</span> exercised an important inhibitory activity against all studied bacteria, especially 
  <span class="italic">M. luteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span> which showed a high sensitivity to this oil and were inhibited from very low concentrations of 0.062% (v/v) and 0.125% (v/v), respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of 0.25% (v/v) was sufficient to stop the growth of 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For Gram-negative bacteria,
