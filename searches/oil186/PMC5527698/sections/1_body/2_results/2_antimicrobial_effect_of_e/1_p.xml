<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, the EO of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> exercised an important inhibitory activity against all studied bacteria, especially 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> which showed a high sensitivity to this oil and were inhibited from very low concentrations of 0.062% (v/v) and 0.125% (v/v), respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of 0.25% (v/v) was sufficient to stop the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>.
