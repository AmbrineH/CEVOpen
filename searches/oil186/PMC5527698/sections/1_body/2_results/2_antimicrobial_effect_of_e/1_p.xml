<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> exercised an important inhibitory activity against all studied bacteria, especially 
 <italic class="italic">M. luteus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> which showed a high sensitivity to this oil and were inhibited from very low concentrations of 0.062% (v/v) and 0.125% (v/v), respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of 0.25% (v/v) was sufficient to stop the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic>.
