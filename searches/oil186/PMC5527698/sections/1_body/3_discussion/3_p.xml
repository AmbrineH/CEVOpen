<p>Hence, it is clear that menthol is the principal major component of the studied EO, which is in agreement with several other works.[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Regarding other components, our results diverge from those published by other authors; in fact, the team research of Laghouiter 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has found that 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> from South Algeria is composed by trans-carveol (58.98%), D-limonene (19.94%), carvone (2.07%), and 4-terpineol (3.01%); hence, Yadegarinia 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that EO of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> from Iran presented a significantly different chemical composition, consisting of a-terpinene (19.7%), isomenthone (10.3%), trans-carveol (14.5%), piperitenone oxide (19.3%) and Î²-caryophyllene (7.6%).
