<p class="p">Hence, the antibacterial activity of EO tested in this study was more marked against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria, which can be explained by the structure of the cell envelope. In fact, Gram-negative bacteria possess an additional membrane which gives them a double protection against toxic agents and hydrophobic compounds. However, the absence of this structure in Gram-positive bacteria makes them sensitive to attacks from external agents.[
