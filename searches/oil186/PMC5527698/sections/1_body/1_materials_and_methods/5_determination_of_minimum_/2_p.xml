<p>For yeasts, the microdilution assay was conducted according to the protocol previously described by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with slight modifications. First, the EO was serially diluted in YPG broth, supplemented with agar at 0.15% (w/v), to achieve final concentrations ranging between 4 and 0.003% (v/v). The 12
 <sup>th</sup> well was also considered as growth control. Then, 50 μl of inoculum was added to each well at final concentration of 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/ml. Finally, the microplate was incubated at 30°C for 48 h.
