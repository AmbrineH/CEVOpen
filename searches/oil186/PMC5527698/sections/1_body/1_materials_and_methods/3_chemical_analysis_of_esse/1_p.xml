<p class="p">The EO was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) (GC/MS) (PolarisQ ion trap MS). Hence, analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard (HP 6890) gas chromatograph (flame ionization detector [FID]). The temperature was programmed from 50°C after 5 min initial hold to 200°C at 4°C/min. Chromatography carrier gas was N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1.8 ml/min), split mode was used (flow: 72.1 ml/min. ratio: 1/50), temperature of injector and detector was 250°C, and final hold time was 48 min. The machine was led by a computer system type “HP ChemStation,” managing its functioning and allowing to follow the evolution of chromatographic analyses. Diluted samples (1/20 in methanol) of 1 μl were injected manually.[
