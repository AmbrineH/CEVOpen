 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">m</sub> value was not changed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, the slope and the vertical axis intercept increase with increasing essential oil concentration (2.5, 3.75 and 5 μg/mL). This result indicates that the essential oil components affected the velocity of the reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, without affecting the Michaelis constant (K
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">m</sub>). From these results, we can conclude that this inhibition is a non-competitive one, indicating that the components of the essential oil bind to a site other than the active one of the enzyme, without competing with the substrate.
