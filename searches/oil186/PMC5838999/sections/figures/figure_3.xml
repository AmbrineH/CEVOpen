 <p> Lineweaver-Burk plot of xanthine oxidase inhibition at different substrate [S] concentrations in absence (○) or presence of various concentrations (●: 2.5 μg/mL; ▲: 3.75 μg/mL and ■: 5 μg/mL) of RaEO. Insert: Secondary replot of Y-intercept against inhibitor concentrations to calculate the inhibition constant (Ki). Each point is the average value from three independent experiments </p>)
