 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydroxyl radicals are known for their capacity to cause oxidative damage to biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA. The antioxidant effect of RaEO using DNA nicking assay is presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The untreated plasmid (lane 1) represents three conformations: the nicked, the linear and the supercoiled forms. On the other hand, incubation of plasmid DNA with Fenton’s reagent resulted in the total degradation of the plasmid and the loss of the three bands (lane 2). We can notice essentially that the pre-incubation of DNA with the essential oil at 2 mg/mL, before the incubation with Fenton’s reagent, protected the plasmid DNA against oxidation. Furthermore, the RaEO, with 2 mg/mL as concentration shows significant protective effect with important conservation of the supercoiled DNA band intensity.
