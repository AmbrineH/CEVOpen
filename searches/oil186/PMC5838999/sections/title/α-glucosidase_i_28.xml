 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to literature, few reports exist for the inhibition activity of α-glucosidase by essential oils. The low IC
  <sub>50</sub> values obtained in this assay indicated a high inhibition activity. From our results, RaEO shows interesting antidiabetic activity with IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 6.7 ± 0.10 μg/mL which is 42-fold lower than that of the commercial inhibitor acarbose (280 ± 10.01 μg/mL).

 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the type of enzyme inhibition and to determine the inhibition constant (Ki), the kinetics was performed according to the procedure detailed in the Materials and Methods section. The Lineweaver–Burk plots analysis indicated that the lines coincided on a point on the left side of the 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>-axis and intercepted both the 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>- and the 
  <span class="italic">X</span>-axes at different points. What can be also observed are a decrease in apparent V
  <sub>max</sub> value and an increase in the value of apparent K
  <sub>m</sub>, indicating that the nature of inhibition is of mixed-type (Fig.
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).

 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, it can be noted that the intersecting lines on the graph converge at the left side of the Y-axis and above the X-axis, indicating that the value of α (a constant that defines the degree to which inhibitor binding affects the affinity of the enzyme for substrate) is greater than 1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. This confirms that the inhibitor prefers binding to the free enzyme rather than to the enzyme substrate complex. Therefore, the mode of inhibition caused by the essential oil is a mixed-type one, but it seems that it has strong competitive components. The inhibition constant (Ki) value derived from the secondary plot (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) was 37.5 μg/mL.
