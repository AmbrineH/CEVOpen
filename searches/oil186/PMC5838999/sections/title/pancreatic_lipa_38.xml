 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the literature, Asteraceae species are well documented for their antimicrobial activities, but to the best of our knowledge there are no studies about their pancreatic lipase inhibition ability. Thus, this is the first study conducted on the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> to inhibit pancreatic lipase. In this work, Turkey pancreatic lipase (TPL) was used to measure the anti-lipase activity of RaEO.
 </p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the method A (preincubation of lipase with inhibitor), the RaEO exhibited promising anti-lipase activity which is comparable with that of pure THL used as a standard inhibitor against pancreatic lipase. In the same way and according to the literature, the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia judaica</span> (Lamiaceae) flowers was determined colorimetrically and compared with Orlistat used as a positive control by Afifi et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> value (0.108 mg/mL) obtained in this study was very close to that obtained with RaEO (0.2 mg/mL). In this work, similarly to our essential oil, the aroma profile of the 
  <span class="italic">Salvia judaica</span> (Lamiaceae) flowers was found to be mainly composed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (71.8%).
 </p>
 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the type of inhibition exerted by the RaEO on the TPL, the method B (inhibition during lipolysis) was used. Our results revealed that the obtained lipase inhibition was irreversible. Similar results have been reported by Gargouri et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] using pure THL as inhibitor for porcine pancreatic lipase. In this case, the lipase hydrolysis rate of olive oil decreased rapidly to reach 10%, with final THL concentration of 200 μM. Gargouri et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>] have described two types of inhibition: the reversible inactivation obtained with amphiphiles compounds, such as detergents and some proteins. This inhibition is due to the modification of the interface quality, which prevents the binding of lipase to the interface [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]; the irreversible inhibition was obtained in the presence of colipase and bile salt and cannot be suppressed by renewal or excess of interface. The irreversible inhibition was obtained with specific reagents, such as THL, C12:0-TNB and E600 [
