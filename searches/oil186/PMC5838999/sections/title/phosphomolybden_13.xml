 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential oil samples (200 μL) were mixed with 2 mL of the phosphomolybdenum reagent (600 mM sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, 4 mM ammonium molybdate) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Then, the mixture was incubated at 95 °C during 90 min and cooled to room temperature. Subsequently the absorbance was measured at 695 nm. In order to estimate the percentage of molybdenum reduced by tested essential oil, a standard curve was constructed using ascorbic acid. EC
  <sub>50</sub> (mg/mL) corresponds to the effective concentration at which the total antioxidant activity (TAA) was 50% and was obtained by interpolation from linear regression analysis. As a positive control, the ascorbic acid was used. The values are presented as the means of triplicate assay.
