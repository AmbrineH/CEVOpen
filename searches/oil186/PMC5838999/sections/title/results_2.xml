 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result revealed the presence of 26 compounds (97.4%). The main constituents include germacrene D (49.2%), methyl eugenol (8.3%), 
  <span class="italic">(E)</span>-β-ionone (6.2%), β-caryophyllene (5.7%), 
  <span class="italic">(E,E)</span>-α-farnesene (4.2%), bicyclogermacrene (4.1%) and 
  <span class="italic">(Z)</span>-α-bisabolene (3.7%). The kinetic inhibition study showed that the essential oil demonstrated a strong α-glucosidase inhibiton and it was a mixed inhibitor. On the other hand, our results evidenced that this oil exhibited important xanthine oxidase inhibitory effect, behaving as a non-competitive inhibitor. The essential oil inhibited the turkey pancreatic lipase, with maximum inhibition of 80% achieved at 2 mg/mL. Furthermore, the inhibition of turkey pancreatic lipase by RaEO was an irreversible one.
