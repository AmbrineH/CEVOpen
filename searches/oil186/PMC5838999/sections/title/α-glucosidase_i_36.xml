 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the available approaches, inhibition of α-glucosidase has appeared to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. For a long time plant food rich in polyphenols have been reported to cause effects similar to insulin in the utilization of glucose and act as good inhibitors of key enzymes like α-glucosidase associated with type 2 diabetes and lipid peroxidation in tissues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. On the other hand, according to literature, few reports exist for the inhibition activity of α-glucosidase by essential oils. In this study, our results revealed that the RaEO exhibited good antidiabetic activity which is 42-fold higher than that of acarbose used as commercial inhibitor. This interesting antidiabetic activity may be due to the large amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, especially germacrene D, as hypothesized by Sarikurkcu et al. [
