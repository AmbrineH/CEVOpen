 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the literature, the comparison of the chemical composition of our essential oil (RaEO) with that of 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</span> roots studied by Skała et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], revealed important similarity. In fact, these authors reported sesquiterpene hydrocarbons as the main class of chemicals in this essential oil (54.7%). Furthermore, Havlik et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] noted that sesquiterpene lactones exist in all parts of 
  <span class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</span> while the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were identified only in essential oil. On the other hand, Benyelles et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] reported that the essential oil extracted from the roots of 
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span> was characterized by a large amount of alcohol derivatives (69.2%). Finally it is worth to note that for the essential oil of the aerial part of the same species (
  <span class="italic">R. acaule</span>), Boussaada et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] described a composition richer in diterpenoids (23.7%), aromatic compounds (23.6%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (21.3%). However, these authors collected the plant material in the completely different habitat of Tunisia. Indeed, the differences between the chemical compositions of the essential oil obtained from the same species may be attributable to environmental factors (geographical, climatic, and seasonal), development stage and genetic variability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Additionally, chemotypes and individual variability may appear within the same plant species, resulting in the differences in chemical compositions of the raw materials [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>].
