<p id="par0070" class="p">Vision is a key strategy by which individual aquatic species avoid predators. However, in low-light or turbid conditions the injury-induced release of chemical messengers play a key in allowing an individual to communicate threat to conspecifics (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>). Among fish in the superorder Ostariophysi, anatomically distinct club cells in the epidermis produce an alarm substance, which is released if those cells are damaged (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>). The alarm substance then binds to olfactory receptors of conspecifics, resulting in a range of anti-predatory behaviors (including freezing, darting, schooling, feeding, and hiding) which may persist for up to 4 h after withdrawal of the alarm substance 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[4]</xref>. The precise composition of the alarm substance is unknown and thus, a purified preparation of alarm substance is not commercially available. However, determining the precise composition of alarm substance is an active area of study 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. Most recently, chondroitin and hypoxanthine 3-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-oxide have been shown to induce anti-predatory behaviors in fish 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>. This suggests that alarm substance contains these compounds as active ingredients or other chemicals that are similar in structure. In bioassays, fish epithelium is usually used as a “natural” source of alarm substance. A prescribed section of skin is removed and homogenized in water; fish exposed to the solution exhibit anti-predator behavior

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Alternately, shallow incisions are made in the epidermis and flushed with water; this solution induces anti-predator behavior as well 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>. The aforementioned procedures are effective at extracting alarm substance but the fish from which they are obtained must be killed.
