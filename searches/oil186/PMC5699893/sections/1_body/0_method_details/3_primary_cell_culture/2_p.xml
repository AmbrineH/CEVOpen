Leibovitz's medium was selected for cell culture because it is CO

If scales are evident in the tube, allow the tube to stand vertically for 15 s—the scales will settle to the bottom. Avoiding the scales if present, remove the media/cell solution from the conical vial with a sterile Pasteur pipet and transfer to a sterile T25 flask with a vented cap (Corning).
