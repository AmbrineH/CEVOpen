<p id="par0020" class="p">All reagents should be used at room temperature. Remove fish from the home tank and place in 1.5 L of water containing 400 μL of an oil of cloves solution (1:10 clove oil in 95% ethanol (should yield a concentration of 100 mg/L) (store in a dark bottle as solution is light sensitive). The solution should induce a light plane of anesthesia in fish in approximately 5 min. When the fish is unable to right itself in the water and/or does not try to avoid handling, collection can begin. Place the fish on its ventral side on a wet paper towel and gently abrade the epidermis with a sterile scalpel blade. Focus cell collection on the anterior end of the animal and avoid removal of scales. Place epidermal cells in a 15 mL polypropylene conical vial containing 10 mL room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (no calcium or magnesium) (Life Sciences) supplemented with 1.5% penicillin/streptavidin solution (10,000 IU/mL, GIbco) and 1.5% Fungizone 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (antimycotic, Gibco), 1.5% kanamycin (Gibco), and 1.5% tetracycline (Gibco) (this solution will be referred to as supplemented PBS). Sample collection should take less than 60 s. Immediately afterwards, place the fish back into its home tank and observe for normal behaviors. Recovery from anesthesia should occur within minutes. Pool cells from six fish.
