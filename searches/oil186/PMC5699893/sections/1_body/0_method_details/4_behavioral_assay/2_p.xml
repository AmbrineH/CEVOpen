<p id="par0060">Fish were recorded in the untreated environment for 3 min, in the presence of a control solution (distilled water) for 3 min, and finally, in the presence of 1.5 mL media, which was taken from epithelial cells after 24 h of culture (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Seconds of darting behavior by each fish under each condition was calculated from the digital record. In our model, darting was the most robust antipredatory behavior observed. Different species may exhibit other behaviors more prominently. Therefore, quantify the most consistently expressed antipredatory behavior. Darting behavior for each fish was measured; nine trials were completed. Data were analyzed using a
