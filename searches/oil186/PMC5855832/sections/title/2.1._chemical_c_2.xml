  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil obtained with Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was represented in (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-00610-t001" href="#ijms-19-00610-t001">Table 1</a>). The result showed that Eugenol (2-Methoxy-4-(2-propenyl) phenol) is the major constituent of the oil with a percentage of 87.03% followed by Eugenyl acetate (4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenyl acetate) with a percentage of 11.25%. The composition of Argan oil includes Schottenol (159 mg/100 g), Spinasterol (129 mg/100 g), Stigmasta-8,22-dien-3β-ol (12 mg/100 g) and other (27 mg/100 g).
