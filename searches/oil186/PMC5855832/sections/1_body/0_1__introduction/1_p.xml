<p>Free radicals are naturally present in the living organism, and they include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-19-00610" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are produced during metabolism of energy in the cell as a result of the reduction of oxygen with one electron which forms superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>) and with 2 or 3 electrons which forms H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by the action of enzymes such as oxidases and with production of hydroxyl radical (OH
 <sup>•</sup>). Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) with anionic superoxide (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>) gives peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>), which is RNS [
