<p>A total of 100 g clove was subjected to hydro-distillation for 3 h with 600 mL distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus modified: the hydrosol was collected in a separator funnel (1 L) so that the heavy essential oil was decanted to the bottom of the flask and collected. Another funnel of distilled water was used to add water to the flask containing the plant material during boiling. The essential oil obtained was collected and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a refrigerator at 4–5 °C prior to analysis. The yield based on dried weight of the sample was calculated.</p>
