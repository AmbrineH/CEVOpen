<p>To evaluate the protective effect of Argan oil or 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil prepared in Argan oil, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: Group 1: received (10 mL/kg/bw) of distilled water, Group 2: received 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil prepared in Argan oil (100 mg/kg/bw), Group 3: received Argan oil (10 mL/kg/bw), group 4: received 1% of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mL/kg/bw) and (10 mL/kg/bw) of distilled water, Group 5: received 1% of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mL/kg/bw) and 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil prepared in Argan oil (100 mg/kg/bw), and Group 6: received H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mL/kg/bw) and Argan oil (10 mL/kg/bw). The interventions were delivered daily by gavage for 21 days. Blood sample was collected from each rat on day 21 and body weight was measured. The kidney, brain, and liver of each rat were removed, weighted and were immediately fixed in formalin solution at (10%). The dose of Argan oil and 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil were similar to the doses used elsewhere in rats [
