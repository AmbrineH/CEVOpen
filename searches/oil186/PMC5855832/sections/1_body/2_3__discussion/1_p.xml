<p>The results of this study showed that Argan oil and 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil has a protective effect on H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced biochemical changes and histopathological injury in kidney, liver and brain. The results demonstrated that 
 <italic>Syzygium</italic>
 <italic>aromaticum</italic> essential oil has more antioxidant content than Argan oil. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> causes significant increase in the lipid parameters, liver enzymes, and blood urea, significant increase in the liver and kidney weight, insignificant increase in the serum creatinine and significant decrease in the total protein and albumin. These H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced biochemical changes have been alleviated with use of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil or Argan oil.
