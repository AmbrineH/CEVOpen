<p>In conclusion, the study shows that Argan oil and especially the mixture of Argan oil with 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil can reduce the oxidative stress that is caused by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. This protection is obviously due to the bioactive molecules and antioxidants such as eugenol in clove essential oil and vanillic acid, syringic acid, vitamin E and ferulic acid in Argan oil [

 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil that might be suitable to be tested in clinical setting.
