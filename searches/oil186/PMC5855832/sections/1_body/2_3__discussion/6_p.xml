 <sub class="sub">2</sub> alone. Blood urea is a waste product of protein metabolism, synthesized in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Therefore, high blood urea could be due to renal damage which was not evident with stable and normal plasma creatinine. Furthermore, the elevated liver enzymes indicate abnormal liver function where low blood urea is expected. Therefore, mechanism of elevated blood urea with the use of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> needs further experiments.
