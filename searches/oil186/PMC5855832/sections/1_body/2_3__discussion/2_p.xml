<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil showed that eugenol and eugenol acetate were the main components, that was in agreement with other studies [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-19-00610" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-19-00610" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The antioxidant content in 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil is higher than that found in Argan oil. Therefore 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil might be more powerful as an antioxidant than Argan oil, and this property most likely due to the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> essential oil, which is rich in eugenol (87.03%) with a potent antioxidant activity [
