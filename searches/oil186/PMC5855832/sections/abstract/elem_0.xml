 <p>Oxidative stress is an important etiology of chronic diseases and many studies have shown that natural products might alleviate oxidative stress-induced pathogenesis. The study aims to evaluate the effect of Argan oil and 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil on hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>)-induced liver, brain and kidney tissue toxicity as well as biochemical changes in wistar rats. The antioxidant content of Argan oil and 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil was studied with the use of gas chromatography. The animals received daily by gavage, for 21 days, either distilled water, 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil, Argan oil, H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> alone, H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil, or H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> and Argan oil. Blood samples were withdrawn on day 21 for the biochemical blood tests, and the kidney, liver and brain tissue samples were prepared for histopathology examination. The results showed that the content of antioxidant compounds in 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil is higher than that found in Argan oil. H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> increased level of blood urea, liver enzymes, total cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C), Triglycerides (TG) and Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), and decreased the total protein, albumin and High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). There was no significant effect on blood electrolyte or serum creatinine. The histopathology examination demonstrated that H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> induces dilatation in the central vein, inflammation and binucleation in the liver, congestion and hemorrhage in the brain, and congestion in the kidney. The H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>-induced histopathological and biochemical changes have been significantly alleviated by 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil or Argan oil. It is concluded that the Argan oil and especially the mixture of Argan oil with 
  <span class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</span> essential oil can reduce the oxidative damage caused by H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2,</sub> and this will pave the way to investigate the protective effects of these natural substances in the diseases attributed to the high oxidative stress.
