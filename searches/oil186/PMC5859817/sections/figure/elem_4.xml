   <span class="italic">Microscopic changes in burn wounds of experimental mice</span>. Histology studies revealed that burn wounds treated with essential oil developed complete epidermal structure (c). In tamanu oil treated mice, wounds were partially recovered with existence of coagulative necrosis region on epidermis and vascular congestion, swollen stromal tissue, and no matured hair follicles (b). On the contrary, saline treated mice formed uneven epidermal layer with the ulcer on epidermis layer and infiltration of immune cells (a). The highlighted part in (a) pointed out the ulcer region with infiltration of lymphocytes and multinuclear leukocytes.
