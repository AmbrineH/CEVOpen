  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> Essential Oil
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous report, Livimbi and Komolafe (2007) suggested that
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> was the most common bacteria isolated from burn wound, followed by
  <span class="italic"> P. mirabilis, Streptococci </span>spp.,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Salmonella</span>, and
  <span class="italic"> Klebsiella </span>spp. [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">21</a>]. Therefore, we investigated antibacterial activity of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil against two bacteria commonly found on burn wound such as
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> to prove the anti-infective efficiency of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> essential oil (CLO). Furthermore,
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> also represent two types of bacteria, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. We found that both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> whereas they did not exhibit antibacterial activity against
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The diameter of inhibition zones of gentamicin (positive control) against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> was highest (11.37 ± 0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03 ± 0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17 ± 0.12 mm, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa (</span>12.07 ± 0.15), but
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </span>was resistant with commercial tamanu oil and CLO (diameters of inhibition zones = diameter of dishes, 6 mm). These results were identical with previous reports [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">19</a>, 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. In previous study, Nguyen et al. (2017) suggested that methanol extract of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> leaves could inhibit
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> but not hinder
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> growth [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> leaves from Nepal against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> has also been demonstrated [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">19</a>]. However, Dung et al. (2008) indicated that essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> isolated from flower buds could inhibit both
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">16</a>]. It may be explained that different parts of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus</span> possess a variety of bioactive compounds which account for different antimicrobial activities of essential oils isolated from different parts of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus.</span> In addition, although tamanu oil is effective remedy for burn wound treatment,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span> is also resistant with commercial tamanu oil [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. From these results, we suggested that CLO has antimicrobial activity against
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, the most common skin wound opportunistic bacterium, but the effectiveness of CLO is lower than commercial tamanu oil. This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment. Next we investigated the wound contractive ability of
  <span class="italic"> C. operculatus </span>essential oil on second-degree burn wound model.
