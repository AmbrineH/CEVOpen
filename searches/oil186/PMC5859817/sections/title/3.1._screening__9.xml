  <span class="italic">C. operculatus</span> leaves essential oil (CLO) has yellowish color and fragrant odor, with 0.1% yield. The presence of some active compounds in CLO was determined by GC-MS analysis, and data were recorded in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. Briefly, a total of 13 compounds were identified in CLO: 6-camphenol; isopinocarveol; p-cymen-8-ol; (−)-myrtenol; I-verbenone; cis-carveol; ethaneperoxoic acid, 1-cyano-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentyl ethaneperoxate; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; (−)-globulol; 2-(4a,8-dimethyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydronaphthalen-2-yl) propan-1-; and longipinocarvone. Most of bioactive compounds identified in CLO exhibited antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activities, such as isopinocarveol, (−)-myrtenol; I- verbenone; cis-carveol; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; (−)-globulol. This finding indicated that CLO may be used as topical treatment, at least as the anti-infective and antiseptic agent, for burn wound. Therefore, the next question has been raised whether CLO could inhibit the growth and/or eliminate some common bacteria inhabited on burn wound or not.
