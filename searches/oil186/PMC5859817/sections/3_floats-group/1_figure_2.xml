   <italic class="italic">Antimicrobial activity of C. operculatus essential oil</italic>. Both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against
   <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> whereas they did not inhibit the growth of
   <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. The diameter of inhibition zones against
   <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> of gentamicin (positive control) was highest (11.37 ± 0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03 ± 0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17 ± 0.12 mm). On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against
   <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa (</italic>12.07 ± 0.15 mm); both tamanu oil and CLO did not affect the growth of
   <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa. </italic>This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment. The experiments were triplicated, and results were presented as mean ± standard deviation.
