   <italic class="italic">GC/MS chromatogram of essential oil extracted from Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves</italic>. A total of 13 compounds were identified in CLO: 6-camphenol; isopinocarveol; p-cymen-8-ol; (−)-myrtenol; I-verbenone; cis-carveol; ethaneperoxoic acid, 1-cyano-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentyl ethaneperoxate; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; (−)-globulol; 2-(4a,8-dimethyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydronaphthalen-2-yl)propan-1-; and longipinocarvone. Among them, many bioactive compounds identified in CLO exhibited antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activities. This finding supports the idea of using
