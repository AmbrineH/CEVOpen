   <italic class="italic">Evaluation of the healing rate of burn wound in experimental mice</italic>. At the beginning of experiment, all burn wounds were of similar sizes in three groups (a, b, c). In day 10, burn wound areas of tamanu oil (e) and essential oil treated mice (f) were smaller than saline treated group (d), and the significant difference of wound contraction between tamanu oil and essential oil treated mice was observed (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we found that burn wounds of essential oil treated mice were fully recovered (i). Burn wound contraction rate of tamanu oil treated mice (h) was significantly higher than that of saline treated groups (g) after 20 days. These results implied that
