 <p> Antimicrobial activity of C. operculatus essential oil. Both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus whereas they did not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. The diameter of inhibition zones against S. aureus of gentamicin (positive control) was highest (11.37 ± 0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03 ± 0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17 ± 0.12 mm). On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (12.07 ± 0.15 mm); both tamanu oil and CLO did not affect the growth of P. aeruginosa. This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment. The experiments were triplicated, and results were presented as mean ± standard deviation. </p>)
