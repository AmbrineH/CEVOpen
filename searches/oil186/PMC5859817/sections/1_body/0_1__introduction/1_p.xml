<p>Burn, one of the most common household injuries, is defined as a type of damage of skin or other tissues caused by exposure to heat, chemicals, electric currents, flame, hot liquid, hot metal or object, steam, radiation from X-ray, sunlight, ultraviolet, and so forth. Among them, the thermal injuries are leading cause of burn (86%), followed by electrical sources (4%) and contacting with chemical sources (3%), and other sources of burns (7%) [

Thermal burn causes not only a small or local injury which can be treated at home or outpatient but also the severe and fatal injuries which require the in-hospital treatment. The World Health Organization estimates that thermal burns account for approximated 6.6 million injuries and 300 thousand deaths annually over the world [

The extent of burn is estimated through total body surface area burn (% TBSA) whereas the depth of burn is estimated by the deep extent of injury into the epidermis or dermis. If the burn extent involves only the epidermis, thus it is classified as superficial burn (first degree). When the burn involves epidermis and dermis, it is categorized as partial thickness burn (second degree). The other burn is full-thickness burn (third degree) which extend into subcutaneous fat or deeper. Thermal burns resulted in both local injuries and a systemic response, in case of severe burn (% TBSA &gt; 20%). Deep and widespread burns may cause many complications such as infection, hypovolemia, hypothermia, blood clotting, scarring, joint mobility problem, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In superficial and partial thickness of burns, topical antibacterial regimes with antibiotic ointments or cream and/or absorbent dressing to cover the burn wound are recommended. Otherwise, in deep partial and full thickness of burns, the surgical excision of damaged tissue and skin grafting are performed to cure the wound.
