 <italic>Cleistocalyx operculatus </italic>(Roxb.) Merr &amp; Perry is a well-known medicinal plant in Asia. It is grown and widely spread in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, and other tropical countries. Leaves and buds are two parts of
 <italic> C. operculatus</italic> commonly used for treating gastrointestinal disorder and dermatophytic infection for many years [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the other beneficial effects of
 <italic> C. operculatus </italic>such as anticancer, antihyperglycemic hypolipidemic, and cardiotonic effects are well documented [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, DÅ©ng et al. (1994) have analyzed the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from
 <italic> Cleistocalyx operculatus</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, Dosoky et al. (2015) proved that essential oil of
 <italic> Cleistocalyx operculatus</italic> leaves possessed a strong antimicrobial effect and cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, application of essential oil isolated from
 <italic> Cleistocalyx operculatus</italic> leaves on wound healing, especially in thermal injury, has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, we investigated the effect of essential oil isolated from
 <italic> Cleistocalyx operculatus</italic> leaves on burn wound model in this study.
