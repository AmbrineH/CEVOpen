<p>Several medical plants exerting antibacterial activity and/or wound healing potential have been applied for treating burn injuries such as
 <italic> Aloe vera</italic>,
 <italic> Achillea millefolium</italic>,
 <italic> Carica papaya</italic>, and
 <italic> Datura alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Herbal preparations may be obtained from a variety of parts of plants (fruit, leaf, bulb, stem, root, pollen, whole plant, and seed) and extraction forms (oil, acetone, methanol, ethanol, hydroalcoholic, and aqueous extract). In Polynesia and Southeast Asia, tamanu oil which is produced from
 <italic> Calophyllum inophyllum </italic>is the well-known and common use product to heal thermal burn wound. Tamanu oil has been proven as promising topical remedy which exerts acceleration of skin healing process, antineuralgic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects [

(2003) suggested that thymus essential oil could reduce NO level induced by burn and enhance the formation of new tissue in burn wound [

 <italic> Nigella sativa </italic>seed oil on burn wound healing process also was proven [

 <italic> Pistacia lentiscus </italic>fruit oil accelerated wound contraction in CO
