<p>Eight-week-old male Swiss albino mice were obtained from Pasteur Institute of Ho Chi Minh City, weighing approximately 30–32 g. The animals were randomly divided into polycarbonate cages with 4 mice for each cage. They were housed under standard husbandry conditions with 12 h light-dark cycle (8:00–20:00) for at least 1 week to acclimate with laboratory environment. They were supplied ad libitum with standard chow and distilled water. The experimental procedure was strictly in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). Briefly, twelve healthy mice were randomly divided into 3 groups with 4 mice per group and treated as the protocol of Tavares Pereira et al. (2012) with some modifications [

The dorsal proximal region was antisepsis with polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine. Thermal lesion was generated by a massive aluminum bar 10 mm in diameter preheated to 100 ± 5°C/10 min. The probe was kept to contact with mouse skin for 15 sec. After that, the burn wound was treated with an indicated volume of saline, tamanu oil, or diluted
