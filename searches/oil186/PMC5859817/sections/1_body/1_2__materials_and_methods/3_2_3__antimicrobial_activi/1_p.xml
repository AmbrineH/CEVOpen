<p>The antimicrobial activity of essential oil was determined by the agar diffusion method. The following bacterial strains
 <italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and
 <italic> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027, which are considered as two common opportunistic bacteria in skin and mucous membrane [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], were employed for screening the antimicrobial activity of
 <italic> C. operculatus </italic>essential oil. Briefly, the tested microorganisms (0.1 ml of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) were inoculated on LB agar. Then the sterilized filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of
 <italic> Cleistocalyx operculatus</italic> essential oil or tamanu oil. The discs were placed in LB agar plates, after which the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The commercial antibiotic discs (Gentamycin, Nam Khoa Biotek Co.) and tamanu oil (Inopilo, Binh Minh Pharmaceutical Joint Co. Ltd.) were used as positive controls. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters.
