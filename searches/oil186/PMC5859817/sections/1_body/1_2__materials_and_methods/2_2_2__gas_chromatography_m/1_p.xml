<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of the essential oil was performed at Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Science, Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City with the given protocol. Briefly, chemical compositions of essential oil were analyzed on a GC-MS Aligent 6890 system equipped with a splitless mode injector and DB–5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, film thickness 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m from Aligent Technologies, USA). The GC injector temperature was set at 250°C. A 1 mL volume of 2,000 ppm oil solution (1 hot water: 10 methanol) was injected. Helium in constant pressure was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The oven initial temperature was maintained 60°C for 1 min and heated at 10°C/min until oven temperature reached 200°C, and the oven was kept in this temperature for 5 min. Then oven was heated at 20°C/min to 280°C and then kept for 1 min. The temperature of transfer line was set at 280°C. For GC-MS analysis, an electron ionization with ionization energy of 1700 eV was used, covering a mass range from 40 to 450 mz. The compounds were identified by NIST MS Search version 2.0.
