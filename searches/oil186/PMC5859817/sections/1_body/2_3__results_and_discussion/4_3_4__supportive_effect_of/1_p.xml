<p>We found that both tamanu oil and essential oil accelerated the wound contraction rate of burn wound after 10 days and 20 days (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). At the beginning of the experiment, all burn wounds were of similar sizes in three groups. In day 10, burn wound areas of tamanu oil and CLO treated mice (0.57 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.03 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, accordingly) were smaller than saline treated group (0.73 ± 0.04 cm
 <sup>2</sup>), and the significant difference of wound contraction between tamanu oil and essential oil treated mice was observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, essential oil group was fully recovered whereas the burn areas of tamanu oil treated and control groups remained after 20 days. Of note, wound healing process of tamanu oil treated mice was also significantly higher than control mice at this time-point (0.22 ± 0.03 versus 0.31 ± 0.02 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively,

 <italic> C. operculatus </italic>essential oil has supportive effect on wound healing process and its efficiency was higher than the commercial tamanu oil (
