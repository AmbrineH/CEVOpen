<p>The second-deep-degree burn is characterized by the extent of injury through the epidermis and into the dermis with painful, red, blistered, moist wound [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To confirm severity of burn wound, the histological examination of burned skin collected from burn lesion was performed with pathological experts from Division of Pathological Anatomy, the Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Centre of Military Hospital 175. Histological analysis showed that injury of burn wound was extended into both epidermis and dermis. In normal skin section, thick squamous epithelium covered the epidermis, and both of epidermis and dermis had the normal structure with several hair follicles and sebaceous glands. In burn wound skin section, epidermis and dermis lost their normal structure. Of note, squamous epithelium layer was removed, and epidermis was necrotized. Moreover, the underlying stromal tissue was swollen and congestive. These results indicated that the second-degree burn model was successfully established in experimental mice (
