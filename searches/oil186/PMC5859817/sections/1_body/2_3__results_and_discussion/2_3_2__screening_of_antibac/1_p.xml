<p class="p">In previous report, Livimbi and Komolafe (2007) suggested that
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> was the most common bacteria isolated from burn wound, followed by
 <italic class="italic"> P. mirabilis, Streptococci </italic>spp.,
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Salmonella</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> Klebsiella </italic>spp. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated antibacterial activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus </italic>essential oil against two bacteria commonly found on burn wound such as
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> to prove the anti-infective efficiency of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus</italic> essential oil (CLO). Furthermore,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> also represent two types of bacteria, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. We found that both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> whereas they did not exhibit antibacterial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The diameter of inhibition zones of gentamicin (positive control) against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> was highest (11.37 ± 0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03 ± 0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17 ± 0.12 mm, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa (</italic>12.07 ± 0.15), but
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </italic>was resistant with commercial tamanu oil and CLO (diameters of inhibition zones = diameter of dishes, 6 mm). These results were identical with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In previous study, Nguyen et al. (2017) suggested that methanol extract of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus</italic> leaves could inhibit
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> but not hinder
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> growth [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus</italic> leaves from Nepal against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> has also been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. However, Dung et al. (2008) indicated that essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus</italic> isolated from flower buds could inhibit both
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. It may be explained that different parts of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus</italic> possess a variety of bioactive compounds which account for different antimicrobial activities of essential oils isolated from different parts of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus.</italic> In addition, although tamanu oil is effective remedy for burn wound treatment,
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> is also resistant with commercial tamanu oil [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. From these results, we suggested that CLO has antimicrobial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>, the most common skin wound opportunistic bacterium, but the effectiveness of CLO is lower than commercial tamanu oil. This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment. Next we investigated the wound contractive ability of
 <italic class="italic"> C. operculatus </italic>essential oil on second-degree burn wound model.
