<p id="Par56">These assays showed that low concentrations of essential oil and extracts of 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> leaves are sufficient to cause an antiproliferative effect on the hFB cell line but do not produce an antimicrobial effect against the microorganisms evaluated in this study, whereby neither of the extracts demonstrated both bioactivities at the same time. However, the ethanolic extract showed potential as a fungistatic agent at low concentrations. These results have also indicated the importance of conducting studies on the effects of natural extracts, which are used in traditional herbal medicine, on proliferation or cytotoxicity using in vitro tests and healthy cell lines.
