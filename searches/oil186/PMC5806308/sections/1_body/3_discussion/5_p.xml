<p id="Par51">The behavior of the ethanolic extract in the MTT assay can be predicted from the MIC test where a fungistatic effect on 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> at a low concentration (5 μL/mL) was observed; this fungus is a microorganism of eukaryote origin as the cell lines that were used in MTT assay. This behavior may be associated with the chemical nature of the extract, specifically a possible synergic effect of its compounds, because this extract has a lower percentage of eugenol, a phenolic compound with high antimicrobial activity and antiproliferative activity on cancer cells. Eugenol has been shown to be a molecule capable of exerting an antiproliferative effect on diverse cancer cells [

 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> extracts, since the aqueous extract exerted this effect at higher concentrations, despite containing a higher content of eugenol than the essential oil and the ethanolic extract [
