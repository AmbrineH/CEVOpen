<p id="Par54">In a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], it was observed that natural compounds with intrinsic reductive potential such as some flavonoids, phytoestrogens and ascorbic acid might lead to false positives in the MTT assay, due to a mechanism of non-enzymatic reduction of the MTT to formazan. Other authors have reported that changes in the metabolism of the cells may induce an increase in the reduction of the MTT to formazan, which has been observed as an increase in the coloration of the reaction, hence in the values of absorbance [
