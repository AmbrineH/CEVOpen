<p id="Par53">In general, in the MTT assay, the antiproliferative effect on the human fibroblast cell line was underestimated when high concentrations of the extracts from 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd were tested. The results also suggest that the measurement of the antiproliferative or proliferative effects of the phytochemicals contained in the extracts may vary between a colorimetric method (MTT assay) and a method that involves the direct counting of viable cells such as the Trypan blue assay. This difference is probably associated with the interaction of diverse chemical components in the extracts (such as the phenolic compounds) with the MTT reagent [
