<p id="Par47">Some studies have reported the antimicrobial activity of essential oil from diverse species of the 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> genus, such as 
 <italic>micranthum</italic> and 
 <italic>basilicum</italic> using the diffusion disc method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In these studies, the essential oil from 
 <italic>micranthum</italic> species showed higher antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (0.069 mg/L) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (0.173 mg/L) than essential oil from the 
 <italic>basilicum</italic> species, however, 
 <italic>basilicum</italic> species showed higher antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (0.057 mg/L) than 
 <italic>micranthum</italic> species (0.104 mg/L). Other authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have reported antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> using the micro-well dilution method, where this extract had a MIC of 250 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, however, activity was not demonstrable against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. These authors also used the diffusion disc method, where the ethanolic extract showed activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (8 mm) and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> at a concentration of 300 μg/disc, but the extract did not show activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic>
