<p id="Par50">The variation of the antimicrobial activity of several species of 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> genus as well as the same 
 <italic>micranthum</italic> species may be attributed to the biochemical properties of the plants that have been influenced by several factors such as the geographical origin, soil, environmental conditions, crop conditions, and seasonal variations. This may also be linked to the difference in the chemical composition, especially the presence of eugenol, since aromatic alcohols are mainly responsible for the antimicrobial activity of essential oils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Some authors have mentioned that the antimicrobial action of essential oil is due to the lipophilic character of its hydrocarbon skeleton and the hydrophilic character of its functional groups; the chemical group with higher antimicrobial activity is phenol, followed by aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, and hydrocarbons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A higher antimicrobial activity has been reported for phenolic compounds such as thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, which is associated with the acidic nature of the hydroxyl group, forming a hydrogen bond with an enzyme active center [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Concerning the volatile compounds in the essential oil from the 
 <italic>micranthum</italic> species, some authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] used the GC-MS analysis to identify majority compounds such as β-caryophyllene (27%), methyl eugenol (14%), eugenol (12%) and in lower percentages, spathulenol (3%) and caryophyllene oxide (3%). Also, the authors identified compounds with antimicrobial activity in the ethanolic extract such as eugenol (18%), β-caryophyllene (6%), benzoic acid (3%), methyl eugenol (2%), dodecanoic acid (2%) and spathulenol (1%). Finally, in the aqueous extract eugenol (59%), 2,2-dimethyl-4-(methylethyl)-2H–imidazole, (4%), phenethyl alcohol (2%), methyl eugenol (2%) and catechol (1%) were identified, compounds that have shown antimicrobial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the present study, the ethanolic extract showed a bacteriostatic effect and a fungistatic effect at lower concentrations than the aqueous extract, despite having the lowest content of eugenol, thus it is possible that the antimicrobial properties of the ethanolic extract may be attributed to a synergic effect between its compounds.
