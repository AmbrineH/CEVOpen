 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These presumptive curative properties may be attributable to secondary metabolites that the plants possess which are distributed in leaves, flowers, stems, seeds or roots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the plants that have been reported to exert these biological activities are those that belong to the family 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> such as 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For other species of the genus 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> such as 
 <italic>sanctum linn</italic>, 
 <italic>gratissimum linn</italic>, 
 <italic>kilimandscharicum</italic> wound healing properties of its crude extracts, and essential oil have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; in the case of the crude extracts of the species 
 <italic>micranthum,</italic> in vitro tests on healthy cell lines that support the therapeutic benefits of these extracts on wound healing and cutaneous infections have yet to be reported. Moreover, studies have not addressed the potential antimicrobial activity of these extracts against pathological microorganisms.
