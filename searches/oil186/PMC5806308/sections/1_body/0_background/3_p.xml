<p id="Par21">The chemical composition of the leaf oil of 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd has been previously reported to comprise volatile compounds such as eugenol, β-elemene, γ-elemene β-caryophyllene, isoeugenol and methyl eugenol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The compounds eugenol and methyl eugenol have also been identified in aqueous and ethanolic extracts of this plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and are phenolic derivatives commonly known for their use in cosmetic products (fragrances) and as flavoring agents in food products; both compounds have shown antiseptic, antibacterial and analgesic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The effects of eugenol on mast cells and melanoma cells have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and due to the broad field of application of this compound, it will be important to know its action on healthy human cells, such as skin cells (fibroblast and keratinocytes) [
