<p id="Par22" class="p">Due to the chemical composition of the essential oil and extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) derived from the 
 <italic class="italic">micranthum</italic> species, its therapeutic use in traditional medicine for the treatment of cutaneous infections and wounds, and since there are no scientific reports that support these bioactivities, the aim of the present study was to assess the essential oil and crude extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of this plant for antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, the proliferative activity was assessed in vitro on a healthy human cell line (hFB) and the CHO-K1 cell line with the purpose of providing evidence (research-based) for its bioactivity and effects on a healthy cell line associated with the process of wound healing.
