<p id="Par34">Trypan blue exclusion assay is a visual method used for the direct counting of viable cells. Therefore, it was chosen to evaluate the proliferative activity of the essential oil and extracts (aqueous and ethanolic) of 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> leaves on hFB cell line and for comparison with a colorimetric method such as MTT. The cells were seeded in a 24 well plate (cell density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and a humidified environment for 24 h. The next day, cells were treated with six different concentrations of each extract for 48 h. The morphological changes of treated and untreated cell line (control) were compared by monitoring, using an inverted microscope Axio Vert 200 (Carl Zeiss). After the morphological assessment, the cell viability was evaluated by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. For this, the cells were rinsed with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1X, Gibco) and trypsinized with 0.50 mL of 0.025% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco). Then, trypsin was neutralized by the addition of 0.50 mL of growth medium. Samples were taken and stained with 0.04% Trypan blue dye solution (Sigma Aldrich). Within two minutes, the cells were loaded in a Neubauer chamber, and the number of viable and non-viable cells in squares with a 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup> area, was counted under a phase contrast microscope. The relative cell proliferation was determined as [no. of viable cells in the cells treated/ no. of viable cells in the cells no treated (control)] × 100.
