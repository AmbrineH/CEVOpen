<p id="Par26">The ethanolic extract was obtained by Soxhlet extraction of ground leaves of 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd, using reagent-grade ethanol (JT Baker) as the solvent. The ethanol was recovered through Büchi rotary evaporator (model R-215) with a vacuum controller (V-850) coupled to a cooling unit. The extract was stored in glass bottles and then filtered through a filtration system comprising a stainless-steel base and a Millipore filter (0.22 μm). Finally, the ethanolic extract was labeled and refrigerated at 4 °C until its analysis.
