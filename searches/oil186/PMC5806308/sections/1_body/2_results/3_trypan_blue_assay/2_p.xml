<p id="Par45">The values of relative cell proliferation percentage of the aqueous extract (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) showed a proliferative effect at concentrations of 0.25% and 0.50% 
 <italic>v</italic>/v in the Trypan blue test, although the MTT test did not show a significant difference compared to the control. However, in both tests there was a tendency of the relative cell proliferation percentage to decrease, starting at a concentration of 2% 
 <italic>v</italic>/v of the extract. The decrease in the values of the relative cell proliferation percentage in the trypan blue assay was higher than in the MTT test.
