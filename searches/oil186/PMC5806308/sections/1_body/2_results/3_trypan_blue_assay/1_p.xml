<p id="Par44">The effect of the extracts on human fibroblasts was also evaluated using Trypan Blue assay. This technique permits the direct count of viable cells through the staining of the cells and microscopic observation. The results of this assay showed a notable difference concerning the MTT test. For example, the essential oil in the trypan blue test (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed a relative cell proliferation less than 80% at all concentrations evaluated, in contrast to the results obtained in the MTT test, where the cell line presented values higher than 80% at all concentrations assayed. In the trypan blue test, all concentrations suggested a significant difference with a notable effect starting from a concentration of 0.0075%.
