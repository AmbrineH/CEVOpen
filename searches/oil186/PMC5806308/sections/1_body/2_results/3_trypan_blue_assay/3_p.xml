<p id="Par46">The values of relative cell proliferation percentage of the ethanolic extract at low concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) showed a similar behavior in both tests (Trypan blue and MTT). A slight significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) proliferative effect concerning the control was observed in the Trypan Blue and MTT tests at concentrations of 0.0075% and 0.015% 
 <italic>v</italic>/v. However, in the Trypan Blue assay the proliferative effect remained until a concentration of 0.06% v/v, while in MTT test a decrease of cell proliferation was observed from this concentration. Finally, when extract concentrations of 0.125% and 0.25% v/v were tested using the trypan blue assay, relative cell proliferation percentage values of 58.71% and 12.26% respectively were obtained, while in the MTT test the values of relative cell proliferation percentage were 82.35% and 77.80% respectively.
