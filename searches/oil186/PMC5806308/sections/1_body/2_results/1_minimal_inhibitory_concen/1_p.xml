<p id="Par36" class="p">The results of the MIC test (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) suggested that the fungi 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> was the most susceptible microorganism to the ethanolic and aqueous extracts. The essential oil exerted the least antimicrobial effect which was indicated through displaying the highest value of MIC in all tested microorganisms. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts showed the same antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> microorganisms with different Gram, and therefore different cell wall chemistry. The positive controls, amikacin, and nystatin showed an antimicrobial effect at 4 mg/L and 2 mg/L respectively, because the wells of the plate, where the antibiotics were deposited with the different microorganisms, did not present a color change when the solution of iodonitrotetrazolium chloride was added during the MIC assay.
