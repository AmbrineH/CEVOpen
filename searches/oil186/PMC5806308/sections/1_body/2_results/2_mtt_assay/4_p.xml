<p id="Par42">The ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> decreased cell proliferation in both cell lines at low concentrations (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the case of the human fibroblast cell line, this decrease was observed at concentrations of 0.06%, 0.125% and 0.25% with relative cell proliferation percentage values of 80.82%, 82.35%, and 77.80% respectively. The CHO-K1 cell line displayed this effect at the same concentrations of extract, but with values of 77.12%, 80.08%, and 57.12% respectively.
