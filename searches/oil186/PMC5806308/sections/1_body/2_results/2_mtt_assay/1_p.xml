<p id="Par39" class="p">The effect of the extracts on cell lines was determined through the calculation of the relative cell proliferation percentage in the MTT assay. The extract concentrations tested were chosen according to the results of the osmolality assay, where the optimum range for testing for cell proliferation is from 230 to 400Â mOsm/kg. The parameter of the pH was also verified, and the optimum range, in this case, is from 6.60 to 7.80 [
