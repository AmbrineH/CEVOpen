 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These assays showed that low concentrations of essential oil and extracts of 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> leaves are sufficient to cause an antiproliferative effect on the hFB cell line but do not produce an antimicrobial effect against the microorganisms evaluated. More studies are necessary to improve understanding of the mechanism of action of the compounds implicated in the bioactivities shown by the crude extracts.
