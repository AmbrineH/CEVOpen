 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the extracts on human fibroblasts was also evaluated using Trypan Blue assay. This technique permits the direct count of viable cells through the staining of the cells and microscopic observation. The results of this assay showed a notable difference concerning the MTT test. For example, the essential oil in the trypan blue test (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) showed a relative cell proliferation less than 80% at all concentrations evaluated, in contrast to the results obtained in the MTT test, where the cell line presented values higher than 80% at all concentrations assayed. In the trypan blue test, all concentrations suggested a significant difference with a notable effect starting from a concentration of 0.0075%.

  <span class="italic">v</span>/v in the Trypan blue test, although the MTT test did not show a significant difference compared to the control. However, in both tests there was a tendency of the relative cell proliferation percentage to decrease, starting at a concentration of 2%

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The values of relative cell proliferation percentage of the ethanolic extract at low concentrations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>) showed a similar behavior in both tests (Trypan blue and MTT). A slight significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) proliferative effect concerning the control was observed in the Trypan Blue and MTT tests at concentrations of 0.0075% and 0.015% 
  <span class="italic">v</span>/v. However, in the Trypan Blue assay the proliferative effect remained until a concentration of 0.06% v/v, while in MTT test a decrease of cell proliferation was observed from this concentration. Finally, when extract concentrations of 0.125% and 0.25% v/v were tested using the trypan blue assay, relative cell proliferation percentage values of 58.71% and 12.26% respectively were obtained, while in the MTT test the values of relative cell proliferation percentage were 82.35% and 77.80% respectively.
