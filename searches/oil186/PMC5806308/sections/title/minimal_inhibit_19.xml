  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) suggested that the fungi 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> was the most susceptible microorganism to the ethanolic and aqueous extracts. The essential oil exerted the least antimicrobial effect which was indicated through displaying the highest value of MIC in all tested microorganisms. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts showed the same antimicrobial effect against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</span> microorganisms with different Gram, and therefore different cell wall chemistry. The positive controls, amikacin, and nystatin showed an antimicrobial effect at 4 mg/L and 2 mg/L respectively, because the wells of the plate, where the antibiotics were deposited with the different microorganisms, did not present a color change when the solution of iodonitrotetrazolium chloride was added during the MIC assay.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil and the extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> leaves showed a bacteriostatic effect against 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. The bacteriostatic effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, at the same concentration, suggests that the chemical composition of the extracts and its mechanism of action had a bacteriostatic effect that was independent of the chemistry of the cell wall of the microorganisms, which in other studies has been reported to be a factor.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of 
  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span>, only the essential oil showed a fungicide effect, since its growth was not observed in the Petri dishes. These results suggest that the essential oil and the extracts of this plant may produce a fungicide or fungistatic effect at low concentrations in comparison with the levels that are necessary to cause a bacteriostatic effect. These last results are relevant since most of studies that have used the microdilution technique to calculate the MIC have not reported complementary tests necessary to verify the bactericide, bacteriostatic, fungicide or fungistatic effects of the extracts.
