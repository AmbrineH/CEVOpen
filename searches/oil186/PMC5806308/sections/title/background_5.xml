 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Mexico, diverse plants have been utilized in traditional medicine in the treatment of several diseases, as well as in the treatment of cuts, cutaneous infections, wounds and burns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. These presumptive curative properties may be attributable to secondary metabolites that the plants possess which are distributed in leaves, flowers, stems, seeds or roots [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Among the plants that have been reported to exert these biological activities are those that belong to the family 
  <span class="italic">Lamiaceae</span> such as 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> Willd [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. For other species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum</span> such as 
  <span class="italic">sanctum linn</span>, 
  <span class="italic">gratissimum linn</span>, 
  <span class="italic">kilimandscharicum</span> wound healing properties of its crude extracts, and essential oil have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]; in the case of the crude extracts of the species 
  <span class="italic">micranthum,</span> in vitro tests on healthy cell lines that support the therapeutic benefits of these extracts on wound healing and cutaneous infections have yet to be reported. Moreover, studies have not addressed the potential antimicrobial activity of these extracts against pathological microorganisms.

  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> Willd is an herbaceous native plant belonging to tropical and subtropical regions of America and the West Indies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. In Mexico, this plant is distributed in the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Colima, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Yucatan [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Previous studies have indicated that the essential oil of this species has activity against human pathogens, fungi, insects, and larvae in addition to its antioxidant, antiprotozoal, anti-inflammatory and contraceptive properties. It is believed that these properties may be related to the presence of diverse chemical compounds in the leaves of this plant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical composition of the leaf oil of 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</span> Willd has been previously reported to comprise volatile compounds such as eugenol, β-elemene, γ-elemene β-caryophyllene, isoeugenol and methyl eugenol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. The compounds eugenol and methyl eugenol have also been identified in aqueous and ethanolic extracts of this plant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] and are phenolic derivatives commonly known for their use in cosmetic products (fragrances) and as flavoring agents in food products; both compounds have shown antiseptic, antibacterial and analgesic properties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The effects of eugenol on mast cells and melanoma cells have been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] and due to the broad field of application of this compound, it will be important to know its action on healthy human cells, such as skin cells (fibroblast and keratinocytes) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the chemical composition of the essential oil and extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) derived from the 
  <span class="italic">micranthum</span> species, its therapeutic use in traditional medicine for the treatment of cutaneous infections and wounds, and since there are no scientific reports that support these bioactivities, the aim of the present study was to assess the essential oil and crude extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of this plant for antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, the proliferative activity was assessed in vitro on a healthy human cell line (hFB) and the CHO-K1 cell line with the purpose of providing evidence (research-based) for its bioactivity and effects on a healthy cell line associated with the process of wound healing.
