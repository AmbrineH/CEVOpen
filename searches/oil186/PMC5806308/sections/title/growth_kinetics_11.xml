  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], a wavelength of 590 nm was used. The absorbance values of this test were correlated with the absorbance values from the growth kinetics of each microorganism tested. This correlation was used to calculate the time taken by each microorganism to reach the exponential phase and the concentration of microorganism necessary to carry out the microdilution test. The value recorded in the present study was 0.50 on the McFarland scale which is equivalent to 1.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/mL. In the growth kinetics, a pre-inoculum of each microorganism was incubated for 20–21 h at 35 °C in agitation. The culture medium used for this purpose were brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for 
  <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. subtilis</span>, nutritive broth (
  <span class="italic">P. aeruginosa</span>) and sabouraud broth (
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span>). The absorbance was measured every 2 h during a period of 16 h using a spectrophotometer model GENESYS 20 (®Thermo Scientific) at a wavelength of 590 nm.
