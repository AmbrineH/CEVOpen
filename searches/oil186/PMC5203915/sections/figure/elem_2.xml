  <p>The effect of

   <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span>) in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. mRNA expression levels were measured by RT-PCR analysis. Astrocytes were incubated for 24 h with 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL of HR or SGR essential oils and LPS (1 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL). (a) The bar graph shows the relative density. The data is represented as means ± SD of three independent experiments.
