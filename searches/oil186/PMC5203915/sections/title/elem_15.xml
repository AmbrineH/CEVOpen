  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Qualitative and Quantitative Differences in Composition of Essential Oils from
   <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> Hairy Roots and Roots of Soil-Grown Plants
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil yields of
   <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> hairy roots (HR) and root of soil-grown plants (SGR) were 0.09% and 0.06% (dry weight, v/w), respectively. The essential oils were dark yellow.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparative analysis of essential oils from roots of soil-grown plants and hairy roots by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated that the chemical profiles of both essential oils were different. 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1"> Table 1</a> presents the chemical constituents of essential oils with their relative percentage amounts and retention indices. In the SGR essential oil, 41 compounds were identified, representing 89.7% of the total oil while 44 compounds were detected in the HR essential oils, amounting to 81.9% of the total identified components (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sesquiterpenes, especially sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.7–62.2%), dominated in both essential oils (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). However, in SGR essential oil, aplotaxene (
   <span class="italic">all</span>-
   <span class="italic">cis</span>-heptadeca-1,8,11,14-tetraene) was the main constituent (27.3%). Among the sesquiterpenes, nardosina-1(10),11-diene was identified as the most dominant compound (20.7%) in this essential oil according to its mass spectrum and retention index [
   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The second significant sesquiterpene was dauca-4(11),8-diene (10.2%) whose MS was identical with literature data, and its RI on the Rtx-1 column differed from the RI available on DB-5 column [
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. In addition, petasitene (4.3%) and
   <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
   <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene (4.2%) were presented in appreciable amounts in SGR essential oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HR essential oil was characterized by the high quantities of cyperene (18.2%), 13-norcypera-1(5,11(12)-diene (15.3%), and cadalene (7.2%) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The concentrations of these components were significantly higher (7-, 11-, and 12-fold, resp.) than those in the SGR essential oil (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). Additionally, the other major constituent of HR essential oil was 2,5,8-trimethyl-1-naphthol (9.6%) which was identified on the basis of MS (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>); however, this compound has not yet been found in nature and was probably an artifact. The major compounds identified in SGR essential oil such as nardosina-1(10),11-diene and dauca-4(11),8-diene, petasitene, and
   <span class="italic"> trans</span>-
   <span class="italic">α</span>-bergamotene were not detected in the HR essential oil, and aplotaxene was presented only in traces (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HR and SGR essential oils were poor in monoterpenes, both hydrocarbons (0.7–1.6%) and oxygenated (0–2.1%) compounds.</p>

   <span class="italic"> R. carthamoides</span> HR and SGR Essential Oils against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria Than against Yeasts
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), and the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of HR and SGR essential oils were investigated against the Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. It was found that both essential oils showed similar properties. The essential oils showed stronger antibacterial (MIC = 125–250 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) than antifungal activity (MIC = 625–1250 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The highest antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 125 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL was observed against
   <span class="italic"> Enterococcus faecalis</span> and
   <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. No significant difference in susceptibility was found between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). In order to address the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the samples, the MBC values were also evaluated. The MBC values are no more than four times the MIC values observed (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study we also evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of HR and SGR essential oils in LPS-treated astrocytes. The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in astrocytes incubated for 24 h with HR and SGR essential oils (25, 50, and 100 
   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL) and LPS (1

   <span class="italic">α</span> but not IL-10, IL-8, or GM-CSF (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). In addition, the expression levels of IL-1
   <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-

   <span class="italic">μ</span>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). A single concentration of essential oils known to be the most effective for reducing of the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as determined by an ELISA, was used in this experiment. RT-PCR analyses showed also that treatment with HR and SGR essential oils resulted in the downregulation of IL-1
   <span class="italic">β</span>, IL-6, and TNF-
   <span class="italic">α</span> mRNA expression in LPS-induced astrocytes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). No change was observed in the mRNA expression of IL-10, IL-8, and GM-CSF in comparison with astrocytes treated with only LPS.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were assessed by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence measurements. Astrocytes were treated with LPS (1
