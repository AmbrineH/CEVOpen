<p class="p">There are few limitations associated with this study. Only five databases limited to USA and Canada were evaluated. Each section in the model was not weighted and that could potentially influence interpretation of results. It is also possible that we missed some data elements, not presented in these five databases. More granular analyses are needed for data sections as name categories, dose administration routes, dose forms etc. This research study is an initial step towards the development of more formal DS terminology/ontology model that could represent DS related information in more accurate and consistent format, similar to their drug counter parts. The knowledge gained here will promote informatics research in DS, such as information extraction and knowledge discovery of safety on DS. Other information, such as safety information, is largely stored in unstructured format in various data sources, which would prove difficulties to support clinical research in dietary supplement. Further efforts, such as extraction of structured information in standardized format from texts in resources, are required.</p>
