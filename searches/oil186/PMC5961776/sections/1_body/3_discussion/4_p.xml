<p>Quantitative analysis (
 <xref rid="t4-2840637" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) showed fragmentary coverage of data elements across five databases, NM having most comprehensive coverage (7/8 sections), while DSID the least (2/8 sections). High percentage of data elements coverage (89%-100%) was observed within each database, thus making it possible to collect DS representation information from these databases. We found some unique data elements usually not seen in drug databases, such as source (animal or plant) and origin (Asia or North America), which can affect the functions of DS, e.g., American Ginseng vs. Korean Ginseng.
