<p class="p">Lack of a comprehensive DS knowledge representation has restricted research on their safety and efficacy. In our previous DS study, we identified mutual ingredients coverage for over the counter medicines and DS across several databases, despite them falling under different regulations and having different representations. In this study, we evaluated and compared five databases limited to DS only (both ingredient and product levels), by cross checking them against a preliminary, standardized set of data elements. This set of data elements entails information deemed essential to comprehensively represent DS. While, we found fragmented and inconsistent DS representations across these five databases (
 <xref rid="t3-2840637" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), high DS coverage (89%-100%) was discovered for each data element within a database (
 <xref rid="t4-2840637" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The knowledge gained from this effort could be used as a platform to develop a more structured and comprehensives DS terminology/ontology system that could represent DS related information in a more accurate and consistent format, similar to their drug counter parts.
