<p>For the quantitative evaluation, facets were first mapped to the data elements in 
 <xref rid="t1-2840637" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> by a physician and health informaticist (RR). A coverage analysis was performed (JV) over the mapped facets, shown as the percentage of database entries having a non-null value. We use this evaluation to estimate the completeness of values for each data element for ingredients and products within each of these databases. Multiple facets in the source databases often map to a single data element in our schema. A given DS was considered to have data for a given ontology attribute if one or more of the corresponding facets in its source database was non-null.
