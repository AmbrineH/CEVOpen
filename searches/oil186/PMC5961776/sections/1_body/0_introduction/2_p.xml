<p>Most people consider DS as safe and usually take them without consulting with healthcare providers. However, there is increasing evidence that DS could interact with prescription medicine and also cause serious adverse events. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 23,000 annual emergency visits were related to DS in US

 </sup>. Unlike prescription and over-the-counter medicines, DS are regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)

 </sup> and unlike drugs, clinical trials on DS safety and efficacy before getting marketed are not required. In addition, it is voluntary for healthcare providers to report only serious adverse events, including hospitalization, disability, and death, related to DS in the post-market surveillance. Current safety documentation for DS is very limited as most available information is based either on pharmacologic research, animal models or pharmaco-epidemiologic studies that often solely focus on a small set of drugs or supplements. These have greatly limited our ability to build up our knowledge on safety of DS.
