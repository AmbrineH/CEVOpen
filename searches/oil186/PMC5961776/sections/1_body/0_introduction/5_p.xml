<p>Current DS resources have term coverage at different levels of granularity (i.e., ingredient and/or product level), and are employed for various purposes by a wide range of users (e.g., pharmacist, physicians, manufacturers, etc.) The knowledge representation within these resources ranges from unstructured and fragmented to structured and comprehensive evidence based data having full monographs/controlled vocabularies and to the most structured and robust standardized terminologies. By definition, “monograph” is a document having detailed information on a concept while “controlled vocabularies” are the list of standardized terms employed for indexing and searching information for a particular concept while. Even within these terminological systems, variability exists in term as well as content coverage (related metadata coverage for each DS e.g., product name, active ingredient(s), drug strength and unit of measure, dosage form)
