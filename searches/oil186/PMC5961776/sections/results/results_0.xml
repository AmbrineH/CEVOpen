 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two levels of DS representation are given: (i) ingredient level (i.e., NM, DSID and NHPID) and (ii) product level (i.e., DSLD and LNHPD). The content under each database was assembled as either structured, controlled vocabulary, and/or descriptive monographs (
  <a rid="t2-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t2-2840637">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the five databases, employing the data element model as a check-list, showed a fragmented and inconsistent distribution of DS representation with variability in data elements distribution and as well as in the underlying content (
  <a rid="t3-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t3-2840637">Table 3</a>), e.g., mechanism of action (only present in NM monographs), scientific name referring to Latin names (NM), or adverse reactions (NHPID, LNHPD) and adverse effects (NM) being used interchangeably.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the quantitative analysis at the level of sections showed inconsistent distribution of data elements across databases, there was high coverage (89%-100%) observed for each section within each database (
  <a rid="t4-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t4-2840637">Table 4</a>). Since we did not normalize the ingredients, there exist some redundant instances.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two representative examples, Ginseng and Fish oil, were fit to the model in order to check the modelâ€™s completeness and representative power. Data was obtained from various database in order to comprehensively represent the examples as shown in 
  <a rid="t5-2840637" ref-type="table" href="#t5-2840637">Table 5</a>.
