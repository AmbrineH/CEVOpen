 <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (4 weeks) were donated by Otago Locusts, Dunedin, NZ. The locusts were reared in large plastic containers at a constant ambient temperature and light source. The feed consisted of oat grass and ground oats. Live locusts were hand harvested into small containers and placed into a −18 °C freezer overnight. Whole samples were freeze-dried (Freezezone 12 Plus, Labconco, Kansas, MO, USA) and ground to produce locust meal (LM). Defatted locust meal (DLM) was prepared by dispersing LM in hexane (1:5,

 <italic>v</italic>) and stirred for three hours using a magnetic stirrer (S-12BB, Jeio Tech Ltd., Seoul, South Korea), with renewal of hexane every hour. The mixture was filtered thrice, and dried in a fume hood to remove any remaining organic solvent. LM and DLM were stored in a desiccator at room temperature until analysis. General chemical materials used in the study were analytical grade and acquired from Thermo Fisher, Sciresby, VIC, Australia.
