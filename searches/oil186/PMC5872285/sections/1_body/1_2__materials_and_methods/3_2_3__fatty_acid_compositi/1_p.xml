<p class="p">FA composition was determined from fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), prepared following a modified method of Van Wijngaarden [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Locust oil (20 mg) and internal standard (C17:0; 10 mg/mL) was mixed with methanolic KOH and heated for 20 min at 80 °C in a heating block (Grant BT3, Grant Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, UK). After addition of diethyl ether (2 mL) and water (5 mL), the bottom layer was acidified using HCl (36.5–38%) and a further aliquot of diethyl ether (2 mL) was added. The diethyl ether upper phase was added into boron triflouride-methanol solution (2 mL; BF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> 14% in methanol, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.,St Louis, MO, USA) and again heated for 20 min at 80 °C. After addition of saturated NaCl (5 mL) the FAME upper layer was collected and analysed using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (Agilent 6890N GC with an Agilent 7683 series auto sampler; Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Sample (1 μL) was injected in a split mode of 20:1. Hydrogen, with a flow rate of 2.2 mL/min was used as the carrier gas, and separation was achieved using SGE BPX-70 column (50 m × 0.32 mm ID × 0.25 μm films; SGE, Melbourne, Australia). The column oven increased from 120 °C to 225 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, then increased 10 °C/min to reach a final temperature of 245 °C, with a hold of 2 min, reaching a max temp of 270 °C (total run time 39 min). The injector and flame ionisation detector were 240 °C and 250 °C respectively. The FA were identified using the FAME reference standard (FAMQ-005, Accustandard Inc., New Haven, CT, USA). Duplicates of three crude oil samples were conducted.
