Consequently, the grass and ground oat diet of the locusts in the current study would have impacted the protein and fat content found. Furthermore, the locusts were constantly active due to a constant artificial light source, and were domestically reared in incubated plastic boxes. This could alter the fat content identified, compared to literature that sourced insects from the wild [
