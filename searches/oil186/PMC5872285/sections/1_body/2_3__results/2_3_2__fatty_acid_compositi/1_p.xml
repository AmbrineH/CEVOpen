<p>When investigating nutritional benefits, locusts also contain appreciable amounts of essential fatty acids known for their health benefits. The FA composition of crude locust oil from

 <xref rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Ramos-Bueno et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have investigated 
 <italic>L. migratoria</italic>. As a general trend, data was consistent with findings, with some differences in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents identified. Oleic acid is the most abundant FA documented in migratory species, followed by palmitic acid, leading to reasonably similar overall SFA and MUFA contents. Î±-linolenic acid (omega-3) content (15.7%) in the present study was within the range identified in literature (13.9% to 16.2%). However, Osimani et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found significantly lower content (3%) in whole dried locusts sourced from Netherlands, which consequently leads to a large variation in overall PUFA content of 
 <italic>L. migratoria</italic> generally found in literature (12.5% to 32.3%). Moreover, linoleic acid (omega-6) in the present study was also within the range of 5.2% to 18.3% [
