 <italic class="italic">L. migratoria</italic>. As a general trend, data was consistent with findings, with some differences in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents identified. Oleic acid is the most abundant FA documented in migratory species, followed by palmitic acid, leading to reasonably similar overall SFA and MUFA contents. Î±-linolenic acid (omega-3) content (15.7%) in the present study was within the range identified in literature (13.9% to 16.2%). However, Osimani et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] found significantly lower content (3%) in whole dried locusts sourced from Netherlands, which consequently leads to a large variation in overall PUFA content of
