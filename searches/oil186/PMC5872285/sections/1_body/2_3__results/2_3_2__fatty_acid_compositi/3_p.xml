<p>Subsequently, the diet of locusts can be advantageously designed to optimise the omega-3 and PUFA content in order to produce a healthy lipid source. Still, locusts from the present study provided desirably low SFA/UFA and n−6/n−3 ratios of 0.58 and 0.55, respectively. The recommended n−6/n−3 ratio is around one, which is far from reach for many Western consumers who consume too much omega-6 in their diets, leading to ratios above 15/1 [

High omega-6 consumption in vegetable oils and grains for example, has been linked to various health diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Greater consumption of omega-3 rich lipids and food sources that have lower n−6/n−3 ratios can help reduce risk of these chronic diseases [

Lipid extraction is often a by-product of protein extraction making locust oil a sustainable and healthy alternative lipid and food source. In another study conducted by the researcher, consumer acceptance of locust oil was explored through focus group discussions. It found the omega-3 content, as well as the sustainability or novelty of locust oil is an attractive feature for some participants, indicating these features should be appropriately marketed and explored in order to improve acceptance.
