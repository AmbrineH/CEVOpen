<p>The protein recovery of each fraction is expressed as a percentage compared to the initial protein content of the sample (DLM). The total protein yield (101.66%), ILF yield, and ILF protein recovery was similar to other literature investigating various insects [

 <xref rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the low SLF (9.83%) and high SF yield (56.60%) was unexpected. Purschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] identified a protein recovery of 51.7% of migratory locust protein concentrate after solubilisation at pH 9. Other insect studies documented soluble yields ranging from 22% to 46% [

 <xref rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and supernatant protein yields between 17% and 23% [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Experimental conditions in the present study could have impacted findings. The soluble proteins may not have aggregated efficiently at pH 4, causing a large proportion to remain in the supernatant fraction, leading to a higher SF yield and protein percentage. pH 4 was used to precipitate the soluble locust protein following Bußler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] methodology on five different insects. Purschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] later identified pH 4 as the isoelectric point for enzymatic hydrolysed migratory locust protein. pH 10 was used to solubilise the proteins following the method by Tirgar et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and pH used by Bußler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, Purschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] identified the minimum solubility at pH 5 and maximum at pH 9. Therefore the pH used based on other insect species by Bußler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] may not have been the optimal pH. Furthermore, other experimental conditions such as NaOH concentration, pH, temperature, run time, and water to sample ratio are known to have an effect on protein yields, possibly affecting the results found in the present study [
