<p>Yield and protein recovery of the three fractions, plus the protein content of LM and extracted fractions are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t003">Table 3</xref>. The protein contents of the three fractions were not significantly different to each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.073). After processing, their combined average protein content (73.6%) was 23.8% higher than the LM, illustrating significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) protein content than whole locusts.
