<p>Similar to the current findings, Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Purschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found protein content to 82% for yellow mealworm and migratory locust. Alternatively, research investigating other insect species found slightly lower values ranging from 65–75% for insoluble, 58–69% for soluble, and 50–61% for supernatant fractions [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Chitin and chitin-bound protein that is consequently indigestible, are likely to contribute to the protein content found in ILF [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although not the focus of the current study, this can lead to lower digestibility compared to supernatant and pellet (soluble) fractions, as documented by Yi et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
