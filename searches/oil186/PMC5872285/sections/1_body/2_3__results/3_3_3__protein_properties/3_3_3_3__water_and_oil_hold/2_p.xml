<p>The ability to hold water against gravity is an important application in certain food areas. The water includes bound, hydrodynamic, capillary and physically entrapped water [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The ability to hold this water is dependent on many factors such as the amino acids, charges, conformation, and hydrophobicity of the protein, pH, temperature, ionic strength and protein concentration [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The reason for the high WHC of the insoluble locust fraction is unknown. The porous structure or large particle size, due to absence of sieving during preparation, could have caused greater entrapment of water into the particle domains. Furthermore, larger particle size has been linked to higher contents of chitin, as found in

 <xref rid="B40-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which could additionally entrap the water into the ILF matrix, creating the high WHC result found. Ability of locust fractions to hold water illustrates protein-water interactions and can be used to interpret other functional properties such as solubility, emulsification, viscosity, gelation, and foaming [
