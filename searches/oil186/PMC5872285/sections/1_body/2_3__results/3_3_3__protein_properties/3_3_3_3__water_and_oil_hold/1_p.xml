<p>The water (WHC) and oil holding capacity (OHC) is expressed as the amount of water or oil (mL) that can be held per gram of sample. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00020-f002">Figure 2</xref>, WHO and OHC values of LM, DLM and SLF were not significantly different to one another, as well as other insect species investigated [

 <xref rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Unexpectedly, the ILF had significantly higher (
