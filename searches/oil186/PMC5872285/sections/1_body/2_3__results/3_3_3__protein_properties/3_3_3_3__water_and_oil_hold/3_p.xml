<p class="p">The high ILF OHC result is also inconsistent with the literature. Contradicting the current results, Bu√üler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] found fat binding capacity (g/g) was significantly higher in the soluble and lower in insoluble fractions of yellow mealworms. The current findings could again be due to the larger particle size and porous structure, causing physical entrapment of oil [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Additionally, higher OHC is linked to non-polar side chains in the protein structure, which was not investigated in the current study. Research on this is limited and further information on the water and oil holding capacity of protein extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">L. migratoria</italic> and insects in general is needed. Nevertheless, the WHC and OHC findings indicate the possible food applications of each fraction.
