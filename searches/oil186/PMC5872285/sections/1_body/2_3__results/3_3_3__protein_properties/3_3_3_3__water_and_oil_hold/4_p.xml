<p>In another consumer study conducted by the researcher, it asked thirty-five participants to design an ideal hypothetical solid and liquid food product containing the ILF and SLF fractions. Participants who were open to trying new or novel foods were screened prior to investigation in order to gain insights from potential end consumers. The liquid product designs (containing soluble locust fraction) designed by participants included chocolate flavoured health drinks, protein powders, an ice cream, and a coconut yoghurt product. Solid food products (containing insoluble locust fraction) included protein packed breadcrumbs, muesli bars, cereals, bread, cookies and a nut substitute. The majority of these products were designed as a healthy, convenient, and eco-friendly snack or breakfast for active consumers or children. These results indicate the exciting future of whole or extracted locust protein as a value-added ingredient.</p>
