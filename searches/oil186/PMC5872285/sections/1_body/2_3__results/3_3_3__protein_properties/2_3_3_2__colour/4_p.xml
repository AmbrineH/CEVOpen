<p>Furthermore, ILF also had much lower a* value (1.67) compared to all other samples, indicating greater green colouration. Consequently, ILF also had a higher overall colour change (∆E 23.44) compared to SLF and SF, and much higher than insoluble yellow mealworm colour change (∆E 9.1) identified by Bußler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The green colouration could be due to a common green pigment identified in insects called insectoverdin. It is a mixture of two chromoproteins, one yellow component from carotenoids and the other a bile component (blue) creating the green colour in locusts [
