<p class="p">To the authors knowledge no other literature has investigated 
 <italic class="italic">L. migratoria</italic> protein isolate colouration. Overall, the locust fractions were darker compared to 
 <italic class="italic">A. domesticus</italic> (house cricket) aqueous extracted fractions (L* 58.53–65.50) investigated by Ndiritu et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The same study also found no difference between fractions, unlike Bußler et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] that identified lighter insoluble samples, similar to current findings.
