<p>Furthermore, extracting the protein from insects has been suggested as a worthwhile practice [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Not only does it increase the protein content (per 100 g) and digestibility for certain fractions [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it can overcome initial consumer acceptance barriers. Many studies have found consumers are more willing to eat insects when they cannot be seen [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], illustrating opportunities as an value-added ingredient as opposed to a whole insect. Protein extraction is usually carried out via aqueous or alkali isoelectric precipitation, in which different pH, temperature, and physical separation (centrifugation) methods are used to separate different fractions [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These fractions include a layer comprising of water insoluble proteins and other constituents, and a layer of protein water soluble proteins. Each fraction is different in terms of yield, chemical composition, digestibility, colour, and functionality. Consequently, insoluble and soluble proteins have different potential applications as an ingredient. To the authors knowledge, only a small number of studies have explored any of these parameters, which include analysis of house crickets
