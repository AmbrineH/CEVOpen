 <xref rid="B3-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Locusts have short life cycles in which adulthood can be reached at four to eight weeks depending on rearing conditions. They can also increase their numbers 10 to 16-fold between each generation, illustrating the rapid and efficient domestic rearing prospects [

The cold-blooded insects obtain moisture from their food decreasing water requirements, and along with the high feed conversion efficiency, insects resource requirements are lower compared to other traditional livestock such as beef [
