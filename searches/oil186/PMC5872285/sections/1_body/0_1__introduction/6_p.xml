<p>Presently, there are only a few commercial insect products sold on the Western market, which include ground insect flour (often cricket), sold on its own or incorporated into bars, chips, protein powders, cookies and even pasta. Locusts are less popular and very few products have utilised extracted insect protein as an ingredient. Even with the promising potential of locusts as an alternative food or protein source, consumers must first be accepting of the idea. Entomophagy is practiced by over two billion people in mostly African, Asian, and Latin American societies [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, in areas where they are not traditionally consumed, such as Western culture, eating insects is met with great resistance, surfacing feelings of disgust and fear [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Enculturation of viewing animal products as a protein and fat source, and viewing insects as a pest that people try to avoid, has caused avoidance of novel insect products, also known as food neophobia. In order to successfully introduce locust products, greater understanding of the locust protein properties could help the limited research and industrial product development, in the hope to improve adoption in the future. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the proximate and fatty acid composition of the adult migratory locusts (
