<p class="p">Locusts are beneficial in terms of their sustainable production and nutrition. Significantly lower amounts of land, water, and feed is needed to rear edible insects compared to other livestock. Additionally, locusts contain high amounts of protein, fat, and essential fatty acids which is impacted by diet, age, habitat, and processing method. Future research investigating how the composition changes at different life stages (nymph vs adult), diets, and seasons would indicate how to optimize locust composition depending on their anticipated end use. Protein extraction after defatting and subsequent processing methods, can improve the protein content, increase water and oil holding capacity for insoluble protein fractions, and decrease the dark brown coloration of whole locusts. The insoluble fractions could be used in a variety of solid products, whereas soluble and supernatant fractions are water soluble, therefore venture into the liquid food and drink market is possible. However, the low yield and replication number in the current study warrants further investigation concerning what experimental conditions or methods would be more efficient, economical and sustainable for upscale. The use of water, solvents, and energy to produce the protein fractions does impact the initial sustainable rearing advantages. Aqueous fat extraction could be researched as a “greener” method for defatting. Moreover, information concerning the solubility, emulsification, digestibility, and amino acid profile will also enable a greater understanding of the fraction’s properties and how they can be extracted and developed to be used as food ingredients. Furthermore, locust oil is a by-product of protein extraction, and with low omega-6/omega-3 and SFA/UFA ratios, it has the potential to become a sustainable and healthy alternative lipid source. With so many potential applications, locusts are an economically and environmentally beneficial venture for the future.</p>
