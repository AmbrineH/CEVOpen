 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The colour of the various fractions can impact the consumer perceptions and acceptance when it is used in products, so is important to consider before product development. The colour of each fraction and LM are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t004" href="#insects-09-00020-t004">Table 4</a>. Processing of the LM did affect the appearance of the three fractions for L*, a*, b* and ∆E values (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.000). SF was the lightest sample, followed by ILF, SLF, and finally LM was the darkest.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the authors knowledge no other literature has investigated 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> protein isolate colouration. Overall, the locust fractions were darker compared to 
  <span class="italic">A. domesticus</span> (house cricket) aqueous extracted fractions (L* 58.53–65.50) investigated by Ndiritu et al. [
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>]. The same study also found no difference between fractions, unlike Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] that identified lighter insoluble samples, similar to current findings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extracted fractions were slightly more yellow compared to the LM. The brown and yellow colour could be due to lipophilic melanoidins, which during defatting and consequent protein extractions may be removed, creating higher a* and L* values [
  <a rid="B37-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-insects-09-00020">37</a>]. This idea is consistent with other studies, that found a lighter defatted sample compared to whole and extracted fractions [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>,
  <a rid="B38-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-insects-09-00020">38</a>]. Colour change could also be attributed to enzymatic browning as a result of processing conditions such as extraction at certain pH values degrading proteins producing brown pigmentation [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>,
  <a rid="B38-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-insects-09-00020">38</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, ILF also had much lower a* value (1.67) compared to all other samples, indicating greater green colouration. Consequently, ILF also had a higher overall colour change (∆E 23.44) compared to SLF and SF, and much higher than insoluble yellow mealworm colour change (∆E 9.1) identified by Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. The green colouration could be due to a common green pigment identified in insects called insectoverdin. It is a mixture of two chromoproteins, one yellow component from carotenoids and the other a bile component (blue) creating the green colour in locusts [
  <a rid="B39-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-insects-09-00020">39</a>]. However, pigmentation in insect changes depending on species, life stage, and habitat therefore differences in colour is expected [
