  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whole adult 
   <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span> (4 weeks) were donated by Otago Locusts, Dunedin, NZ. The locusts were reared in large plastic containers at a constant ambient temperature and light source. The feed consisted of oat grass and ground oats. Live locusts were hand harvested into small containers and placed into a −18 °C freezer overnight. Whole samples were freeze-dried (Freezezone 12 Plus, Labconco, Kansas, MO, USA) and ground to produce locust meal (LM). Defatted locust meal (DLM) was prepared by dispersing LM in hexane (1:5, 
   <span class="italic">w</span>/
   <span class="italic">v</span>) and stirred for three hours using a magnetic stirrer (S-12BB, Jeio Tech Ltd., Seoul, South Korea), with renewal of hexane every hour. The mixture was filtered thrice, and dried in a fume hood to remove any remaining organic solvent. LM and DLM were stored in a desiccator at room temperature until analysis. General chemical materials used in the study were analytical grade and acquired from Thermo Fisher, Sciresby, VIC, Australia.

   <a rid="B25-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-insects-09-00020">25</a>]. Moisture was calculated on a weight basis after freeze-drying whole locust for seven days. Crude fat was extracted from LM (2 g) for 1.5 h in Soxhlet apparatus, using hexane. Fat content was determined gravimetrically after the solvent was evaporated off using a Rotary evaporator (Rotovapor-R, Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) and a room temperature water bath (Watson Victor Ltd., Buchi 461 Water Bath, Auckland, New Zealand). Crude protein was determined using the Kjeldahl method (Tecator Digestion System 1007 Digester; Kjeltec System 1002 Distilling Unit, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia), with a 6.25 N conversion factor. Ash content was found gravimetrically after drying the sample in a muffle furnace (McGregor, Interlab, Wellington, New Zealand) at 600 °C for eight hours. Carbohydrates were determined by difference. Analysis was carried out in triplicate.

   <a rid="B26-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-insects-09-00020">26</a>]. Locust oil (20 mg) and internal standard (C17:0; 10 mg/mL) was mixed with methanolic KOH and heated for 20 min at 80 °C in a heating block (Grant BT3, Grant Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, UK). After addition of diethyl ether (2 mL) and water (5 mL), the bottom layer was acidified using HCl (36.5–38%) and a further aliquot of diethyl ether (2 mL) was added. The diethyl ether upper phase was added into boron triflouride-methanol solution (2 mL; BF
   <sub>3</sub> 14% in methanol, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.,St Louis, MO, USA) and again heated for 20 min at 80 °C. After addition of saturated NaCl (5 mL) the FAME upper layer was collected and analysed using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (Agilent 6890N GC with an Agilent 7683 series auto sampler; Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Sample (1 μL) was injected in a split mode of 20:1. Hydrogen, with a flow rate of 2.2 mL/min was used as the carrier gas, and separation was achieved using SGE BPX-70 column (50 m × 0.32 mm ID × 0.25 μm films; SGE, Melbourne, Australia). The column oven increased from 120 °C to 225 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, then increased 10 °C/min to reach a final temperature of 245 °C, with a hold of 2 min, reaching a max temp of 270 °C (total run time 39 min). The injector and flame ionisation detector were 240 °C and 250 °C respectively. The FA were identified using the FAME reference standard (FAMQ-005, Accustandard Inc., New Haven, CT, USA). Duplicates of three crude oil samples were conducted.

The supernatant’s pH was adjusted to 4.0 using 1 M HCl and stirred at 900 rpm for 1 h. pH 4 and 10 were chosen following similar methods conducted by Bußler et al. [
   <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. After centrifugation at the same conditions as above, the residual precipitated protein was re-suspended twice in acidified water (pH 4) and centrifuged at similar conditions for 30 min. This formed two fractions; precipitated locust protein referred to as soluble locust fraction (SLF) and the supernatant fraction (SF). SLF was adjusted to pH 7 using 1 M NaOH. The resulting three fractions; ILF, SLF and SF, were freeze dried and stored in a desiccator at room temperature for further analysis. Protein and fat contents were identified using the same methods as proximate analysis. Yield of each fraction is based on dry weight basis compared to total initial weight. Results are also presented as a percentage of protein recovery in which the protein content of each fraction is divided by the initial total protein content of the sample tested (after defatting).
