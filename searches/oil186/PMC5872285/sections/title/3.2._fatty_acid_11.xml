 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When investigating nutritional benefits, locusts also contain appreciable amounts of essential fatty acids known for their health benefits. The FA composition of crude locust oil from 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t002" href="#insects-09-00020-t002">Table 2</a>. The chain lengths ranged from 14 to 18 carbons. To the authors knowledge, only Mohamed [

  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] and Ramos-Bueno et al. [
  <a rid="B32-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-insects-09-00020">32</a>] have investigated 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span>. As a general trend, data was consistent with findings, with some differences in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents identified. Oleic acid is the most abundant FA documented in migratory species, followed by palmitic acid, leading to reasonably similar overall SFA and MUFA contents. α-linolenic acid (omega-3) content (15.7%) in the present study was within the range identified in literature (13.9% to 16.2%). However, Osimani et al. [
  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] found significantly lower content (3%) in whole dried locusts sourced from Netherlands, which consequently leads to a large variation in overall PUFA content of 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> generally found in literature (12.5% to 32.3%). Moreover, linoleic acid (omega-6) in the present study was also within the range of 5.2% to 18.3% [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many variables influence the FA composition of locusts. For example, the study conducted by Osimani et al. [
  <a rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-insects-09-00020">8</a>] found large differences in SFA and PUFA contents of whole dried locusts samples sourced from either Belgium or the Netherlands. The FA composition of locusts or other insect species is significantly influenced by their diet. Insects that consume grass or plants containing high PUFA are linked to high α-linolenic acid content in the FA composition [
  <a rid="B33-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-insects-09-00020">33</a>]. Dreassi et al. [
  <a rid="B34-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-insects-09-00020">34</a>] found yellow mealworms fed on wheat, oat, cornflour, and chickpea flour had much 10% higher PUFA’s content compared to mealworms fed on 100% oat flour.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, the diet of locusts can be advantageously designed to optimise the omega-3 and PUFA content in order to produce a healthy lipid source. Still, locusts from the present study provided desirably low SFA/UFA and n−6/n−3 ratios of 0.58 and 0.55, respectively. The recommended n−6/n−3 ratio is around one, which is far from reach for many Western consumers who consume too much omega-6 in their diets, leading to ratios above 15/1 [
  <a rid="B35-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-insects-09-00020">35</a>]. High omega-6 consumption in vegetable oils and grains for example, has been linked to various health diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Greater consumption of omega-3 rich lipids and food sources that have lower n−6/n−3 ratios can help reduce risk of these chronic diseases [

  <a rid="B35-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-insects-09-00020">35</a>,
  <a rid="B36-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-insects-09-00020">36</a>]. Lipid extraction is often a by-product of protein extraction making locust oil a sustainable and healthy alternative lipid and food source. In another study conducted by the researcher, consumer acceptance of locust oil was explored through focus group discussions. It found the omega-3 content, as well as the sustainability or novelty of locust oil is an attractive feature for some participants, indicating these features should be appropriately marketed and explored in order to improve acceptance.
