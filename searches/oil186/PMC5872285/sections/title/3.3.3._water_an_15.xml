 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The water (WHC) and oil holding capacity (OHC) is expressed as the amount of water or oil (mL) that can be held per gram of sample. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="insects-09-00020-f002" href="#insects-09-00020-f002">Figure 2</a>, WHO and OHC values of LM, DLM and SLF were not significantly different to one another, as well as other insect species investigated [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>,
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>]. Unexpectedly, the ILF had significantly higher (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.000) WHC and OHC of 5.17 mL/g and 7.31 mL/g, respectively. A study conducted by Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] found whole and defatted yellow mealworm samples had higher WHC compared to the insoluble and soluble fractions, contradictory to the present study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability to hold water against gravity is an important application in certain food areas. The water includes bound, hydrodynamic, capillary and physically entrapped water [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. The ability to hold this water is dependent on many factors such as the amino acids, charges, conformation, and hydrophobicity of the protein, pH, temperature, ionic strength and protein concentration [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>]. The reason for the high WHC of the insoluble locust fraction is unknown. The porous structure or large particle size, due to absence of sieving during preparation, could have caused greater entrapment of water into the particle domains. Furthermore, larger particle size has been linked to higher contents of chitin, as found in 
  <span class="italic">T. molitor</span> grist [
  <a rid="B40-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-insects-09-00020">40</a>], which could additionally entrap the water into the ILF matrix, creating the high WHC result found. Ability of locust fractions to hold water illustrates protein-water interactions and can be used to interpret other functional properties such as solubility, emulsification, viscosity, gelation, and foaming [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high ILF OHC result is also inconsistent with the literature. Contradicting the current results, Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] found fat binding capacity (g/g) was significantly higher in the soluble and lower in insoluble fractions of yellow mealworms. The current findings could again be due to the larger particle size and porous structure, causing physical entrapment of oil [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>]. Additionally, higher OHC is linked to non-polar side chains in the protein structure, which was not investigated in the current study. Research on this is limited and further information on the water and oil holding capacity of protein extracts from 
  <span class="italic">L. migratoria</span> and insects in general is needed. Nevertheless, the WHC and OHC findings indicate the possible food applications of each fraction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In another consumer study conducted by the researcher, it asked thirty-five participants to design an ideal hypothetical solid and liquid food product containing the ILF and SLF fractions. Participants who were open to trying new or novel foods were screened prior to investigation in order to gain insights from potential end consumers. The liquid product designs (containing soluble locust fraction) designed by participants included chocolate flavoured health drinks, protein powders, an ice cream, and a coconut yoghurt product. Solid food products (containing insoluble locust fraction) included protein packed breadcrumbs, muesli bars, cereals, bread, cookies and a nut substitute. The majority of these products were designed as a healthy, convenient, and eco-friendly snack or breakfast for active consumers or children. These results indicate the exciting future of whole or extracted locust protein as a value-added ingredient.</p>
