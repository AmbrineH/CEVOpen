 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yield and protein recovery of the three fractions, plus the protein content of LM and extracted fractions are displayed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t003" href="#insects-09-00020-t003">Table 3</a>. The protein contents of the three fractions were not significantly different to each other (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.073). After processing, their combined average protein content (73.6%) was 23.8% higher than the LM, illustrating significantly higher (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.000) protein content than whole locusts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the current findings, Zhao et al. [
  <a rid="B11-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-insects-09-00020">11</a>] and Purschke et al. [
  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00020">19</a>] found protein content to 82% for yellow mealworm and migratory locust. Alternatively, research investigating other insect species found slightly lower values ranging from 65–75% for insoluble, 58–69% for soluble, and 50–61% for supernatant fractions [
  <a rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-insects-09-00020">12</a>,
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>]. Chitin and chitin-bound protein that is consequently indigestible, are likely to contribute to the protein content found in ILF [
  <a rid="B10-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-insects-09-00020">10</a>]. Although not the focus of the current study, this can lead to lower digestibility compared to supernatant and pellet (soluble) fractions, as documented by Yi et al. [
  <a rid="B13-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-insects-09-00020">13</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The protein recovery of each fraction is expressed as a percentage compared to the initial protein content of the sample (DLM). The total protein yield (101.66%), ILF yield, and ILF protein recovery was similar to other literature investigating various insects [
  <a rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-insects-09-00020">12</a>,
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>]. However, the low SLF (9.83%) and high SF yield (56.60%) was unexpected. Purschke et al. [
  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00020">19</a>] identified a protein recovery of 51.7% of migratory locust protein concentrate after solubilisation at pH 9. Other insect studies documented soluble yields ranging from 22% to 46% [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-insects-09-00020">16</a>] and supernatant protein yields between 17% and 23% [
  <a rid="B12-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-insects-09-00020">12</a>]. Experimental conditions in the present study could have impacted findings. The soluble proteins may not have aggregated efficiently at pH 4, causing a large proportion to remain in the supernatant fraction, leading to a higher SF yield and protein percentage. pH 4 was used to precipitate the soluble locust protein following Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] methodology on five different insects. Purschke et al. [
  <a rid="B18-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-insects-09-00020">18</a>] later identified pH 4 as the isoelectric point for enzymatic hydrolysed migratory locust protein. pH 10 was used to solubilise the proteins following the method by Tirgar et al. [
  <a rid="B28-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-insects-09-00020">28</a>] and pH used by Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>]. However, Purschke et al. [
  <a rid="B19-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-insects-09-00020">19</a>] identified the minimum solubility at pH 5 and maximum at pH 9. Therefore the pH used based on other insect species by Bußler et al. [
  <a rid="B15-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-insects-09-00020">15</a>] may not have been the optimal pH. Furthermore, other experimental conditions such as NaOH concentration, pH, temperature, run time, and water to sample ratio are known to have an effect on protein yields, possibly affecting the results found in the present study [
