  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of chemical analysis of the essential oils were as follows. The relative contents of the primary components in peppermint leaf essential oil were pulegone (1.17%), menthofuran (2.11%), menthone (25.42%), menthol (38.81%), menthyl acetate (4.38%), and 1,8-cineole (5.57%). The primary components in orange peel essential oil were limonene (94.64%), myrcene (1.91%), 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (0.47%), linalool (0.30%), and decanal (0.17%). In rosemary flower and leaf essential oil, the primary components were 1,8-cineole (47.42%), 
   <span class="italic">α</span>-pinene (13.62%), camphor (11.13%), 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-pinene (4.39%), and borneol (2.55%). The primary components in clove bud essential oil were eugenol (82.50%), 
   <span class="italic">β</span>-caryophyllene (3.89%), and eugenyl acetate (12.07%).
