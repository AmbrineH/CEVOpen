  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group, a fatigue group, an essential oil mixture (EOM) group, and a peppermint essential oil (PEO) group. Loaded swimming to exhaustion was used as the rat fatigue model. Two groups were nebulized with EOM and PEO after swimming, and the others were nebulized with distilled water. After continuous inhalation for 3 days, the swimming time, blood glucose, blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in blood were determined.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Results</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> While an increased time to exhaustion and SOD activity were apparent in both the EOM and PEO groups, the BLA and MDA were lower in both groups, in comparison with the fatigue group, and the changes in the EOM group were more dramatic. Additionally, the EOM group also showed marked changes of the rise of blood glucose and the decrease of BUN and GSH-PX.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The results suggested that the inhalation of an essential oil mixture could powerfully relieve exercise-induced fatigue.</p>
