<p>After 7 days acclimation, the weight loaded swimming to exhaustion was carried out as described by Chi et al. [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with slight modifications. All of the rats were removed from the fatigue group, EOM group, and PEO group for the swimming to exhaustion in a pool (length 65 cm, width 50 cm, depth 50 cm, water depth 30 cm, and temperature 25 ± 1°C). A lead block (10% of body weight) was attached to the tail root of the swimming rat [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The rats were determined to be exhausted when they failed to rise to the surface to breathe after 7 s [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The rats in the control group were normally raised without any treatment until the end of the experiment. Swimming to exhaustion started at 5 p.m. every day for three days. All rats were fasted 12 hours before bleeding.
