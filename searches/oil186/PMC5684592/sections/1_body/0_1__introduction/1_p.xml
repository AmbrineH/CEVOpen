<p class="p">Physical fatigue will occur sooner or later depending on the type of exercise. Physical fatigue is commonly defined as the inability to sustain or maintain voluntary activity, and it is considered to be associated with a physiological decline [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Several theories have been proposed to explain physical fatigue, including the “exhaustion theory,” the “radical theory,” and the “clogging theory.” The “exhaustion theory” proposed that depletion of energy stocks within the body, such as glucose or glycogen, could lead to fatigue. However, the “clogging theory,” that is, the excessive accumulation of blood lactic acid (BLA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), would cause metabolic disorders that would eventually result in the fatigue. The “radical theory” hypothesizes that intensive exercise could produce an imbalance between the body's oxidation system and its antioxidation system. Muscle cells have defense mechanisms that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and protect cells against exercise-induced oxidative injury [
