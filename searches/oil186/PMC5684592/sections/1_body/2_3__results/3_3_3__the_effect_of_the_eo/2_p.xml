<p class="p">Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref> show that the BLA level of the rats in the fatigue group was significantly higher than that of the control group after swimming (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, inhalation of the EOM significantly decreased the concentrations of BUN and BLA in comparison with the fatigue group (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The BUN and BLA concentrations were even lower than the PEO group and the control group (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
