<p class="p">Oxidative stress should be responsible for muscle fatigue [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The antioxidant system in the body is weak in exercise-fatigue conditions [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and the SOD and GSH-Px activities are generally considered indicators of the capacity of the antioxidant defensive system [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an end-product of the radical-initiated oxidative decomposition of cell membrane lipids, so it is frequently used as a biomarker of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">7</xref> show that, compared with the control group, the SOD activity decreased but the serum MDA level increased in the fatigue group. Additionally, the data showed that EOM treatment reduced the serum MDA and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px after swimming to exhaustion. The present study showed that the muscle could have been assaulted by ROS after exercising to exhaustion. It additionally suggested that the antifatigue effect of the EOM probably occurred via protection of the cell membrane by preventing lipid oxidation due to the modification of the GSH-Px and SOD activities.
