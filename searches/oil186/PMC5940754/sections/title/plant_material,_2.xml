  <span class="italic">Siparuna guianensis</span> was collected in the counties of Gurupi (11°43′45″ latitude S. 49°04′07″ longitude W) and Formoso do Araguaia (11°47′48″ latitude S. 49°31′44″ longitude W), State of Tocantins, Central Brazil. The collections were approved by the Brazilian National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq. n° 010580/2013–1). Taxonomic identification was carried out and confirmed by experts at the herbarium of the Federal University of Tocantins (Porto Nacional, TO, Brazil), where the samples were deposited under the reference number 10.496. The leaves of

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP-2010 instrument (Kyoto, Japan) operating at 70 eV with a DB-5MS methylpolysiloxane column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 1.0 μm; J &amp; W Scientific Inc. Folsom. USA). The injection split ratio was 1:50 throughout the run (60.3 min) and helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.50 mL/min (53.5 Kpa). The constant linear velocity was established at 42 cm/s and the injector temperature at 250 °C. The temperature of the transfer line was 260 °C.</p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-FID analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus instrument (Kyoto, Japan), with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a CP-Sil column 8 CB with methylpolysiloxane as the stationary phase (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0. 25 μm (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, USA). The injection split ratio was 1:50 flow division throughout the run (60.3 min), and nitrogen was used as carrier gas with constant flow of 1.5 mL/min, an injector temperature of 250 °C, and a detector temperature of 260 °C.</p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC column oven temperature went from 70 °C to 180 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, with a hold time of 27.5 min followed by a heating ramp of 25 °C/min to 250 °C, and a final hold time of 30 min
