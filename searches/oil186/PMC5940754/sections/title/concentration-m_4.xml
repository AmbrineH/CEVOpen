 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concentration-mortality bioassays were carried out using 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> instar larvae in a completely randomized experimental design. We used impregnated filter paper (9 cm in diameter) as the surface for the essential oil (contact) exposure. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">guianensis</span> was dissolved in a mixture of water and 2% (v/v) of the detergent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain the desired concentrations. Filter paper disks were impregnated with 300 µL of this solution and placed covering the inner walls of a 100 mL plastic cup, which received 25 larvae of the velvetbean caterpillar or a single larva of the armyworm (to avoid cannibalism). Each bioassay was replicated four times, and each replicate contained 25 velvetbean caterpillars or 16 armyworms. Larval mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure, considering dead the larvae that were unable to walk when prodded with a fine hair brush. A similar procedure was used to establish the concentration-response curves for the synthetic insecticides indoxacarb (Rumo 300 g a.i./L; DuPont do Brasil S.A., Barueri, SP, Brazil) against the 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> instar larvae of all strains. The conventional insecticide was used as positive control for the assessed insecticidal activity of the essential oil of
