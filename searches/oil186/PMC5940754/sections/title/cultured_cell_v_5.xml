Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method in the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA), using the manufacturer specified protocol. The same experiment was performed with a human monocytic cell line (TPH1) after incubation with increasing concentrations of the

  <span class="italic">guianensis</span> essential oil on cultured lepidopteran cells, IPLB-SF-21AE and UFL-AG-286 cells were incubated with the essential oil at a concentration of 0.86 mg/mL. The culture medium was removed after the incubation period (i.e., 24 h) and the cells were immediately treated with reagents provided in the Apoptosis/Necrosis Detection Kit (blue, green, red) (Abcam®; Cambridge, UK), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The assayed cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss GmBh, Oberkochen, Germany).
