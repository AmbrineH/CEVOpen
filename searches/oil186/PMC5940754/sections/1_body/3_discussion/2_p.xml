<p id="Par36">Our chromatographical analyses revealed the monoterpene β-myrcene (varying from approximately 69% to 80%) and the non-terpenic acyclic ketone 2-undecanone (varying from approximately 8% to 11%) as the major components of the

These findings confirm the spatio-temporal variations (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, irradiance, genotype, extraction method and agronomic conditions) commonly encountered in the chemical composition of essential oils and that can influence the chemical profile of essential oil extracted from the same plant species
