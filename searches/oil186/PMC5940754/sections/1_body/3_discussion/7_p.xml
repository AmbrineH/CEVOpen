<p id="Par41" class="p">Thus, the findings described here not only revealed the potential control of two key lepidopteran pests (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">frugiperda</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gemmatalis</italic>, including a 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">frugiperda</italic> that is resistant to Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab 
 <italic class="italic">Bt</italic> toxins) by the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guianensi</italic>s essential oil but also showed that this oil induced cell death (i.e., apoptotic and necrotic cells) in insect cells, although not in human cells. Such characteristics demonstrated that the current pest management initiatives will likely benefit from including 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guianensi</italic>s essential oil as an alternative tool in managing lepidopteran pests, especially in the context of raising concerns regarding the sustainable use and efficacy of 
 <italic class="italic">Bt</italic>-plants. Further investigations aiming to elucidate the molecular interactions between the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guianensi</italic>s essential oil (and its constituents) and the potential ionic channels (e.g., octopamine, tyramine, GABA and TRP) targeted by these molecules will shed light on the major mode of actions of these plant products on lepidopteran pests.
