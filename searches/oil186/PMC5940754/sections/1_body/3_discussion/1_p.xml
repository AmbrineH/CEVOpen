 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guianensis</italic>, to the larval stages of key lepidopteran pests (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gemmatalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">frugiperda</italic>, including a 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">frugiperda</italic> strain that is resistant to the Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab 
 <italic class="italic">Bt</italic> toxins). This high toxicity was associated with induction of necrotic and apoptotic cell death in lepidopteran cells revealed by 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> assays, which were absent from the human monocytic cell line TPH1. We also report that the sublethal exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guianensis</italic> resulted in deficits in reproduction (e.g., egg-laying deterrence and decreased egg viability), larval development (e.g., feeding inhibition) and locomotion (e.g., individual and grouped larvae walking activities).
