<p id="Par2">The worldwide adoption of genetically modified crop plants expressing toxic proteins of the bacterium 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (i.e., 
 <italic>Bt</italic> toxins) was a response to the economic losses caused by lepidopteran pest species, particularly in maize and soybeans
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. However, despite the importance of genetically modified 
 <italic>Bt</italic> plants on the integrated management of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, the sustainability of this agricultural practice has been threatened by lack of information about the interaction of 
 <italic>Bt</italic> toxins (e.g., Cry proteins) with non-target organisms (including other relevant pests such as the phytosuccivorous insect pests) and the rapid evolution of high levels of resistance. Indeed, recent studies described field-evolved 
 <italic>Bt</italic>-resistance in the fall armyworm 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> to non-pyramided 
 <italic>Bt</italic> plants expressing Cry1F, Cry1A. 105, Cry2Ab and Cry1Ab toxins as well as to the dual-gene 
 <italic>Bt</italic> (i.e., expressing Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab toxins) maize

 </sup>. Additionally, cases of cross-resistance between 
 <italic>Bt</italic> toxins and non-
 <italic>Bt</italic> conventional insecticides were reported in the diamondback moth 
 <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (i.e., pyrethroids and Cry1Ac toxin) and in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> (i.e., organophosphates and Cry1F toxin)
