<p id="Par5">Thus, the present study aimed at shedding further light on the insecticidal activity of the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> essential oil. The chemical constituents of essential oils of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> were initially identified and subsequently tested on the velvetbean caterpillar 
 <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic> (HÃ¼bner), a key soybean pest species, and on 
 <italic>Bt</italic>-susceptible and resistant strains of the fall armyworm 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (J.E. Smith), a key pest species of maize and soybeans. The larvicidal, ovicidal, egg-laying deterrence and repellence properties of the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> essential oil were assessed, as was the potential impairment of larval walking activity of both caterpillar species. We also assessed the toxicity of this essential oil on lepidopteran and human cell lines.
