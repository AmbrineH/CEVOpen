Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method in the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA), using the manufacturer specified protocol. The same experiment was performed with a human monocytic cell line (TPH1) after incubation with increasing concentrations of the
