<p id="Par22" class="p">The results of egg viability, oviposition, foliar consumption and larval weight were subjected to univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks when the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were not satisfied. The results of walking behavior were submitted to multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to secure an overall error level of
