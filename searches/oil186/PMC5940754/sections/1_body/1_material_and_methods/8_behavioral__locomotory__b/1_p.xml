 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic>) were performed 3, 6, and 16 h after contact exposure to the respective LC
 <sub>10</sub> and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> essential oil determined for each Lepidoptera pest species (
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic>: 3.34 (LC
 <sub>10</sub>) and 8.09 (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) μL/mL; 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic>: 0.32 (LC
 <sub>10</sub>) and 2.45 (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) μL/mL). The contact exposure was performed using filter paper impregnated with 1 mL of the oil solution (or control) and left to dry at air temperature. The exposed larvae were placed (either individually or in group) in an arena consisting of an uncontaminated filter paper placed in a Petri dish (135 × 20 mm); the movement of the larvae within the arena was recorded for 10 min using an automated video tracking system equipped with a CCD camera (ViewPoint Life Sciences, Montreal, Canada).
