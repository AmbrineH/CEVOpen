<p id="Par17" class="p">In the no-choice bioassay, either a treated or an untreated leaf section was offered to a single larva in a single plastic container. The containers were kept closed with a plastic lid where small holes were made to allow gas exchange. After 24â€‰h of exposure, the changes in the leaf sections and the larvae weights were recorded. The oil concentration equivalent to LC
