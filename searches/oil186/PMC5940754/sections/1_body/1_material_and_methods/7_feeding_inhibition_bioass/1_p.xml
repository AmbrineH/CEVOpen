 </sup> with some adjustments. Plants of maize (variety AG1051 Agroceres, Santa Cruz das Palmeiras, SP, Brazil) and soybean (MSOY 8866, Monsanto, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) were grown in the greenhouse at the Horticulture Section of the Federal University of Tocantins (Gurupi, TO, Brazil). The maize and soybean leaves were obtained from 30-day-old plants. At the beginning of the experiment, 4 cm

 <italic>frugiperda</italic> and

 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> were weighted separately. Each leaf section was dipped for 10 seconds in a 15 mL solution of the essential oil and then left to air dry at room temperature before being offered to individual larvae. The leaf sections and larvae were put in 30 mL plastic containers. In the free-choice bioassay, both treated and untreated leaf sections were offered simultaneously to the larvae. The two leaf sections were put on the bottom of the cup without touching each other.
