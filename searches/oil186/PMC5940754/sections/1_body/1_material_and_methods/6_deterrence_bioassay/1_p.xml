 </sup> with some modifications. PVC oviposition containers of 20 cm (diameter) per 25 cm (height), internally covered with sulfite paper, were used. Half of the internal area was covered by sulfite paper treated with 20 mL of the essential oil at a concentration equivalent to LC
 <sub>10</sub> and allowed to air dry. The other half was treated with either DMSO 2% in distilled water or water only (as a control). Fifty containers were used per treatment and species (

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic>). Each container received a couple of adult moths (i.e., 1 ♀ and 1 ♂), and the number of eggs laid in each area was recorded after 48 h.
