<p id="Par29">In contrast, there was an inverse susceptibility pattern of the insect species to the synthetic insecticide indoxacarb; its LC
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> was 0.08 µL a.i./mL, while for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> it was 0.003 µL a.i./mL (for the Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab susceptible strain) and 0.005 µL a.i./mL (for the Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab resistant strain). Based on these LC

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> was less tolerant to indoxacarb than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> (i.e., TR

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Nonetheless, the essential oil toxicity was lower than that of indoxacarb (approximately 3.5-fold for
