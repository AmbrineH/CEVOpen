<p id="Par31">We tested the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> on the viability of lepidopteran cultured cells from 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> (IPLB-SF-21AE) and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> (UFL-AG-286) incubated for a 24 h period with a concentration of 0.86 mg/mL of the essential oil. The cells from both species suffered severe alterations in their viability after the incubation period. The armyworm cells showed both necrotic and apoptotic death, while only necrosis seemed to be causing death of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> essential oil exhibited higher toxicity against the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gemmatalis</italic> cell lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), but mortality and toxic effects were not observed in the human monocytic cell line (TPH1) incubated with increasing concentrations of the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guianensis</italic> essential oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, it is worth noting that the lowest tested concentration (i.e., 0.85 µL of essential oil/mL) was 85-fold higher than the LC
 <sub>99</sub> estimated for the insect cultured cells (IPLB-SF-21AE and UFL-AG-286) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
