<p id="Par34" class="p">The activity bioassays demonstrated that the general activity of the larvae groups was significantly (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) influenced by the exposure to the essential oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7C</xref>). Changes in group behavior over time were found for all tested populations when exposed to either LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub> or LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> compared to the unexposed control. The 3 h exposure to LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> of the essential oil already resulted in a drastic reduction of the group activity. This reduction was persistent after 6 and 16 h. Similar trends were found for the sublethal dose of LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10</sub>, especially after 16 h of exposure.
