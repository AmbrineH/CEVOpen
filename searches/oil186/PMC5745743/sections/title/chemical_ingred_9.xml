 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GC-MS was used to analyze chemical ingredients of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil. The essential oil was diluted in 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane (≥99%, GC grade, Sigma-Aldrich), and filtrated using a 0.22 μm filter. A blank (
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane) was prepared equally as the essential oil sample, and used as control sample. A measure of 1 μL sample was injected into a Trace 1300 GC coupled with an ISQ LT MS (Thermo, USA). Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a TG-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 μm; Thermo, USA). Temperature programming was set to 60 °C held for 2 min, then rose to 120 °C at 3 °C/min, maintained for 4 min, finally increased to 290 °C at 3 °C/min and held for 2 min. The inlet temperature was kept at 280 °C and ion source temperature was 270 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. Electron impact ionization source (70 eV) was used at full scan mode (

  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil were identified by NIST 14 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with a similarity of more than 70%. Retention indexes (RI) was also evaluated, using a saturated 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane mixture (C9-C36, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA). RI value for each component was calculated by AMDIS version 2.70 (Automated Mass Spectrometry Deconvolution and Identification System).
