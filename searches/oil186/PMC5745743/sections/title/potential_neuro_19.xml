 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key pathway node of the network was neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This pathway was connected with a total of 50 proteins, which meant that more than a quarter of target proteins of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil were involved in it. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction contains a collection of receptors and ligands, and is closely related to neurological function and neurodegeneration diseases [

  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>), one of the best known neurodegeneration diseases. Besides, it has been reported that ethanol extract of dried 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> flowers had neuroprotective effect in Wistar rat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Extract of this flower was also found to protect D-galactose induced aging in mouse model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. These data suggested a possible neuroprotection of
