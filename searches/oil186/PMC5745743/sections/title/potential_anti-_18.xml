 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the target proteins of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil, MAPK1 (MK01
  <span class="italic">, k</span> = 33) and MAPK3 (MK03
  <span class="italic">, k</span> = 31) had much higher degree values than others (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This indicated that the two proteins were associated with most ingredients and pathways in the network. They were considered as hub nodes and had significant impact on bioactivities of the essential oil. MAPK1 and MAPK3 were members of MAPKs family, which played an important role in MAPK/ERK cascade. Once universally activated, this pathway could block apoptosis, whereas the inhibition of MAPK/ERK is closely associated with anti-tumor effect [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. MAPK1 and MAPK3 have been reported to be associated with various types of cancer, such as prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and gastric cancer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>].

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few compounds in this essential oil also showed a potential strong tumor-inhibiting activity through some other target proteins. p53 is one of the most intensively studied tumor suppressor proteins, with mutations that lead to loss of wild-type p53 activity frequently detected in many different tumor types [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. In this study, p53 was the target protein of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-anethol. It was involved in 15 pathways in the network, which were all closely correlated to tumor progression, such as apoptosis, pancreatic cancer, glioma, and melanoma. This protein, together with the hub proteins MAPK1 and MAPK3, all belong to MAPK signaling pathway (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 12).
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EGFR is another important protein in relation to tumor development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Signaling by EGFR plays a key role in tumorigenesis prompted efforts to target this receptor in anticancer therapy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. It was the target protein of the selected main active ingredients, geraniol and eugenol. This protein was involved in 18 pathways in the network, most of which were tumor-related, such as ErbB signaling pathway, bladder cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, pathway analysis showed that several target proteins of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil were involved in many tumor-related pathways (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>), including cytochrome P450 (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 22), non-small cell lung cancer (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 10), prostate cancer (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 8), small cell lung cancer (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 7), VEGF signaling pathway (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 6), prostate thyroid cancer (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 6), Wnt signaling pathway (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 5), tyrosine metabolism (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 4), and so on. These data suggested a potential anti-tumor effect of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were also many reports about the anti-tumor effect of 
  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span>. Compounds isolated from ethyl acetate extract of 
  <span class="italic">Osmanthus fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">aurantiacus</span> flower could inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Pomolic acid, isolated from flowers of 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">aurantiacus</span> Makino, could induce apoptosis in SK-OV-3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. These reports were consistent with the assumption that 
  <span class="italic">O. fragrans</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">thunbergii</span> essential oil had a potential anti-tumor effect.
