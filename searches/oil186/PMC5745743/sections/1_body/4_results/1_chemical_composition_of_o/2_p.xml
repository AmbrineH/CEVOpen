<p id="Par21" class="p">In previous reports, Xin et al. characterize the volatiles in flowers of four cultivar groups of sweet osmanthus (Wuhan, China), and that 71 compounds were found in Thunbergii cultivars.

 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-linalool oxide (furan), trans-linalool oxide (furan) and linalool were the most common volatiles [
