 <italic class="italic">O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">thunbergii</italic> essential oil was 0.19% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/w, on a dry weight basis). Pharmaceutical potentials of herbal medicines are determined by their chemical compositions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. In the present study, a total of 91 compounds were identified from the essential oil, including alcohols, ketones, esters, hydrocarbons, terpenes, aldehydes, acids, and so on. Total ions chromatogram (TIC) of the sample was shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>, and that chemical information of identified compounds was listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>. Alcohols and ketones were major ingredients of the essential oil. This essential oil has highest concentration of dihydro-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ionol, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ionone, (2,6,6-trimethyl-2-hydroxycyclohexylidene) acetic acid lactone and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-decalactone. In order to narrow the scope of potential active ingredients, pharmaceutical properties of these compounds were researched. After the preliminary screening, 79 ingredients were reserved for the next step.
