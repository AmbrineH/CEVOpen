<p id="Par33" class="p">In order to get further understanding of the key pathway in the ingredient-target-pathway network, the nodes associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), which contained 8 ingredients, 50 proteins and 150 connections. Degree values of the network were also evaluated as mentioned above. Interestingly, eugenol (

 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = 46) were also key nodes with much higher degree values, whereas ⟨
