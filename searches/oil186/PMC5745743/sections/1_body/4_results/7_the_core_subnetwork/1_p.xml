<p id="Par33">In order to get further understanding of the key pathway in the ingredient-target-pathway network, the nodes associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which contained 8 ingredients, 50 proteins and 150 connections. Degree values of the network were also evaluated as mentioned above. Interestingly, eugenol (
 <italic>k</italic> = 47) and geraniol (
 <italic>k</italic> = 46) were also key nodes with much higher degree values, whereas ⟨
 <italic>k</italic>⟩ of the network was only 5.08. This result supported the importance of eugenol and geraniol for 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil.
