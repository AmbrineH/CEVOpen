 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), consisted of 305 nodes and 879 connections. The nodes included 44 ingredients, 191 target proteins, and 70 pathways. Degree distribution was first investigated as the basic property of a network. Degree values of all nodes were calculated and listed in Additional file

 <italic>k</italic>⟩ of the network was 5.76. 
 <italic>P(k)</italic> of the network was shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. It is obvious that some nodes had much higher degree values, whereas others only had a few connections. In general, the network exhibited approximate scale-free property and power-law degree distribution, indicating that key nodes played a much more important role in the ingredient-target-pathway network of
