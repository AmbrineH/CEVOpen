 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This indicated that the two proteins were associated with most ingredients and pathways in the network. They were considered as hub nodes and had significant impact on bioactivities of the essential oil. MAPK1 and MAPK3 were members of MAPKs family, which played an important role in MAPK/ERK cascade. Once universally activated, this pathway could block apoptosis, whereas the inhibition of MAPK/ERK is closely associated with anti-tumor effect [
