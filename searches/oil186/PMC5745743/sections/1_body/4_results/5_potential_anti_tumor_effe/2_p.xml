<p id="Par28">A few compounds in this essential oil also showed a potential strong tumor-inhibiting activity through some other target proteins. p53 is one of the most intensively studied tumor suppressor proteins, with mutations that lead to loss of wild-type p53 activity frequently detected in many different tumor types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In this study, p53 was the target protein of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-anethol. It was involved in 15 pathways in the network, which were all closely correlated to tumor progression, such as apoptosis, pancreatic cancer, glioma, and melanoma. This protein, together with the hub proteins MAPK1 and MAPK3, all belong to MAPK signaling pathway (
