<p id="Par26">In order to explore key nodes of the network, degree values of all nodes were ranked in a descending order (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Among all the 44 ingredients, eugenol (
 <italic>k</italic> = 106) and geraniol (
 <italic>k</italic> = 96) had most connections with target proteins, and were screened as key ingredients of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil. Eugenol and geraniol were reported to exert multiple pharmacological actions. For instance, eugenol exhibited potential to inhibit ehrlich ascites and solid carcinoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of eugenol were also found in clove extract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Geraniol in essential oil of plants was reported to modulate DNA synthesis and potentiates 5-fluorouracil efficacy on human colon tumor xenografts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Experimental evidences showed the therapeutic or preventive effects of geraniol on other different types of cancer, such as breast, lung, pancreatic, and hepatic cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Geraniol could also inhibit prostate cancer growth by targeting cell cycle and apoptosis pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, geraniol in plant essential oil also exhibited anti-microbial activity against many microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which might be induced by causing leakage of K
 <sup>+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions from microorganism cells through changes in the compositions of the cell membranes [
