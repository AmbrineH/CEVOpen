 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In this section, a pathway-based protein association network was constructed for 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil to select key target proteins with strong interaction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The network contained 142 nodes and 2102 connections. ⟨
 <italic>k</italic>⟩ of the network was 29.61. Degree distribution was evaluated and listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. An uneven distribution was observed, as nodes with higher degree values accounted for a larger proportion, demonstrating that most target proteins of this essential oil were involved in common pathways.
