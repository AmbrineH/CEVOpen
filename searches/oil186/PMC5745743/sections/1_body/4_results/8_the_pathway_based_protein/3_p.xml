 </sub> were calculated for nodes in the pathway-based protein association network. The top ten nodes with the highest scores of centrality indices were listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Subsequently, a three-dimensional diagram was drawn based on the centrality indices of all nodes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Obviously, five nodes were outliers in the diagram, including KPCA, EGFR, PP2BA, MAPK1 and MAPK3. Centrality indices reflect the influence of a node on others through the network and how close a node is to others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, these nodes were considered as key proteins in the pathway-based protein association network.
