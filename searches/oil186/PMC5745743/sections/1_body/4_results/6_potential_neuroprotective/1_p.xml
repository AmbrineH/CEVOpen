<p id="Par32">The key pathway node of the network was neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This pathway was connected with a total of 50 proteins, which meant that more than a quarter of target proteins of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil were involved in it. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction contains a collection of receptors and ligands, and is closely related to neurological function and neurodegeneration diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Coincidentally, some target proteins of this essential oil were proved to be enriched in Alzheimer’s disease (
 <italic>k</italic> = 8, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), one of the best known neurodegeneration diseases. Besides, it has been reported that ethanol extract of dried 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> flowers had neuroprotective effect in Wistar rat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Extract of this flower was also found to protect D-galactose induced aging in mouse model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These data suggested a possible neuroprotection of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil.
