<p id="Par16">The collected data were analyzed using complex network method. First, an ingredient-target-pathway network was constructed based on their interrelationships, designed to screen main active components and bioactivities of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil. In this network, nodes represented ingredients, target proteins or pathways collected in previous steps, respectively. If a protein was the hit target of any ingredients, or involved in any pathways, connections were made between these nodes. Subsequently, targets and ingredients connected to the most important biological pathway were extracted from the ingredient-target-pathway network, and reconstructed as a core subnetwork to explore the underlying mechanism. Moreover, a pathway-based protein association network was built to evaluate the closeness of interaction between target proteins. If two proteins were both involved in common pathways, a connection was made between them. Isolated nodes were excluded from the network. All the networks for 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil were constructed and visualized by Pajek ver. 2.00 (Batagelj and Mrvar, 2009).
