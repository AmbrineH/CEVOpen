<p id="Par17">A series of parameters of the networks for 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil were investigated for more interpretation. Degree (
 <italic>k</italic>) was first calculated and ranked to evaluate the importance of a node. The degree 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> indicates the number of edges connecting to the node 
 <italic>i</italic>. Mean value of 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for all nodes in the network is defined as average degree, denoted as ⟨
 <italic>k</italic>⟩. Degree distribution, the proportion of randomly selected nodes with a certain number of connections, was represented as 
 <italic>P(k)</italic>.
