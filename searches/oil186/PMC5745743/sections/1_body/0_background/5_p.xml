<p id="Par9">In this study, we applied the complex network method to evaluate the main active ingredients and bioactivities of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil. GC-MS was used to analyze ingredients of this essential oil. An ingredient-target-pathway network was constructed, and that statistical characteristics of the network were calculated to determine the key nodes. The nodes associated with the key pathway were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork to explore the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, a pathway-based protein association network was also built to investigate interrelationships between target proteins of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil.
