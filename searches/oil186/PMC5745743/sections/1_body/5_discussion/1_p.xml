 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), these two compounds showed potential of strong bioactivity and acceptable cytotoxicity at the level of quantity according to previous reports. Geraniol originated from geranium essential oil was reported to show 312.5 μg/mL minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against many species of bacteria such as

 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>. Moreover, 100 μg/mL strong activity of geraniol was also found against
