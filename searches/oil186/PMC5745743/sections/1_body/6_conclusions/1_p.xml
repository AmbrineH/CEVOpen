<p id="Par41">This study presents one of the first complex network analysis for evaluating active ingredients and bioactivities of plant essential oil. We analyzed the ingredients of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil, and collected target proteins and related pathways for the selected compounds. Three networks were constructed based on these data to investigate the interrelationships. Topological Statistical analysis of these networks revealed that eugenol and geraniol were the main active ingredients of this essential oil. The essential oil also showed potential anti-tumor and neuroprotective effect, which were strongly supported by previous reports about 
 <italic>Osmanthus fragrans</italic> [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Results of this work suggested a possible application of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil in oncotherapy and neurological disorders, that would benefit the development and utilization of 
 <italic>Osmanthus fragrans</italic> flowers. Complex network theory was also proved to be effective in bioactivities studies of essential oil. Moreover, it provides a novel strategy for exploring the molecular mechanisms of traditional medicines.
