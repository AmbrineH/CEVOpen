<p id="Par10">Fresh flowers of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> were collected from the campus of Baoji University of Art and Science (106°18′ E, 33°35’N, 618 m altitude), Baoji, China, in late September, 2015. The plant species was identified and confirmed by Prof. Xiaomei Wang, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry, Baoji University of Art and Sciences. The flowers (BJWLXY-CC-SKLP150915) were dried in the shade at 25 °C until the humidity lower than 30%, and conserved in an airtight polyethylene bag at −20 °C. Samples (10 g) were extracted by steam distillation. The distilled liquid was then extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, and dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by evaporation. Residual essential oil was stored at −20 °C until use.
