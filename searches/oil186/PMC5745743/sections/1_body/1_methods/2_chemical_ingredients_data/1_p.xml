<p id="Par11">GC-MS was used to analyze chemical ingredients of 
 <italic>O. fragrans</italic> var. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> essential oil. The essential oil was diluted in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (≥99%, GC grade, Sigma-Aldrich), and filtrated using a 0.22 μm filter. A blank (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) was prepared equally as the essential oil sample, and used as control sample. A measure of 1 μL sample was injected into a Trace 1300 GC coupled with an ISQ LT MS (Thermo, USA). Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a TG-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness: 0.25 μm; Thermo, USA). Temperature programming was set to 60 °C held for 2 min, then rose to 120 °C at 3 °C/min, maintained for 4 min, finally increased to 290 °C at 3 °C/min and held for 2 min. The inlet temperature was kept at 280 °C and ion source temperature was 270 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. Electron impact ionization source (70 eV) was used at full scan mode (
