 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last three decades, a huge progress in medicinal plants research has been observed. In fact, the global interest towards the use of herbal remedies has created a huge need for information about the uses and the therapeutic properties of these plants [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Essential oils are among the most interesting components of herbals and plants. These essential oils are rich in hydrocarbon compounds that have oxygenated, hydrogenated, and dehydrogenated functional groups. Most of these chemicals are monoterpenoid or sesquiterpenoids. They are odorous principles, which are found in various plants parts and evaporate at ordinary temperature [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. They are used as therapeutic agents in ethno, conventional, and complementary alternative medicines particularly as analgesics, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, local anesthetic, anthelmintic, antipruritic, and antiseptic as well as many other therapeutic uses [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>–
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nowadays, essential oils are used broadly in medicine and cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical industries and as flavoring agents and preservatives in food industry and design [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>]. In addition, it is scientifically accepted that natural antioxidants exert health promoting effects and their consumption as food or as food additives or as nutraceuticals and supplements have been greatly promoted worldwide. A complex mixture of antioxidants may account for improvement of cardiovascular health and decreased incidence of cancer in individuals who consume more of these substances [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>–
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. In elderly subjects, a higher intake of antioxidants is linked with improved health compared to subjects consuming less fruits and vegetables in their diet [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>–
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, many food industries utilize synthetic chemical preservatives to extend the shelf life of the produced commercial food products. Unfortunately, the chronic intake of these chemicals may cause carcinogenic or toxic effects to consumers. Accordingly, a growing interest in the discovery of new natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agent has been observed in order to avoid or minimize the undesirable consequences and side effects related to the consumption of chemical preservatives [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>–
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. In fact, the so-called hurdle technology, combining antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, has gained wide acceptance within the food and pharmaceutical industries [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining two or more compounds could be more effective for improving antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and could offer a synergistic potential. However, the use of phytochemicals to prevent foodborne microbes is poorly studied [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>–
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Many scientific investigations concluded that the chemical compositions and yields of essential oils may be affected by environmental factors such as seasonal and climate variations, geographical conditions, and growth stages of the plant in addition to the genetic factors for the same plant species [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>–
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>].

  <span class="italic">Ruta chalepensis</span> L. (Rutaceae), commonly known as Rue or Fringed rue, is a wild perennial herbaceous shrubs which is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Sea regions. It usually grows on the rocky slopes of mountains. It is has glabrous, alternate bipinnatisect leaves with narrow oblong lanceolate or obovate segments and cymose inflorescence [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. It is the only rue species mentioned and covered in the Flora Palaestina and even mentioned in the Bible under the Greek name Pigam, closely cognate with the Arabic name Figam which is used as flavor for honey, wine, and olive oil [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. Due to its high content of amino acids, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and furocoumarins in the leaves and young stems,
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> has pleiotropic pharmacological activities [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. It has been used widely in various folk medicines as analgesic and antipyretic and for treatment of mental disorders, convulsions, rheumatism, dropsy, neuralgia and bleeding disorders [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>–
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Palestinian traditional medicine, it has been used for treatment of asthma, renal colic, arthritis, rheumatism, backache, skin bacterial and fungal diseases, eye inflammation and ear infection. Besides that, it has been used as antitussive, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antilice, sedative, and bronchodilator and also for treatment of snake bites [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>–
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>].
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil showed potential repellent activity against
  <span class="italic"> Aegorhinus superciliosus</span> and
  <span class="italic"> Aedes albopictus</span> [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to identify the chemical composition of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> growing wildly in three regions of the West Bank area of Palestine. Afterwards, screening and comparison of their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity were conducted.
