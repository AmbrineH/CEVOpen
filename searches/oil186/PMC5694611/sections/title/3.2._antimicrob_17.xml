 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin regions of Palestine extracted by microwave-ultrasonic method exhibited interesting potential bioactivity against the growth of all microbes examined in this study. However, the highest antibacterial activity (lowest MIC) against bacterial pathogen examined was for
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil from Jerusalem and was seen against
  <span class="italic"> E. coli</span>,
  <span class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</span>,
  <span class="italic"> S. aureus</span>, and MRSA with MIC values of 0.75 mg/ml, 7 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, and 4 mg/ml, respectively, in comparison with gentamycin which has MIC values of 0.5 mg/ml, 2 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1.5 mg/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the best antifungal activity against
  <span class="italic"> C. albicans</span> was for
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil from Jenin region which showed MIC value close to 2.75 mg/ml in comparison with amphotericin B which had MIC value around 2 mg/ml. The antifungal and antibacterial activity for the three essential oils are shown in
