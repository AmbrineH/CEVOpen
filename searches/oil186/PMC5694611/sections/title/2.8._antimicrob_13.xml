 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The essential oils of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> obtained from the three regions in this study were investigated for their antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial activities of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils were examined against the growth of three references bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) including
  <span class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus</span> (ATCC 25923),
  <span class="italic"> Escherichia coli</span> (ATCC 25922), and
  <span class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (ATCC 27853) as well as against the growth of a diagnostically confirmed clinical isolates Methicillin-Resistant
  <span class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MRSA). The antifungal activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils was examined against the growth of a diagnostically confirmed clinical isolates
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antimicrobial activity of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils obtained from the three regions used in this study was determined by using broth microdilution method as described previously [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each one of the isolated
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils was dissolved in DMSO (5%) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml. The prepared
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils solutions were filter-sterilized and then were serially microdiluted (2-fold) eleven times in sterile nutrient broth. In 96-well plates, the dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions. In the microwells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the extracted
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils, the concentration of these oils ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml. On the other hand, the concentrations of these essential oils in the microwells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml. In these plates, microwell number 11 contained essential oil free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. In addition, the microwell number 12 contained essential oil free nutrient broth that was left uninoculated with any of the test microbes. This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Microwells number 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> and 0.5–2.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span>, respectively. Each of the included microbes in this study was examined in duplicate for being inhibited by the
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At 35°C all the inoculated plates were incubated and the incubation period lasted for about 18 hours for the plates inoculated with the test bacterial strains and for about 48 hours for the plates inoculated with
  <span class="italic"> Candida albicans</span>. The lowest concentration of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil, at which no visible microbial growth in that microwell was observed, was considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oil. The MIC of gentamycin and amphotericin B were also determined in parallel experiments as positive controls for antimicrobial activity and all the established tests were performed in triplicate.
