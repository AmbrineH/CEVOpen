 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The antioxidant activity of the essential oil of
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span>, collected from three regions of the Palestinian West Bank, was tested by DPPH and using Trolox as a reference compound. The used concentrations ranged 1–100 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/ml for all the studied essential oils from three regions as well as for standard Trolox as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The results revealed that the free radical scavenging property was exhibited by all the studied
  <span class="italic"> R. chalepensis</span> essential oils. IC
