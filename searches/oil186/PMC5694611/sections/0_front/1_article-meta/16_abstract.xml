  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p> Interest in essential oils was recently revived with their popularity increasing in medicine, pharmacy, and aromatherapy. This study was performed to identify the chemical compositions of the essential oil of
   <italic> Ruta chalepensis</italic> growing wildly in three regions in Palestine and to assess and compare their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title> Methods</title>
  <p> Identification of the essential oil was performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity was tested against
   <italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,
   <italic> Escherichia coli</italic>,
   <italic> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, Methicillin-Resistant
   <italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and
   <italic> Candida albicans</italic> by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, while antioxidant activity was analyzed by using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method.

  <title> Results</title>
  <p> The essential oils of
   <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> from Jerusalem and Hebron regions have almost identical components; the major compounds identified were linalyl acetate and 
   <italic>Î²</italic>-linalool; these essential oils exerted potential antioxidant and antibacterial activities. On the other hand, the major components of the plant essential oil from Jenin region were 2-undecanone and 2-nonanone, which exhibited potential antifungal activity.

  <title> Conclusions</title>
  <p> The phytoconstituents and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil of
   <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> from different regions in Palestine were established in this study. The obtained results indicate possible applications for
   <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> in the treatment of various infectious and noninfectious diseases.
