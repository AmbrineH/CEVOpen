 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> collected from the mountains of Jerusalem and Hebron regions of Palestine had almost the same essential oil constituents and had powerful antioxidant and antibacterial activities; meanwhile the plant species growing wildly in Jenin had different essential oil constituents and had lower antioxidant and antibacterial activities but had potential antifungal activity. Furthermore, our results indicated that the geographical location and ecological conditions affected the chemical constituents of the essential oil. Our investigation could have numerous applications in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and food and cosmetic industries. Finally the phytoconstituents and antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the essential oil of wild
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> growing in Palestine are now well established in this study which could indicate the future uses of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> in the treatment of various infectious and noninfectious diseases in addition to other ailments. In addition, this study highlighted the importance of fixing all variables that might affect the final composition of the extract including area of cultivation, climatic and weather conditions, method of preparation, and the solvent used for extraction.
