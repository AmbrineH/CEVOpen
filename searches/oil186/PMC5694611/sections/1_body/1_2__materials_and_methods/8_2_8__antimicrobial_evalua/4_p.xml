<p>At 35Â°C all the inoculated plates were incubated and the incubation period lasted for about 18 hours for the plates inoculated with the test bacterial strains and for about 48 hours for the plates inoculated with
 <italic> Candida albicans</italic>. The lowest concentration of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil, at which no visible microbial growth in that microwell was observed, was considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil. The MIC of gentamycin and amphotericin B were also determined in parallel experiments as positive controls for antimicrobial activity and all the established tests were performed in triplicate.
