<p>The GC-MS chromatograms were recorded using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS. The GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (30 m long, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thickness, and 0.25 mm inner diameter). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The injector temperature was 220°C. The oven temperature was programmed from 50°C (1 min hold) at 5°C/min to 130°C and then at 10°C/min to 250°C and was kept isothermally for 15 min. Transfer line temperature was 290°C.
