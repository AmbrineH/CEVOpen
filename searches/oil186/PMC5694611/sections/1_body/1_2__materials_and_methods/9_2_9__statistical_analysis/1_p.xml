<p>The antioxidant IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined in triplicate for the essential oils of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> obtained from three different Palestinian regions. The results were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) and the obtained data were compared using ANOVA with multiple comparisons. All the data were considered statistically significant when the 
 <italic>p</italic> value was &lt;0.05. The statistical significance was represented as 
 <italic>∗</italic> with 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>∗∗</italic> with 
 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.001, and ∗
