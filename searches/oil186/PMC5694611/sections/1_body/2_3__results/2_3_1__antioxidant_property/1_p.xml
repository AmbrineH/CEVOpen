<p>The antioxidant activity of the essential oil of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic>, collected from three regions of the Palestinian West Bank, was tested by DPPH and using Trolox as a reference compound. The used concentrations ranged 1–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for all the studied essential oils from three regions as well as for standard Trolox as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The results revealed that the free radical scavenging property was exhibited by all the studied
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils. IC
 <sub>50</sub> and percentages of inhibition for
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> collected from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin were 6.9 ± 0.94 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 69.56%, 7.8 ± 1.05 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 61.53%, and 19.9 ± 0.68 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml 24.12%, respectively.
