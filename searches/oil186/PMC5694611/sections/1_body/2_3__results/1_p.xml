<p>The phytochemical profile of the
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil components from Hebron region was almost similar to Jerusalem region and the total components of the essential oil were 96.75% and 96.3%, respectively. In addition, they contained major phytochemical classes such as (i) alcohol which represented 32.36% and 38.24%, respectively, (ii) ketone group 31.16% and 18.27%, respectively; and (iii) ester group which represented 29.51% and 35.05%, respectively. Meanwhile the essential oil from the same species growing in Jenin region had almost different components: the total essential oil represented 92.58% and the major represented class of phytoconstituents was ketonic products with 89.81% of total identified essential oil components. Moreover, 14 components were identified from
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil which was harvested from the mountains of Hebron. Regarding
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil which was obtained from the mountains of Jerusalem, 17 components were identified. Surprisingly, only 7 components were identified in the essential oil that was extracted from
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> of Jenin region and two phytochemical classes (hydrocarbons and ester groups) were absent in this sample. The compositions of the essential oils isolated from
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> from the three regions of Palestine are illustrated in
