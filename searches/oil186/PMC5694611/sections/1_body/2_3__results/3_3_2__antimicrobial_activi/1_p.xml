<p>The essential oil of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> from Jerusalem, Hebron, and Jenin regions of Palestine extracted by microwave-ultrasonic method exhibited interesting potential bioactivity against the growth of all microbes examined in this study. However, the highest antibacterial activity (lowest MIC) against bacterial pathogen examined was for
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil from Jerusalem and was seen against
 <italic> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic>,
 <italic> S. aureus</italic>, and MRSA with MIC values of 0.75 mg/ml, 7 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, and 4 mg/ml, respectively, in comparison with gentamycin which has MIC values of 0.5 mg/ml, 2 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1.5 mg/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the best antifungal activity against
 <italic> C. albicans</italic> was for
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil from Jenin region which showed MIC value close to 2.75 mg/ml in comparison with amphotericin B which had MIC value around 2 mg/ml. The antifungal and antibacterial activity for the three essential oils are shown in
