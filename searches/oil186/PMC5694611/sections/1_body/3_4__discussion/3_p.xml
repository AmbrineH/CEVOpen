<p>A study which was performed by Tzakou and Couladis, 2011, on the essential oil of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> from Greece showed that the main components of the oil were 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-phellandrene (10.7%) and 2-methyloctyl acetate (44.0%) [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Another study which was conducted in Tunisia by Tounsi et al., 2011, showed that the leaves of cultivated
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> contained 2-nonanol as the major active constituents of the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Another study conducted also in Tunisia by Ghazghazi et al., 2015, showed that the main chemical constituents of
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oil were menthol (43.92%) and linalool (42.10%) [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These variations in the phytochemical components may be due to the various geographical locations and climatic and weather conditions from which the
 <italic> R. chalepensis</italic> leaves were collected.
