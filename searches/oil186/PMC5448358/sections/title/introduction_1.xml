  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of South America (Brazil and Argentina), Africa (Congo Republic, Gabon, DR Congo, Angola), and Australia (Yang et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0022">2013</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> has been studied in only the Republic of Congo, where this plant grows spontaneously on the “Plateau des Cataractes”. It is usually used by local people as a théiforme drink to relieve pain, which justifies its vernacular name “tikoni” (pain).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first description of the chemical profile of the essential oils from different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers) showed that the oils from the aerial parts were mainly rich in 
  <span class="italic">p‐</span>menthadienol isomers, and the main ones are 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol, 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol. The essential oil of the roots is rather rich in sesquiterpene compounds, and aristolone, with a content of approximately 40%, is the major compound. (Silou, Loubaki, Figuérédo, &amp; Chalchat, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0017">2006</a>). Studies of the essential oils of species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus</span> are very limited; however, it appears that 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> is the only species of the genus that is rich in 
  <span class="italic">p‐</span>menthadienol isomers. However, these isomers are present at significant contents in the oils of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon giganteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon densiflorus</span>. Indeed, the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon giganteus</span> from the Ivory Coast is characterized by high contents of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol (8.7% and 18,4%, respectively) and 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol (16% and 15.7%, respectively), and this oil presents antimicrobial properties (Boti et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0005">2006</a>). Moreover, the antimicrobial properties were also observed on the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon giganteus</span> from Burkina Faso (Menut et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0012">2000</a>), Cameroon (Jirovetz, Buchbauer, Eller, Ngassoum, &amp; Maponmetsem, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0010">2007</a>), Benin (Ayedoun, Sohounhloué, Menut, Lamaty, &amp; Bessière, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0003">1999</a>), and Mali (Sidibe, Chalchat, Garry, &amp; Hamara, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0016">2001</a>); these species produce essential oils rich in 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐menthadienol isomers. The essential oil from the flowers and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon densiflorus</span> of Zambia is also rich in 
  <span class="italic">p‐</span>menthadienol isomers, and it contains 22.4% 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol and 11.1% 
  <span class="italic">cis‐p</span>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol. The oil of the Brazilian plant presents a similar composition (Boelens, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0004">1994</a>; Chisowa, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0006">1997</a>). The literature reports several uses of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon densiflorus</span>: the crushed leaves are used as a treatment for rheumatism in Gabon, the flower head is smoked in a pipe as a cure for bronchial affections in Malawi, and the plant sap is used in the Congo‐Brazzaville, where it is also given as a treatment for asthma and to calm fits (Akhila, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0002">2010</a>). Manifestly, the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon densiflorus</span> exhibits biological activities. The massive presence of 
  <span class="italic">p‐</span>menthadienol isomers in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> points also to possible antimicrobial properties. Aristolone is also an interesting constituent since it is likely to induce an antalgic activity (Tian‐Shung, Amooru, Damu, &amp; Kuo, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0020">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a previous study of 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> from Congo‐Brazzaville, (1) the volatile components from the stems and the roots were obtained by hydrodistillation and head‐space solid phase microextraction (HS‐SPME), and (2) for the extracts obtained with methanol, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were demonstrated and compared. The essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> did not have significant properties of DPPH and ABTS
  <span class="sup">.+</span> for either the stems or the roots. However, the solvent extracts are effective antioxidants according to in vitro assays. The authors conclude that the extracts of 
  <span class="italic">Elyonurus hensii</span> have potential as natural additives for the food and pharmaceutical industries (Yang et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0022">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of experimental designs can improve the yields of essential oil. They also optimize the extraction of the major constituents of the essential oils by organizing the steam distillation with a minimum number of experiments to be performed (Silou, Malanda, &amp; Loubaki, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0018">2004</a>; Silou et al., 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0019">2009</a>). Taking into account the scientific interest that seems to represent the isomers of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐menthadienol and aristolone, we have tried to optimize the extraction of these major constituents by using a 2
  <span class="sup">n</span> full factorial design. We have used a simple model of the first degree which gives the representation of the response function based on variables, which allows us to evaluate the influence of different factors studied on the contents of the aristolone and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐menthadienol isomers.
