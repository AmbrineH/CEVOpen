 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all three sites, Loufoulakari (L), Campus rural (C), and Sese (S), it is observed that the behavior of the five main major constituents is identical for the aerial parts. During periods of significant rainfall decreases, May (m) and July (j), the 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol isomers are produced in large quantities (on average, the content is of the order of 18%), and the content of the 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol isomer (around of 5%) decreased in the same period for the Lm, Cm, Sm, Lj, Cj, and Sj samples (Figure 
  <a rid="fsn3459-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#fsn3459-fig-0001">1</a>). Moreover, for the three sites, the results show that the type of soil does not influence the production of the main major constituents. In the zone of “plateau des Cataractes” where the harvests were performed, the average temperature is 22°C (min 15°C, max 26°C) during the dry season and 28°C (min 23°C, max 33°C) during the rainy season (Samba Kimbata, 
  <a rid="fsn3459-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn3459-bib-0015">1978</a>). It is, therefore, possible to consider that the factors related to the sunlight and to the water stress have an impact on the quantitative production of these isomers. The drastic decrease in rainfall is already an important factor influencing the yield of essential oil, and in this case, the composition of essential oil is also affected. There is a natural selection in the biosynthesis of isomers favoring the synthesis of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1 (7),8‐dien‐2‐ol during periods of water stress. The separation of the isomers by conventional methods of chemistry is not always easy, these results show that it just to extract the essential oil from the plant material harvested during the water stress period for obtaining extracts enriched in 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol and poor in 
  <span class="italic">cis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trans‐p</span>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol. This is one of the first possible steps in the separation of four isomers of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐menthadienol.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the roots, on all three sites, the chemical profile is primarily aristolone. We also find a certain selectivity of the plant in the production of two major compounds. In February and December, for all three sites, the content of aristolone is at the maximum, whereas that of limonene is low. In general, it seems that the production of aristolone comes at the expense of limonene. (Figure
