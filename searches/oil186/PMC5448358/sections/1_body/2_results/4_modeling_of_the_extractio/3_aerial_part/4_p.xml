 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 1.33% for 8 experiments on a scale ranging from 0.40% to 2.11%. In the experimental domain considered, the factors of the coefficients are low, reflecting the weak influence of factors chosen on the essential oil yield. However, there is an influence of the residual water content (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = −0.61) on the yield of the essential oil. The negative sign of the coefficient indicates that a high water content in the plant material does not favor the extraction of essential oil, thus confirming the observations made on modeling the extraction of the essential oils of
