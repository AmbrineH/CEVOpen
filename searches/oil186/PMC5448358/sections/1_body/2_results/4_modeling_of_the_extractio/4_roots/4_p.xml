<p class="p">The content of aristolone is more sensitive to the effects of the factors and their interactions. With an average content of 41.10% for eight experiments and a range of 36.68% to 54.55%, the extraction of aristolone is impacted by the residual water content with a large negative weight (a
 <sub class="sub">2 = </sub>−3.53). The effects of the interactions are also important; the combined effects of the duration of extraction and the state of division have a large negative weight (a
 <sub class="sub">13 = </sub>−3.58). Additionally, the combined effects of the duration of extraction, the residual water content and the state of division led to the most significant effect on the response (a
 <sub class="sub">123 = </sub>4.07). In the latter case, the interpretation of this interaction is very complex. However, if we consider the mathematical model in which we neglect the factors and interactions that have a minor influence, we obtain the following equation:
