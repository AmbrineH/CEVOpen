<p id="Par27">Membrane disruption in CNB oil treated RSY150 cells was assessed as leakage of cellular contents (OD
 <sub>600</sub> = 260 nm) in the supernatant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The amount of leaked cellular content increased as a function of CNB oil concentration, from 1/8 MIC to MIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), showing that compromised cell membrane integrity is dose dependent. The positive control amphotericin B showed leakage at MIC.
