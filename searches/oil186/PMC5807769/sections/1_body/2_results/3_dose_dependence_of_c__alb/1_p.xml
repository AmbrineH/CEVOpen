<p id="Par25" class="p">To determine the dose dependence of CNB oil over a 24 h period, growth curves were constructed at different concentrations of CNB oil (15.625–125 µg/mL) in YPD media. Growth inhibition was dose dependent with complete inhibition of growth at MIC (125 µg/mL) and increased growth at progressively lower sublethal concentrations: 62.5 μg/mL (1/2 MIC), 31.25 μg/mL (1/4 MIC) and 15.625  µg/mL (1/8 MIC) (Fig.
