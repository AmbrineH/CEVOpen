<p id="Par26">The viability of cells cultured to logarithmic phase after treatment for 4 h with different concentrations of CNB oil (125–62.5 µg/mL) were assessed using the vital dye, methylene blue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), which enters both live and dead cells. Since live cells are able to reduce the dye [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] they become colorless, whereas dead cells remain blue. The cells were non-viable following CNB oil treatment, confirmed by CFU for each CNB oil treatment (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC and control). There was a significant reduction in the number of colonies treated with 1/2 MIC CNB oil in comparison to cells treated at 1/4, 1/8 MIC and control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).
