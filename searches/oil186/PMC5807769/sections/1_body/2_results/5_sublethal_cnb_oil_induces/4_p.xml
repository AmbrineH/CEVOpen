<p id="Par34">Control cells of both strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, g) revealed a smooth and homogeneous surface. There was a significant increase (p = 0.015) in cell surface roughness (5.4 ± 1.0 nm) of the clinical isolate following CNB oil exposure compared to control (2.7 ± 1.2 nm), whereas the RSY150 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e–h) showed no significant change (p = 0.2432) compared to control cells (treated 4.9 ± 1.08 nm vs. control 3.52 ± 1.77 nm). These results are summarized in Table
