<p id="Par31" class="p">AFM is a powerful tool for imaging ultrastructural changes at the cell surface and probing the associated biophysical properties. We chose QI™ mode, which records a large number of force curves (n = 16,536; 128 pixel
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> resolution) for a detailed analysis. Representative QI™ images of RSY150 and a clinical isolate of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> exposed to sub lethal concentrations of CNB oil, along with comparable controls, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a–d. Changes in RSY150 and the clinical isolate after CNB treatment are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. There was a clear difference between the CNB treated RSY150 and the clinical isolate, with 50% of the RSY150 cells showing leakage and exfoliation while the clinical isolate showed leakage with increased surface roughness. The exfoliation in these cells was usually limited to a small area on the cell in the form of an aberration, while the rest of the surface showed little change. The clinical isolate exposed to CNB oil had rough cell surfaces, with or without leakage.
