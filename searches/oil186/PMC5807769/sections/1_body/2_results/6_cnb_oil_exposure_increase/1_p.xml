<p id="Par36">In order to determine whether cell wall integrity was compromised by CNB, RSY150 were exposed to cell wall perturbing agents CR and CFW at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC. Higher sensitivity, reflecting compromised cell wall integrity, was observed in CNB treated cells in comparison to control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) at 1/2 MIC, progressively decreasing to 1/4 MIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). As positive controls, we analyzed mutants lacking genes related to cell wall integrity and to wall organization and biogenesis for their sensitivity to CNB oil treatment. The mutants tested had the following knockouts: 
 <italic>VPS28</italic>, a VPS factor required for vacuolar protein sorting; 
 <italic>CRH11</italic>, encoding a GPI-anchored cell wall transglycosylase; 
 <italic>SSU81</italic>, encoding a function involved in oxidative stress, cell wall biogenesis, and morphogenesis; and 
 <italic>DFG5</italic>, encoding an N-linked mannoprotein of the cell wall and membrane. All these mutants exhibit generalized sensitivity to CNB oil, with lower MIC than the wild type strain (CaSS1), further verifying an impact of CNB on cell wall integrity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The associated MIC decreased two-fold, from 125 μg/mL to 61.5 μg/mL, for all mutants.
