<p id="Par37" class="p">The RSY150 strain expressing both Tub2-GFP-and Htb-RFP was imaged by LSCM to visualize the mitotic spindle in dividing cells exposed to CNB oil. In untreated cells, the spindle varied in length for the control RSY150 strain, but it consistently spanned the distance between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a) and nuclear migration was normal. In contrast, these well-defined mitotic spindles were missing in RSY150 cells exposed to CNB oil at MIC. Furthermore, Tub2-GFP fluorescence in these cells consistently failed to show the wild type pattern of spindle formation between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). Instead, Tub2-GFP often had reduced fluorescence in cells undergoing nuclear division, with only several fluorescence spots visible, indicating disruption of the mitotic spindle. Cells exposed to sub MIC CNB oil had reduced spindle defects, with most of the cells in recovery phase and observed as fluorescent patches or aggregates of tubulin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c).
