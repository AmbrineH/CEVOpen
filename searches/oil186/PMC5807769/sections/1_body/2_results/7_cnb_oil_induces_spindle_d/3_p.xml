<p id="Par39">Cinnamaldehyde treated 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed similar morphological features to CNB oil treated cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4), with depolymerized tubulin, resulting in an absence of mitotic spindles. Overall the effect was more pronounced in cinnamaldehyde treated cells as compared to those treated with CNB oil. Cells exposed to cinnamaldehyde at MIC showed a significantly increased percentage of cells in anaphase (15.8%) as compared to control (9.6%), whereas RSY150 cells exposed to linalool were arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There was complete disruption of the cell wall at MIC after 4Â h, with cells having depolymerized tubulin compared to controls, however the cells showed some tubulin fluorescence at 1/2 MIC, with intact cell walls (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4).
