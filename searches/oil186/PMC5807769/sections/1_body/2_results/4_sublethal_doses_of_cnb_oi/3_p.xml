<p id="Par30" class="p">Based on the altered phenotype during CNB exposure at sublethal levels, we studied the impact of CNB on hyphal growth. During hyphal induction (10% serum) in the presence of CNB oil, growing hyphae had intense chitin staining at their growing tips. The intensity of chitin staining was higher in cells treated at MIC and decreased progressively as a function of CNB oil concentration, at 1/2 MIC (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c, f). At 1/4 MIC CNB the intensity of CFW staining was comparable to control, however hyphal width remained the same.
