 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and β-1,3 D-glucan is critical in maintaining cell shape, mechanical rigidity and resistance to osmotic pressure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Exposure to CNB oil produced osmotically fragile, swollen cells with an uneven chitin distribution and increased elasticity, consistent with prior studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The elasticity values reported in this study are high in comparison, reflecting cross linking from fixation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Inhibition of β-1,3-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan synthase by cinnamaldehyde in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or by caspofungin in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> results in reduced cell wall β-1,3-glucan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and increased cell wall chitin content, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, mutants defective in chitin and β-glucan cross linking (
 <italic>chr1chr2Δ</italic>) have cell wall elasticity that varies with architecture and composition [
