 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is decorated with proteins called adhesins that play a pivotal role in cell communication, adhesion and microbial infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Adhesive forces in this study are based on the interaction between the cell surface and the hydrophilic, negatively charged silicon nitride AFM tip. Exposure to CNB oil gave rise to a moderate increase in cell adhesion, which may be attributed to cell wall remodelling, as evidenced by concomitant changes in roughness. Changes in adhesion may reflect loss or rearrangement of adhesins, or reorganization of surface sugars [
