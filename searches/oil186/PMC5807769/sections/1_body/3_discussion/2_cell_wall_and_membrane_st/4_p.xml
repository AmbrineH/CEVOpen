<p id="Par44">Cell wall stress was characterised not only by changes in chitin distribution and expression, but also polarized growth and moderate sensitivity to cell wall perturbing agents, leading to cell cycle arrest and fungal death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Congo Red and Calcofluor White target chitin and β-1,3-glucan synthases to produce a cytokinetic defect leading to cell cycle arrest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. A delayed or arrested cell cycle results in polarized growth with formation of pseudohyphal cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], as characterized by depolymerized microtubules [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Such a morphology was observed in 30% of the cell population exposed to CNB oil, along with defects in microtubule polymerization.
