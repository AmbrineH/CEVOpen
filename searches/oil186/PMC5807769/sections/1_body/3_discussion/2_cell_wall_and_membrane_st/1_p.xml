<p id="Par41">CNB oil treated RSY150 cells in the stationary phase had an irregular chitin distribution found on the lateral wall of budding cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Such effects became pronounced in metabolically active cells grown in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, f), with intense chitin staining at the hyphal tip. Similar staining patterns have been reported for cells exposed to high sugar or salt concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], for which hypo-osmotic pressure induced chitin synthesis or polymerization at the growing hyphal tip. Consistent with this idea is the larger cell volume of RSY150 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and sensitivity of the 
 <italic>SSU18</italic> mutant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) exposed to CNB oil. Cell wall reinforcement with chitin in response to stress is a well-known phenomenon in yeast [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. It is known that most resistant clinical strains have a higher overall chitin content, reinforcing the cell wall and making them more resistant to cell wall targeted antifungals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. As expected, the metabolically active clinical isolate showed more chitin than RSY150 (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figures S2, S3) for both control and treated cells, confirming cell wall reinforcement in the clinical strain.
