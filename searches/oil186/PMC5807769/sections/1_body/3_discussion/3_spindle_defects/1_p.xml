 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, the pre-mitotic movement of the nuclei through the bud neck and subsequent separation of nuclei are coordinated by microtubules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. In normal cells, nuclear division is complete when the buds are still small, such that larger budding cells are never observed without the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. In the control cells, two distinct subcellular microtubule structures were observed, one traversing the mother and budding cells and the other only in the mother cells. Anaphase and G2 cell cycle arrest, as well as a more pronounced filamentous growth, were apparent following CNB exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c). Cell cycle defects associated with microtubule perturbation were readily visualized in CNB treated RSY150 in which Htb-RFP and Tub2-GFP highlighted the nucleus and microtubules, respectively. Four hours following treatment with CNB at MIC, log phase cells had ablated mitotic spindles, observed as fluorescent patches or aggregates of tubulin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). Large-budding cells had nuclear staining restricted to the mother cell (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, arrow). These results are consistent with previous observations in which tubulin polymerization inhibitors and Δ
 <italic class="italic">kar3/Δkar3</italic> mutants had similar phenotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>]. We observe anaphase arrest in cells exposed to CNB at MIC, with 14% of the cells in anaphase as compared to 10% in the control, an effect which is reduced at 1/2 MIC. Cells treated at MIC cinnamaldehyde had 15% of cells in anaphase, slightly less than the Δ
 <italic class="italic">kar3/Δkar3</italic> mutant that had 17% of cells in anaphase and exhibited polarized growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Kar3 may mediate microtubule sliding during nuclear fusion and possibly mitosis, interacting with spindle microtubules to produce an inwardly directed force on the poles that antagonizes the CIP8 and KIP1 outward force [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. The Δ
 <italic class="italic">kar3/Δkar3</italic> mutant (RSY35) is no more resistant to CNB oil than wild type, suggesting that Kar3 is not likely the target of CNB oil.
