<p id="Par40">The cell wall of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the first line of defense against the host immune system and toxic agents, modulating fungal interactions and maintaining cell integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast cell wall contains three main components: mannoproteins (~ 39%), β-glucans (~ 59%), and chitin (~ 2%), that contribute to a highly dynamic molecular architecture which is continuously remodelled in response to cell surface interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway compensates for damage caused by environmental stress, signaling through the MAPK cascade to mediate cell wall biosynthesis and actin organization, regulating cell cycle progression and other necessary events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In response to cell wall stressors, for example the antifungal drug caspofungin which is a non-competitive inhibitor of β-1,3-glucan synthase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], activation of the CWI pathway can reinforce the cell wall by increasing chitin levels in
