<p id="Par47">The multisite impact of CNB oil can be attributed to both its major (cinnamaldehyde) and minor components. Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to compromise cell membrane and wall integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which we observe in this study along with a pronounced spindle defect and anaphase arrest. Minor components, which include limonene (2%), eugenyl acetate (0.6%), linalool (3.9%) and benzyl benzoate (0.6%), also contribute to CNB oil antifungal activity. The synergistic, additive or antagonist activity of these components to modify the overall effect of the oil has yet to be explored. However based on previous reports, these components target the cell membrane and modulate its function, including fluidity and permeability, leading to cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Limonene (2%) has been reported to affect the cell wall in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] and p-cymene (1.4%) inhibits germ tube formation and alters cell membrane integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Eugenyl acetate and linalool exhibit anti-virulence activity by inhibiting germ tube formation, and linalool has been reported to arrest cell cycle in the GI phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Such studies used higher (mg) concentrations of CNB oil components to produce their effects in comparison with their presence in CNB oil at only 0.6-5%. There remains the possibility of synergies between the CNB oil components.
