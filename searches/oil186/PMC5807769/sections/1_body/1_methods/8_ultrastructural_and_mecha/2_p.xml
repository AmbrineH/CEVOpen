<p id="Par18" class="p">QI force curves (JPK software) obtained at each pixel of a 128 × 128 raster scan were collected using a Z-length of 7 μm and a raster scan of 100 μm/s for QI™. Adhesion and Young’s modulus calculations were made from approximately 16,536 force curves collected from each of five biological replicates. All force curves within a 200 × 200 nm square in the center of the cell were batch processed and histogram data exported from the JPK software using Excel. Adhesion was determined using the distance between the lowest point and baseline of the retract curve and Young’s moduli determined using the Hertz model (JPK software), an estimate of cell envelope elasticity. Surface roughness was measured at the mid-point of the cell using the QI™ height images [
