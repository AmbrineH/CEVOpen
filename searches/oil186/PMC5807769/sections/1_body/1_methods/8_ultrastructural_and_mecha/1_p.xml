 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> RSY150 and a clinical isolate from blood were analyzed by Quantitative Imaging (QI™) using a Nanowizard III AFM (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Briefly, cell suspensions (2.2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) from both strains treated either with YPD only (control) or YPD with 1/2 MIC CNB oil for 24 h were deposited onto poly-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-Lysine coated cover slips for 1 h, fixed with formalin and air dried prior to AFM imaging. Cells treated with the fungal wall degrading enzyme, glucanase, served as a positive control. Samples were imaged with silicon nitride cantilevers (HYDRA6R-200NG; Nanosensors, Neuchatel, Switzerland) having calibrated spring constants ranging from 0.03 to 0.062 N/m.
