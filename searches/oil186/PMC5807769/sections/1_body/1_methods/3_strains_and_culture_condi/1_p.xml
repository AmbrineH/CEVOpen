 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> strains and clinical isolates used in this study are described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The RSY150 and RSY35 strains were a kind gift of Dr. Richard J. Bennett. RSY150 expresses Tub2-GFP and Htb-RFP and RSY35 is a Kar3 deletion mutant that express only Tub2-GFP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Kar3 is a bifunctional protein having a kinesin-like motor domain joined to a distinct microtubule binding domain that is essential for yeast nuclear fusion during mating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Strains were stored as 50% glycerol stocks at − 80 °C and were freshly revived on yeast-extract peptone dextrose agar (YPDA) containing 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose and 2% Bacto-agar prior to each experiment. All strains were grown with continuous shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C in YPD broth and the mutant strains supplemented with 80 mg/L uridine (YPDU). For the yeast to hyphal transition and leakage assays, cells were grown to mid log phase before exposure to CNB oil. For hyphal induction experiments, cells were grown in YPD broth with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% glucose.
