The endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound resulting in total inhibition (MIC 100%) of growth, compared to the growth in negative control wells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The MICs for cinnamaldehyde (stock concentration 450 μg/mL) and linalool (stock concentration 9.85 mg/mL) were also tested for RSY150 and RSY35 [
