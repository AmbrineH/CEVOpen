<p id="Par8">CNB oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) with an Agilent 7890A GC according to previously reported methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Briefly, 1 μl of diluted CNB oil (1:10 in ethanol) was injected onto a HP-5 column (30 mm × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) and separated using a carrier gas of helium (constant flow of 1.1 mL/min) with the following temperature gradient: 60 °C for 5 min, increased to 210 °C at 3 °C/min and to 260 °C at 10 °C/min. The GC-FID injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and the split ratio of injection was 20:1. For GC–MS using similar conditions, 0.2 μl was injected with a split ratio of 200:1 and separated on a HP-5MS column (30 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.25 um).
