<p id="Par20">The sensitivity of 
 <italic>C albicans</italic> to cell wall perturbing agents (Congo red (CR) and CFW) after exposure to CNB oil was tested following a previously reported method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, overnight stationary phase cultures of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> RSY150 (2.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/mL) in YNB complete media, unexposed or exposed to CNB oil at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC, were incubated for 24 h with shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C in a microtiter plate. Cells were washed with PBS to eliminate oil residues and any carryover effect of the oil to different wells. An aliquot (5 μL) of each was diluted to final densities of 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL and were spotted on YNB plates supplemented with one of the following cell wall disrupting agents: CFW (15 μg/mL) or CR (15 μg/mL). The plates were incubated at 30 °C and monitored for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> growth over 3 days. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and colonies counted for statistical analysis and graphical representation.
