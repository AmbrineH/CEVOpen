<p id="Par19" class="p">To assess the integrity of the cell membrane following CNB oil exposure, the cellular content leakage assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] was carried out with slight modification. Briefly, a mid logarithmic phase culture of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> RSY150 was washed three times and resuspended to ~10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/mL in PBS. Cell suspensions were transferred to a 24 well plate containing CNB oil at MIC, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC in PBS, and incubated at 30 °C for 6 h with shaking (200 rpm). CNB oil in PBS served as a blank, untreated cells in PBS as negative controls, and amphotericin B at MIC served as a positive control. Following incubation, cell leakage was analyzed from supernatant diluted 1:10 with PBS based on absorbance at 260 nm (Varian Cary 100 BIO, UV–VIS spectrophotometer; Midland, ON, Canada) against a blank lacking CNB oil. Nucleotides represent one class of leakage components that absorb at 260 nm, for which uracil containing compounds have the highest absorbance. Mean ratios for each treatment from three independent experiments were calculated and compared to that of corresponding untreated samples.
