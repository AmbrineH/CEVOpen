<p id="Par12">To investigate the effect of CNB oil on growth kinetics of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, an overnight culture of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> RSY150 diluted to contain 2.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.001) was treated with CNB oil (62.5, 31.25 and 15.1 µg/mL corresponding to 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC) in separate wells of a microtiter plate in triplicate and incubated at 30 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The OD
 <sub>600</sub> was measured at 30 min intervals for 24 h using a BioTek Synergy HTX multi-mode microplate reader (Northern Vermont, USA). Media with CNB oil was used to determine background absorbance for three independent experiments.
