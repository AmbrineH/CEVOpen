<p id="Par16">Hyphal induction in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> RSY150 was performed according to the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Briefly, a yeast suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL) was prepared from mid logarithmic phase cells in pre-warmed YPD with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and deposited into a 12 well plate with the appropriate amounts of CNB oil to achieve MIC and 1/2 MIC. Control cultures lacked CNB oil. The cells were stained with CFW (0.01 μg/mL) to highlight hyphae and pseudo hyphae after 4 h incubation at 37 °C, and images captured on an AxioObserver Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Germ tubes were identified when the cell projection was equal to the size of the blastospore. Results from three independent experiments were reported as average ± standard deviation.
