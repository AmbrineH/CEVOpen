<p id="Par15">Calcofluor white (CFW) at a concentration of 0.01 μg/mL was used as a chitin specific dye [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to highlight the gross morphology and chitin distribution in CNB oil treated RSY150 along with blood and genital clinical isolates. Cell suspensions at two growth phases each, mid logarithmic (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/mL) and stationary (2.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL), were treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC of CNB oil and imaged on an Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) at 63× magnification (λ
 <sub>ex</sub> = 365 nm; λ
 <sub>em</sub> = 435 nm).
