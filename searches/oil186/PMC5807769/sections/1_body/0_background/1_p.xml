 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a commensal fungi, develops into a resilient pathogen under low host immunity such as that for immunocompromised individuals with HIV/AIDS, and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A limited number of antifungals are available for treating such infections, and the use of these antifungal classes, including azoles, echinocandins, polyenes and allylamines, can be accompanied by side effects. Poor bioavailability requires higher doses, which can ultimately result in resistance and ineffectiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The continued high morbidity following systemic fungal infection and emerging resistance to antifungal agents underscore a clear need for alternatives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this context, essential oils (EOs) are gaining popularity due to their strong antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. EO combinations with other essential oils or existing antifungal agents could vastly reduce the probability of multi-drug resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, comprehensive studies are required to fully assess their independent pharmacological properties and potential side effects prior to consideration for clinical use as antifungal agents.
