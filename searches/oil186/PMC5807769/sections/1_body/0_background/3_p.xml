<p id="Par6">Here, we report a detailed characterization of the anticandidal effects of CNB oil using atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and traditional biochemical assays. AFM quantitative imaging (QI™) is a powerful tool for assessing the impact of antifungals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], nutrient stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], oxidative stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and characterizing yeast genetic mutants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while LSCM imaging of fluorescent markers can delineate defects in intracellular processes. AFM was used to quantify the morphological, ultrastructural and biophysical properties of RSY150 and a clinical isolate exposed to CNB oil. The RSY150 strain of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with RFP tagged histone protein B (Htb-RFP) and GFP tagged β-tubulin (Tub2-GFP) was used to track cell cycle defects in response to CNB oil exposure. Finally biochemical assays were used to verify physiological changes identified by imaging. We report for the first time that CNB oil causes β-tubulin depolymerisation and cell cycle arrest, which we attribute to its major constituent cinnamaldehyde.
