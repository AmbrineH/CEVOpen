  <p>CNB oil decreased cell viability and compromised cell membrane integrity in RSY150. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Growth curves of RSY150 exposed to 125, 62.5, 31.25 and 15.125 µg/mL of CNB oil, with absorbance measured at 30 min intervals to show the antifungal time course of the CNB oil. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Methylene blue staining of cells exposed to CNB concentrations as in (

   <span class="bold">c</span> Corresponding CFU counts of viable CNB exposed cells as compared to control. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Leakage of cellular content as a function of absorbance at 260 nm following exposure to CNB oil at concentrations as in (
