  <p>CNB oil exposure in RSY150 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> caused spindle defects in RSY150 and a delayed cell cycle. Mid logarithmic phase RSY150 cells were treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC oil for 4 h and imaged live by LSCM (Tub2-GFP λ
   <sub>ex</sub> = 488 nm; λ
   <sub>em</sub> = 512 nm and Htb-RFP λ
   <sub>ex</sub> = 543 nm; λ
   <sub>em</sub> = 605 nm). RSY150 were examined for nuclear and spindle localization in budding cells. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Spindle morphologies of MIC and 1/2 MIC CNB oil treated cells and untreated control. Control cells showed normal spindle formation during mitosis (arrow heads) whereas the MIC treated cells had a majority of dividing cells lacking a mitotic spindle (small arrow heads). Cells treated with 1/2 MIC of CNB oil had diminished spindle defects. Despite the spindle defect, the cells completed mitosis. Images are representative from three independent experiments. Bar = 5 μm. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Cell cycle analysis of cells treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC CNB oil and untreated controls. Of cells treated at MIC CNB oil, 14% were in anaphase in comparison to 10% for control cells, whereas 12% of cells exposed to 1/2 MIC CNB oil were in anaphase. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> The number of cells counted for treated and control cells in anaphase were plotted. Double asterisks represent statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05). For each treatment 250 cells were analyzed
