   <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU were spotted on YNB complete media agar containing CFW and CR and examined after 2 days. Treated cells showed greater sensitivity to cell wall stressors. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> The number of colonies on the CR and CFW plates show a dose dependent effect that decreases as a function of oil concentration. The 1/2 MIC CNB oil was more effective than 1/4 MIC, with a significant difference ** between 1/2 MIC oil treatment compared to untreated controls (p &lt; 0.05). The cell count was normalized with treated cells grown on YNB media agar only. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Wild type background strain (CaSS1) and cell wall defective mutants (
   <italic class="italic">SSU81, CRH, DFG</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">VPS</italic>) were exposed to a twofold increasing dilution of CNB oil in a MIC assay, showing overall sensitivity to the CNB oil and indicating a moderate cell wall stress response
