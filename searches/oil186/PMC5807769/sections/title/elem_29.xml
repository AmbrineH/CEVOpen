Adhesive forces in this study are based on the interaction between the cell surface and the hydrophilic, negatively charged silicon nitride AFM tip. Exposure to CNB oil gave rise to a moderate increase in cell adhesion, which may be attributed to cell wall remodelling, as evidenced by concomitant changes in roughness. Changes in adhesion may reflect loss or rearrangement of adhesins, or reorganization of surface sugars [

   <span class="italic">Candida</span>, the pre-mitotic movement of the nuclei through the bud neck and subsequent separation of nuclei are coordinated by microtubules [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>]. In normal cells, nuclear division is complete when the buds are still small, such that larger budding cells are never observed without the nucleus [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>]. In the control cells, two distinct subcellular microtubule structures were observed, one traversing the mother and budding cells and the other only in the mother cells. Anaphase and G2 cell cycle arrest, as well as a more pronounced filamentous growth, were apparent following CNB exposure (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a, c). Cell cycle defects associated with microtubule perturbation were readily visualized in CNB treated RSY150 in which Htb-RFP and Tub2-GFP highlighted the nucleus and microtubules, respectively. Four hours following treatment with CNB at MIC, log phase cells had ablated mitotic spindles, observed as fluorescent patches or aggregates of tubulin (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a). Large-budding cells had nuclear staining restricted to the mother cell (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a, arrow). These results are consistent with previous observations in which tubulin polymerization inhibitors and Δ

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,

We observe anaphase arrest in cells exposed to CNB at MIC, with 14% of the cells in anaphase as compared to 10% in the control, an effect which is reduced at 1/2 MIC. Cells treated at MIC cinnamaldehyde had 15% of cells in anaphase, slightly less than the Δ
   <span class="italic">kar3/Δkar3</span> mutant that had 17% of cells in anaphase and exhibited polarized growth [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Kar3 may mediate microtubule sliding during nuclear fusion and possibly mitosis, interacting with spindle microtubules to produce an inwardly directed force on the poles that antagonizes the CIP8 and KIP1 outward force [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The Δ
   <span class="italic">kar3/Δkar3</span> mutant (RSY35) is no more resistant to CNB oil than wild type, suggesting that Kar3 is not likely the target of CNB oil.

  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed pseudohyphal growth in CNB oil treated RSY150 at MIC, an effect which became less prominent at 1/2 MIC, a common response of yeast experiencing cell wall stress [

  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The multisite impact of CNB oil can be attributed to both its major (cinnamaldehyde) and minor components. Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to compromise cell membrane and wall integrity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], which we observe in this study along with a pronounced spindle defect and anaphase arrest. Minor components, which include limonene (2%), eugenyl acetate (0.6%), linalool (3.9%) and benzyl benzoate (0.6%), also contribute to CNB oil antifungal activity. The synergistic, additive or antagonist activity of these components to modify the overall effect of the oil has yet to be explored. However based on previous reports, these components target the cell membrane and modulate its function, including fluidity and permeability, leading to cell death [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Limonene (2%) has been reported to affect the cell wall in

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. Eugenyl acetate and linalool exhibit anti-virulence activity by inhibiting germ tube formation, and linalool has been reported to arrest cell cycle in the GI phase [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Such studies used higher (mg) concentrations of CNB oil components to produce their effects in comparison with their presence in CNB oil at only 0.6-5%. There remains the possibility of synergies between the CNB oil components.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CNB oil as an antifungal</div>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose that the main component of CNB oil, namely cinnamaldehyde (75%), is responsible for the majority of the cell envelope defects observed in this study. The cell envelope mutants and cell stressor assays demonstrate that the cell wall is moderately affected, reinforced by chitin. Further, the sensitivity of all the cell envelope mutants indicates multiple targets for CNB oil, consistent with its chemical heterogeneity. Our data reports for the first time the depolymerisation of β tubulin leading to cell cycle arrest at MIC of CNB oil. The mitotic spindle defect, a novel finding of this study, we attribute to cinnamaldehyde. The effect was strong at MIC and reduced at 1/2 MIC in cells exposed to either CNB oil or cinnamaldehyde. We propose that membrane disruption may lead to aberrant actin filaments, by virtue of actin’s association with the membrane, and microtubule depolymerisation that ultimately disrupts the mitotic spindle, causing cell cycle arrest. This notion is supported by a finding in 
   <span class="italic">S. cerevisiae</span>, for which both cytoplasmic microtubules and actin filaments are needed for spindle orientation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>], but further study is required to determine the role of actin in tubulin depolymerisation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we suggest that CNB exerts its antifungal effect by targeting multiple cellular sites, including the cell wall, membrane and cell cycle machinery, ultimately leading to cell death induced by cell cycle arrest, a mechanism which requires further study.</p>
