 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calcofluor white (CFW) at a concentration of 0.01 μg/mL was used as a chitin specific dye [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] to highlight the gross morphology and chitin distribution in CNB oil treated RSY150 along with blood and genital clinical isolates. Cell suspensions at two growth phases each, mid logarithmic (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> cells/mL) and stationary (2.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> cells/mL), were treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC of CNB oil and imaged on an Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) at 63× magnification (λ

  <sub>em</sub> = 435 nm).
