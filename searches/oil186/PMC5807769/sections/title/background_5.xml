  <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span>, a commensal fungi, develops into a resilient pathogen under low host immunity such as that for immunocompromised individuals with HIV/AIDS, and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. A limited number of antifungals are available for treating such infections, and the use of these antifungal classes, including azoles, echinocandins, polyenes and allylamines, can be accompanied by side effects. Poor bioavailability requires higher doses, which can ultimately result in resistance and ineffectiveness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. The continued high morbidity following systemic fungal infection and emerging resistance to antifungal agents underscore a clear need for alternatives [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. In this context, essential oils (EOs) are gaining popularity due to their strong antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. EO combinations with other essential oils or existing antifungal agents could vastly reduce the probability of multi-drug resistance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. However, comprehensive studies are required to fully assess their independent pharmacological properties and potential side effects prior to consideration for clinical use as antifungal agents.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cinnamon oil is an aromatic liquid obtained from the twigs, bark and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Extracts of cinnamon bark (CNB) and leaves (CNL) have been used extensively as therapeutics in many cultures since antiquity. The anti-candida activity of CNB oil against planktonic and biofilm culture of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> and 
  <span class="italic">non</span>-
  <span class="italic">albicans</span> spp. has been documented [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The main constituents of CNB oil include trans-cinnamaldehyde, and minor components such as eugenyl acetate, linalool, and benzyl benzoate, each having antifungal activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. CNB oil has been shown to alter cell membrane permeability and fluidity, and inhibit biofilm formation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], but the mechanisms of toxicity remain unknown. On the other hand, each component has been extensively studied, showing effects at various cellular sites, including the cell membrane and cytosol. For example, cinnamaldehyde, the major constituent of CNB oil, targets the membrane and causes increased cell wall thickness in 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], attributed to β-1-3-glucan synthase inhibition as observed in 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The increase in bud scar formation upon cinnamaldehyde exposure also suggests an impact on cell division, resulting in decreased viability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Benzyl benzoate and linalool affect membrane fluidity and induce cell cycle arrest at the G2-M and G1 phases, respectively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] at concentrations greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. We hypothesized that the cell wall and membrane are primary targets of CNB oil, which in turn disrupt intracellular processes vital to 
  <span class="italic">Candida</span> survival.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we report a detailed characterization of the anticandidal effects of CNB oil using atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and traditional biochemical assays. AFM quantitative imaging (QI™) is a powerful tool for assessing the impact of antifungals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], nutrient stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], oxidative stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>] and characterizing yeast genetic mutants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], while LSCM imaging of fluorescent markers can delineate defects in intracellular processes. AFM was used to quantify the morphological, ultrastructural and biophysical properties of RSY150 and a clinical isolate exposed to CNB oil. The RSY150 strain of 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> with RFP tagged histone protein B (Htb-RFP) and GFP tagged β-tubulin (Tub2-GFP) was used to track cell cycle defects in response to CNB oil exposure. Finally biochemical assays were used to verify physiological changes identified by imaging. We report for the first time that CNB oil causes β-tubulin depolymerisation and cell cycle arrest, which we attribute to its major constituent cinnamaldehyde.
