  </div>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative susceptibilities of the RSY150 strain and clinical isolates to CNB oil were determined using a broth microdilution method. The planktonic growth of 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> lab strains (ATCC 64548 and RSY150) was effectively inhibited by 125 μg/mL CNB oil, whereas the clinical strain isolated from blood and the ATCC 10231 strain were more resistant and required higher concentrations (250 μg/mL) of CNB oil to produce an inhibitory effect. This clinical strain isolated from blood was selected for detailed analysis and further experiments. Clinical isolates from blood and genital infections displayed varying susceptibility to CNB oil. In general, a blood isolate was resistant to CNB oil with a MIC of 500 μg/mL, whereas one genital strain was more resistant to CNB oil with a MIC at 1000 μg/mL and the other more susceptible with a MIC of 125 μg/mL. The data is summarized in Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. RSY35, a mutant strain for microtubule motor protein Kar3, showed growth inhibition at 125 μg/mL of CNB oil. Similarly, the growth of RSY150 and RSY35 was inhibited by cinnamaldehyde with a MIC of 112.5 μg/mL. Both strains showed identical response to linalool with MICs at 2.46 mg/mL.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the effects of CNB oil on metabolically active cells were distinct. Logarithmic phase cells exposed to CNB oil for 4 h at MIC and 1/2 MIC had intense chitin staining in the bud neck region and uneven lateral cell wall staining (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>b, e) compared to control cells that stained evenly at the bud and lateral wall. We also observed an increased frequency of elongated cells during exposure to CNB oil at MIC, which became less prominent at 1/2 MIC (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Figure S2a, b). The clinical isolate from blood, on the other hand, showed overall stronger staining than RSY150, with increased intensity at the bud neck upon exposure to CNB oil at MIC and 1/2 MIC (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Figure S3a). In contrast, the genital clinical isolate having a similar MIC to RSY150 showed a normal chitin distribution (Additional file

  </p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the altered phenotype during CNB exposure at sublethal levels, we studied the impact of CNB on hyphal growth. During hyphal induction (10% serum) in the presence of CNB oil, growing hyphae had intense chitin staining at their growing tips. The intensity of chitin staining was higher in cells treated at MIC and decreased progressively as a function of CNB oil concentration, at 1/2 MIC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>c, f). At 1/4 MIC CNB the intensity of CFW staining was comparable to control, however hyphal width remained the same.

  </div>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine whether cell wall integrity was compromised by CNB, RSY150 were exposed to cell wall perturbing agents CR and CFW at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC. Higher sensitivity, reflecting compromised cell wall integrity, was observed in CNB treated cells in comparison to control (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>a) at 1/2 MIC, progressively decreasing to 1/4 MIC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>b). As positive controls, we analyzed mutants lacking genes related to cell wall integrity and to wall organization and biogenesis for their sensitivity to CNB oil treatment. The mutants tested had the following knockouts: 
   <span class="italic">VPS28</span>, a VPS factor required for vacuolar protein sorting; 
   <span class="italic">CRH11</span>, encoding a GPI-anchored cell wall transglycosylase; 
   <span class="italic">SSU81</span>, encoding a function involved in oxidative stress, cell wall biogenesis, and morphogenesis; and 
   <span class="italic">DFG5</span>, encoding an N-linked mannoprotein of the cell wall and membrane. All these mutants exhibit generalized sensitivity to CNB oil, with lower MIC than the wild type strain (CaSS1), further verifying an impact of CNB on cell wall integrity (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>c). The associated MIC decreased two-fold, from 125 μg/mL to 61.5 μg/mL, for all mutants.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RSY150 strain expressing both Tub2-GFP-and Htb-RFP was imaged by LSCM to visualize the mitotic spindle in dividing cells exposed to CNB oil. In untreated cells, the spindle varied in length for the control RSY150 strain, but it consistently spanned the distance between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a) and nuclear migration was normal. In contrast, these well-defined mitotic spindles were missing in RSY150 cells exposed to CNB oil at MIC. Furthermore, Tub2-GFP fluorescence in these cells consistently failed to show the wild type pattern of spindle formation between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>b). Instead, Tub2-GFP often had reduced fluorescence in cells undergoing nuclear division, with only several fluorescence spots visible, indicating disruption of the mitotic spindle. Cells exposed to sub MIC CNB oil had reduced spindle defects, with most of the cells in recovery phase and observed as fluorescent patches or aggregates of tubulin (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>c).

  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RSY150 cells grown to the mid logarithmic phase and exposed to oil for 4 h were imaged by LSCM to view patterns of nuclear division and tubulin distribution in the parent cells and the bud. Budding cells with a single nucleus were considered to be pre-mitosis, representing those in the G1 or S phase. Cells with nuclei traversing the parent and budding cells were considered to be in the anaphase stage of mitosis. Finally, cells having separate nuclei in both parent and budding cells were considered to be at a post-mitotic phase, G2/M. For RSY150 control cells, 52% of the population was in the G1 or S phase; 36% of the cells had undergone mitosis; and the final 10% were in anaphase (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>b, c). On the other hand, RSY150 treated with MIC of CNB oil displayed noticeable differences in cell cycle distribution, with 39% having not begun mitosis, 48% having completed mitosis, and 14% in anaphase, still undergoing nuclear division (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>c). Cells treated with 1/2 MIC were at GI phase (38%), whereas the dominant number of cells were at G2/M phase, with no change in the number of cells undergoing anaphase. Cells treated at MIC with CNB oil showed extended cells with pseudohyphal formation, however the effect was less pronounced in cells treated at 1/2 MIC, where large budding cells were observed (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Figure S2a, b). The data clearly indicate that CNB oil induces tubulin depolymerisation leading to cell cycle arrest at anaphase.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cinnamaldehyde treated 
   <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> showed similar morphological features to CNB oil treated cells (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>: Figure S4), with depolymerized tubulin, resulting in an absence of mitotic spindles. Overall the effect was more pronounced in cinnamaldehyde treated cells as compared to those treated with CNB oil. Cells exposed to cinnamaldehyde at MIC showed a significantly increased percentage of cells in anaphase (15.8%) as compared to control (9.6%), whereas RSY150 cells exposed to linalool were arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as previously reported [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. There was complete disruption of the cell wall at MIC after 4 h, with cells having depolymerized tubulin compared to controls, however the cells showed some tubulin fluorescence at 1/2 MIC, with intact cell walls (Additional file
