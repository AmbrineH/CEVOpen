 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CNB oil analyzed by GC-FID and GC–MS identified several known constituents. The peaks identified by GC-FID were further confirmed with GC–MS and previously reported RI [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The composition of our CNB is shown in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1 (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Figure S1), for which compounds are listed in the order of elution on the HP-5 column. The major compounds (concentrations &gt; 2.0 as relative % peak area from GC-FID and GC–MS) were E-cinnamaldehyde (74%), α-caryophyllene (5.3%), linalool (3.9%) and E-cinnamyl acetate (3.8%). Minor components with known function included limonene (2%), eugenyl acetate (0.6%), α-pinene (0.3%) and benzyl benzoate (0.6%). Another minor constituent was p-cymene (1.4%).
