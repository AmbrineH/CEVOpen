 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the dose dependence of CNB oil over a 24 h period, growth curves were constructed at different concentrations of CNB oil (15.625–125 µg/mL) in YPD media. Growth inhibition was dose dependent with complete inhibition of growth at MIC (125 µg/mL) and increased growth at progressively lower sublethal concentrations: 62.5 μg/mL (1/2 MIC), 31.25 μg/mL (1/4 MIC) and 15.625  µg/mL (1/8 MIC) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a), used for subsequent experiments.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The viability of cells cultured to logarithmic phase after treatment for 4 h with different concentrations of CNB oil (125–62.5 µg/mL) were assessed using the vital dye, methylene blue (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>b), which enters both live and dead cells. Since live cells are able to reduce the dye [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] they become colorless, whereas dead cells remain blue. The cells were non-viable following CNB oil treatment, confirmed by CFU for each CNB oil treatment (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC and control). There was a significant reduction in the number of colonies treated with 1/2 MIC CNB oil in comparison to cells treated at 1/4, 1/8 MIC and control (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>c).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Membrane disruption in CNB oil treated RSY150 cells was assessed as leakage of cellular contents (OD
  <sub>600</sub> = 260 nm) in the supernatant [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. The amount of leaked cellular content increased as a function of CNB oil concentration, from 1/8 MIC to MIC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>d), showing that compromised cell membrane integrity is dose dependent. The positive control amphotericin B showed leakage at MIC.
