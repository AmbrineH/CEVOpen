  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Briefly, mid logarithmic phase 
  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> RSY150 cultures (2.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> cells/mL) were treated with various concentrations (62.5, 31.25 and 15.1 µg/mL corresponding to 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC) of CNB oil at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells fixed with formaldehyde were used as positive controls for staining. The cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS;0.01 M pH 7.4) to ~ 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> CFU/mL, then 100 µL of treated and control cell suspensions mixed with 100 µL methylene blue (0.1 mg/mL stock solution in 2% sodium citrate) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were examined using an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon) at 40× magnification. A minimum of 100 cells in consecutive visual fields were examined and the percentage of stained cells were calculated using the Nikon SPOT software [

  <span class="italic">C. albicans</span> RSY150 (1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC, and 1/8 MIC) along with controls were serially diluted (10
