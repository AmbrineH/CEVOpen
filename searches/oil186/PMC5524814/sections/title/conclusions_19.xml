 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The traditional uses of 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> are close to those of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>, but in a fewer number. Some morphological characters of the first species can discriminate it from the second one, as well as from other 
  <span class="italic">Salvia</span> species. Nevertheless, identification using macro and micromorphological characters can be difficult when the raw herbal material is dried and cut, and is not possible in the case of extracts. In this context, the proposed HPTLC fingerprinting allows to discriminate the species and is suitable for quality control of the herbal material of 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> used in the preparation of herbal products and liquors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the essential oils of 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia, S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> and their hybrid 
  <span class="italic">S</span> x 
  <span class="italic">hegelmaieri</span> is very similar, and mostly in accordance with the chromatographic profile prescribed in the current standards of the European Pharmacopeia, ISO and AENOR for the “Spanish sage oil.” Therefore, 
  <span class="italic">S. blancoana</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">mariolensis</span> and its hybrid should be considered as suitable sources of the oil together with the accepted 
  <span class="italic">S. officinalis</span> subsp. 
  <span class="italic">lavandulifolia</span>. There is no safety concern related to the content of thujone for the consumption of the traditional liquors homemade from these species, since this compound is only found in trace amounts in their essential oils.
