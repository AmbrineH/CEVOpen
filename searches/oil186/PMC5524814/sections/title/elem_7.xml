  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air-dried plant material of each sample (50 g) was submitted to hydrodistillation for 2.5 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus, as described in the European Pharmacopeia (EDQM, 
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2016</a>). Essential oils were stored in amber colored glass vials at 4°C until analysis. Essential oil yields were determined using the same apparatus and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene as collector solvent, and were calculated as the mean of three replicates.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two types of extracts were obtained. Powdered air-dried plant material (0.5 g) was sonicated for 15 min with either 5 mL of ethanol/water (50/50, v/v) or 5 mL of dichloromethane. After centrifugation for 10 min, the extracts were filtered through a membrane filter of 45 μm and the supernatants, which were used as test solutions, were stored at 4°C till used.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reference solutions of eupatorin and rutin used for HPTLC analysis of dichloromethane and hydroalcoholic extracts, respectively, were prepared at a concentration of 3 mg/10 mL in methanol and stored at 4°C till used.</p>
