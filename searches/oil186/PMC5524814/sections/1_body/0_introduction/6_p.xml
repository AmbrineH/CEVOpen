<p class="p">There is a need of a better morphological and chemical knowledge of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic>, which could help the establishment of quality specifications for the herbal materials and improve the opportunities of marketing the herbal preparations thereof such as, teas and traditional liquors under controlled conditions. For this reason, the aims of the present paper were: to analyze the ethnopharmacological knowledge reported about 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> in comparison with S. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>; to clarify the main morphological characters that can help the identification and differentiation of the sages marketed in the studied area; to characterize the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) and comparing its composition with those of closely related taxa; and to develop a method of identification by HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography) to distinguish 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> from other 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> taxa currently found in Valencia region, that could be routinely applied for quality control of herbal material.
