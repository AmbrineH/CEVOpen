<p>The composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia, S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> and their hybrid 
 <italic>S</italic> x 
 <italic>hegelmaieri</italic> is very similar, and mostly in accordance with the chromatographic profile prescribed in the current standards of the European Pharmacopeia, ISO and AENOR for the “Spanish sage oil.” Therefore, 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> and its hybrid should be considered as suitable sources of the oil together with the accepted 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>. There is no safety concern related to the content of thujone for the consumption of the traditional liquors homemade from these species, since this compound is only found in trace amounts in their essential oils.
