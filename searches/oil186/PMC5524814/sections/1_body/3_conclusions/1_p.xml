<p>The traditional uses of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> are close to those of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, but in a fewer number. Some morphological characters of the first species can discriminate it from the second one, as well as from other 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species. Nevertheless, identification using macro and micromorphological characters can be difficult when the raw herbal material is dried and cut, and is not possible in the case of extracts. In this context, the proposed HPTLC fingerprinting allows to discriminate the species and is suitable for quality control of the herbal material of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> used in the preparation of herbal products and liquors.
