 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, and one of 
 <italic>S. x hegelmaieri, S. officinalis</italic> subsp. officinalis, 
 <italic>S. x auriculata</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. microphylla</italic> var.

 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. mariolensis and another of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. lavandulifolia were collected in winter time, with the aim of detecting seasonal changes in their essential oil composition (Table
