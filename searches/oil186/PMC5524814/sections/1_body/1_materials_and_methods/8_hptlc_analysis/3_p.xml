<p>Derivatization of the plates was carried out by dipping with either the Natural Products Reagent (NPR) and the PEG-400 solution (hydroethanolic extracts), or the anisaldehyde solution (dichloromethane extracts). In the case of hydroethanolic extracts, after elution, the plates were dried in cold air for 5 min, heated at 100°C for 3 min and dipped in the NPR solution (1 g of diphenylboric acid aminoethyl ester in 200 mL of ethyl acetate) while still hot. Once the plates were dried, they were subsequently dipped in the PEG-400 solution (10 g of PEG 400 in 200 mL of dichloromethane) and dried. Evaluation was performed under UV light at 366 nm. In the case of dichloromethane extracts, plates were immersed in anisaldehyde solution, prepared according to the European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM,
