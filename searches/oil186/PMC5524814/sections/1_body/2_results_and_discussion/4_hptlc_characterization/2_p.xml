 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref> shows the HPTLC chromatograms of the hydroalcoholic extracts examined under UV light at 366 nm after derivatization with NPR and PEG-400 solution. With this system, the chromatographic profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis, S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. x 
 <italic class="italic">hegelmaieri</italic> were very similar to each other with only slight differences concerning the intensities of certain zones. The only remarkable difference is a fluorescent blue zone at Rf 0.4 present in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>, which is not observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> nor in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. x 
 <italic class="italic">hegelmaieri</italic>. High similarity is also observed between 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. x auriculata</italic>, which, nevertheless, could be distinguished from the former three thanks to the presence of one additional orange fluorescent zone in the lower third of the chromatogram and the much higher intensity of the lower of the two orange fluorescent zones present in the middle third. Finally, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. microphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">microphylla</italic> showed a clearly different chromatographic profile from all other taxa analyzed, mainly due to the presence, in the middle third, of one intense blue fluorescent zone (Rf 0.45) and a yellow fluorescent zone (Rf 0.49), which are absent in the other taxa. Thus, the fingerprints obtained with the hydroalcoholic extracts are not useful enough for the distinction of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic>. Although these two taxa have partially similar uses, they do not have overlapping distribution and the former constitutes a local resource for inland highland areas of Alicante province. For a potential commercialization and valorization of the traditional beverage “salvieta,” used only in this area, it is worth to set up a suitable HPTLC system for differentiating these two species.
