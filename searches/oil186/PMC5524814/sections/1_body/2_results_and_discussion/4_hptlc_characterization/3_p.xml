<p>The HPTLC analysis of dichloromethane extracts derivatized with anisaldehyde reagent and examined under daylight or UV 366 nm, provided characteristic fingerprints for most of the taxa analyzed, as it is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. All samples of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> (SB1-SB5) showed a homogeneous fingerprint, which was similar to the one obtained with 
 <italic>S. x hegelmaieri</italic>, a hybrid of the former, botanically very close. These two taxa were clearly differentiated from the others by two zones observed at daylight, appearing in the lower part of the chromatogram (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), at Rf 0.12 (red-brown) and Rf 0.19 (gray-blue). Furthermore, examination of the plate under UV light at 366 nm (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) showed three blue fluorescent bands at Rf 0.12, Rf 0.14 and Rf 0.50 which were absent in the other taxa. Therefore, all these zones might be considered as specific markers for 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. x 
 <italic>hegelmaieri</italic>. In the case of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, a blue-green zone in the middle third (Rf 0.45) of the chromatogram observed under white light (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) appears to be characteristic of this taxon. This zone is also seen under UV light at 366 nm as a greenish gray zone (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The fingerprints of the cultivated species 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>officinalis, S</italic>. x 
 <italic>auriculata</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. microphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic>microphylla</italic> showed visible differences after derivatization of the plates with anisaldehyde and observation under white light (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).
