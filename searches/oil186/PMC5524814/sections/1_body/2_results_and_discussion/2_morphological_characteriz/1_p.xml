<p>It is a common criterion to consider 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic>, traditionally cultivated in Spain for centuries, as an introduced species from the Eastern Mediterranean along with other species, such as, 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. x auriculata</italic> Mill., an hybrid of both (Reales et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Concerning 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, its independence (as 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic>) was recognized by several authors. Nevertheless, Bolòs and Vigo (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and, more recently, Reales et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) subordinated it to 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, mainly due to the high coincidence of the indumentum of the calyx. This criterion is nowadays internationally accepted (TPL, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and has been followed in the present work. 
 <italic>S. microphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic>microphylla</italic>, a foreign species coming from Mexico (Valdés et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), cultivated in this area for more than 150 years, is also used in Valencian folk medicine together with 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>officinalis, S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia, S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. x auriculata</italic>. All of them have been collected for morphological and chemical characterization.
