<p>Macro and micromorphological characters are useful for the identification of the different Iberian 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> subgenus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> taxa related to 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>. As it is shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, leaves of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> are oblanceolate, while those of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic> are linear-lanceolate and those of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> are ovate. 
 <italic>Salvia blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> present persistent upper floral bracts in contrast with the rest. The presence of cup-shaped glandular trichomes and long patent eglandular trichomes can separate it from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia. Salvia blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>vellerea</italic>, with different distribution areas, exhibit different type of leaves, the second lacking sessile glands. 
 <italic>Salvia microphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic>microphylla</italic> (subgenus 
 <italic>Calosphace</italic>), is not included in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> due to its distinct morphology, especially its delta-shaped leaves and red flowers, which clearly differentiates it from the other sages. The raw herbal material from all these taxa is frequently dried and cut before marketed, making even more difficult its identification. Therefore, other techniques, such as, chemical profiling, are useful.
