<p class="p">It is the first time that the detailed composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mariolensis</italic> is described. Only some preliminary data were previously published by us (Martínez-Francés et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). In the present work, the essential oils distilled from the air-dried aerial parts of seven samples of this taxon (SB1–SB7), collected in different locations and including wild and cultivated plant material, were submitted to exhaustive analysis by GC-FID and GC-MS. The results, which are shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">4</xref> (main constituents) and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref> (complete list of constituents), were compared with those given by the oils of three samples of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic> (SL1–SL3). In addition, the composition of the essential oil of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. x 
 <italic class="italic">hegelmaieri</italic>, the hybrid of the two former taxa growing in the same geographical area, is reported for the first time (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref>).
