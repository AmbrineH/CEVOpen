<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, after a single oral dose of 50 μL, has shown to improve cognitive function in healthy humans compared to placebo, specially the performance of secondary memory and attention tasks (Kennedy et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This effect has been mainly related to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the oil, 1,8-cineol followed by α-pinene being the most active constituents (Perry et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kennedy et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Taking in account the similarity in composition with the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic>, which is particularly rich in 1,8-cineol, the effect on cognitive function could also be expected from the oil of this species.
