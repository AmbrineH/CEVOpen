<p>In order to investigate seasonal variations in the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>, two samples were collected at winter time (SB7 and SL3, respectively). In general, the chromatographic profile of the latter was inside the range found for spring-early summer samples of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic>. Nevertheless, in the case of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic>, the essential oil of the winter sample (SB7) showed a significantly higher percentage of 1,8-cineole and a lower percentage of camphor, the two major constituents, when compared to the essential oils from samples collected in late spring-early summer (SB1â€“SB6).
