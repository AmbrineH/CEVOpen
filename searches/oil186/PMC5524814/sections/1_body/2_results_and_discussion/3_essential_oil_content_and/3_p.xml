<p>More than 98% of each essential oil was identified, which, considering all the samples analyzed, involved a total of 174 constituents. In all cases, the main group of constituents were oxygenated monoterpenes (46.5–71.2%), followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (21.3–41.1%). The essential oil of 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> is characterized by 1,8-cineole (13.7–45.7%) and camphor (12.1–28.6%) as major constituents, followed by myrcene (3.0–5.6%), α-pinene (3.0–7.4%), camphene (4.2–8.5%), β-pinene (5.0–7.6%), limonene (1.7–5.0%), and borneol (0.8–7.4%). Among sesquiterpenes (2.6–8.5%), β-caryophyllene (0.2–3.5%), β-caryophyllene oxide (0.3–1.2%), and spathulenol (0.2–1.3%) reached the higher percentages. The essential oil of 
 <italic>S</italic>. x 
 <italic>hegelmaieri</italic> showed a similar pattern, with 1,8-cineole (40.0%), camphor (15.9%), α-pinene (6.0%), camphene (5.8%), β-pinene (5.8%), myrcene (4.3%), borneol (3.4%), and limonene (3.3%) as the main constituents.
