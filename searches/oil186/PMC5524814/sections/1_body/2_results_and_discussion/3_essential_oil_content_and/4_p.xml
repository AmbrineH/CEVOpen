<p>As it can be seen in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, the essential oils of the three taxa analyzed showed a similar profile, mainly concerning their major constituents. They are, in general, in accordance with those previously reported for the essential oils from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic> (Lawrence et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Marcos Sanz et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Martínez-Francés et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Usano-Alemany, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), with 1,8-cineole and camphor as major constituents. However, some minor distinguishing features could be recognized. In fact, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene was found in the three samples of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic> in a range from 2.0 to 3.3%, while it did not reach 1% either in 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic> or in 
 <italic>S</italic>. x 
 <italic>hegelmaieri</italic>. Furthermore, the phenylpropanoid estragole was detected in traces in only one sample from 
 <italic>S. blancoana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>mariolensis</italic>, whereas it was found in 
 <italic>S</italic>. x 
 <italic>hegelmaieri</italic> (0.8%) and two samples of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lavandulifolia</italic> (0.8 and 2.2%).
