  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span>. The SPME fiber 75-μm carboxen/ polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) (preconditioned for 6 min at 240 °C) was used for analysis. The dried powdered seeds (300 mg) were hermetically sealed in 4 ml vial. The SPME fiber holder was then introduced into the vial. Both sample and fiber were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C as predefined extraction time and temperature, respectively. After extraction, the fiber was withdrawn from the sample and thermally introduced into the injection port of the GC–MS for desorption for 3 min at 240 °C in splitless mode. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The alkane solution (C
  <sub>7</sub>–C
  <sub>30</sub> in n-hexane) performed by headspace extraction during 30 min, at 60 °C, was used to calculate the retention indices.
