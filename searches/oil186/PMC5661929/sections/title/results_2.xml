 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were the most volatile fractions identified by HD and HS-SPME coupled to GC-MS but their quality and amount were quite different according to the extraction methodology. The main phenolic compounds identified by HPLC were caffeic acid, followed by cinnamic acid and gallic acid. 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> seeds essential oils showed significant antioxidant activity in DPPH (IC
  <sub>50</sub> value = 1.5 mg/mL), H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> scavenging assay (IC
  <sub>50</sub> value = 159.43 μg/mL) and reducing power test (IC
  <sub>50</sub> value = 0.982 mg/mL) compared to methanolic extract. Moreover, the results revealed that the essential oil was able to protect RBC from hemolysis induced by H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>. However, the methanolic extract had no effect on H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>-induced hemolysis of RBC as compared to the essential oil and the standard vitamin C.
