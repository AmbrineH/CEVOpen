  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> seeds, accounting for 71.25 g/100 g DW, followed by protein with 12.54 g/100 g DW. According to Pearson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] plant food that provides more than 12% of its calorific value from protein is considered a good source of protein. The fat yield of the seed was 5.61 g/100 g DW. This value was lower than the values reported for oily seeds such as soybean [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Therefore, the seed could not be classified as oily seed due to the low oil content.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seeds showed a considerable amount of ash (2.58 g/100 g DW) that may indicate the presence of considerable amounts of inorganic nutrients in this plant. All these values were in the range usually found in some cereals including quinoa, amaranth, purple corn and rice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The energetic contribution of 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> seed was also important (385.65 kcal/100 g DW). The mineral content of the 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> seeds have been found in 2.58 g/100 g DW ash content. Also, it is important to investigate the composition of minerals in plants because they have a basic role in our diet. The composition of macroelements (K, Mg, Ca, Na) and microelements (Fe, Zn, Mn) in seeds of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> is detailed in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. As can be seen, potassium (an essential nutrient for the synthesis of proteins) was found to be the major nutrients detected in the seeds followed by Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Na. Ca intake helps to prevent and treat a variety of bone-related illnesses, such as osteoporosis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The predominant microelement in the seed sample was Fe (3.05 g/100 g DW). The content of minerals presents similar values to those reported for other cereals and pseudocereals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Moreover, food consumed by the citizens of underdeveloped countries are poor in important elements, namely Fe and Zn, and increased consumption of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> might be useful to reward their daily needs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we can see, the consumption of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> could cover nutritional requirements like quinoa, rice, purple corn, and amaranth. It is demonstrated that such nutraceutical and functional food ingredients have a physiological benefit and provide protection against many chronic diseases. Furthermore, they can exert a role in controlling lipid metabolism and the prevention of dyslipidaemia both in animal models and in humans [
