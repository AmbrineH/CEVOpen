 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in this study, the seeds of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> are a rich source of phenolic compounds (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The total phenolic content was 102.7 mg GAE /g, while total flavonoid content was 31.62 mg CAE/g DW. These results corroborate previous works which described important polyphenol contents in roots, stem barks and leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Although the TPC values for 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> in the present study were lower compared to the ethyl acetate extract of 
  <span class="italic">P. mannii</span> (314 mg GAE/g) .

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To our best of knowledge, there have been no studies dealing with the identification of polyphenols from 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira.</span> The HPLC analysis of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> seeds recorded at 280 nm revealed the presence of five phenolic acids (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Phenolic acids were characterized by the predominance of caffeic acid (38.57 mg/g) followed by ferulic acid (20.07 mg/g), 
  <span class="italic">p-</span>coumaric acid (12.85 mg/g), cinnamic acid (5.14 mg/g) and gallic acid (1.03 mg/g) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Phenolic compounds that have been detected in 
  <span class="italic">P. angustifolium</span> include quercetin glycosides rutin, isoquercitrin dicaffeoylquinic acid [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. It has been reported that such compounds exhibit diverse therapeutic and biological properties that may justify the use of 
  <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> in traditional medicine.
