   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] plant food that provides more than 12% of its calorific value from protein is considered a good source of protein. The fat yield of the seed was 5.61 g/100 g DW. This value was lower than the values reported for oily seeds such as soybean [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Therefore, the seed could not be classified as oily seed due to the low oil content.

  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seeds showed a considerable amount of ash (2.58 g/100 g DW) that may indicate the presence of considerable amounts of inorganic nutrients in this plant. All these values were in the range usually found in some cereals including quinoa, amaranth, purple corn and rice [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The energetic contribution of 
   <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> seed was also important (385.65 kcal/100 g DW). The mineral content of the 
   <span class="italic">Pittosporum</span> seeds have been found in 2.58 g/100 g DW ash content. Also, it is important to investigate the composition of minerals in plants because they have a basic role in our diet. The composition of macroelements (K, Mg, Ca, Na) and microelements (Fe, Zn, Mn) in seeds of 
   <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> is detailed in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. As can be seen, potassium (an essential nutrient for the synthesis of proteins) was found to be the major nutrients detected in the seeds followed by Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Na. Ca intake helps to prevent and treat a variety of bone-related illnesses, such as osteoporosis [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The predominant microelement in the seed sample was Fe (3.05 g/100 g DW). The content of minerals presents similar values to those reported for other cereals and pseudocereals [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Moreover, food consumed by the citizens of underdeveloped countries are poor in important elements, namely Fe and Zn, and increased consumption of

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we can see, the consumption of 
   <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> could cover nutritional requirements like quinoa, rice, purple corn, and amaranth. It is demonstrated that such nutraceutical and functional food ingredients have a physiological benefit and provide protection against many chronic diseases. Furthermore, they can exert a role in controlling lipid metabolism and the prevention of dyslipidaemia both in animal models and in humans [

However, some differences in the amounts of major components were detected according to the extraction methods. As appears from Table

Moreover, monoterpenes hydrocarbons (0.357%) and alcohols (5.796%) were not detected using SPME extraction. It is noteworthy that the HS-SPME analysis, had favored a qualitative estimation of the volatile components using a small amount of plant.

  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reducing power assay was commonly reported as a simple and robust method for measuring antioxidant power. This test is based on the conversion of Fe

   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, the tested oil had slightly lower antioxidant potential than BHT (EC

  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the results obtained from the three methods have shown that 
   <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> exhibited an important antioxidant activity. The obtained results are in agreement with several reports. Notably, the recent study of Dong et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], demonstrated that essential oil from 
   <span class="italic">Chuanminshen violaceum</span> had potent antioxidant activity in vitro when compared to other sub-fraction like ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol and chloroform fraction. However, findings of Mohamed et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>] suggested that methanolic extract of 
   <span class="italic">Commiphora myrrha</span> exhibited higher DPPH scavenging capacity than the essential oil. These results suggested that there is a relationship between the chemical composition of aromatic plants and their antioxidant activity. According to our results, the antioxidant activity of 
   <span class="italic">P. tobira</span> seed essential oil might be attributed to the presence of biologically active component such as spathulenol, λ-gurjunene, camphor and isospathulenol. Spathulenol was found to be the important component in many medicinal plants such as 
   <span class="italic">Stachys inflata</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Kundmannia syriaca</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Additionally, previous studies showed the immunomodulatory effects of spathulenol identified from 
   <span class="italic">Salvia spinosa</span> essential oil [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Moreover, studies of Martins et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], have demonstrated the anti-tumor potential of spathulenol.
  </p>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite all these investigations, it is difficult to attribute the antioxidant activity to the major active compounds of the essential oil. Indeed, it is also important to take into account minor compounds for their antioxidant activities [

  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in human body and possess many biological characteristics enabling them to ensure drug transport.
