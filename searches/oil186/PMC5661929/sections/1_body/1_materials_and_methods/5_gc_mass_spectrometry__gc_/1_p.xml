 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic>. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 and 290 °C, respectively. The VF-5MS capillary column was about 30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness and the column temperature was programmed from 50 to 280 °C at 5 °C/ min and the flow rate of the carrier gas (Helium) was 1.0 mL/ min. A sample of 1.0 μL was injected, using splitless mode. Mass spectrometry was in ionization energy mode at 70 eV (scan range 40–450 m/z). Retention indices were determined by injection of the samples under the same condition of series of n-alkanes (C

Identification of components was done by comparison of their retention times with those of pure molecules purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and by comparing their mass spectra with our own library of spectra built from pure essential oils constituents, NIST library data of the GC-MS system and from published sources.
