<p id="Par19">Moisture, protein, fat, and ash were determined using the AOAC process (1990) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The ash content was determined after heat treatment at 600 ± 15 °C. Total carbohydrates have been calculated by removing from 100% the amount of moisture, total fat, protein and ash. Energy has been calculated using this equation: Energy (kcal) = 4 × (g protein + g carbohydrate) + 9 × (g fat). Mineral elements analyses were performed using the method of Rjeibi et al. [
