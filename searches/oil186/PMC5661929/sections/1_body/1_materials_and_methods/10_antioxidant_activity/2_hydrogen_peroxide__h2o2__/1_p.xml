<p id="Par28">This test was done according to the method reported by Sahreen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Different sample concentration (1 mL) were mixed with 2.4 mL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 0.6 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution (40 mM). The mixture was shaken vigorously and incubated at room temperature for 10 min vitamin C was used as positive control. The absorbance was measured at 230 nm. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity (%) = 1− Absorbance 
 <sub>sample</sub> / Absorbance 
 <sub>control</sub> × 100.
