<p id="Par50">This study shows, for the first time, the aroma compounds composition of 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> using hydrodistillation and HS-SPME coupled to GC-MS. Results revealed that the predominant components are sesquiterpenes and that the quality and the quantity of the essential oil vary according to the extraction methodology. This essential oil showed high antioxidant activity and significant inhibitory activity against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced hemolysis. Our findings suggested that 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> could be considered as a novel source of natural antioxidant that may be used to protect the human body against disease caused by free radicals.
