<p id="Par39">To our best of knowledge, there have been no studies dealing with the identification of polyphenols from 
 <italic>P. tobira.</italic> The HPLC analysis of 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> seeds recorded at 280 nm revealed the presence of five phenolic acids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Phenolic acids were characterized by the predominance of caffeic acid (38.57 mg/g) followed by ferulic acid (20.07 mg/g), 
 <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid (12.85 mg/g), cinnamic acid (5.14 mg/g) and gallic acid (1.03 mg/g) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Phenolic compounds that have been detected in 
 <italic>P. angustifolium</italic> include quercetin glycosides rutin, isoquercitrin dicaffeoylquinic acid [

 <italic>P. tobira</italic> in traditional medicine.
