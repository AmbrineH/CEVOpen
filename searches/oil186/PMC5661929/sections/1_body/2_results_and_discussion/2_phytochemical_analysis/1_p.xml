<p id="Par38">As shown in this study, the seeds of 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> are a rich source of phenolic compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The total phenolic content was 102.7 mg GAE /g, while total flavonoid content was 31.62 mg CAE/g DW. These results corroborate previous works which described important polyphenol contents in roots, stem barks and leaves of 
 <italic>Pittosporum</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although the TPC values for 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> in the present study were lower compared to the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic> (314 mg GAE/g) .
