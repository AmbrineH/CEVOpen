<p id="Par34">The composition in total fat, moisture, protein, carbohydrate and ash contents are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Carbohydrate seems the predominant component of 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> seeds, accounting for 71.25 g/100 g DW, followed by protein with 12.54 g/100 g DW. According to Pearson [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] plant food that provides more than 12% of its calorific value from protein is considered a good source of protein. The fat yield of the seed was 5.61 g/100 g DW. This value was lower than the values reported for oily seeds such as soybean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the seed could not be classified as oily seed due to the low oil content.
