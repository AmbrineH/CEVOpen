 <italic class="italic">Pittosporum</italic> seed was also important (385.65 kcal/100 g DW). The mineral content of the 
 <italic class="italic">Pittosporum</italic> seeds have been found in 2.58 g/100 g DW ash content. Also, it is important to investigate the composition of minerals in plants because they have a basic role in our diet. The composition of macroelements (K, Mg, Ca, Na) and microelements (Fe, Zn, Mn) in seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> is detailed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. As can be seen, potassium (an essential nutrient for the synthesis of proteins) was found to be the major nutrients detected in the seeds followed by Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Na. Ca intake helps to prevent and treat a variety of bone-related illnesses, such as osteoporosis [
