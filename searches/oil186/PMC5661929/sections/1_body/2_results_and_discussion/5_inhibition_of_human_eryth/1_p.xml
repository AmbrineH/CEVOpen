<p id="Par49" class="p">The erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in human body and possess many biological characteristics enabling them to ensure drug transport. The excess of ROS can generate oxidative stress conditions that could damage the erythrocyte membrane lipids and proteins and possibly lead to hemolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Given so, in this experimental work, we aimed for the first time to assess whether 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> prevents damages to erythrocyte membrane or not. Therefore, RBC (red blood cells) were chosen as easy biological design. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> seeds oil inhibited the hemolysis of erythrocytes in a dose-dependent pattern. The maximum of anti-hemolytic activity was observed at 63.64% with 200 μg/mL of essential oil and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was 116.54 μg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Results demonstrated that essential oil protected erythrocytes from H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced hemolysis. However, the methanolic extract at the concentration from 10 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL, have no effects on RBC. Accordingly, essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> seeds may contain more anti-hemolytic compounds as compared to methanolic extract. Moreover, the antioxidant compounds present in 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> might be responsible for the anti-hemolytic activities. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained by Miyazaki et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], who reported the protective effect of natural antioxidant against the degradation of RBC membrane by ROS.
