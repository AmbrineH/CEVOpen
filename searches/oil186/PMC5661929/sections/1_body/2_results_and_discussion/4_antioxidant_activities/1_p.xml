<p id="Par44">As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the DPPH scavenging activity of all samples increased in a manner dependent on the concentration. At the concentration of 10 mg/mL, 
 <italic>P. tobira</italic> seeds essential oil showed the highest radical scavenging activity value (89.24%) but significantly lower than the vitamin C and BHT (95.97% and 93.66%, respectively) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). More precisely, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the tested oil (1.5 ± 0.21 mg/mL) was less efficient than that of the standards BHT (0.093 ± 0.004 mg/mL) and vitamin C (0.0105 mg/mL) (Table
