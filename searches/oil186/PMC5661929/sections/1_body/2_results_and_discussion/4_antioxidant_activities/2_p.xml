 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) scavenging ability with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 159.43 ± 2.7 and 308.57 μg/mL for essential oil and methanolic extract, respectively. Thus, IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of essential oil were 1.93-fold more efficient than the methanolic extract but less efficient than vitamin C (IC
