<p id="Par46">The reducing power assay was commonly reported as a simple and robust method for measuring antioxidant power. This test is based on the conversion of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> under the effect of essential oils. In agreement with DPPH and (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) scavenging assays, reducing power method showed that essential oils exhibited good antioxidant activity. Thereby, the reducing powers of the tested samples increased when their concentrations were increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the tested oil had slightly lower antioxidant potential than BHT (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.384 ± 0.102 mg/mL for BHT and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.982 ± 0.24 mg/mL for tested oil), but better than methanolic extract.
