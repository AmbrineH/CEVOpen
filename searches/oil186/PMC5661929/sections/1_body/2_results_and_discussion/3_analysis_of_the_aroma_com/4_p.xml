 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, a remarkable amount of himachalene (10.493%) was detected by HS-SPME, while it was completely absent in comparison to the aromas obtained from HD. Moreover, monoterpenes hydrocarbons (0.357%) and alcohols (5.796%) were not detected using SPME extraction. It is noteworthy that the HS-SPME analysis, had favored a qualitative estimation of the volatile components using a small amount of plant. Finally, further works on the HS-SPME are needed to improve the extraction efficiency such as selection of fiber, optimization of extraction time and temperature [
