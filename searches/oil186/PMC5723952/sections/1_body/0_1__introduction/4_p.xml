<p>To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported in literature on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic>. In this paper, different aerial parts of the 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> were used to obtain essential oil, infusion, decoct, and hydroalcoholic macerate. The solid plant materials (dried leaves and inflorescences), the essential oil of dried inflorescences, and the obtained aqueous or hydroalcoholic extracts from dried petals, leaves, and seeds were characterized by chromatographic or/and spectrophotometric methods.
