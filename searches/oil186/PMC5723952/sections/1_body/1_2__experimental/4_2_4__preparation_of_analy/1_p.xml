<p>A 500 μg/mL stock solution of gallic acid (GA) was prepared by dissolving 0.0125 g GA in distilled water, brought to 25 mL in a volumetric flask. A working solution of 50 μg GA/mL was obtained by dilution from the stock solution. A stock quercetin (Q) solution of 1 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving 0.0250 g Q in 96% ethanol and brought to 25 mL in a volumetric flask. A working solution of 100 μg Q/mL was obtained from the stock solution, by dilution with 96% ethanol. A 0.05% ethanolic solution of DPPH· was prepared just before use.</p>
