<p>The GC-MS analysis revealed that the number of volatile components of the hydrodistilled essential oil of inflorescences was different from that of the dry plant material (leaves and inflorescences) undergoing headspace extraction. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1</xref> shows the relative content of volatile compounds from leaves, inflorescences, and essential oil of inflorescences of 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> growing in Romania, expressed as percentage from the total area. Thus, using headspace, twenty-two compounds were identified in leaves accounting for 99.0% of the total identified components, with α-pinene (46.0%), β-phellandrene (24.6%), sabinene (9.6%), and germacrene D (6.1%) as the main components. The flowers of 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> contained thirty-three components (98.6%), with the same principal constituents, but in different percentages: α-pinene (40.1%), germacrene D (24.0%), β-phellandrene (13.9%), and sabinene (9.7%). The total number of identified components of the essential oil of inflorescences was forty-one, representing 95.9% of total areas. The same components were the main volatile compounds of the essential oil, with β-phellandrene (26.09%), germacrene D (21.6%), α-pinene (16.3%), and sabinene (12.0%).
