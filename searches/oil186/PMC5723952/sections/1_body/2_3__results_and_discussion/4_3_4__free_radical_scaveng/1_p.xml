<p>As mentioned, polyphenolic and flavonoid compounds are considered to have significant antioxidant properties mainly due to their important content in hydroxyl groups. These substances are able to act as radical scavengers because phenolic hydroxyl groups are good H-donating antioxidants, which scavenge reactive oxygen species and stop the production of new radicals. The stable DPPH路 radical is often used to assess the radical scavenging activity of many biological active compounds. DPPH路 has the property to accept an electron from an antioxidant. This redox reaction leads to the decrease of the violet color of the DPPH路 radical. The total reaction antioxidant-DPPH路 leads to a yellow-colored solution. A low EC50 value denotes a high scavenging activity. As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>, the extracts obtained from petals present the lowest values of EC50 with a minimum in the case of macerate extract. As about relationship between EC50 and TPC values, generally, negatively linear correlations are reported in literature. But, there is not always a linear correlation between these two analytical parameters. In our study, negative linear correlations were obtained in the case of infusions and macerate extracts (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). Cheynier et al. assumed that besides the radical scavenging, the antioxidant activities could also be attributed to other different mechanisms such as binding of transition metal ion catalysts or decomposition of peroxides [

At the same time, the radical scavenging activity of polyphenols depends on their molecular structure, respectively, on the availability of phenolic hydrogen and the possibility of stabilization of the resulting HO and NO radicals via hydrogen donation [
