<p class="p">As about flavonoids, from the data reported in the literature, the major assays for the total flavonoids content determination are generally based of the absorbance of Al(III)-flavonoids compounds [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The difference between the two mostly applied spectrophotometric methods is the reaction medium: (a) in the presence of NaNO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in alkaline medium and (b) in the presence of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COOK or CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COONH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (without nitrite). In our work, the spectrophotometric method in the absence of nitrite was used. This last one method can be only used to determine the content of flavonols (quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, and morin) and luteolin (from flavones family) [
