<p>The obtained results on 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> extracts indicate significant antioxidant activity, especially of macerate of petals (resulted by applying Folin–Ciocalteu, total flavonoids, and DPPH· assays). Also, leaves, inflorescences, and the inflorescences' essential oil of 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> were found to be rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (especially, α-pinene in leaves and inflorescences and β-phellandrene and germacrene D, in inflorescence essential oil). Further studies will complete the characterization of 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic>. They will be focused both on the complete analysis of the composition of the aqueous and hydroalcoholic 
 <italic>Rudbeckia triloba</italic> extracts and on their biochemical characterization.
