  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span> was collected in August 2016 from particular gardens placed in a limitrophe rural area of Bucharest, Romania (Islaz village, Branesti commune, Ilfov county, latitude: 44.46117°; longitude: 26.38724°; altitude, 70 m; Bucharest distance, 6.92 km). The plant was authenticated at the Bucharest Botanical Garden, where the voucher specimen was deposited (406406/30.03.2017). After collection, the plant material was separated into its principal aerial components: inflorescences, petals, leaves, and seeds which were washed thoroughly with water to remove dust. Then, the vegetable materials were let aside to dry at room temperature. The dried components of the plant were cut into small pieces and kept in paper bags until further experiments.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Preparation of Plant Extracts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infusion, decoction, and maceration were applied on three aerial parts of the plant, namely, petals, seeds, and leaves. Before infusion and decoction, the weighed amount of dry vegetable material (1 g) was soaked with a small volume of cold bidistilled water and left aside for 10 min. This preliminary procedure allows the plant cells to expand and thus to release their active ingredients when preparing the infusion or decoction. The infusion was prepared by adding 50 mL of bidistilled boiled water to the wet vegetable material. The mixture was covered with a watch glass, left to stand for 15 minutes. The decoction was made by boiling the wet plant material with 50 mL of water for 10 min. After that, the mixture was left aside for 15 min. The hydroalcoholic extract was prepared by macerating 0.5 g of the vegetable material in 50 mL of 70% ethanol for 7 days, in dark, at ambient temperature. Then, each plant extract was filtered through a filter paper. The filtrate was quantitatively transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and brought to the mark with bidistilled water (in the case of infusion and decoct) and with 70% ethanol (in the case of macerate), to obtain the diluted extracts. Parts of the obtained filtrate extracts were stored at −45°C for further analyses. The essential oil was isolated from dried inflorescences, by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus, for 4 h, using a standard procedure [
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. The essential oil was dried on anhydrous Na
   <sub>2</sub>SO
   <sub>4</sub> and stored at +4°C. The quantity of essential oil from plant was expressed in percentage (v/w), as an average of the values obtained from five extractions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GC-MS analyses were carried out with a Thermo Electron system (Focus GC chromatograph coupled with a Polaris Q ion trap mass detector). A DB-5MS capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm of film thickness) was used with helium as carrier gas (1 mL/min). GC oven was programmed at an initial temperature of 60°C for 3 min. The temperature was increased up to 200°C at the rate of 10°C/min, kept constant for 2 min, and then increased up to 240°C at the rate of 12°C/min and held at 240°C for 2 min [
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Both injector and detector temperatures were 250°C. The electronic impact ionization mode was 70 eV, and the detection was performed in the range of 35–300 amu (full scan mode). The identification of the components was carried out using Xcalibur® software, NIST Mass Spectral Library, and MS literature data. Retention indices (RIs) of the compounds were determined relative to the retention times of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes standard solution for GC (C8–C20). Relative percent of individual components was calculated based on the GC peak areas without the use of correction factors. For GC-MS analysis, the hydrodistilled essential oil was diluted in hexane (1 : 100) and 1 µL was injected. A Triplus HS Autosampler (Thermo Electron) was used for headspace analysis, an amount of 1 g of inflorescences or leaves being introduced in a sample vial (20 mL size) and sealed with silicone rubber septum and aluminium cap. The headspace vial containing the plant material was heated to 80°C for 10 min, and 500 μL of the headspace gas was injected into the column. The GC-MS analysis was performed in the same way as for essential oils.

The mixtures were homogenized and kept in darkness for 30 min, at room temperature. Then, absorbance measurements were made at 517 nm against reagent blank (for each sample, a blank mixture was prepared without adding DPPH·). The DPPH· solution was freshly prepared and kept in a refrigerator until used. EC50 value was obtained by plotting the absorbance at 517 nm versus concentration of extract solutions. The concentration (%, v/v) of the sample solution that decreases the initial absorbance of DPPH· by 50% represents EC50.
