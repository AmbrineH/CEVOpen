 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DPPH· free radical scavenging activity of the obtained herbal extracts was determined according to Shimada et al. with slight modification [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Aliquots of filtrate extracts (0.01–0.3 mL) were mixed with ethanol up to 1.9 mL. Then, 0.1 mL of 0.05% ethanolic solution of DPPH· was added to each sample up to a total volume of 2 mL. A standard solution containing 0.1 mL of 0.05% DPPH· and 1.9 mL ethanol was also prepared. The mixtures were homogenized and kept in darkness for 30 min, at room temperature. Then, absorbance measurements were made at 517 nm against reagent blank (for each sample, a blank mixture was prepared without adding DPPH·). The DPPH· solution was freshly prepared and kept in a refrigerator until used. EC50 value was obtained by plotting the absorbance at 517 nm versus concentration of extract solutions. The concentration (%, v/v) of the sample solution that decreases the initial absorbance of DPPH· by 50% represents EC50.
