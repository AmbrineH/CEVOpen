 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For centuries, herb plants are used as a source of medicine. World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the world's population resort to folk medicine for their primary healthcare needs [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. In this context, natural products, such as plant extracts, either as pure compounds or as standardized extracts, provide unlimited opportunities for new drug discoveries [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. Also, vegetable materials are used from ancient time as source of flavoring, beverages, fragrances, and cosmetics products. This is because the plant materials have unique properties to synthesize biologically active compounds resulted as metabolites from their so-called secondary metabolism [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. Between the four major classes of bioactive secondary metabolites (terpenes, phenolics, glycosides, and alkaloids), the phenolic compounds (derived from secondary metabolism of the aromatic amino acids) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic activities, being of particular importance for human health [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. They are also known to decrease cardiovascular risks [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Epidemiological studies demonstrated the ability of plant polyphenols to offer protection against development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. The phenolic groups in polyphenols accept an electron to form relatively stable phenoxyl radicals, disrupting chain oxidation reactions in cellular components [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Phenolics represent a large variety of compounds such as simple phenols, phenolic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, stilbenes, hydrolysable and condensed tannins, lignans, and lignins [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]. It should be noted that flavonoids represent one of the most important natural phenols. Another important class of compounds occurring in plant materials is represented by terpenoids, which play an essential role in development of living systems. Most of them are volatile substances and are generally present in the essential oil obtained by extractive methods.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not just perennial but also cultured plants are studied in terms of their pharmacological properties. Between cultured plants, the decorative species of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia</span> are present in particular or public gardens. Native to North America, 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia</span> is a flowering plant of the family Asteraceae, found in 25 different perennial, annual, or biennial species. The most common varieties of this plant are 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia fulgida</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia hirta</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span>, or 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span>. This last one was reported in Austria in the 1970s, while in Romania, it has been encountered for the first time in Maramures and Neamt counties [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few studies on biochemical properties of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia</span> varieties are reported [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. Thus, leaf essential oils from three herbaceous members of the Asteraceae family, 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia fulgida</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia hirta</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Symphyotrichum novae-angliae</span>, were obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main components in the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia fulgida</span> were found to be the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (germacrene D (30.1%) and δ-cadinene (17.8%)); similar composition was reported in the case of leaf oil of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia hirta</span>, with 23.6% germacrene D and 16.2% δ-cadinene. The leaf oils of these extracts were found to be inactive for antimicrobial activity [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Another study reports the chemical composition, minerals, and antioxidative effect of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span> [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. General component of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span> is crude protein. The highest content of minerals is potassium, followed by calcium and magnesium, suggesting that 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span> was alkaline material. The content of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds and DPPH· radical scavenging activity of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span> were also reported. The chemical profile of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia hirta</span> was established by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) technique and by means of the total content of polyphenols [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. As about the therapeutic actions of the species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia</span>, they are relatively varied. The active compounds or extracts of these plants exhibit anti-inflammatory effects (
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia hirta</span>) [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>], antimycobacterial (
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia subtomentosa</span>) [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>], antileukemic (
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia mollis</span>) [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], antitussive (
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia fulgida</span>) [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>], antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and cytotoxic activities (
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia laciniata</span>) [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported in literature on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span>. In this paper, different aerial parts of the 
  <span class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</span> were used to obtain essential oil, infusion, decoct, and hydroalcoholic macerate. The solid plant materials (dried leaves and inflorescences), the essential oil of dried inflorescences, and the obtained aqueous or hydroalcoholic extracts from dried petals, leaves, and seeds were characterized by chromatographic or/and spectrophotometric methods.
