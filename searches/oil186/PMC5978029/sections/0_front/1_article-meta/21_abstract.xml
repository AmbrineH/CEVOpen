 <p>The research conducted in this study presented for the first time results of physico-chemical properties and in vitro antimicrobial activity of hydroxyapatite plant essential oil against Gram-positive bacteria (methicillin-resistant 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> 0364) and Gram-negative bacteria (
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922). The samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to determine the morphology and structure of the nanocomposites of hydroxyapatite coated with basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) essential oils (EOs). The values of the BET specific surface area (S
  <sub>BET</sub>), total pore volume (V
  <sub>P</sub>) and pore size (D
  <sub>P</sub>) were determined. The results for the physico-chemical properties of HAp-L and HAp-B revealed that lavender EOs were well adsorbed on the surface of hydroxyapatite, whereas basil EOs showed a poor adsorption on the surface of hydroxyapatite. We found that the lavender EOs hydroxyapatite (HAp-L) exhibited a very good inhibitory growth activity. The value of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) related to growth bacteria was 0.039 mg/mL for MRSA, 0.02 mg/mL for 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 0.039 mg/mL 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922. The basil EO hydroxyapatite (HAp-B) showed poor inhibition of bacterial cell growth. The MIC value was 0.625 mg/mL for the HAp-B sample in the presence of the MRSA bacteria, 0.313 mg/mL in the presence of 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 0.078 mg/mL for 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922.
