<p>In this paper, the influence of the basil and lavender EOs on the morphological, physico-chemical and antibacterial properties of the HAp was analysed. The morphology of the HAp sample changed as particles agglomerated when coated with EOs. The FT-IR spectral investigations of the HAp-B and HAp-L samples revealed the presence of IR absorption bands specific to both HAp and EOs. This suggested that both basil and lavender EOs were incorporated into the HAp sample, which is in agreement with the SEM analysis and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. However, there was a reduced number of IR bands specific to basil EO present in the HAp-B sample in comparison with those specific to lavender EO identified in the HAp-L sample. The results obtained revealed that both HAp-B and HAp-L exhibited good antimicrobial activity. HAp-L and HAp-B were found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of

 <italic>E coli</italic> and MRSA bacterial strains. The results of this study suggested that the best antibacterial activity could be observed for the samples of hydroxyapatite coated with lavender EO. In conclusion, the determination of MIC and MBC values is relevant in clinical applications and allows a better understanding of the action of antibiotic agents. These results could significantly contribute to the development of new applications for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, their use in bone reconstruction could help reduce the number of postoperative infections after various implants. Important future goals include the determination of the active antimicrobial components within the EO as well as the mechanisms involved in the process of inhibiting bacterial growth. The understanding of these mechanisms and the development of novel antimicrobial agents based on EOs available in nature presents tremendous potential for the discovery of alternatives to conventional antibiotics.
