<p>In this context, the results presented in this paper evidence the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities of hydroxyapatite-lavender essential oil (HAp-L) and hydroxyapatite-basil essential oil (HAp-B) nanocomposites. The morphology of the surfaces of the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with essential oils was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The influence of the basil and lavender essential oils on the molecular structure of the HAp was investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements. The antibacterial effect of hydroxyapatite coated with basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) essential oil nanopowders (pressed into pellets) against Gram-positive (MRSA, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) bacteria was also studied.
