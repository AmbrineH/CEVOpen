<p>Essential oils are complex biostructures, and contain a lot of chemical compounds from different chemical classes: terpenoids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters, either saturated or with different levels of unsaturation, their chemical composition depending on the plantâ€™s origin and quality, harvest time, climate, soil and especially extraction process [
