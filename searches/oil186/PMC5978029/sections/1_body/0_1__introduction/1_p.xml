<p class="p">Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a calcium phosphate compound and the best known biomaterial in terms of its morphological and compositional similarity with human hard tissue. From a thermodynamic point of view, hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate with regard to the physiological conditions of the human body, including temperature, body fluids composition and human pH. The outstanding properties of HAp nanopowders, such as their biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity and nontoxicity, have been demonstrated [
