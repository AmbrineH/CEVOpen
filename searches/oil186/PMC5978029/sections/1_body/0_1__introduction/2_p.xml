Therefore, it is of interest in medicine and biomedical engineering for bone regeneration and dental applications. As a result of its biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite can be used for coating metal prostheses or dental implants, which is favorable for a successful osteointegration process. On the other hand, it is well known that the risk of postoperative infections [
