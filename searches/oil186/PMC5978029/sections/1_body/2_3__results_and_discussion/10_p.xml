<p>Furthermore, the normalized absorption IR spectra of basil EO and HAp-B presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003">Figure 3</xref> could provide a quantitative evaluation of the basil EO absorption into the HAp sample. By comparing the IR spectrum of HAp (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f002">Figure 2</xref>) with the IR spectrum of HAp-B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), wavenumber differences can be noticed, especially in the 1400–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> range. On the other hand, in the IR spectrum of the HAp-B sample, the bands specific to basil EO were not clearly highlighted, although there are many IR-specific bands of basil EO in the 400–1400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region. This is also the case concerning the IR bands at 2852, 2925, and 2964 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. In the spectrum of the HAp-B sample, only the basil EO IR absorption bands of 1640 and 3310 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, attributed to O-H vibrations, were visible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These bands were partially overlaid with the 1645 and 3338 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> IR bands characteristic to HAp (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These results could indicate a poor absorption of basil EO into the HAp structure. The absorption intensities of the 1640 and 3310 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> IR bands in the basil EO spectrum were 0.15 and 0.26, respectively. In the HAp-B spectrum, the intensities of these absorption bands were 0.13 and 0.27, respectively.
