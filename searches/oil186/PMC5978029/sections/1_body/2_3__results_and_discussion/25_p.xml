<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of the HAp-B and HAp-L samples was also confirmed by measuring the inhibition zone diameters (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-11-00652-t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of HAp. HAp-B and HAp-L ranged from no inhibition for HAp sample to 25.83 ± 0.9 mm for the HAp-L sample in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 0364 bacterial strain. The results suggested that HAp-L presented a stronger antibacterial activity against all tested microbial strains. In the case of HAp-B sample, the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacterial strain proved to be the most susceptible, presenting a diameter inhibition zone of 14.65 ± 0.5 mm.
