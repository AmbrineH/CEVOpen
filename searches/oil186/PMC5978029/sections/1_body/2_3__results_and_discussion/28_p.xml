<p>Taking into account the fact that the MIC is the lowest concentration of a chemical that prevents visible growth of a bacterium, it can be said that the smallest concentration of HAp-L nanopowders at which the visible inhibition of MRSA bacterial growth was evidenced was 0.039 mg/mL. The MIC value for the HAp-B sample related to the MRSA was 0.625 mg/mL. On the other hand, the visible inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial growth was observed at 0.02 mg/mL for the HAp-L sample. The value of MIC related to the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria was registered at 0.313 mg/mL for the HAp-B sample. For HAp-L, a clear inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial growth at 0.039 mg/mL was observed, but the MIC value was recorded at 0.02 mg/mL. The MIC value for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial growth was recorded at 0.078 mg/mL for the HAp-B sample. According to Tripathi [
 <xref rid="B47-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], MBC is the concentration that leads to microbial death. In agreement with Tripathi, the MBC values at which the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was stopped by HAp-L were at concentrations of 1.25 mg/mL. On the other hand, Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], in their studies on “determination of minimum bactericidal concentrations of oxacillin for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>: influence and significance of technical factors”, defined MBC as the smallest concentration that kills bacteria with a reduction of 99.9%. Pankey and Sabath [
 <xref rid="B49-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], in their studies on “Clinical relevance of bacteriostatic versus bactericidal mechanisms of action in the treatment of Gram positive bacterial infections”, confirmed Taylor’s theory of MBC determination. In agreement with Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Pankey and Sabath [
 <xref rid="B49-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the MBC value at which the development of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E coli</italic> bacterial cells was stopped in the presence of HAp-L was 0.625 mg/mL. For MRSA, we could say that the growth of these bacterial cells was stopped at 2.5 mg/mL in the presence of HAp-L according to Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Pankey and Sabath [
 <xref rid="B49-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A slight decrease in the cellular viability of various Gram-positive bacteria (MRSA and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) in the presence of HAp-B was evidenced without any reduction in cellular development by 99.9%.
