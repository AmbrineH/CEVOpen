 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a, the uniform ellipsoidal shape of HAp nanoparticles and their distribution can be observed in the investigated sample. By covering HAp with EOs, the nanoparticles agglomerated, as can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b,c. The particles’ shape remained ellipsoidal for both HAp-B and HAp-L samples, while the sample surfaces were affected.
