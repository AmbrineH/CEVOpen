 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b, the IR spectrum of the HAp-L samples reveals absorption bands characteristic to both HAp and lavender EO. All the characteristic IR absorption bands for HAp were present in the spectrum. In addition to the HAp IR spectral bands, the IR bands specific to lavender EO can also be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b. Thus, the bands at 692, 917, 1375 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> correspond to C–H vibrations, while the band at 1640 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was associated with the C=C stretching vibrations [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The 1235 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> IR band belongs to the C–O stretching vibration of the ester group, and the 1740 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> band was related to the C=O stretching vibration. The IR bands from 1375 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and those in the 2800–3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> range were due to the bending and stretching of the C–H vibrations in methyl and methylene groups, as was indicated in
