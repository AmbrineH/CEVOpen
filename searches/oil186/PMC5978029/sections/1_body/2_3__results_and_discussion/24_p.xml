<p>The antibiotic resistances of the tested microorganisms have been investigated and reported in numerous studies [

 <xref rid="B46-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In their research, A.W. Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] identified a zone with an average inhibition diameter of 23 mm for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 when tested against antibiotic discs of tetracycline (30 µg). More than that, the antibiotic resistance of different types of MRSA has been investigated by Trzcinsky et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. They showed that the diameter of the inhibition zone is closely related to clinical isolation, reporting an area with an average inhibition diameter of 6 to 17 mm when the antibiotic resistance of different types of MRSA was tested with tetracycline antibiotic discs (30 μg). The antibiotic resistance of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> control strains against antibiotic discs of tetracycline (30 µg) has also been tested previously [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], indicating that the diameter of the inhibition zone was between 19 and 28 mm.
