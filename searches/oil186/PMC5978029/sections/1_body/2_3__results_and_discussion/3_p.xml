The distribution of the HAp nanoparticles covered with EOs became non-uniform, and it seemed that the porosity of the HAp nanoparticles increased. An obvious increase in porosity was noticed for HAp-L samples, while a clear change in the porosity of HAp-B samples was not observed. This behavior could suggest that basil EO had poor adsorption on the surface of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.
