<p>In the case of the HAp-L IR deconvoluted spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), the peaks from 835, 875 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the C–O vibrations in the [CO
 <sub>3</sub>]
 <sup>2−</sup> group, an impurity in the synthesis of the HAp. The peak at 835 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> could also be assigned to the C–H vibrations into the lavender EO spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The 920, 945, 960, 1020, 1050 and 1090 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> IR peaks belong to the P–O vibrations in the [PO
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>3−</sup> group [

 <xref rid="B21-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to the peaks previously identified in the IR spectrum of HAp-L, the peak fitting analysis revealed some peaks related to the structure of the lavender EO, namely 917 and 990 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, assigned to C-H vibrational deformations in accordance with [
