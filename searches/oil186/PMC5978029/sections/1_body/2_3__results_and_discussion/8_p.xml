<p>The IR spectra of the basil EO and HAp-B samples are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003">Figure 3</xref>. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003">Figure 3</xref>a [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], in the spectrum of basil EO, the main characteristic IR absorption bands were observed. In the 2800–3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> spectral region, the IR peaks of –CH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching (2852, 2925, 2964 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and C–H stretching (3310 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) vibrations were identified. The intense IR band at 1640 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was attributed to the C=C stretching vibration and the 1740 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> absorption band is characteristic of C=O stretching vibrations. The most relevant absorption bands from the 500–1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> spectral region are: 600, 802 (C–H vibrations), 1110, 1177, 1235 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O stretching vibrations), 992, 1370, 1420, 1450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H bending vibrations) [
