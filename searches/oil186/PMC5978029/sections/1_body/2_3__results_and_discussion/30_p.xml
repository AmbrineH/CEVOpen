<p>Considering previous studies, the research presented in this paper contains the first study that highlights the MIC and MBC values of hydroxyapatite coated with lavender or basil EOs. The determination of MIC and MBC plays an important role in clinical applications when tracking bacterial response to antibiotic therapy [

In accordance with the research and controversy related to the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of materials with antibacterial properties, the studies presented in this work represent only a stage of our research on the determination of antimicrobial properties of materials based on hydroxyapatite coated with EOs (HAp-EOs). Current and future studies can provide useful information on the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity of HAp-EOs on a wide range of bacterial strains in order to predict a favorable clinical outcome.
