<p class="p">The spectrum of the HAp-B sample was dominated by the IR bands specific to HAp. The IR spectral absorption bands of basil EO were usually present in the 2700–3200 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 600–1850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> spectral regions. As the 600–1850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> spectral range was mainly dominated by the IR bands characteristic to HAp, only a few IR bands specific to basil oil were indicated in the HAp-B absorption spectrum shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> and subsequently in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-11-00652-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, like 720 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C–H vibrations), 1640 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (O–H vibrations) respectively 3310 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (O–H vibrations). The broad IR band from 720 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a appears to be due to the overlapping of the basil EO absorption bands in the 600–800 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> spectral region.
