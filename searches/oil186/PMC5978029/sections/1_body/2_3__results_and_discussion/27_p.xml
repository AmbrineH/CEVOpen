<p>The effect of nanopowders of HAp-B and HAp-L on cell viability was appraised on different Gram-positive (MRSA and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f008">Figure 8</xref>aâ€“c). The effects of the HAp-B and HAp-L samples tested against MRSA cell growths at different concentrations from 0.01 to 5 mg/mL are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f008">Figure 8</xref>a. For HAp-L the growth of MRSA cell was diminished at concentrations greater than 0.02 mg/mL. A slow decrease in MRSA cell growth was observed for HAp-B samples. HAp-B leads to a decrease in MRSA cell growth at concentrations greater than 0.625 mg/mL. It was noticed that at concentrations lower than 0.625 mg/mL, HAp-B did not have any effect on the inhibition of MRSA cell growth. An evolution of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell growth in the presence of the HAp-B and HAp-L was also monitored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). Impaired cell growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed at concentrations between 0.313 and 5 mg/mL for the HAp-B sample. Likewise, a decrease in cell growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed, starting at the lowest concentration (0.01 mg/mL), in the presence of the HAp-B sample. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of the HAp-B and HAp-L was also evaluated against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f008">Figure 8</xref>c). The HAp-L inhibited the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth starting with a concentration equal to 0.02 mg/mL while the HAp-B inhibited the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth starting with a concentration equal to 0.078 mg/mL.
