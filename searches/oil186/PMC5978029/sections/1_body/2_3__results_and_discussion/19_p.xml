<p>The IR spectrum of the HAp-B sample in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, as well as the second derivative and the deconvoluted IR spectra from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f005">Figure 5</xref>, indicate only a few IR bands specific to basil EO in comparison with the bands specific to lavender EO. In [

 <xref rid="B26-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it was shown that the basil and lavender EOs have many characteristic IR bands in the 800–1800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> spectral region. In the HAp-B IR spectrum, there were a few IR bands specific to the basil EO (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This emphasizes the fact that the lavender EO was better adsorbed on the surface of hydroxyapatite compared to basil EO.
