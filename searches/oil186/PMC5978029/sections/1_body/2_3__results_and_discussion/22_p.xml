<p class="p">The results indicated that HAp-L displayed good antibacterial activity against MRSA, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 0364 and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 microbial strains, while the antibacterial activity of HAp-B samples against MRSA, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 0364 and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 was not so well evidenced. It can be observed that HAp-L was strongly inhibitory against all tested bacterial strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>c,f,i). The results also suggested that HAp-B was moderately inhibitory against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> 0364 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>h) and weakly inhibitory to MRSA, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b). The HAp-B sample showed the best antimicrobial activity against the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 bacterial strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>e). Due to the fact that the HAp powders presented no inhibitory effect on the growth of the tested bacterial strains, the antibacterial activity of the HAp-B and HAp-L samples was attributed to the basil and lavender EOs. According to the manufacturerâ€™s data, the basil essential oil (W212000 Aldrich) used in this study was mainly composed of eugenol, 32.4%; limonene, &lt;0.1%; linalool, 41.9%; and methyl chavicol, 0.9% [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The lavender essential oil (61718 Aldrich) was comprised of over 100 constituents, including linalool, perillyl alcohol, linalyl acetate, camphor, limonene, tannins, triterpenes, coumarins 3,4,5, cineole, and flavonoids, etc. [

 <xref rid="B29-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Both essential oils, purchased from Sigma Aldrich, had as a major constituent linalool, which has been reported to possess a strong antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Studies regarding the synergy between the components of essentials oils are still scarce. However, numerous results in this area have reported that the antimicrobial activity of a given essential oil is strongly influenced by just one or two main components, and also by the interactions between the major and minor components present in the oil composition [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Therefore, the distinctive behavior of the antimicrobial activity of HAp-B and HAp-L samples attributed to the basil and lavender EOs could be related both to the different interactions between the two oils constituents with the HAp powders and to the synergy between the constituent elements of each oil, separately. The effectiveness of essential oils in inhibiting bacterial growth is strongly depended on the nature of functional groups and orientation. Various mechanisms explaining the antimicrobial activity of EOs have been reported in the literature. EOs can disrupt the cell membrane of a microorganism by simply increasing membrane permeability, destabilizing the cellular architecture causing the breakdown of membrane integrity, which disrupts many vital cellular activities [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of EOs differs depending on the type of EO, as well as the targeted microbial strain, depending on their structure (Gram positive, Gram negative and fungi). It has been reported that sandalwood and vetiver EOs have strong inhibitory effects on the Gram-positive bacterial strains, while they do not exhibit any antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. On the other hand, EOs obtained from cinnamon, clove, pimento, thyme, oregano, and rosemary have been reported to be effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhi</italic> (Gram negative), 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram positive), and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Gram negative) bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">Myrtus communis</italic> EO has been described as being effective in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus durans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium avium</italic> bacterial strains, which belong both to the Gram-negative as well as the Gram-positive bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Even though there are numerous studies regarding the antibacterial activity of EOs, there is no substantial evidence that definitely supports EOs presenting stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria. The different behavior of HAp-B and HAp-L samples could also be due to different adsorption on the hydroxyapatite surface of the two EOs (basil and lavender) as can be seen in the studies presented above.
