<p>These findings are in good agreement with studies regarding the antibacterial activity of lavender EO, which was demonstrated to exhibit in vitro activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) even at low concentrations [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> even at low concentrations. On the other hand, M. Sienkiewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], following studies on the use of essential oils of rosemary as effective antibacterial agents, reported that basil EO exhibited strong antibacterial activity against
