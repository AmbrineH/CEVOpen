The solution containing P was then added dropwise into the Ca-containing solution, and the new obtained mixture was magnetically stirred for 2 h at a temperature of 100 °C. During the reaction, the pH value was constantly kept at 10. The final product was washed with deionized water several times. The obtained material (HAp) was dried for 48 h at 100 °C. The HAp-B and HAp-L samples were obtained by mixing HAp powder with basil and lavender essential oil. HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were pressed into pellets with a diameter of 6 mm.
