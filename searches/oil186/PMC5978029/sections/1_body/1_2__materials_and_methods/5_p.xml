<p class="p">The spectra of HAp-B and HAp-L samples were acquired using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Waltham, MS, USA) SP 100 equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) accessory, in the spectral range of 400–4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with a 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resolution. The samples were placed on the ATR accessory without any preparation. The background spectrum was acquired in air and taken as reference background spectrum. Before and after the spectral analysis of each sample, the ATR diamond crystal was cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol solution. The ATR plate cleaning was verified by recording the background spectrum after each sample measurement and comparing it with the reference background spectrum. The acquired transmission IR spectra were transformed into absorption spectra according to the A = log (1/T) using the Perkin Elmer spectrometer, SPECTRUM software (Version 6.4.1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MS, USA). The fine structure of the obtained absorption spectra of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples was revealed by peak fitting analysis. The first step performed in the peak fitting analysis procedure was the baseline correction of the experimental infrared spectrum, followed by the second-order derivative calculation for peak wavenumbers finding. Secondly, during the fitting analysis process, a Lorentz-type profile curve was used for each identified peak. A sum of all the Lorentz fitted curves was generated by multiple iteration of the nonlinear least-squares data-fitting algorithm of the calculation software. If the sum of all the fitted curves is set correctly, the algorithm gives a valid and convergent solution. The theoretical curve obtained as a result of peak fitting analysis versus experimental IR curve was presented and analysed [
