<p>The tested microorganism strains that were used in this study were Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> 0364 (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 0364) and Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922). The qualitative antibacterial assays were performed using microbial suspensions obtained from 15–18 h solid cultures on tryptone soy agar (TSA). The cultures were then transferred to fresh Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and incubated for 2–3 h to reach the exponential growth phase. The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) and were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates evenly using a sterile swab. Hydroxyapatite, and hydroxyapatite coated with lavender and basil EOs pellets were placed directly, aseptically and distinctively onto the previously inoculated MHA plates. Agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h and the inhibition zones formed were measured in mm [

 <xref rid="B19-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The materials were solubilized in DMSO and two-fold dilutions of the samples ranging from 5 to 0.01 mg/mL were carried out in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). Each tube was inoculated with microbial suspension adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and a volume of 100 μL of each sample dissolved in DMSO as described above were added to the first well and a serial two-fold dilution was performed. After incubation at 37 °C for 18–24 h, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined by measuring the absorbance of the microbial suspensions at 620 nm.
