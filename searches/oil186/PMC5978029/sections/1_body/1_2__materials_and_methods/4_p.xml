<p>The specific surface area (S
 <sub>BET</sub>) cumulative pore volume (V
 <sub>p</sub>) and diameter of the pores (D
 <sub>p</sub>) of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples were determined using an ASAP 2020 instrument from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm. The measurements were performed at 77 K. The specific surface areas of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [

 <sub>P</sub>) and pore size (D
 <sub>P</sub>) were calculated using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method [
