 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microstructure of the HAp sample and the influence of the basil and lavender EOs on the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles’ shape and distribution were investigated by SEM.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The respective morphologies of the hydroxyapatite coated with EOs of basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f001" href="#materials-11-00652-f001">Figure 1</a>a–c. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f001" href="#materials-11-00652-f001">Figure 1</a>a, the uniform ellipsoidal shape of HAp nanoparticles and their distribution can be observed in the investigated sample. By covering HAp with EOs, the nanoparticles agglomerated, as can be observed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f001" href="#materials-11-00652-f001">Figure 1</a>b,c. The particles’ shape remained ellipsoidal for both HAp-B and HAp-L samples, while the sample surfaces were affected.

  <a rid="B10-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-materials-11-00652">10</a>] are also presented. The distribution of the HAp nanoparticles covered with EOs became non-uniform, and it seemed that the porosity of the HAp nanoparticles increased. An obvious increase in porosity was noticed for HAp-L samples, while a clear change in the porosity of HAp-B samples was not observed. This behavior could suggest that basil EO had poor adsorption on the surface of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The particle size, structure, and morphology can have a significant influence on both materials and the efficiency of their use. Properties such as S
  <sub>BET</sub>, V
  <sub>P</sub> and D
  <sub>P</sub> are significant material characteristics in numerous applications, including pharmaceutical and medical products. To determine the total pore volume (V
  <sub>P</sub>) and pore size (D
  <sub>P</sub>) of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples, the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method was used. Moreover, the values of the specific surface area (S
  <sub>BET</sub>) of the samples were determined by the BET method. The nitrogen physisorption results, including the S
  <sub>BET</sub>, V
  <sub>P</sub> and D
  <sub>P</sub> of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples, are given in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="materials-11-00652-t001" href="#materials-11-00652-t001">Table 1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BET surface areas increased from HAp to HAp-L. The S
  <sub>BET</sub> value for HAp-B is close to that of HAp. As expected, the pore volume V
  <sub>P</sub> increased from HAp to HAp-L. The results regarding the porosity of the materials were similar to those observed by SEM analysis. These materials could have high potential for use in a variety of applications, due to the possibility of obtaining particles with a controlled size and shape.

  <span class="sup">−1</span> IR bands in the basil EO spectrum were 0.15 and 0.26, respectively. In the HAp-B spectrum, the intensities of these absorption bands were 0.13 and 0.27, respectively.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00652-f007" href="#materials-11-00652-f007">Figure 7</a>e). Due to the fact that the HAp powders presented no inhibitory effect on the growth of the tested bacterial strains, the antibacterial activity of the HAp-B and HAp-L samples was attributed to the basil and lavender EOs. According to the manufacturer’s data, the basil essential oil (W212000 Aldrich) used in this study was mainly composed of eugenol, 32.4%; limonene, &lt;0.1%; linalool, 41.9%; and methyl chavicol, 0.9% [

The lavender essential oil (61718 Aldrich) was comprised of over 100 constituents, including linalool, perillyl alcohol, linalyl acetate, camphor, limonene, tannins, triterpenes, coumarins 3,4,5, cineole, and flavonoids, etc. [

  <a rid="B29-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-materials-11-00652">29</a>]. Both essential oils, purchased from Sigma Aldrich, had as a major constituent linalool, which has been reported to possess a strong antimicrobial activity [
  <a rid="B30-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-materials-11-00652">30</a>]. Studies regarding the synergy between the components of essentials oils are still scarce. However, numerous results in this area have reported that the antimicrobial activity of a given essential oil is strongly influenced by just one or two main components, and also by the interactions between the major and minor components present in the oil composition [
  <a rid="B31-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-materials-11-00652">31</a>]. Therefore, the distinctive behavior of the antimicrobial activity of HAp-B and HAp-L samples attributed to the basil and lavender EOs could be related both to the different interactions between the two oils constituents with the HAp powders and to the synergy between the constituent elements of each oil, separately. The effectiveness of essential oils in inhibiting bacterial growth is strongly depended on the nature of functional groups and orientation. Various mechanisms explaining the antimicrobial activity of EOs have been reported in the literature. EOs can disrupt the cell membrane of a microorganism by simply increasing membrane permeability, destabilizing the cellular architecture causing the breakdown of membrane integrity, which disrupts many vital cellular activities [
  <a rid="B32-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-materials-11-00652">32</a>]. Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of EOs differs depending on the type of EO, as well as the targeted microbial strain, depending on their structure (Gram positive, Gram negative and fungi). It has been reported that sandalwood and vetiver EOs have strong inhibitory effects on the Gram-positive bacterial strains, while they do not exhibit any antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacterial strains [
  <a rid="B33-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-materials-11-00652">33</a>,

  <span class="italic">Salmonella typhi</span> (Gram negative), 
  <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (Gram positive), and

  <a rid="B37-materials-11-00652" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-materials-11-00652">37</a>]. Even though there are numerous studies regarding the antibacterial activity of EOs, there is no substantial evidence that definitely supports EOs presenting stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria. The different behavior of HAp-B and HAp-L samples could also be due to different adsorption on the hydroxyapatite surface of the two EOs (basil and lavender) as can be seen in the studies presented above.
