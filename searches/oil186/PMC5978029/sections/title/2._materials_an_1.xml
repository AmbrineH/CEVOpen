  <span class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</span> L. (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and basil oil, linalol type, obtained from 
  <span class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</span> L. (Sigma Aldrich). The essential oils were used as purchased without any dilution.

During the reaction, the pH value was constantly kept at 10. The final product was washed with deionized water several times. The obtained material (HAp) was dried for 48 h at 100 °C. The HAp-B and HAp-L samples were obtained by mixing HAp powder with basil and lavender essential oil. HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were pressed into pellets with a diameter of 6 mm.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The morphology of the samples was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a HITACHI S4500 microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Prior to recording the images, the powder samples were evenly dispersed in a specimen holder using as double coated conductive carbon tape conductive adhesive. The sample holder containing the samples was introduced into the vacuum chamber, and all SEM images were recorded using a 5 kV electron acceleration voltage and an Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD). The 3D surface plots of the SEM images were obtained using Image J software (ImageJ 1.51j8, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spectra of HAp-B and HAp-L samples were acquired using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Waltham, MS, USA) SP 100 equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) accessory, in the spectral range of 400–4000 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> with a 4 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> resolution. The samples were placed on the ATR accessory without any preparation. The background spectrum was acquired in air and taken as reference background spectrum. Before and after the spectral analysis of each sample, the ATR diamond crystal was cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol solution. The ATR plate cleaning was verified by recording the background spectrum after each sample measurement and comparing it with the reference background spectrum. The acquired transmission IR spectra were transformed into absorption spectra according to the A = log (1/T) using the Perkin Elmer spectrometer, SPECTRUM software (Version 6.4.1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MS, USA). The fine structure of the obtained absorption spectra of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples was revealed by peak fitting analysis. The first step performed in the peak fitting analysis procedure was the baseline correction of the experimental infrared spectrum, followed by the second-order derivative calculation for peak wavenumbers finding. Secondly, during the fitting analysis process, a Lorentz-type profile curve was used for each identified peak. A sum of all the Lorentz fitted curves was generated by multiple iteration of the nonlinear least-squares data-fitting algorithm of the calculation software. If the sum of all the fitted curves is set correctly, the algorithm gives a valid and convergent solution. The theoretical curve obtained as a result of peak fitting analysis versus experimental IR curve was presented and analysed [

The cultures were then transferred to fresh Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and incubated for 2–3 h to reach the exponential growth phase. The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> CFU/mL) and were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates evenly using a sterile swab. Hydroxyapatite, and hydroxyapatite coated with lavender and basil EOs pellets were placed directly, aseptically and distinctively onto the previously inoculated MHA plates. Agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h and the inhibition zones formed were measured in mm [

The materials were solubilized in DMSO and two-fold dilutions of the samples ranging from 5 to 0.01 mg/mL were carried out in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). Each tube was inoculated with microbial suspension adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and a volume of 100 μL of each sample dissolved in DMSO as described above were added to the first well and a serial two-fold dilution was performed. After incubation at 37 °C for 18–24 h, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined by measuring the absorbance of the microbial suspensions at 620 nm.
