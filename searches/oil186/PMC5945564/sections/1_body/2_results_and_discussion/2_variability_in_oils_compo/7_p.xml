<p id="Par25">Several studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activities of limonene, α-pinene and β-caryophyllene, the primary constituents found in the oils of 
 <italic>P. guineense</italic> presented in this paper. Limonene showed significant anti-inflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a beneficial role as a diet supplement in reducing inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; limonene decreased the infiltration of peritoneal exudate leukocytes and reduced the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, in the induced peritonitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. α-Pinene presented anti-inflammatory effects in human chondrocytes, exhibiting potential anti-osteoarthritic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and in mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], being, therefore, a potential source for the pharmaceutical industry. The anti-arthritic and the in vivo anti-inflammatory activities of β-caryophyllene was evaluated by molecular imaging [
