<p id="Par18">Comparing these results with the composition of other essential oils described for the same plant, a specimen of 
 <italic>P. guineense</italic> sampled in Arizona, USA, has also been found to contain β-bisabolene, α-pinene, and limonene as its primary constituents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, the oil from another specimen collected in Roraima, Brazil, presented β-bisabolol as the main component, followed by limonene and 
 <italic>epi</italic>-α-bisabolol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, a specimen sampled in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, presented an essential oil with a very high value of spathulenol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that there is a significant variation in the essential oils of different types of Araçá.
