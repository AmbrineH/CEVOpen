 <italic>Psidium guineense</italic> is a botanical resource that presents commercial application perspectives, based on its fruits and functional elements, as well as due to the use of its leaves as anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For this study were selected twelve Araçá specimens, with occurrence in various localities of Pará state (PA), Brazil (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and which showed different composition for the leaf oils. The yields of the oils from these twelve Araçá samples ranged from 0.1 to 0.9%, where the higher yields were from specimens sampled in the Northeast of Pará, Brazil (0.4-0.9%), and the lower yields were from plants collected in the West of Pará, Brazil (0.1-0.3%). The identification of the constituents of the oils by GC and GC-MS was 92.5% on average, with a total of 157 compounds, where limonene (0.3-47.4%), α-pinene (0.1-35.6%), β-caryophyllene (0.1-24.0%), 
 <italic>epi</italic>-β-bisabolol (6.5-18.1%), caryophyllene oxide (0.3-14.1%), β-bisabolene (0.1-8.9%), α-copaene (0.3-8.1%), myrcene (0.1-7.3%), muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol (1.6-5.8%), β-bisabolol (2.9-5.6%), and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene (0.1-5.0%) were the primary components, in descending order up to 5% (see Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In general, the constituents identified in oils belong to the terpenoids class, with the following predominance: monoterpene hydrocarbons (0.9-76.9%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (5.2-63.5%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (5.6-46.7%), and oxygenated monoterpenes (1.9-8.8%).
