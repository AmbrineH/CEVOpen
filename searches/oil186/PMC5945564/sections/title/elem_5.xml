  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leaves were ground and submitted to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus (3 h). The oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and their yields were calculated by the plant dry weight. The moisture content of the samples was calculated using an Infrared Moisture Balance for water loss measurement. The procedure was performed in duplicate.</p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oils were analyzed on a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra system (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an AOC-20i auto-injector and the GCMS-Solution software containing the NIST (Nist, 2011) and FFNSC 2 (Mondello, 2011) libraries [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. A Rxi-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness) silica capillary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used. The conditions of analysis were: injector temperature of 250 °C; Oven temperature programming of 60-240 °C (3 °C/min); Helium as carrier gas, adjusted to a linear velocity of 36.5 cm/s (1.0 mL/min); split mode injection for 1 μL of sample (oil 5 μL : hexane 500 μL); split ratio 1:20; ionization by electronic impact at 70 eV; ionization source and transfer line temperatures of 200 and 250 °C, respectively. The mass spectra were obtained by automatic scanning every 0.3 s, with mass fragments in the range of 35-400 m/z. The retention index was calculated for all volatile components using a homologous series of C8-C20 n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), according to the linear equation of Van den Dool and Kratz (1963) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The quantitative data regarding the volatile constituents were obtained by peak-area normalization using a GC 6890 Plus Series, coupled to FID Detector, operated under similar conditions of the GC-MS system. The components of oils were identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra (molecular mass and fragmentation pattern) with data stored in the GCMS-Solution system libraries, including the Adams library (2007) [

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The multivariate analysis was performed using as variables the constituents with content above than 5%. For the multivariate analysis, the data matrix was standardized by subtracting the mean and then dividing it by the standard deviation. For hierarchical cluster analysis, the complete linkage method and the Euclidean distance were used. Minitab software (free 390 version, Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA), was used for these analyzes.</p>
