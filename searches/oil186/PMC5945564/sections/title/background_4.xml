 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Myrtaceae comprises 132 genera and 5671 species of trees and shrubs, which are distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly South America, Australia and Tropical Asia [

  <span class="italic">Psidium</span> is a genus with at least 60 to 100 species, occurring from Mexico and Caribbean to Argentina and Uruguay. Therefore, it is naturally an American genus, although

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The leaves and pulp of Araçá have been used as an anti-inflammatory remedy for wound healing and oral antibacterial agent [

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present work aimed at investigating the variability of the chemical composition of the essential oils of different specimens of
