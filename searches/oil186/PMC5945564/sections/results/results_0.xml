 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a total of 157 identified compounds, limonene, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, 
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-β-bisabolol, caryophyllene oxide, β-bisabolene, α-copaene, myrcene, muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol, β-bisabolol, and 
  <span class="italic">ar</span>-curcumene were the primary components in descending order up to 5%. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) displayed three different groups with the following chemical types: limonene/α-pinene, β-bisabolene/
  <span class="italic">epi</span>-β-bisabolol, and β-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide. With the previous description of another chemical type rich in spathulenol, it is now understood that at least four different chemotypes for 
  <span class="italic">P. guineense</span> should occur.
