<p class="p">Total FA% compositions, corresponding to each FA component of oil and TAG fraction, are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. SFA with carbon chains shorter than 14 carbon atoms, called short- and medium-chain FA, was not found in pumpkin seed oil, as confirmed in other papers [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. SFA was represented especially by palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, at 14.2% and 5.8%, respectively. It is reported that oils rich in myristic (C14:0) and palmitic acids affect the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol only a little, and stearic acid slightly reduces this ratio [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. PUFA and MUFA fractions were the most abundant (37.2% and 41.7%, respectively, for oil; 37.8% and 43.0%, respectively, for TAG); in fact, the main FA were oleic (C18:1
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9) and linoleic (C18:2
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6) acids. Berrettina pumpkin seed oil showed a higher content of oleic acid than linoleic acid (41.4% vs. 37.0% for oil); on the contrary, Procida et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] reported a higher content of linoleic acid (44.30–51.58%) than oleic acid (34.16–42.59%) for three Italian samples of pumpkin (Crudigno, Pepo, and Winter). It has been reported by some authors [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] that oleic acid is the predominant FA (41–46%), followed by linoleic acid (33.4–34.3%), in pumpkin seed oil from Italy and Libya. Siano et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] found that the main FA of southern Italian pumpkin (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>) seed oil were linoleic acid (47.45%), followed by oleic (25.54%) and palmitic (17.58%) acids. Habib et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found that pumpkin (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>, known as “Misti Kumra”) seed oil contained a high amount of oleic acid, 40.58%, while linoleic acid was 14.97%.
