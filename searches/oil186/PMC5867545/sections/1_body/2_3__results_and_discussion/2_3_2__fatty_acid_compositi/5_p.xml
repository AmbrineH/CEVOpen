<p class="p">In addition, the nutritional quality of pumpkin (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima,</italic> var. Berrettina) cultivated in central Italy was evaluated, using different indices, based on the FA composition of the oils. It is known that some FA can help to prevent or promote coronary thrombosis and atherosclerosis based on their effects on LDL concentration and serum cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The equations proposed by Ulbricht and Southgate [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] for the atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI) showed that C12:0, C14:0, and C16:0 FA are atherogenic, while C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 are thrombogenic. PUFA 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3, PUFA 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6, and MUFA are antiatherogenic and antithrombogenic. Atherogenic indices have been described as powerful indicators of the risk of cardiovascular disease; the higher the value, the higher the risk of developing the disease, and vice versa. The AI of pumpkin (
 <italic class="italic">C. maxima</italic>) seed oil was lower than that reported by Siano et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] (0.19 for Berrettina vs. 0.34), while the TI was comparable (0.50 for Berrettina vs. 0.65).
