<p>It was reported by Orsavova et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that MUFA may reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while it may possibly increase HDL cholesterol, and that oleic acid (C18:1
 <italic>n</italic>-9) may promote insulin resistance contrary to PUFA, with protection against insulin resistance. The high content of linoleic acid is an important nutritional aspect, because it is an essential FA (EFA), together with linolenic acid (C18:3
 <italic>n</italic>-3), and a lack of either of the two leads to ill health and causes deficiency symptoms. In addition, several studies [
