<p>Initially, the lipid fraction was isolated by Soxhlet extraction, and then the TAG fraction was purified by TLC. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f001">Figure 1</xref>, several steps were carried out. Initially, the total FA% composition (A
 <sub>t</sub>) was determined by HRGC. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f002">Figure 2</xref>a shows the characteristic HRGC profile of the FAME of the TAG fraction of pumpkin samples. Then, enzymatic hydrolysis of TAG with pancreatic lipase was used to obtain 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2-MAG, and finally, after HRGC analysis of the FAME (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), the acidic composition of 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2-position (A
 <sub>2</sub>) of the glycerol backbone of TAG was obtained. TAG was also subjected to chemical hydrolysis with Grignard reagent, then separation of enantiomeric 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2(2,3)-DAG, realized by enzymatic synthesis of 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2-PA, allowed us to obtain the acidic composition of the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2-positions (A
 <sub>1,2</sub>) of the glycerol backbone of TAG, after HRGC analysis of the FAME (
