<p class="p">The indirect method of analyzing TAG was based on a chemical–enzymatic–instrumental (stereospecific analysis) procedure and allowed us to carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of all molecular TAG species, including enantiomeric ones. In fact, it is known that in TAG molecules the positions esterified by FA are numbered relative to their stereospecific numbering (
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>) as 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1, 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2, and 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3. The procedure allowed us to evaluate the FA % composition of each of the three 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-positions of TAG (% intrapositional composition). These data could be used to obtain the distribution of FA among the three 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-positions of TAG [
