<p>The stereospecific analysis represents a potent analytical-investigative procedure to give the fingerprint of TAG fraction for each botanical variety or animal species. The results of the stereospecific analysis procedure are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t002">Table 2</xref>. It was observed that Berrettina pumpkin seed oil had a high percentage of UFA (98.5%) in 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position, represented by MUFA (36.2%) and PUFA (62.4%). In 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position, the main FA was linoleic acid (62.1%), followed by oleic acid (36.0%). SFA are preferentially esterified in 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1 position (44.7%), represented essentially by palmitic and stearic acids (28.6% and 13.7%, respectively). Regarding the two primary positions, oleic acid was equally distributed between the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1 and 
 <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions, while linoleic acid prefers the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-3 position (42.2%).
