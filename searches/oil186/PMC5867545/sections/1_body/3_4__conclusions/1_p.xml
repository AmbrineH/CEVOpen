<p>The results reported in this study confirm that pumpkin seed oils are interesting vegetable oils with important nutritional value, related to the presence of MUFA, PUFA, phytosterols, and carotenoids. A more extensive sampling for a better characterization of pumpkin seed oils and for authentication purposes is necessary. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time stereospecific analysis data of pumpkin seed oil have been reported. Information obtained from this research could help to assess the potential of seed oil from this pumpkin cultivar to be commercially exploited for nutraceutical application, and incorporated into food formulations to benefit human health. </p>
