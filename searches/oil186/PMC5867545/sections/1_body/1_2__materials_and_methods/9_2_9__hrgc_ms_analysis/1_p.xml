<p>A Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) and split-splitless injector maintained at 300 °C was used. The following MS parameters were used: interface temperature 270 °C; MS ionization mode electron ionization; detector voltage 0.9 kV; acquisition mass range 50–500 u; scan speed 1000 u/s; acquisition mode full scan; scan interval 0.5 s; solvent delay 6 min. Data were collected by GC-MS Solution software (Shimadzu). The column and the chromatographic conditions were the same as those reported in
