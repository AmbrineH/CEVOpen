<p class="p">The TAG fraction was isolated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), according to the method described by Cossignani et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], from total fat of pumpkin seed samples using silica gel plates (SIL G-25, 0.25 mm, 20 cm Ã— 20 cm; Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and petroleum ether/diethyl ether/formic acid (70:30:1,
