<p>The 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2(2,3)-DAG ethereal solution was concentrated under nitrogen stream, then cardiolipin solution, buffered 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2-DAGK, buffer, and Na
 <sub>2</sub>ATP were added, mixing each time. After incubation at 40 °C for 90 min under constant stirring, chloroform/methanol (2:1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was added to the mixture to stop the reaction and extract the products of interest. The combined extracts were concentrated, treated with anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and applied to TLC plates. The developing system was chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (65:25:5, 
 <italic>v/v/v</italic>). The band of the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2-phosphatidic acids (
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2-PA), visualized with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein spray (Rf ≈ 0.1), was scraped off, methylated, and analyzed by HRGC with flame ionization detection (FID) as reported in the following paragraph to obtain the constituent FAME. The obtained data represent the intrapositional composition of FA esterified in 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,2 positions, named A
 <sub>1,2</sub>.
