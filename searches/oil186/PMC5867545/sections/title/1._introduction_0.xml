 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pumpkin (
  <span class="italic">Cucurbita</span> spp.), one of the most popular vegetables consumed in the world, has been recently recognized as a functional food [
  <a rid="B1-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-foods-07-00030">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-foods-07-00030">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-foods-07-00030">3</a>]. Pumpkin seeds, generally considered agro-industrial waste, are an extraordinarily rich source of bioactive compounds with interesting nutraceutical properties [
  <a rid="B4-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-foods-07-00030">4</a>]. In recent years, several studies [
  <a rid="B5-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-foods-07-00030">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-foods-07-00030">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-foods-07-00030">7</a>] have highlighted the health properties of pumpkin seed oil against many diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. It also shows antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties [
  <a rid="B8-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-foods-07-00030">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-foods-07-00030">9</a>]. Due to the presence of interesting natural bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids, tocopherols, and sterols, pumpkin-derived products have a wide spectrum of biological activity, proven by in vivo experiments [
  <a rid="B10-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-foods-07-00030">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the positive health effects, research has been focused particularly on the content and composition of fatty acids (FA) and tocopherols in pumpkin seed oil, while, to a lesser extent, other lipid components, such as sterols, alcohols, and phenol acids, have been studied, as is done with other food matrices to identify specific markers characteristic of the plant varieties [
  <a rid="B11-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-foods-07-00030">11</a>]. Among the relevant aspects to be considered when dealing with this vegetable, the beneficial effects of using environmentally friendly natural herbicides [
  <a rid="B12-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-foods-07-00030">12</a>] must be mentioned, since the content of bioactive compounds could be affected, and there could be possible contamination of this vegetable due to the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> spp. microfungi and their secondary metabolites [
  <a rid="B13-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-foods-07-00030">13</a>], affecting the content of beneficial compounds of the vegetable itself.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stevenson et al. [
  <a rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00030">14</a>] summarized FA composition and reported significant differences among various cultivars of pumpkin seed oil extracted from various pumpkin sources. Rezig et al. [
  <a rid="B15-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00030">15</a>] studied the chemical composition and oil properties of seeds of a Tunisian variety of pumpkin, Béjaoui (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span>). They found that the major FA were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids and that the seed oil was rich in δ-tocopherol, while the sterol marker was β-sitosterol and the predominant phenolic acid was syringic acid. Siano et al. [
  <a rid="B16-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-foods-07-00030">16</a>] highlighted that saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) of 
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span> produced in southern Italy showed similar values (25.20% and 25.54%, respectively), while the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content was 48.14%. Habib et al. [
  <a rid="B17-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-foods-07-00030">17</a>] determined the proximate composition of powdered seed and the lipid composition of the oil of 
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span> collected in Bangladesh. They affirmed that the high degree of unsaturation makes the oil suitable for use as valuable drying agent, and lower free FA content indicates suitability of the oil for consumption as food. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other researchers studied the chemical composition of pumpkin seed oils from 
  <span class="italic">C. pepo</span> [
  <a rid="B5-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-foods-07-00030">5</a>,
  <a rid="B18-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-foods-07-00030">18</a>,

  <a rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00030">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-foods-07-00030">21</a>]. Due to the differences among the species and/or varieties of 
  <span class="italic">Cucurbita</span> spp. grown in different areas of the world, the present study focused on characterizing a native Italian cultivar (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span>, var. Berrettina, locally known as “priest’s hat”), paying attention to the lipid composition of the seed oil. Since there is little information about the lipid structure, the present research deepens understanding of the total FA content and intrapositional composition of Berrettina pumpkin by using stereospecific analysis, and pays attention to other minor lipid components such as sterols, alcohols, and carotenoids. Butinar et al. [
  <a rid="B22-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-foods-07-00030">22</a>] proposed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) as a useful technique to evaluate the genuineness of pumpkin seed oils produced in Slovenia, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no data in the literature dealing with stereospecific analysis of pumpkin seed TAG.
