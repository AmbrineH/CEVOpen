 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) and split-splitless injector maintained at 300 °C was used. The following MS parameters were used: interface temperature 270 °C; MS ionization mode electron ionization; detector voltage 0.9 kV; acquisition mass range 50–500 u; scan speed 1000 u/s; acquisition mode full scan; scan interval 0.5 s; solvent delay 6 min. Data were collected by GC-MS Solution software (Shimadzu). The column and the chromatographic conditions were the same as those reported in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TMSE sterols and alcohols were identified by comparing retention times and mass spectra to those of authentic TMSE-derivatized compounds. Confirmation of these structures was achieved by HRGC-MS using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) 2008 library to match mass spectral peaks of phytosterol standards to those found in pumpkin seed oil samples. Comparisons of parent molecular ion (M+) and fragmentation ions/patterns were employed to assist in elucidating the identities of the phytosterols. In addition to the presence of specific ion fragments, the relative intensity of the ion fragments was considered. Some compounds, for which commercial standards are not available, were tentatively identified by comparison of relative retention times, M+ values, and fragmentation patterns with data obtained from olive oil analysis or from MS spectra reported in the literature. </p>
