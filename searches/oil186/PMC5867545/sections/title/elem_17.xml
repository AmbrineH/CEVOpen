It is reported that oils rich in myristic (C14:0) and palmitic acids affect the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol only a little, and stearic acid slightly reduces this ratio [
   <a rid="B35-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-foods-07-00030">35</a>]. PUFA and MUFA fractions were the most abundant (37.2% and 41.7%, respectively, for oil; 37.8% and 43.0%, respectively, for TAG); in fact, the main FA were oleic (C18:1
   <span class="italic">n</span>-9) and linoleic (C18:2
   <span class="italic">n</span>-6) acids. Berrettina pumpkin seed oil showed a higher content of oleic acid than linoleic acid (41.4% vs. 37.0% for oil); on the contrary, Procida et al. [
   <a rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00030">20</a>] reported a higher content of linoleic acid (44.30–51.58%) than oleic acid (34.16–42.59%) for three Italian samples of pumpkin (Crudigno, Pepo, and Winter). It has been reported by some authors [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was reported by Orsavova et al. [

   <span class="italic">n</span>-9) may promote insulin resistance contrary to PUFA, with protection against insulin resistance. The high content of linoleic acid is an important nutritional aspect, because it is an essential FA (EFA), together with linolenic acid (C18:3
   <span class="italic">n</span>-3), and a lack of either of the two leads to ill health and causes deficiency symptoms. In addition, several studies [
   <a rid="B39-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-foods-07-00030">39</a>] have positively correlated EFA intake with reduction of numerous disorders (cardiovascular, neurological, visual, and cancerous).

   <span class="italic">n</span>-3, PUFA 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-6, and MUFA are antiatherogenic and antithrombogenic. Atherogenic indices have been described as powerful indicators of the risk of cardiovascular disease; the higher the value, the higher the risk of developing the disease, and vice versa. The AI of pumpkin (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indirect method of analyzing TAG was based on a chemical–enzymatic–instrumental (stereospecific analysis) procedure and allowed us to carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of all molecular TAG species, including enantiomeric ones. In fact, it is known that in TAG molecules the positions esterified by FA are numbered relative to their stereospecific numbering (
   <span class="italic">sn</span>) as 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-1, 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-2, and 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-3. The procedure allowed us to evaluate the FA % composition of each of the three

   <span class="italic">sn</span>-positions of TAG [

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f002" href="#foods-07-00030-f002">Figure 2</a>b), the acidic composition of 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-2-position (A
   <sub>2</sub>) of the glycerol backbone of TAG was obtained. TAG was also subjected to chemical hydrolysis with Grignard reagent, then separation of enantiomeric 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2(2,3)-DAG, realized by enzymatic synthesis of 
   <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2-PA, allowed us to obtain the acidic composition of the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stereospecific analysis represents a potent analytical-investigative procedure to give the fingerprint of TAG fraction for each botanical variety or animal species. The results of the stereospecific analysis procedure are shown in

   <span class="italic">sn</span>-2 position, the main FA was linoleic acid (62.1%), followed by oleic acid (36.0%). SFA are preferentially esterified in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another part of the research was analyzing the main components of unsaponifiable fractions, i.e., sterols and alcohols. Alkaline hydrolysis was carried out on pumpkin seed oils to obtain data relative to the qualitative composition of sterol and alcohol fractions. Phytosterols have been studied for their role in lowering cholesterol levels. In addition to this property, plant sterols have antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidation activities [
   <a rid="B44-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-foods-07-00030">44</a>]. Together with the high content of linoleic acid, sterols can help in the treatment of lipid-associated disorders such as atherosclerosis.

   <a rid="B45-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-foods-07-00030">45</a>] showed that pumpkin seed oil contains specific Δ
   <span class="sup">7</span>-phytosterols, typical of only a few plant families (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">Cucurbitaceae</span>), that provide a fingerprint for detection of adulteration. These Δ

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, sterol identification was carried out by HRGC-MS. Each peak was analyzed via detection of the parent molecular ion and the fragmentation pattern of the TMSE derivative. In addition to the presence of specific ion fragments, the relative intensity of the ion fragments was considered. Some TMSE sterols were identified by comparison with the NIST mass spectra library; typical fragmentation is reported in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t003" href="#foods-07-00030-t003">Table 3</a>, together with sterol composition (% and mg/100 g). TMSE sterols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was usually equivalent to [M-15]
   <span class="sup">+</span>, due to the loss of the methyl terminal group. Other main fragment ions useful for identifying the single sterol compounds are [M-90]
   <span class="sup">+</span>, [M-105]
   <span class="sup">+</span>, and [M-129]
   <span class="sup">+</span>. They correspond to the loss of the trimethylsilanol, methyl group with trimethylsilanol, and fragmentation of the 1,2-cyclopenthanophenanthrene structure, respectively. The predominant sterols of Berrettina pumpkin seed oil are Δ
   <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols, in particular Δ
   <span class="sup">7,22,25</span>-stigmastatrienol, Δ
   <span class="sup">7,25</span>-stigmastadienol, and spinasterol, which accounted for about 76.8% of the total sterols, followed by Δ
   <span class="sup">7</span>-avenasterol and Δ
   <span class="sup">7</span>-stigmastenol. The Δ
   <span class="sup">5</span>-sterols were represented by campesterol, stigmasterol, and only a little cholesterol, as in other foodstuff [
   <a rid="B47-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-foods-07-00030">47</a>]. Differences between the contents of Δ

   <span class="sup">7</span>-sterols could be attributed to the maturity stage of seeds or to the solvent used in the extraction procedure [
   <a rid="B15-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-foods-07-00030">15</a>]. A total sterol content of 295 mg/100 g oil was measured in 
   <span class="italic">C. maxima</span> seed oil; 15.7 mg/100 g was represented by Δ
   <span class="sup">5</span>-sterols and 279.3 mg/100 g by Δ

For example, analysis of a more extensive sampling is required for better characterization of pumpkin seed oils and for their authentication.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The alcoholic fraction (aliphatic and triterpenic classes) was also studied, after derivatization as TMSE and analysis by HRGC-MS; the typical fragmentation is reported in

Some aliphatic alcohols (from C16 to C25 members of the 1-alkanol homologous series) with odd and even numbers of carbon atoms of the aliphatic chain were identified.

TMSE alcohols give a molecular ion that is not abundant, while the first significant ion observed in the high mass range was equivalent to [M-15]
