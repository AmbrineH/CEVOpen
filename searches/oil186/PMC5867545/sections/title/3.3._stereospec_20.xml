 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indirect method of analyzing TAG was based on a chemical–enzymatic–instrumental (stereospecific analysis) procedure and allowed us to carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of all molecular TAG species, including enantiomeric ones. In fact, it is known that in TAG molecules the positions esterified by FA are numbered relative to their stereospecific numbering (
  <span class="italic">sn</span>) as 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1, 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2, and 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-3. The procedure allowed us to evaluate the FA % composition of each of the three 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-positions of TAG (% intrapositional composition). These data could be used to obtain the distribution of FA among the three 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-positions of TAG [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, the lipid fraction was isolated by Soxhlet extraction, and then the TAG fraction was purified by TLC. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f001" href="#foods-07-00030-f001">Figure 1</a>, several steps were carried out. Initially, the total FA% composition (A
  <sub>t</sub>) was determined by HRGC. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f002" href="#foods-07-00030-f002">Figure 2</a>a shows the characteristic HRGC profile of the FAME of the TAG fraction of pumpkin samples. Then, enzymatic hydrolysis of TAG with pancreatic lipase was used to obtain 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2-MAG, and finally, after HRGC analysis of the FAME (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00030-f002" href="#foods-07-00030-f002">Figure 2</a>b), the acidic composition of 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2-position (A
  <sub>2</sub>) of the glycerol backbone of TAG was obtained. TAG was also subjected to chemical hydrolysis with Grignard reagent, then separation of enantiomeric 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2(2,3)-DAG, realized by enzymatic synthesis of 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2-PA, allowed us to obtain the acidic composition of the 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2-positions (A
  <sub>1,2</sub>) of the glycerol backbone of TAG, after HRGC analysis of the FAME (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stereospecific analysis represents a potent analytical-investigative procedure to give the fingerprint of TAG fraction for each botanical variety or animal species. The results of the stereospecific analysis procedure are shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t002" href="#foods-07-00030-t002">Table 2</a>. It was observed that Berrettina pumpkin seed oil had a high percentage of UFA (98.5%) in 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2 position, represented by MUFA (36.2%) and PUFA (62.4%). In 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2 position, the main FA was linoleic acid (62.1%), followed by oleic acid (36.0%). SFA are preferentially esterified in 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1 position (44.7%), represented essentially by palmitic and stearic acids (28.6% and 13.7%, respectively). Regarding the two primary positions, oleic acid was equally distributed between the 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1 and 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-3 positions, while linoleic acid prefers the 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-3 position (42.2%).
