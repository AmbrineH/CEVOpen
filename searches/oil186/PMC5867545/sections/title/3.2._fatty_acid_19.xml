 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total FA% compositions, corresponding to each FA component of oil and TAG fraction, are reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="foods-07-00030-t002" href="#foods-07-00030-t002">Table 2</a>. SFA with carbon chains shorter than 14 carbon atoms, called short- and medium-chain FA, was not found in pumpkin seed oil, as confirmed in other papers [
  <a rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00030">14</a>,
  <a rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00030">20</a>,
  <a rid="B37-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-foods-07-00030">37</a>,
  <a rid="B38-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-foods-07-00030">38</a>]. SFA was represented especially by palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, at 14.2% and 5.8%, respectively. It is reported that oils rich in myristic (C14:0) and palmitic acids affect the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol only a little, and stearic acid slightly reduces this ratio [
  <a rid="B35-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-foods-07-00030">35</a>]. PUFA and MUFA fractions were the most abundant (37.2% and 41.7%, respectively, for oil; 37.8% and 43.0%, respectively, for TAG); in fact, the main FA were oleic (C18:1
  <span class="italic">n</span>-9) and linoleic (C18:2
  <span class="italic">n</span>-6) acids. Berrettina pumpkin seed oil showed a higher content of oleic acid than linoleic acid (41.4% vs. 37.0% for oil); on the contrary, Procida et al. [
  <a rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00030">20</a>] reported a higher content of linoleic acid (44.30–51.58%) than oleic acid (34.16–42.59%) for three Italian samples of pumpkin (Crudigno, Pepo, and Winter). It has been reported by some authors [
  <a rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00030">14</a>] that oleic acid is the predominant FA (41–46%), followed by linoleic acid (33.4–34.3%), in pumpkin seed oil from Italy and Libya. Siano et al. [
  <a rid="B16-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-foods-07-00030">16</a>] found that the main FA of southern Italian pumpkin (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span>) seed oil were linoleic acid (47.45%), followed by oleic (25.54%) and palmitic (17.58%) acids. Habib et al. [
  <a rid="B17-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-foods-07-00030">17</a>] found that pumpkin (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span>, known as “Misti Kumra”) seed oil contained a high amount of oleic acid, 40.58%, while linoleic acid was 14.97%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was reported by Orsavova et al. [
  <a rid="B38-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-foods-07-00030">38</a>] that MUFA may reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while it may possibly increase HDL cholesterol, and that oleic acid (C18:1
  <span class="italic">n</span>-9) may promote insulin resistance contrary to PUFA, with protection against insulin resistance. The high content of linoleic acid is an important nutritional aspect, because it is an essential FA (EFA), together with linolenic acid (C18:3
  <span class="italic">n</span>-3), and a lack of either of the two leads to ill health and causes deficiency symptoms. In addition, several studies [
  <a rid="B39-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-foods-07-00030">39</a>] have positively correlated EFA intake with reduction of numerous disorders (cardiovascular, neurological, visual, and cancerous). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minor FA (contents lower than 0.5%) of Berrettina pumpkin seed oil were myristic, palmitoleic (C16:1
  <span class="italic">n</span>-7), margaric (C17:0), heptadecenoic (C17:1
  <span class="italic">n</span>-7), arachidic (C20:0), behenic (C22:0), and lignoceric (C24:0) acids. These data are in good agreement with similar studies [
  <a rid="B14-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-foods-07-00030">14</a>,
  <a rid="B20-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-foods-07-00030">20</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extreme variability of FA composition of pumpkin seeds, and consequently of the corresponding pumpkin seed oils, is affected not only by the variety of the cultivar, but also by the growth conditions and degree of ripeness [
  <a rid="B40-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-foods-07-00030">40</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the nutritional quality of pumpkin (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima,</span> var. Berrettina) cultivated in central Italy was evaluated, using different indices, based on the FA composition of the oils. It is known that some FA can help to prevent or promote coronary thrombosis and atherosclerosis based on their effects on LDL concentration and serum cholesterol [
  <a rid="B41-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-foods-07-00030">41</a>]. The equations proposed by Ulbricht and Southgate [
  <a rid="B41-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-foods-07-00030">41</a>] for the atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI) showed that C12:0, C14:0, and C16:0 FA are atherogenic, while C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 are thrombogenic. PUFA 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-3, PUFA 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-6, and MUFA are antiatherogenic and antithrombogenic. Atherogenic indices have been described as powerful indicators of the risk of cardiovascular disease; the higher the value, the higher the risk of developing the disease, and vice versa. The AI of pumpkin (
  <span class="italic">C. maxima</span>) seed oil was lower than that reported by Siano et al. [
  <a rid="B16-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-foods-07-00030">16</a>] (0.19 for Berrettina vs. 0.34), while the TI was comparable (0.50 for Berrettina vs. 0.65).
