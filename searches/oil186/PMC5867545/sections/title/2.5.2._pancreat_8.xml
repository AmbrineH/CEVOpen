  <a rid="B26-foods-07-00030" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-foods-07-00030">26</a>]. Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.08), bile salts, CaCl
  <sub>2</sub>, and pancreatic lipase were added to an aliquot of TAG. The mixture was incubated under magnetic stirring in a water bath at 40 °C for 5 min, and then 6 M HCl and diethyl ether were added and the mixture was centrifuged. Diethyl ether was dried by anhydrous Na
