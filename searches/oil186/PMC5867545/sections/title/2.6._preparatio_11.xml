 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FAME of TAG, 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-2-MAG, and 
  <span class="italic">sn</span>-1,2-PA fractions were prepared by transesterification. Hexane and 2 N methanolic KOH were added to the fraction and stirred for 3 min, then water was added. The organic phase (upper) containing the FAME was dried over anhydrous Na
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>, then analyzed by HRGC. A DANI GC1000 DPC gas chromatograph (Norwalk, CT, USA) equipped with a split-splitless injector and a flame ionization detector (FID) was used. Separation was obtained using the CP-Select CB for FAME fused silica capillary column (50 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm f.t.; Varian, Superchrom, Milan, Italy). Chromatograms were acquired and processed using Clarity integration software (DataApex Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic). The injector and detector temperature was 250 °C. The oven temperature was held at 180 °C for 6 min, and raised to 250 °C at 3 °C/min; the final temperature was held for 10 min. Carrier gas (He) flow rate was 1 mL/min; the injection volume was 1 µL with a split ratio of 1:70. A standard solution containing 37 FAME was used to identify the individual FA. The percentage of each FA was calculated using the peak area of the samples. The data were normalized considering only the main reported FA (% mol mean values ≥0.1).
