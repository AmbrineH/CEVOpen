 <p class="p">The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others. We analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Glandora rosmarinifolia</italic> (Ten.) D.C. Thomas obtained by hydrodistillation and verified some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). In the essential oil we detected 35 compounds. The results of the biological assays indicate that essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">rosmarinifolia</italic> induces cell growth inhibition at concentration-dependent way in all cell line models. This oil does not seem to possess antioxidant activity, while the cytotoxicity of 
  <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">rosmarinifolia</italic> essential oil appeared to involve, at least in part, a pro-oxidant mechanism. Our results show for the first time the antitumoral and pro-oxidant activities of 
  <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">rosmarinifolia</italic> essential oil and suggest that it may represent a resource of pharmacologically active compounds.
