<p class="p">Identification of compounds was carried out using NIST 11, Wiley 9, FFNSC 2, and Adams [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] databases. These identifications were confirmed by Linear Retention Indices (LRI) with those available in literature by SciFinder database. Some of the compounds were also confirmed by comparison of mass spectra and retention times with standard compounds available in laboratory. The retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>-C
 <sub class="sub">30</sub>) injected under the same operating conditions. Component relative concentrations were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors.
