<p class="p">Our previous data on the same tumor cellular models, demonstrated that the redox perturbation due to natural compounds led to inhibition of NF-κB, a transcriptional factor often constitutively activated in many type of cancers and an important target for antitumor therapy [

Further studies should be also necessary to confirm if the diterpenes and this hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone are NF-κB inhibitors in these cancer models and to evaluate their possible use as anticancer drugs.
