<p>Our chemical composition indicates that the compounds found in 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>rosmarinifolia</italic> essential oil potentially have several biological roles. Among others, diterpenes contributing to 30% of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>rosmarinifolia</italic> composition could have beneficial effects as bactericides, as protection against free radical cell damages, as anti-inflammatory and in the treatment of cancer, among others [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As reported by Islam [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] diterpenes may act as anticancer alone or in combination with other diterpenes or anticancer drugs with synergic effects. In particular, phytol, occurring in 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>rosmarinifolia</italic> essential oil to 4.1%, can induce apoptosis in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells and its cytotoxic activity has been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for several tumor cell lines [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, the diterpenes have also evident actions against toxic substances that cause cytogenotoxic damages in biological systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In an ecological context, they may confer to plants resistance against pests or pathogens [
