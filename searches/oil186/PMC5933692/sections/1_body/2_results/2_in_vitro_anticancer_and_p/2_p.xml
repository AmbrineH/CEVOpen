<p>In order to explain if antitumor activity of this oil could depend on pro-oxidant activity, as in the case of other natural compounds, we performed a separate experiment in which cell lines were treated with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) at two concentrations, 1 mM and 2 mM before exposure to the essential oil at the corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as reported in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196947.t002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196947.t003">3</xref>. In all tested cell lines a reduction between 27.3% and 38.0% of the cytotoxicity activity of the essential oil was observed, suggesting that the mechanism involves an at least partially pro-oxidant effect (
