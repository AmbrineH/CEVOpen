<p>We investigated the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>rosmarinifolia</italic> essential oil by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196947.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the essential oil induces cell growth inhibition at concentration dependent way in all cell line models. The relative IC
