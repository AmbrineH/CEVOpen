  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> essential oil. 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rosmarinifolia</span> thus represents a resource of pharmacologically valuable compounds and we speculate that its anticancer property could be linked to the high content in diterpenes and naphthoquinone. However, further experiments must be conducted to identify molecular pathway in which the oil compounds are involved.
