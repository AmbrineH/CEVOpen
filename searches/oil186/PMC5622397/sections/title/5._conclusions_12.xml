 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia lunata</span> isolate is pathogenic to the maize plants on the tested concentrations. For the phytotoxicity essay the concentration above 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was phytotoxic to the plants, marking off the maximum concentration to be utilized. The 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> phytopathogen showed itself resistant to the methyl-thiophanate in a concentration applied above the recommended in in vitro tests. In the in vitro control the tested dosages of 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil presented promising results and can be a great alternative on the management of this disease, however the curative application was not efficient.
