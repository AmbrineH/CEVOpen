 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the preparation of the essential oil solutions sterilized small glass jars with lids were utilized in order to receive the different concentrations. One supply solution was prepared for the higher concentration utilizing a volumetric flask of 10 mL. On sequence, there was added initially the oil and adjusted the concentration of 50 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to a volume of 10 mL, next there was added Tween 80 (1 oil: 1 Tween). In laminar flow chamber, the flask was softly agitated and next was inserted the distilled water. After the agitation, there was obtained a homogeneous mixture. Subsequently, there were realized the other dilutions until the concentrations of 2.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were obtained. As negative and positive control there were prepared the solutions of methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and sterilized distilled water, respectively.
