 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pathogenicity of the 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> isolates in maize plants was confirmed, in which typical symptoms were small circular spots on the verified leaves after the incubation period of 48 h later than the inoculation on the plants. However, all the conidia suspensions provoked injuries on the leaves of maize plants (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f001" href="#medicines-04-00062-f001">Figure 1</a>). Among the six conidia concentrations prepared (10
  <span class="sup">1</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">2</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">3</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">4</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">5</span>, and 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), there was a incidence gradient of leaf spots from the lower concentration to the higher concentration of 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The concentration of 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was the chosen for the realization of the preventive and curative tests of the next stages realized, due to the better simulation of the severity of the disease verified under favorable conditions to the disease on the field.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the phytotoxicity essay, the non-toxic concentrations were applied in the in vivo tests. Phytotoxicity symptoms appeared after 12 h of the application on leaves. It was verified that at the end of 10 days there was phytotoxicity in the concentrations of 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (5.8%), 10 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (18.1%), and 50 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (20.9%), thus showing that cannot be utilized in tests of control of the disease in the plant, provoking leaf necrosis, followed by posterior wilt. Yet the concentrations 2.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 5.0 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> did not provoke phytotoxicity along the evaluation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f002" href="#medicines-04-00062-f002">Figure 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the effect of the in vitro inhibition of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil upon 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span>, it was verified the growth of the phytopathogen in all the tested concentrations (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00062-t001" href="#medicines-04-00062-t001">Table 1</a>). Regarding the concentration of 50 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, the growth was partially inhibited, with values lower than the control values.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared the mycelial growth means of the pathogen on the 10th day of incubation, it was verified that the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil did not provide an inhibitory effect among the concentrations of 2.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00062-t001" href="#medicines-04-00062-t001">Table 1</a>). Thus, on these concentrations, the phytopathogen mycelium grew normally along the days, and only in the concentrations of 50 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (C5) was the partial inhibitory effect observed (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00062-t001" href="#medicines-04-00062-t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> phytopathogen, the negative control (methyl-thiophanate) did not present a relevant difference from the positive control (water), even with the utilization of the concentration above the recommended dosage. Thus, not efficiency in the mycelial growth inhibition of this pathogen in vitro was observed. On the other side, it was verified mycelial inhibition of the 
  <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> genre when submitted to the same fungicide (negative control 2), and in the same concentration. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the essay of 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> conidia germination inhibition, it was verified that it had 100% of conidia germination on the positive control (methyl-thiophanate). The concentrations of 5.0 and 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> oil also totally inhibited the conidia germination (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f003" href="#medicines-04-00062-f003">Figure 3</a>). Yet the concentrations 0.625; 1.25 and 2.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> had a low inhibition percentage of 3.3%, 2.3%, and 25%, respectively, indicating oil activity upon the conidia, even in the lower concentrations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It can be observed (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00062-t002" href="#medicines-04-00062-t002">Table 2</a>) that the majoritarian chemical components present on the essential oil of 
  <span class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</span> leaves were Geranial (41.46%) and Neral (32.43%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the preventive and curative effects, the utilized concentrations were different from the tested in vitro (fungitoxicity) and in vivo (phytotoxicity), because from the concentration 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, the plants presented phytotoxicity symptoms. Therefore, there were tested concentrations below the utilized in in vitro tests.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the preventive effect of the 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil under progress of the 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot disease (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f004" href="#medicines-04-00062-f004">Figure 4</a>), it was observed a greater Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in the positive control (Distilled water), in relation to the other treatments. For the plants treated with the fungicide methyl-thiophanate (6) there was reduction on the disease symptoms in relation to most of the utilized treatments. However, in the oil concentration 7.5 µL mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> a similar effect to the control with methyl-thiophanate was verified. The other concentrations had similar AUDPC.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the curative control (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f004" href="#medicines-04-00062-f004">Figure 4</a>), it was observed that the application of 
  <span class="italic">C. citratus</span> essential oil did not provide the expected effect and there was no control of the disease on the symptomatic plants and the treatments AUDPC was similar to the control. Yet the treatment with methyl-thiophanate was also efficient on the curative control of the disease.
