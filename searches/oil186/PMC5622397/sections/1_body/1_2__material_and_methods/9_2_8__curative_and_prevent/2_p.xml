<p>In order to evaluate the preventive effect of the essential oil, an entirely casualized design was used, where different concentrations of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> oil were tested, being: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0; and 7.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and three repetitions. As control, there were utilized water-pulverized plants (positive control) and methyl-thiophanate-pulverized plants at 2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (negative control). From each treatment, 5 mL was sprayed on the plants and one hour after, the plants were inoculated with 5 mL of the conidia solution (10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of 
 <italic>C. lunata</italic>. The evaluation of the severity of the disease was made every two days after inoculation (5 evaluations on total).
