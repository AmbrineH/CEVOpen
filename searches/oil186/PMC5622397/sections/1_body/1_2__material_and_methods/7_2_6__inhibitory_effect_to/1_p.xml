<p>For the evaluation of the inhibition effect of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil upon the germination of conidia there was used an entirely casualized design, with seven treatments and three repetitions. The treatments were constituted by the following oil concentrations: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0, and 7.5 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, negative control, with methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and positive control with distilled/sterilized water. From each oil treatment, there was mixed 100 µL of the oil concentrations and 100 µL of the 
 <italic>C. lunata</italic> conidia concentration (10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The evaluation was made 12 h after the inoculation in optical microscope.
