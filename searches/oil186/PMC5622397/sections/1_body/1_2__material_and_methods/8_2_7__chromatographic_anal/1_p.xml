<p class="p">The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the essential oils were realized by chromatography in gas phase, attached to the mass spectrometry CG-MS. The chromatograph utilized was the model Shimadzu GC-210, equipped with mass selective detector model QP2010 Plus, and was operated in these conditions: capillary column of fused silica TRX-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm of film thickness); with the following programming of the temperature on the column: 60–240 °C (3 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>); injector temperature: 220 °C; carrier gas helium; and, splitless injection with injected volume of 1 μL of a solution 1:1000 in hexane. For the mass spectrometer (MS), there were utilized the following conditions: impact energy of 70 eV; ion source, and interface temperature: 200 °C. There was injected, at the sample conditions, a homologous series of n-alkanes (C
