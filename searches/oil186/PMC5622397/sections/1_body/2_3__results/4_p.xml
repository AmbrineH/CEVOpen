<p>Compared the mycelial growth means of the pathogen on the 10th day of incubation, it was verified that the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil did not provide an inhibitory effect among the concentrations of 2.5 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00062-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, on these concentrations, the phytopathogen mycelium grew normally along the days, and only in the concentrations of 50 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (C5) was the partial inhibitory effect observed (
