<p>For the preventive effect of the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f004">Figure 4</xref>), it was observed a greater Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in the positive control (Distilled water), in relation to the other treatments. For the plants treated with the fungicide methyl-thiophanate (6) there was reduction on the disease symptoms in relation to most of the utilized treatments. However, in the oil concentration 7.5 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> a similar effect to the control with methyl-thiophanate was verified. The other concentrations had similar AUDPC.
