<p>On the essay of 
 <italic>C. lunata</italic> conidia germination inhibition, it was verified that it had 100% of conidia germination on the positive control (methyl-thiophanate). The concentrations of 5.0 and 7.5 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> oil also totally inhibited the conidia germination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Yet the concentrations 0.625; 1.25 and 2.5 µL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> had a low inhibition percentage of 3.3%, 2.3%, and 25%, respectively, indicating oil activity upon the conidia, even in the lower concentrations.
