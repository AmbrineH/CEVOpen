<p>For the 
 <italic>C. lunata</italic> phytopathogen, the negative control (methyl-thiophanate) did not present a relevant difference from the positive control (water), even with the utilization of the concentration above the recommended dosage. Thus, not efficiency in the mycelial growth inhibition of this pathogen in vitro was observed. On the other side, it was verified mycelial inhibition of the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genre when submitted to the same fungicide (negative control 2), and in the same concentration.
