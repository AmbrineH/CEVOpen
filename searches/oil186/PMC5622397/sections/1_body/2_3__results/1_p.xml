<p>The pathogenicity of the 
 <italic>C. lunata</italic> isolates in maize plants was confirmed, in which typical symptoms were small circular spots on the verified leaves after the incubation period of 48 h later than the inoculation on the plants. However, all the conidia suspensions provoked injuries on the leaves of maize plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00062-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Among the six conidia concentrations prepared (10
 <sup>1</sup>, 10
 <sup>2</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, and 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), there was a incidence gradient of leaf spots from the lower concentration to the higher concentration of 10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The concentration of 10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was the chosen for the realization of the preventive and curative tests of the next stages realized, due to the better simulation of the severity of the disease verified under favorable conditions to the disease on the field.
