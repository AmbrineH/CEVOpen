 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Lipid Nanoparticles Characterization</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As reported in the literature [
  <a rid="B29-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-pharmaceutics-09-00048">29</a>], the use of solid lipids to form the lipid nanocarrier core leads to nanoparticles defined as SLNs while the use of mixtures of solid and liquid lipids results in NLCs. Therefore, in this work, lipid nanoparticles loading rosemary EO were regarded as NLCs, being that their lipid phase was a mixture of solid lipid (cetyl palmitate) and liquid lipid (rosemary EO).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003">Table 3</a>, unloaded lipid nanoparticles containing only the solid lipid cetyl palmitate (SLN A) showed small sizes (36.45 nm) and narrow dimensional distribution (polydispersity index 0.208), in accordance with previous studies [
  <a rid="B27-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-pharmaceutics-09-00048">27</a>,
  <a rid="B30-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-pharmaceutics-09-00048">30</a>]. When rosemary oil was mixed in different ratios with cetyl palmitate, NLCs with different mean sizes and polydispersity indexes were obtained. When the total amount of lipid phase (solid lipid plus oil) was maintained constant (7% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>, NLC BEO1–4), an increment of oil content led to an increase of mean particle size. For these lipid nanoparticles, polydispersity index values were higher than 0.300, thus indicating that the distribution did not consist of a single size mode.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-f001" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-f001">Figure 1</a>, two different populations of lipid nanoparticles were observed in NLCs BEO1–4, one with small sizes (mean size 22 nm) and the other with bigger sizes (mean size 312 nm). At a lower rosemary EO content (1–2% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>), the percentage of small sized nanoparticles was higher than that of large nanoparticles. When the amount of essential oil used to prepare these nanocarriers was raised to 4% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>, the percentage of large nanoparticles became preponderant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposite trend was observed for lipid nanoparticles obtained using a constant amount of solid lipid (7% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>) while increasing the content of rosemary EO (1–3% 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">w</span>). These NLCs (CEO1–3) showed a decrease of particle sizes and polydispersity index values as the percentage of rosemary EO increased (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003">Table 3</a>). NLC CEO1 and NLC CEO2, loading 1–2% of rosemary EO respectively, showed two populations of nanoparticles, having small (30 nm) and large (235 nm) mean size, while NLC CEO3 (rosemary EO 3%) contained a single population of small nanoparticles (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-f002" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-f002">Figure 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results point out that the ratio solid lipid/liquid lipid plays a key role in determining NLC size and dimensional distribution, as already reported in literature [
  <a rid="B31-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-pharmaceutics-09-00048">31</a>]. The interactions occurring among NLC components may change depending on the solid lipid/liquid lipid ratio. These interactions may affect the nanoparticle curvature radius, thus leading to nanoparticles with different mean sizes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Morphological analyses were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) only on samples showing a single population of nanoparticles. TEM imaging of SLN A and NLC CEO3 showed that nanoparticles were round in shape (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-f003" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-f003">Figure 3</a>). No evident difference could be observed between SLN A and NLC CEO3 TEM images as TEM provides information only about the morphology and the external surface of the nanoparticles.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the content of rosemary EO strongly affected the mean particle size and dimensional distribution, zeta potential values were similar for all the nanoparticles under investigation. It is interesting to note that all rosemary EO-loaded nanoparticles showed zeta potential similar to that of unloaded SLNs, thus suggesting that the incorporation of rosemary EO into these nanoparticles did not influence their superficial charge.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-t003">Table 3</a> highlight that the higher the rosemary EO content, the lower the PIT values, for both series of NLCs. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-f004" href="#pharmaceutics-09-00048-f004">Figure 4</a>, a linear relationship between percentages of rosemary EO used to prepare the nanocarriers and PIT values of the corresponding nanoparticles was observed (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.985 for NLC BEO1–4; 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.983 for NLC CEO1–3).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concentration-dependent interactions occurring between rosemary EO and lipid nanoparticles components could explain PIT lowering as rosemary EO content increased. As reported in the literature [
  <a rid="B32-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-pharmaceutics-09-00048">32</a>], rosemary EO hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) is 16.5 while cetyl palmitate has an HLB value of 10.0. Therefore, increasing the percentage of rosemary EO in the lipid phase would lead to an increase in hydrophilicity of the lipid mixture. In conventional emulsions, an increase in hydrophilicity is expected to lead to an increase in PIT values [
  <a rid="B33-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-pharmaceutics-09-00048">33</a>]. As NLC BEO1–4 and CEO1–3 contain both solid and liquid lipids, they could be classified as multiple NLCs [
  <a rid="B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048">17</a>]. Being comprised of complex structures, with a matrix consisting of oil droplets embedded in solid lipids and a shell of surfactants, the interactions among different components could affect PIT values differently from conventional emulsions. Therefore, further studies have been planned to elucidate the interactions occurring between rosemary EO and other nanoparticle constituents.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As only NLC CEO3 showed a single population of nanoparticles, we selected this colloidal dispersion for stability tests. No significant changes of particles size and polydispersity indexes were observed during storage at room temperature for two months (data not shown). Therefore, we used NLC CEO3 to prepare the gel vehicles for in vivo topical application.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All gels showed no change in their organoleptic properties during storage in non-transparent containers for one month at room temperature.</p>
