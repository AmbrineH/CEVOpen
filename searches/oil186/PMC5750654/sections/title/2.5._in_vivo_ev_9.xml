 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This experiment has been designed to assess the in vivo activity of rosemary oil-loaded lipid nanoparticles in comparison with unloaded SLNs and free rosemary oil in gel vehicles after topical application for one week. Investigations were carried out following the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, revised in 2008. The local ethics committee declared that no approval was needed for this type of study, due to the nature of the study and the safety of the ingredients used in the formulations under investigation. Ten healthy female volunteers (average age 53 ± 4), without dermatological diseases and with normal/moderate dry skin were enrolled in the study, after giving their informed consent. Young healthy subjects were not included in this study as they showed high hydration skin levels that made them unsuitable for the evaluation of the effects of skin hydrating treatments. Freshly prepared gel samples were presented in similar containers labeled with four-digit code numbers and the study was performed in double blind. In the first part of the study, subjects were given four out of the six different gels. The volunteers were explained how to pick up and apply the samples and were instructed to apply the product (about 2 mg) onto two different areas over the back of their hands, twice a day (morning and evening) for a period of one week.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements of skin hydration and elasticity were performed at baseline (prior to the treatment) and after one week of treatment. Measurements were taken under controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and humidity (35 ± 5%) conditions, after 30 min of acclimatization. The volunteers were requested not to apply the gels the morning before the final measurement. The use of other products was not allowed throughout the study, apart from normal hygiene treatment. Skin analyses were performed using specific probes of the instrument Soft Plus (Callegari Srl, Parma, Italy). These probes determined skin hydration by capacity measurements in the range 0–100 u.c. (arbitrary units) with a resolution of 1 u.c. and 5% precision, while stress/deformation of skin by suction application allowed measurements of skin elasticity in the range 0–50 u.c. with a resolution of 1 u.c. and 10% precision. Each measurement was performed in triplicate.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second part of the study, after a one-month wash-out, the same subjects were requested to apply the remaining two gels and the test was performed in the same conditions and using the same procedures and instrumental analyses described above.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis of the results was performed using Students’
