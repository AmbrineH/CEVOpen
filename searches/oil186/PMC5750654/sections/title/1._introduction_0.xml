 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, the increasing demand for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products based on natural active ingredients has brought researchers to focus their attention on essential oils (EOs). Traditionally, EOs have been used as fragrances in food and cosmetics but, in the last decades, many investigations have highlighted their numerous biological and medicinal properties, demonstrating their antioxidant, preservative, antimicrobial, antiviral, fungicidal, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, sedative and anticancer activities [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EOs are volatile, lipophilic liquid or semiliquid, complex mixtures of low molecular weight organic compounds produced by plants as secondary metabolites whose main components consist of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and short-chained aliphatics. Due to the chemical structures of their constituents, EOs can be easily degraded after exposure to humidity, heat, oxygen and light, owing to chemical and enzymatic reactions (oxidation, isomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation), which may occur during the manufacturing and handling processes [
  <a rid="B8-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-pharmaceutics-09-00048">8</a>]. The presence of degradation products in EOs could impair their biological activity. For example, topical application of EOs containing oxidized terpenoids may show skin-sensitizing effects, thus inducing allergic contact dermatitis [
  <a rid="B9-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-pharmaceutics-09-00048">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-pharmaceutics-09-00048">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To overcome the drawbacks of EOs, such as high volatility, easy degradation, high lipophilicity and poor membrane permeability, several researchers have suggested the encapsulation of these active ingredients into nanocarriers [
  <a rid="B11-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-pharmaceutics-09-00048">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advantages, including the ability to incorporate lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, controlled drug release, drug targeting, increased drug stability and bioavailability, safety, easy scale-up and low cost of production, have boosted the use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as nanocarriers for different administration routes [
  <a rid="B12-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-pharmaceutics-09-00048">12</a>,

  <a rid="B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048">17</a>]. Recent investigations have revealed the usefulness of SLNs as carriers for EO delivery. EOs from the genera 
  <span class="italic">Boswellia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Commiphora</span>, exhibiting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities, were efficiently loaded into SLNs designed for oral delivery, providing increased anticancer activity compared to free EOs [
  <a rid="B18-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-pharmaceutics-09-00048">18</a>]. Moghimipour et al. [
  <a rid="B19-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-pharmaceutics-09-00048">19</a>] prepared SLNs encapsulating the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Zataria multiflora</span> and concluded that SLNs are suitable carriers for essential oils. The same conclusion was reported in a study assessing SLNs loaded with 
  <span class="italic">Nigella sativa</span> essential oil [
  <a rid="B20-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-pharmaceutics-09-00048">20</a>]. Two different SLN formulations were investigated in vitro as carriers for the topical and transdermal delivery of 
  <span class="italic">Artemisia arborescens</span> essential oil [
  <a rid="B21-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-pharmaceutics-09-00048">21</a>]. This study pointed out the high physical stability of these formulations, along with their ability to target the essential oil to the skin layers, while retaining in vitro antiviral activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosemary (
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> L.) essential oil has been attributed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, fungicidal, and anticancer activity, mainly owing to its flavonoids and terpenes content [
  <a rid="B22-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-pharmaceutics-09-00048">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-pharmaceutics-09-00048">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-pharmaceutics-09-00048">24</a>,
  <a rid="B25-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-pharmaceutics-09-00048">25</a>]. Investigations on rosemary aqueous extracts pointed out the antioxidant activity of this extract and its ability to control lipoperoxidation of skin lipids. Therefore, rosemary aqueous extracts have been suggested as a useful tool for the prevention and treatment of skin disorders, including age-related skin damages [
  <a rid="B26-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-pharmaceutics-09-00048">26</a>]. However, to date, topical benefits of rosemary essential oil have not been clearly demonstrated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we evaluated the effects on skin hydration and elasticity of rosemary essential oil after topical application via gel vehicles in human volunteers. To improve its topical efficacy, rosemary essential oil was loaded into lipid nanoparticles, whose safety has been previously reported [
  <a rid="B27-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-pharmaceutics-09-00048">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a one-week topical treatment with gels containing two different percentages of rosemary EO-loaded lipid nanoparticles, a significant increase in skin hydration was observed in comparison with gels containing the same percentages of free rosemary EO. Skin elasticity increased as well, although to a lesser extent. These results suggest that the design of suitable lipid nanocarriers could be a successful approach to improve rosemary EO topical benefits.</p>
