 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For negative-staining electron microscopy, 5 ÂµL of lipid nanocarriers dispersions were placed on a 200-mesh formvar copper grid (TAAB Laboratories Equipment, Berks, UK) and allowed to be adsorbed. Then the surplus was removed by filter paper. A drop of 2% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) aqueous solution of uranyl acetate was added over 2 min. After removing the surplus, the sample was dried at room temperature before imaging it with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM 2010, Jeol, Peabody, MA, USA) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
