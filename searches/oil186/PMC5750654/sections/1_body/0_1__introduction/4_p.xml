<p class="p">Advantages, including the ability to incorporate lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, controlled drug release, drug targeting, increased drug stability and bioavailability, safety, easy scale-up and low cost of production, have boosted the use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as nanocarriers for different administration routes [

 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Recent investigations have revealed the usefulness of SLNs as carriers for EO delivery. EOs from the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Commiphora</italic>, exhibiting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities, were efficiently loaded into SLNs designed for oral delivery, providing increased anticancer activity compared to free EOs [

 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] prepared SLNs encapsulating the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Zataria multiflora</italic> and concluded that SLNs are suitable carriers for essential oils. The same conclusion was reported in a study assessing SLNs loaded with 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Two different SLN formulations were investigated in vitro as carriers for the topical and transdermal delivery of 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia arborescens</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. This study pointed out the high physical stability of these formulations, along with their ability to target the essential oil to the skin layers, while retaining in vitro antiviral activity.
