<p class="p">After a one-week topical treatment with gels containing two different percentages of rosemary EO-loaded lipid nanoparticles, a significant increase in skin hydration was observed in comparison with gels containing the same percentages of free rosemary EO. Skin elasticity increased as well, although to a lesser extent. These results suggest that the design of suitable lipid nanocarriers could be a successful approach to improve rosemary EO topical benefits.</p>
