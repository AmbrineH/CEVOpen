<p>EOs are volatile, lipophilic liquid or semiliquid, complex mixtures of low molecular weight organic compounds produced by plants as secondary metabolites whose main components consist of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and short-chained aliphatics. Due to the chemical structures of their constituents, EOs can be easily degraded after exposure to humidity, heat, oxygen and light, owing to chemical and enzymatic reactions (oxidation, isomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation), which may occur during the manufacturing and handling processes [

For example, topical application of EOs containing oxidized terpenoids may show skin-sensitizing effects, thus inducing allergic contact dermatitis [
