<p>Unloaded SLNs and EO-loaded NLCs, whose composition is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t001">Table 1</xref>, were prepared using the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The aqueous phase (double distilled water containing 0.35% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) imidazolidinyl urea and 0.05% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone as preservatives) and the oil phase (cetyl palmitate, emulsifier and co-emulsifier, different percentages 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> of EO) were separately heated at 85 °C. Two series of NLCs were prepared: NLCs BEO1–4 were obtained using a constant amount of lipid phase (7% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) with different ratios solid lipid/liquid lipid, while NLCs CEO1–3 contained a constant amount of solid lipid (7% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) and different percentages of liquid lipid.
