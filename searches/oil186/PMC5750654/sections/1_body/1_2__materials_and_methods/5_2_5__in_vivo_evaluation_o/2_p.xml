<p class="p">Measurements of skin hydration and elasticity were performed at baseline (prior to the treatment) and after one week of treatment. Measurements were taken under controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and humidity (35 ± 5%) conditions, after 30 min of acclimatization. The volunteers were requested not to apply the gels the morning before the final measurement. The use of other products was not allowed throughout the study, apart from normal hygiene treatment. Skin analyses were performed using specific probes of the instrument Soft Plus (Callegari Srl, Parma, Italy). These probes determined skin hydration by capacity measurements in the range 0–100 u.c. (arbitrary units) with a resolution of 1 u.c. and 5% precision, while stress/deformation of skin by suction application allowed measurements of skin elasticity in the range 0–50 u.c. with a resolution of 1 u.c. and 10% precision. Each measurement was performed in triplicate.</p>
