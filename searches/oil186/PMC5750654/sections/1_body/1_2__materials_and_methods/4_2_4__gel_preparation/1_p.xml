<p>Gel formulations were prepared using Carbopol Ultrez 21 as a gelling agent and TEA for neutralization, and their compositions are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceutics-09-00048-t002">Table 2</xref>. The rheological additive (0.8% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) was carefully dispersed in the aqueous phase, under mild agitation. The aqueous phase consisted of deionized water (gel A), deionized water containing EO and Solubilisant Gamma 2428 (gel B and B1), SLN A (gel C), NLC CEO3 (gel D and D1). As rosemary essential oil was poorly water soluble, we added a solubilizing compound to obtain aqueous gels containing different percentages of EO. All gel formulations were prepared using deionized water containing 0.35%

 <italic>w</italic> imidazolidinyl urea, 0.05% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone as preservatives. The resulting mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 24 h, to allow complete polymer hydration. Then, TEA (0.8% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) was added drop by drop under slow agitation, to prevent the formation of air bubbles, until the gel was formed. All formulations were stored in airtight jars, and kept in the dark and at room temperature until use.
