<p class="p">In industry, heating of oilseeds is carried out with the aim of increasing oil extraction yield, reducing seed moisture, and deactivating lipases and lipoxygenases which could induce fatty acids (FA) oxidation [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The oxidation could lead to loss of nutritional value and decreased shelf life [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The roasting of oilseeds could also improve the stability of vegetable oils by increasing the extraction yield of antioxidant substances [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. As regards the effect of roasting on the content of tocopherols which represent the major antioxidants of vegetable oils, the data from the literature are inconsistent. Depending on the nature and variety of oilseeds, roasting may lead to a decrease [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] or an increase in tocopherols level in oil [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Since tocopherols are thermosensitive, their final concentration in the oil will depend essentially on the temperature and the duration of the roasting.
