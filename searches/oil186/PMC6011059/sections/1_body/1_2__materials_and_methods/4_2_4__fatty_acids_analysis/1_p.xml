<p>Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared according to AOCS method Ce 1K-07 [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. FAME were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890, USA). The apparatus was equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a BPX70 column (60 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m film; SGE Europe). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature of the column oven was 170°C. The temperature of the injector and the detector was 220°C.
