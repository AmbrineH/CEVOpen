<p class="p">K232 reflects the content of conjugated dienes (CD) produced from the hydroperoxides of the UFA. K270 permits to evaluate the secondary oxidation products resulting from the decomposition of hydroperoxides [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In our study, the K232 value of 0.844 for the control oil increased to 0.878, 0.896, and 0.906, respectively, under the 175°C/10 min, 75°C/30 min, and 100°C/10 min conditions and decreased to 0.814, 0.806, and 0.793, respectively, for the couples temperature (°C)/time (min) of 175/30, 100/20, and 75/10. The absorption at 270 nm also showed variations according to the roasting conditions. Overall, it increased from 0.041 to 0.062, respectively, at 150°C/30 min and 75°C/30 min conditions, compared to the control (0.054). Previous studies reported that increasing temperature and time of seed roasting led to an increase in K232 and K270 [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The fluctuations of the CD contents recorded in this work would be due to the instability of these compounds which transform into secondary oxidation products. The increase in the K270 value indicates the formation of undesirable oxidation products such as carbonyl compounds. However, the values of acidity, PV, and K270 encountered under the various conditions of our work remained below the limits set by the Moroccan Standard NM 08.5.090 [
