<p>The development of the color of argan oil prepared from almonds roasted at different temperatures and times is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The absorbance at 420 nm increased significantly from 100Â°C with both time and temperature. These results are in agreement with data previously reported for other edible oils [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They reflect the formation of browning substances from nonenzymatic Maillard-type reactions between reducing sugars and free amino acids or amides [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The products of the Maillard reaction are also responsible for the development of the flavour of the edible argan oil. For this reason, roasting constitutes an important step in the edible oil production. Some derivatives of the Maillard reaction also afford numerous food safety benefits [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, others exhibited toxicity [
