<p>The effect of roasting on the initial physicochemical characteristics of the argan oil is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The acidity of 0.18 for the control oil increased significantly under the effect of the roasting whatever the temperature and the duration. The maximum values (0.28-0.3) were recorded for the temperature of 175°C. This result is consistent with previous works on pine nuts, colza, and sesame oils [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The increase in acidity could be explained by the release of FA following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides which constitute the major components of vegetable oils. It could trigger reactions of oxidative degradation of the oil due to the prooxidative action of free FA [
