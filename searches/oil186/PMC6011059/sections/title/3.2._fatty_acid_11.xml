 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FA composition of oils obtained from unroasted and roasted almonds is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. Argan oil from unroasted almonds consisted of 47.01% oleic and 32.66% linoleic acids as UFA and 13.59% palmitic and 5.49% stearic acids as saturated fatty acids (SFA). These results are consistent with previous works [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>, 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. The roasting did not lead to significant variations of FA composition. Similar results were reported for safflower and rice germ oils [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. This result would be due to the protective effect of almonds tissues by limiting the contact between UFA and oxygen which is responsible for initiating the oxidative processes [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. In addition, natural antioxidants such as polyphenols and tocopherols present in almonds tissues could exert a protective effect against UFA oxidation. In general, vegetable oils are estimated by their FA composition. Their nutritional value is related to the richness of essential FA (
  <span class="italic">ω</span>3 and 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>6 families). Argan oil is produced for food and cosmetic purposes. In the process of extracting the edible oil, the roasting of the almonds is systematically carried out for the development of the organoleptic characteristics such as flavour and color. As for the cosmetic oil, it is cold extracted from unroasted almonds. Our results showed that both types of extraction processes result in the same FA profile.
