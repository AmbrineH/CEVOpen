 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phospholipids content was estimated by measuring phosphorous according to AOCS recommended method Ca 12-5515 [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The method is based on ashing the oil sample in the presence of zinc oxide. The phosphorus is then determined by a spectrophotometric measurement as a blue phosphomolybdic acid complex (Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer). The phospholipids content is obtained by multiplying the phosphorus content by 25.
