  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fruits of argan tree were collected in the forest of Admine located at 15 km in the east of Agadir city (south of Morocco). Tocopherols and fatty acids homologues were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, USA). Hexane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and cyclohexane were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Argan fruits were depulpated and obtained seeds were crushed manually. Then, almonds were distributed in batches of 300 g, uniformly spread on a stainless steel plate, and placed in an electric convection oven (Binder ED 115, USA) under continuous aeration. Roasting temperatures of 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175°C were applied for duration of 10, 20, or 30 min. After cooling, the almonds were subjected to a mechanical press for cold extraction of the oil (Komet S87G press, Germany). A control sample of oil was obtained from unroasted almonds.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phospholipids content was estimated by measuring phosphorous according to AOCS recommended method Ca 12-5515 [
   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. The method is based on ashing the oil sample in the presence of zinc oxide. The phosphorus is then determined by a spectrophotometric measurement as a blue phosphomolybdic acid complex (Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer). The phospholipids content is obtained by multiplying the phosphorus content by 25.
