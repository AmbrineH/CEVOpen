 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The acid value (AV) and the peroxide value (PV) were determined according to IUPAC 2.201 [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>] and IUPAC 2.501 [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>], respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The absorbance at 233 and 270 nm was determined using a Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer after diluting oil in cyclohexane (1/100, v/v).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The color of oils was evaluated as described by Yoshida et al. [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]. Solutions of 5% of oils in chloroform (w/v) were prepared to determine absorbance at 420 nm in a Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer.
