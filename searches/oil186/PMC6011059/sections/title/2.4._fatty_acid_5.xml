 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared according to AOCS method Ce 1K-07 [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. FAME were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890, USA). The apparatus was equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a BPX70 column (60 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m film; SGE Europe). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature of the column oven was 170°C. The temperature of the injector and the detector was 220°C.
