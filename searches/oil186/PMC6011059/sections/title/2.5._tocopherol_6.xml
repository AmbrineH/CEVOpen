 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of tocopherols was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (Flexar, Perkinelmer, USA). The apparatus was equipped with a C18 column (250 mm length, 4 mm internal diameter, and 5 
  <span class="italic">Î¼</span>m particle size; Varian Inc.) and a fluorescence detector. The excitation and detection wavelengths were 290 and 330 nm, respectively. The mobile phase consisted of 2:98 tetrahydrofuran/hexane (v/v) mixture and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Oil samples were diluted in hexane (0.1g/ml) before analysis.
