GC-MS was carried out on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled with a 5975I mass selective detector (MSD) and fitted with a 7683B series injector. Chromatographic separation was performed on HP-5ms (30.0 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm). Injector temperature was 250 °C. Injection volume was 1.0 μL with split ratio of 20:1. Helium was used as carrier gas with flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was programmed from 50 °C to 200 °C at 3 °C/min, from 200 °C to 240 °C at 10 °C/min, and held at 240 °C for 10 min. With regard to MSD conditions, temperature of transfer line was 280 °C. The ion source temperature was 230 °C with the electron energy of 70 eV. The MS scan range was 29–400 amu. GC-FID was performed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a 7683B auto-sampler and coupled with a FID. A HP-5ms column (30.0 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) was used. The chromatographic conditions were the same as those for GC-MS. FID temperature was 280 °C.
