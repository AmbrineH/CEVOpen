In addition, a mixed standard solution of 2-phenylethanol, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, geraniol and citronellol (approximately 2.000 mg/mL for each in ethyl acetate) were analyzed under identical chromatographic conditions and, the number of theoretical plates (&gt; 50,000), signal-to-noise ratio (much higher than 10) and tailing factor (0.9â€“1.3) for all the five compounds were satisfactory. Moreover, the mixed standard solution was injected (with auto-sampler) in sextuplicate and RSDs of the peak areas for each compound were found to be less than 2.0%.
