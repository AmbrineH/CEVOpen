<p class="p">Statistical analysis was performed with Minitab 17 software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test was employed to determine statistical significance of variations within data. The significance level was set at 0.05 unless otherwise noted. A data matrix of 16 samples × 31 components was constructed for multivariate analyses. It consisted of percentages of main components and excluded minor components (&lt;2.0% in all samples). HCA was performed using standardized variables with Ward linkage and squared Euclidean distance. PCA was performed using the correlation matrix.</p>
