 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) sodium chloride solution (1800 mL) were sonicated under identical conditions (power, frequency and duration) as those for essential oil extraction. After that, hydro-distillation was performed for 2 h to afford the hydrolate (approximately 400 mL). Sodium chloride (40 g) was dissolved into the hydrolate and the resulting solution was immediately extracted with methylene chloride (40 mL aliquots and five cycles). The organic layer was dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to yield the hydrolate extract which was an oily liquid. It was accurately weighed and stored at −5 °C.
