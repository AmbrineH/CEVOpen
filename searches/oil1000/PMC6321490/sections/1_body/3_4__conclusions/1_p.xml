<p class="p">Essential oils and hydrolate extracts are two important natural products obtained by hydroâ€”or steam distillation from aromatic plants. For species like 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. with hundreds of cultivars, it is very necessary to study comparative chemical profiles of essential oils and hydrolate extracts from different cultivars. In this study, eight cultivars from Central China were investigated. Hydrocarbons accounted for considerable proportions of the essential oil components whereas oxygenated compounds predominated in the hydrolate extracts. Multivariate analyses with HCA and PCA further indicated the chemical differences between essential oils and hydrolate extracts. Owing to predominance of oxygenated compounds and almost trace level of hydrocarbons, 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. hydrolate extracts could be good alternatives to the essential oils. Typical oxygenated components of the hydrolate extracts were 2-phenylethanol, geraniol, citronellol, nerol, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, linalool and linalool oxides. Moreover, hydrolate extracts from different cultivars presented different chemotypes, namely methylated phenols, 2-phenylethanol, geraniol + citronellol + nerol, and mixed types. These were further confirmed by quantitative evaluation relative to the major oxygenated components. The outcome of this work will contribute to applications of 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. hydrolate extracts in fragrances and cosmetics.
