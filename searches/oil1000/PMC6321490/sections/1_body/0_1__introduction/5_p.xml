<p class="p">In spite of the existence of hundreds of cultivars, studies on essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. are limited to just a few ones. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on chemical compositions of hydrolate extracts or comparative compositions of essential oils and hydrolate extracts from different 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. cultivars. Therefore the objective of this work was to investigate comparative chemical profiles of essential oils and hydrolate extracts of eight 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. cultivars from Central China. GC-MS and GCâ€“flame ionization detector (GC-FID) were used to analyze the samples. Multivariate tools of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] were employed to further evaluate the chemical variation among samples. Chemical compositions of essential oils and hydrolate extracts were compared. The importance of hydrolate extracts from different cultivars was evaluated. The outcome of this work can contribute to applications of 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. hydrolate extracts in fragrances and cosmetics.
