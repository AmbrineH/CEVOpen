<p class="p">Furthermore, distribution of major oxygenated compounds in hydrolate extracts varied with cultivars. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03268-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, hydrolate extract from cultivar ‘SHT’ presented chemotype of methylated phenols (65.0%). This made it possess an organoleptic quality similar to Chinese rose oil. Hydrolate extract from ‘WLPS’ presented chemotype of 2-phenylethanol (64.4%). This allowed it to be an alternative to less productive rose hydrolate in China. Further, hydrolate extract from ‘BXT’ presented chemotype of geraniol + citronellol + nerol (59.9%) and, owing to very low percentage of hydrocarbons (0.5%), it could be a good alternative to expensive rose oil. On the other hand, hydrolate extracts from five other cultivars presented somewhat mixed chemotypes.
