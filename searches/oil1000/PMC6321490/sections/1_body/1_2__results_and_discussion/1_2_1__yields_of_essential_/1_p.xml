 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] Pharmacopoeias. In order to improve the extraction efficiency, salt-mediated ultrasound-assisted hydro-distillation was employed in this study. Immersion of plant materials into sodium chloride solution of a suitable concentration leads to changes of osmotic pressure of plant cells and promotes cells rupture, which accelerates the release of essential oil from inside the cells [

Key operating parameters of salt-mediated sonication include ultrasonic power and frequency, concentration of sodium chloride solution and treatment duration. Based on preliminary tests, the optimal pretreatment condition was selected as ultrasonic power of 400 W and frequency of 40 kHz, sodium chloride concentration of 5% (
