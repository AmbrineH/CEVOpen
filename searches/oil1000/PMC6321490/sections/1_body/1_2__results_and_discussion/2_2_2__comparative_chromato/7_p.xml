Briefly, the hydrolate extracts possessed higher percentages of alcohols and much lower percentages of alkanes and alkenes in comparison with essential oils from the same cultivars. For ‘YH’, ‘WLPS’, ‘JXQ’, ‘BXT’ and ‘HH’, the essential oils were mainly composed of alkanes and alkenes (31.8–63.7%) and alcohols (22.8–52.4%). For ‘FDB’, ‘SHT’ and ‘JYH’, the essential oils were mainly composed of alkanes and alkenes (29.8–52.9%), alcohols (18.8–34.5%) and ethers (16.0–49.7%). On the other hand, for ‘WLPS’, ‘JYH’, ‘YH’ and ‘BXT’, the hydrolate extracts were predominantly composed of alcohols (80.4–95.6%). For ‘JXQ’, ‘HH’, ‘FDB’ and ‘SHT’, the hydrolate extracts were mainly composed of alcohols (33.9–73.7%) and ethers (17.6–65.0%).
