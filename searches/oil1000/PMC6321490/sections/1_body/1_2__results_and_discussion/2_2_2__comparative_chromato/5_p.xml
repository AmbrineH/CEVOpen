<p class="p">The percentages of non-terpene oxygenated compounds in hydrolate extracts (24.2–96.6%) were significantly higher than those in essential oils (11.7–62.5%) from the same cultivars. These in hydrolate extracts were mainly 2-phenylethanol, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and cinnamyl alcohol, etc. 2-Phenylethanol was present with the highest percentage in hydrolate extract from ‘WLPS’ (64.4%) whereas it was not detected in that from ‘BXT’. This compound also predominates in rose (
 <italic class="italic">Rosa damascena</italic> Mill. and 
 <italic class="italic">R. rugosa</italic> Thunb.) hydrolates [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In addition, it occurs in floral volatiles of certain 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. cultivars [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. 1,3,5-Trimethoxybenzene existed with the highest percentage in hydrolate extract from ’SHT’ (64.7%). It is a key component responsible for specific floral scent of Chinese rose (
 <italic class="italic">R. chinensis</italic> Jacq.) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and also occurs in floral volatiles of several 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. cultivars [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This compound is an effective sedative and can also be used as a cosmetic additive [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Another methylated phenol was 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. It is also identified as a key floral scent component from willows (
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> species) that attracts female bees (
 <italic class="italic">Andrena vaga</italic> Panz.) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-03268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. With regard to C6 aliphatic alcohols, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol are also found to be characteristic volatile components emitted from 
 <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. buds [
