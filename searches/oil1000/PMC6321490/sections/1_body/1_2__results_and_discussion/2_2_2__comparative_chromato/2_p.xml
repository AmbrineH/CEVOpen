<p class="p">Significant compositional differences were observed between essential oils and hydrolate extracts. Hydrocarbons accounted for considerable proportions (29.8–63.7%) of the essential oil components but their percentages in hydrolate extracts were rather low (≤1.1%). On the other hand, oxygenated compounds predominated (98.3–99.8%) in hydrolate extracts. The difference between essential oils and hydrolate extracts can be explained by solubility effect. Oxygenated compounds possess relatively high water solubility and tend to dissolve into the hydrolate during distillation [
