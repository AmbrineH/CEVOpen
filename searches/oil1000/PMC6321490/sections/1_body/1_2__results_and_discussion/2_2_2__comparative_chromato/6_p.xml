<p class="p">The percentages of oxygenated terpenes in hydrolate extracts were higher than those in essential oils for cultivars except for ‘SHT’ and ‘WLPS’. These were mainly monoterpene alcohols, particularly geraniol, citronellol, nerol, linalool and linalool oxides (furanoid). Geraniol, citronellol and nerol are recognized as major monoterpene alcohols characteristic of rose oil [
