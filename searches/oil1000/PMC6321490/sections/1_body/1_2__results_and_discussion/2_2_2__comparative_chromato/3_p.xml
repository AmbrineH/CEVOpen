<p class="p">The percentages of non-terpene hydrocarbons in essential oils (29.2–57.1%) were much higher than those in hydrolate extracts (≤1.1%). These in essential oils were mainly tricosane (3.6–14.2%), nonadecane (2.1–13.0%), heptadecane (2.1–11.7%), pentadecane (2.1–11.2%), pentacosane (2.0–9.1%) and (
