  <italic class="italic">Paeonia suffruticosa</italic> Andr. is a famous ornamental and aromatic plant with hundreds of cultivars in China. The objective of this work was to investigate comparative chemical profiles of essential oils and hydrolate extracts from eight 
  <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. cultivars from Central China. The percentages of hydrocarbons in hydrolate extracts (≤1.1%) were significantly lower than those in the essential oils (29.8–63.7%). The percentages of oxygenated compounds in hydrolate extracts (98.3–99.8%) were significantly higher than those in the essential oils (34.8–69.6%). Multivariate analyses with hierarchical clusters and principal components further indicated the chemical differences between essential oils and hydrolate extracts. Due to predominance of oxygenated compounds and almost trace level of hydrocarbons, 
  <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. hydrolate extracts could be good alternatives to the essential oils. Moreover, distribution of major oxygenated compounds in hydrolate extracts varied with cultivars. Hydrolate extracts from ’SHT’, ’WLPS’ and ’BXT’ presented chemotypes of methylated phenols (65.0%), 2-phenylethanol (64.4%) and geraniol + citronellol + nerol (59.9%), respectively. Those from five other cultivars presented somewhat mixed chemotypes. These results were further confirmed by quantitative evaluation relative to the major oxygenated compounds. The outcome of this work will promote applications of 
  <italic class="italic">P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. hydrolate extracts in fragrances and cosmetics.
