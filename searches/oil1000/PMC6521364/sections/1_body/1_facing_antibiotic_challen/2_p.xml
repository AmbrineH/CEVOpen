<p id="Par10" class="p">Lyme disease is an infectious disease that can usually be successfully cured by antibiotic therapy at the very early stages of infection, targeting the replicative form of the spirochete [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Persisters are tolerant to antibiotics without having acquired resistance to them through genetic modification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. Persistence is a non-inheritable feature. This discriminates persistent cells from resistant mutants, which exhibit stable, inheritable drug insensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>]. A decrease of antibiotic pressure leads to the rise of a cell population that is as susceptible to antibiotics as the original population. A raised cell population called “reverters” constitutes a very small proportion of persisters that could revert to replicating forms and cause relapse or chronic infection [
