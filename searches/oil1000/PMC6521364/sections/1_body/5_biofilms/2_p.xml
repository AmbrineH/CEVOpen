<p id="Par18" class="p">The mode of biofilm formation of the causative agent of Lyme disease highly resembles that of other bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129" class="xref">129</xref>]. It has been shown that 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> is able to form colonies and develop aggregates with characteristic features of biofilms on biotic and abiotic substrates in a static or low-share-force environment. The use of the atomic force microscopy revealed the presence of channel-like structures in 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> biofilms that have been previously described in other biofilms and presumably serve as the routes of distribution of the oxygen and nutrition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" class="xref">130</xref>]. Sapi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>] showed that the protective extracellular substrate of 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> aggregates is predominantly composed of alginate with calcium and extracellular DNA. However, contrary to the other bacterial species that share the same pathway for alginine production, regulated by clustered 
 <italic class="italic">algA</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">algD</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">algE</italic> genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">131</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> most probably uses a yet unknown pathway of alginate production as its genome lacks the genes homologous to that mentioned above. An analysis of the key components of 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> biofilm formation highlighted the impact of RpoN-RpoS alternative sigma factor pathways that are involved in the bacterial response to the environmental stresses and are responsible for sensing environmental stimuli [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" class="xref">132</xref>]. The RpoN-RpoS signal-transduction pathway secures the successful transmission of the spirochete from tick to host, regulating the expression of over 100 genes involved in the infectious cycle, survival and stress response of 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">133</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">134</xref>]. Another regulatory pathway vital for 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> biofilm formation is the quorum sensing system, that by autoinducers triggers the population-wide differential regulation of genes involved in biofilm formation [
