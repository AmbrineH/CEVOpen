 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> biofilms have already been described in the midgut of infected tick nymphs during blood-feeding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Using confocal and epifluorescence microscopy, the authors confirmed that during the blood-feeding 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> spirochetes progress through the nymphal midgut as epithelial cell-associated networks of non-motile organisms. 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> biofilms have also been detected in human infected skin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" class="xref">114</xref>]. The reoccurrence of the disease, the ability of spirochetes to evade the host immune system and the ability to resist antibiotic treatment strongly supports the existence of biofilm-like protective structures in infected patients.
