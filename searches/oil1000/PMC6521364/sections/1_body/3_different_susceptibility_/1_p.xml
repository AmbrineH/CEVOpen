 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" class="xref">114</xref>]. Stress persisters differ from antibiotic persisters of the same 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> species due to the origin of condition that triggered their transformation. 
 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> persisters differ from 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> persisters due to the difference in environment in which the spirochetes reside [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>]. It is still unknown if the same morphological forms, for example RBs formed in response to antibiotic exposure, are the same as RBs that are present in excess in stationary growth culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>]. Recent studies confirmed that the susceptibility of heterogeneous persisters to a diverse spectrum of antibiotics is also different [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. Results of the study of three morphological forms of 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia in vitro</italic> revealed that five antimicrobial drugs commonly used as monotherapy in LD cases (doxycycline, amoxicillin, tigecycline, metronidazole and tinidazole) showed different potential in eradicating spirochetes, round bodies and biofilm-like colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]. While significant killing was shown by all five drugs in the case of replicating spirochetes (85–90%) and round bodies (68–90%), neither one of the studied drugs was able to reduce the spirochete colony formation more than 55%. In the same study, viable spirochetes were detected in 70–85% of biofilm-like colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]. Another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>] revealed that tolerance to antibiotics is increased by different forms of spirochetes as culture ages, from log phase to stationary phase, from spirochete form to RB, micro-colonies or biofilms. The same study confirmed that the use of multiple drugs (triple combination) is much more effective in eradicating spirochete persisters. The complete eradication of biofilm-like spirochete micro-colonies 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> was confirmed for a combination of daptomycin + doxycycline + cefoperazone, something that has not been achieved before with any single, dual or even triple drug combination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. Another option for successful eradication of 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> persisters 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> is the pulse dosing of antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. While a combination of multiple antibiotics from different classes analyzed in the mentioned study did not improve the killing of persisters, four pulse doses of cetriaxone eradicated all live spirochetes in culture, including persisters [
