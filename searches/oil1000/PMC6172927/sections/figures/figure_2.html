 <p> Effect of essential oil of Pterodon polygalaeflorus (EOPPgfl) on formalin test. Effect of several doses (10–60 mg/kg, orally) of EOPPgfl, morphine (Mor; 5 mg/kg, sc), and naloxone (Nal; 2 mg/kg, sc) on paw licking from 0 to 5 min (1st phase of formalin test; panel A) and from 15 to 30 min (2nd phase of formalin test; panel B) after formalin administration (intraplantar injection of 20 µL of 2.5% formalin (v/v) solution in distilled water). Con, control (intra-paw injection of 20 µL of saline). Data are reported as means±SE (n=8). A, *P&lt;0.001 compared to control; #P&lt;0.001 compared to Mor (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks, d.f.=8, H=43.151 followed Dunn’s post hoc test). B, *P&lt;0.001 compared to control; #P&lt;0.001 compared to Mor (parametric one-way ANOVA, d.f. 1=8, d.f. 2=55, F=11.961 followed Bonferroni post hoc test). </p>
