 <p> Effect of essential oil of Pterodon polygalaeflorus (EOPPgfl) on carrageenan-, dextran-, and formalin-induced edema. A1, Time course of alteration induced by EOPPgfl (orally) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg, ip) on edema induced by carrageenan (control, intraplantar injection of 50 μL of 6.0 mg/mL carrageenan solution in saline). A2, Area under the curves shown in A1 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd phase of carrageenan edematogenic effect. *P&lt;0.001 compared to control; #P&lt;0.001 compared to 10 mg/kg; $P&lt;0.001 compared to 10 and 30 mg/kg (parametric one-way ANOVA, 1st phase, d.f. 1=4, d.f. 2=35, F=23.675; 2nd phase, d.f. 1=4, d.f. 2=35, F=35.545; 3rd phase, d.f. 1=4, d.f. 2=35, F=59.183, followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test). B1, Time course of alteration induced by EOPPgfl (orally) and cyproheptadine (10 mg/kg, ip) on edema induced by dextran (control, intraplantar injection of 50 μL of 6.0 mg/mL dextran solution in saline). B2, Area under the curves shown in B1 for dextran edematogenic effect. *P&lt;0.05 compared to control (parametric one-way ANOVA, d.f. 1=3, d.f. 2=28, F=28.003, followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test). C, Alteration induced by EOPPgfl (orally) on edema induced by formalin (control, intraplantar injection of 20 μL of formalin 2.5% v/v in saline). *P=0.003, compared to control (non-paired t-test). Data are reported as means±SE (n=8-10 in all cases). </p>
