 <p> Effect of essential oil of Pterodon polygalaeflorus (EOPPgfl) on acetic acid-induced writhing. A, Effect of several doses (10–300 mg/kg, orally) of EOPPgfl and of indomethacin (Ind, 10 mg/kg, ip) on the number of writhings; EOPPgfl and Ind were administered 60 and 30 min, respectively, before acetic acid administration. Ten min after acetic acid administration, the writhings were counted during 20 min. Con: control. B, Time course of the EOPPgfl effect (30 mg/kg, orally). Each animal received a single dose of EOPPgfl. Data are reported as means±SE (n=8–10). A, *P&lt;0.001 compared to control; #P&lt;0.001 compared to 30 mg/kg EOPPgfl (one-way ANOVA, d.f. 1=7, d.f. 2=60, F=17.931, followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test). B, *P=0.002 compared to control (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks, d.f.=4, H=16.923, followed by Dunn's post hoc test). </p>
