<p class="p">The investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of EOPPgfl action was not the objective of this study. However, it is known that in the second phase of the formalin test, the release of inflammatory mediators occurs, and that there are differences in the edema induced by carrageenan and dextran. Dextran, within 30 min after its injection, leads to edema mediated by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>) due to degranulation of mast cells (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Carrageenan induces an acute vascular response with protein-rich exudate and containing large numbers of neutrophils (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). The first relates to the release of histamine and serotonin, the second (90â€“150 min) is mediated by the release of bradykinin (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), and finally in the third phase, the mediator is suspected to be prostaglandin (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). In the late phase of the formalin test, the release of inflammatory mediators (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>) occurs such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>), thus the edema must be due to such mediators.
