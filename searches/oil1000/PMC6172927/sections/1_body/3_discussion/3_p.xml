<p class="p">The results demonstrated that the calculated LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for EOPPgfl, given orally, was 3.4 g/kg allowing the oil to be classified within the category of low-toxicity essential oils (
 <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>) and to be considered a safe oil regarding acute toxic aspects. It is important to note that the doses that inhibit nociception and edema formation in the various models tested are in the range of 10â€“100 mg/kg, which represent doses below 3% of LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>. Thus, EOPPgfl can be considered to have high therapeutic potentiality. Moreover, this study also showed that EOPPgfl possesses antinociceptive activity on chemical and thermal nociception models.
