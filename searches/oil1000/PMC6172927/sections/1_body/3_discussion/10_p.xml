<p class="p">In conclusion, EOPPgfl was active in nociception and acute inflammation in rodents at very low doses in relation to its LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, which is compatible with its use in folk medicine. Given the large yield of the seeds, it can be hypothesized that EOPPgfl is at least part of the active principle of the effects of the seeds preconized in folk medicine. Therefore, the current investigation provides information for the search of a novel candidate for the prevention and treatment of inflammation, either EOPPgfl (with a chemical composition here described) or a combination of its major constituents.
