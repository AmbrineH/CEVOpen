<p class="p">In the hot plate test, 30 mg/kg EOPPgfl increased the latency time to the thermal stimulus. This test of thermal nociception is a good method for measuring the effects of opioid analgesics but it is not sensitive to the analgesic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). EOPPgfl increased the response time to the thermal stimulus in the hot plate test, suggesting that EOPPgfl acted primarily at the spinal medulla and/or higher central nervous system levels (

In order to investigate the participation of an indirect mechanism of the effect of EOPPgfl, its action in acetic acid-induced writhing and in the formalin tests was investigated and the oil showed antinociceptive effects in both tests.
