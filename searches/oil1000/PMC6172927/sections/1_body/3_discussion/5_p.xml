<p class="p">Acetic acid-induced writing is a model sensitive to analgesic substances of central or peripheral action, allowing the assessment of varied mechanisms of action (

 <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). Therefore, the effectiveness of EOPPgfl in decreasing acetic acid-induced contortions, although suggesting an involvement of primarily neural mechanisms, does not exclude a antinociceptive effect of EOPPgfl due to anti-inflammatory activity, secondary to inhibitory action on the phlogistic activity of autacoids such as histamine, serotonin, and/or prostaglandin. Despite a dose-dependent relationship, EOPPgfl doses above 60 mg/kg no longer had a significant antinociceptive effect in acetic acid-induced writhing, which was surprising. Although we do not have a clear explanation for this finding, it can be suggested that in these doses, some components of EOPPgfl somehow prevent the action of the constituent promoting antinociceptive activity. Although pronounced, the effect of EOPPgfl was lower than that caused by indomethacin (10 mg/kg,
