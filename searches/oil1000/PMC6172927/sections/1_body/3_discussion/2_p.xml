<p class="p">The sample of 
 <italic class="italic">P. polygalaefllorus</italic> seeds of the present investigation produced the same yield (2.4% of EO) found by Evangelista et al. (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>) and Leonhardt et al (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), thus confirming the great EO yield of the seeds. It is also worth mentioning that this yield was obtained using a cheap and easy method of EO extraction: steam distillation (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). The chromatographic analysis identified 100% of the compounds, predominantly sesquiterpenes, which largely differed from that of the previous investigation (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). In the present case, there was a major constituent (beta-elemene, 48.2%, followed by trans-caryophyllene, 19.5%), whilst in the previous study a major constituent was not identified (Î²-cariophyllene, 20.6%, followed by spatulenol, 16.6%). This is not surprising, since it is known that EO compositions differ with the place and season of collection (
 <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>); the time of collection of the present and previous samples differed (February 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic> October, respectively). Since there is a large difference in chemical composition and it may affect the pharmacological results, care should be taken to obtain the appropriate EOPPgfl sample.
