<p class="p">It is known that the formalin test is a behavioral evaluation method used to measure the efficacy of antinociceptive agents with different mechanisms of action (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). In the first phase, starting immediately after formalin injection and with a duration of 3 to 5 min (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>), the nociception is attributed to a peripheral neural mechanism and related to the direct chemical stimulation of type C nociceptor afferent fibers and, in part, of type AÎ´ fibers and is associated with the release of excitatory amino acids, nitric oxide, and substance P. In the second phase, which begins 15 to 20 min after the injection and lasts for 20 to 40 min, pain is attributed to inflammatory activity and/or alteration of central processing (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). In the formalin test, EOPPgfl was effective in both first and second phases of the test. The effectiveness of EOPPgfl during the first phase of formalin test suggests a peripheral neural mechanism. On the other hand, the effectiveness EOPPgfl during the second phase of formalin test is consistent with an anti-inflammatory action and/or alteration of central processing. In these effects, there was probably no involvement of opioid receptors since they were not blocked by naloxone (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>), which blocked the effect of morphine.
