 <italic class="italic">P. polygalaeflorus</italic> has anti-inflammatory activity by modulation of B cells and lymphocyte activation. Due to the effect of EOPPgfl in the second phase of the formalin test and because of the medicinal use of 
 <italic class="italic">P. polygalaeflorus</italic> seed extracts for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, we hypothesized that EOPPgfl acted by a mechanism that includes an indirect anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, in order to investigate the participation of an anti-inflammatory mechanism of EOPPgfl, the effectiveness of EOPPgfl in paw edema induced by noxious stimulation was investigated. Formalin, carrageenan, and dextran were used as inflammatory agents. EOPPgfl inhibited edema from the three substances suggesting that its anti-nociceptive effect is primarily due to a large spectrum anti-inflammatory activity. It is important to highlight that this antiedematogenic activity was coherent with reports on the pharmacological effects of EOPPgfl major constituents. The sesquiterpene beta-elemene, in investigations with macrophages of rats, was observed to inhibit the synthesis of PGE2 and NO (
