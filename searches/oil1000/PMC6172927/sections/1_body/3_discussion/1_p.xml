<p class="p">This study was designed to evaluate the antinociceptive, antiedematogenic, and acute toxic effects of EOPPgfl in experimental models of pain and inflammation. The results demonstrated that EOPPgfl, with the chemical composition here described, presented very low acute toxicity and antinociceptive effects, probably due to anti-inflammatory activities.</p>
