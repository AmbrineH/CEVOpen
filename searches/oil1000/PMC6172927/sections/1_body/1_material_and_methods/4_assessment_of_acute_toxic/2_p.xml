<p class="p">To determine LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, the animals were randomly separated into 6 groups: 1 control and 5 experimental groups. Each experimental group received, through orogastric cannula, different concentrations of EOPPgfl (1â€“8 g/kg). The control group received only vehicle (0.1% Tween 80 in 0.9% saline). The animals were then placed in cages with water and feed 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> and observed for a period of 72 h. After this period, the number of deaths in each group was observed and reported as percentage of the total number of animals. Calculation of LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was done by semi-logarithmic interpolation, where the EOPPgfl doses were plotted on the abscissa axis and the values corresponding to the probit percentage of deaths on the ordinate axis.
