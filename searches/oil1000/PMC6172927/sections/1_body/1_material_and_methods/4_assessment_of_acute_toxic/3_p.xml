<p class="p">To evaluate changes in behavioral parameters, animals were randomly separated in 5 experimental groups (10 animals/group). The animals were initially observed for 72 h for the following behavioral parameters: alertness, analgesia, spontaneous motor activity, locomotion, sedation, response to touch, nasal secretion, piloerection, ptosis, dyspnea, urination, diarrhea, and seizure. They were then treated with the same doses of EOPPgfl or vehicle and observed for the same parameters during the first 3 h and, at 24-h intervals, for 72 h.</p>
