 <italic class="italic">P. polygalaeflorus</italic> Benth collected in the municipality of São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Maranhão state in February 1999 by steam distillation method. Chemical composition was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the Technological Development Park of Federal University of Ceará (PADETEC-UFC) by Craveiro (

Briefly the conditions were as follows: Hewlett-Packard 6971 (USA); dimethylpolysiloxane DB-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.1 μm); helium (1 mL/min) as carrier gas; injector temperature: 250°C; detector temperature: 200°C; column temperature: 35–180°C at 4°C/min and then 180-250°C at 10°C/min; and mass spectra: electronic impact 70 eV. The compounds were identified using a NIST mass spectral library search (more information on
