<p class="p">In order to obtain carrageenan- and dextran-induced paw edema, the phlogistic agents (both 300 µg/paw) were injected into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw. The contralateral paw received an equal volume of sterile saline. The animals received EOPPgfl (10–60 mg/kg) orally or vehicle. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg, 
 <italic class="italic">ip</italic>) or cyproheptadine (10 mg/kg, 
 <italic class="italic">ip</italic>) were used as positive controls. The time course of the carrageenan-induced paw edema was considered to have three phases: a first (from 1 to 90 min), a second (from 91 to 150 min), and a third phase (from 151 to 240 min) (

 <italic class="italic">sc</italic> into the right hind paw. The animals received EOPPgfl (60 mg/kg) orally or vehicle. Paw licking was then measured during the first 5 min (considered as the first phase of formalin test) and at 15 min after the formalin injection (considered as the second phase of the test).
