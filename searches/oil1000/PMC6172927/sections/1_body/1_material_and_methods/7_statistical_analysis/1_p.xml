<p class="p">All data are reported as meansÂ±SE, where n is the number of experiments. The difference between two groups was assessed by the unpaired Student's 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test. The significance (P&lt;0.05) of the results that demanded multiple comparisons was initiated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality of data distribution. In the cases in which normality was rejected, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn's 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test was done; otherwise parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni or Holm-Sidak 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test was employed. For each experimental series analyzed and parametric data, the ANOVA parameters d.f.
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (degree of freedom related to the number of independent variables, between groups), d.f.
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (degree of freedom related to the number of observations in each group, within group), and F (ratio of the mean square variation estimates of data between groups and within group) were used. For non-parametric data, ANOVA on rank parameters d.f. (degree of freedom) and H (value computed by ranking all observations from smallest to largest without regard to treatment group) was used. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant for all 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> tests. Statistical analysis was done using Sigma Stat and Sigma Plot software (Systat Inc., USA).
