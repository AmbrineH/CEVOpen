<p class="p">For the formalin test, different groups of animals received EOPPgfl (10-100 mg/kg) orally or vehicle, 60 min before the treatment with 20 µL of formalin (2.5% v/v) administered into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw. The time the animal spent licking the paw during the first 5 min (early phase) and from 15 to 30 min (late phase) post-formalin injection served as measures of sensitivity. The test was done at ambient temperature of 22–26°C and care was taken to exclude environmental disturbance (high temperature, noise, and excessive movement) that might interfere with the animal's response. In another experimental series, a group of animals received naloxone (2 mg/kg,
