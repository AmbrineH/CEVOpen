<p class="p">For the writhing test, different groups of animals (n = 8–10 animals/group) received EOPPgfl (10–100 mg/kg, orally) or vehicle (0.1% Tween 80 in sterile saline, orally), 60 min before, or indomethacin (10 mg/kg, 
 <italic class="italic">ip</italic>), 30 min before noxious stimulation with 
 <italic class="italic">ip</italic> injection of acetic acid (0.6% v/v; 0.1 mL/10 g body weight). Then, abdominal writhes were recorded for 20 min, starting 10 min after acetic acid injection. In another experimental series, a time course for the effect of the oil (30 mg/kg, orally) administered 15, 30, 60, and 120 min before noxious stimulation was carried out. Antinociceptive activity is reported as the number of abdominal constrictions.
