<p class="p">For the hot plate test, a mouse was placed on a plate maintained at 50.0 ± 1°C and the latency of its reaction to this nociceptive stimulus (number of seconds before it licked its hind paw or jumped) was quantified, with an interruption time ≤45 s. The test used only mice that in a pretest showed a hot plate reaction time ≤20 s. The latency of the reaction to nociception was measured at time 0 (60 min after EOPPgfl, 30 mg/kg, or vehicle administration) and then at 30 min intervals up to the 180th min.</p>
