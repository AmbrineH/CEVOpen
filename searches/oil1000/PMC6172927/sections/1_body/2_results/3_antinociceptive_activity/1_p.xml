<p class="p">EOPPgfl (20, 30, and 60 mg/kg) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05, ANOVA, Dunn test) writhing number from 51.9±1.62 counts (n=10) (control value) to 35.2±2.64 (n=10), 25.9±2.32 (n=10), 31.2±5.8, and 7.5±2.8 counts (n=8), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01" class="xref">Figure 1A</xref>). This reduction corresponded to 32.2, 50.1, 39.8, and 85.5%. The effect of EOPPgfl was time-dependent since EOPPgfl (30 mg/kg), administered 15, 30, 60, or 120 min prior to the time of writhing measurement, induced writhing reduction that amounted to 27.0, 37.7, 46.8, and 31.2%, respectively. The EOPPglf-induced writhing reduction is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01" class="xref">Figure 1B</xref>; the reduction was significant at 30 and 60 min.
