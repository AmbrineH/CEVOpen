<p class="p">As assessed by the hot plate test, EOPPgfl significantly increased the latency time for nociceptive response to the thermal stimulus starting at 30 min and spanning throughout the observation period of 180 min. The peak of EOPPgfl effect occurred at 60 min when the latency time increased from 6.5 (control value) to 15.0 s. The effect of EOPPgfl was similar to that of morphine, although the effect of the oil lasted longer (
