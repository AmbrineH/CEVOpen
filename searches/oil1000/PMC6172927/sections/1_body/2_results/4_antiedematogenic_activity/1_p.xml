<p class="p">EOPPgfl significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced edema from the 30th to the 240th min of the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>1 and A2). At the three phases of carrageenan-induced edema, the paw volume increase underwent inhibition with all EOPPgfl doses, as demonstrated by the decrease of the area under the curve of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>2. At doses of 100 mg/kg, the effect of EOPPgfl was similar to the effect of indomethacin (inhibition of 80%). EOPPgfl at 30 and 60 mg/kg also inhibited the edema induced by dextran (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>) and at 60 mg/kg inhibited formalin-induced edema (2.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>). In the edema induced by dextran, the effect of EOPPgfl (30 and 60 mg/kg) occurred throughout the observation period and was similar to the effect of cyproheptadine. EOPPgfl at 60 mg/kg produced a 55.7% inhibition of the edema caused by formalin.
