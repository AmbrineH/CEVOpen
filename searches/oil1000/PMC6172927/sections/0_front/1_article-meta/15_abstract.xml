 <p class="p">Essential oils (EO) are volatile liquids responsible for the aroma of plants. 
  <italic class="italic">Pterodon polygalaeflorus</italic> seeds have received widespread use in folk medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. For this reason and because 
  <italic class="italic">Pterodon polygalaeflorus</italic> seeds have great EO content, which is frequently pharmacologically active, the present study aimed to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of EO from 
  <italic class="italic">Pterodon polygalaeflorus</italic> (EOPPgfl) and its acute toxic effects. The EEOPPgfl sample, which was extracted by steam distillation of the seeds, had a yield of 2.4% of the seeds weight and had, as major constituents, beta-elemene (48.19%), trans-caryophyllene (19.51%), and epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene (12.24%). The EOPPgfl sample showed mild acute toxicity and its calculated median lethal dose (LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was 3.38 g/kg. EOPPgfl (20–60 mg/kg) showed antinociceptive activity as evidenced by several tests and inhibited writhing induced by acetic acid. The maximum effect was obtained with the 30 mg/kg dose and at 60 min after its administration. EOPPgfl also decreased formalin-induced nociception, as verified by the inhibition of the first and second phase of the formalin test. At 30 mg/kg, EOPPgfl also decreased thermally stimulated nociception. Nociception may be related to inflammatory and antiedematogenic activity and at doses ranging 10–100 mg/kg, EOPPgfl blocked dextran- and carrageenan-induced edema. The results demonstrated that EOPPgfl presented, at doses approximately 100 times smaller than LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>, an antinociceptive effect that probably was due to anti-inflammatory activities.
