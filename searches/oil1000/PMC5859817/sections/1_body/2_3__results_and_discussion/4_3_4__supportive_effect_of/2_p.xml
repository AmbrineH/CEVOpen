<p class="p">For reconfirmation of efficiency of essential oil on wound healing process, we investigated the microscopic structure of skin from burn wounds treated with essential oil, tamanu oil, and saline via histological examination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Histology studies revealed that burn wounds treated with essential oil developed complete epidermal structure: squamous epithelium covered on epidermis, the stratum spinosum keratinized, observation of matured hair follicles, thick and neatly arranged fibers, and scattered immune cells. That proved that burn wound treated with essential oil was fully recovered. In tamanu oil treated mice, wounds were partially recovered with existence of coagulative necrosis region on epidermis and vascular congestion, swollen stromal tissue, and no matured hair follicles. On the contrary, saline treated mice formed uneven epidermal layer with the necrotic ulcer on epidermis layer, infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmatocytes and multinuclear leukocytes, existence of granulation tissue, and fibrosis region. These results suggested that
