 <xref rid="B118-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>]. The choice of an appropriate encapsulation technique, and carrier material and size depend upon processing and storage conditions, triggers and mechanisms of release, and the cost and scale of production. For the targeted delivery of carriers in feed to the lower intestine, the process conditions include the slow digestion of the carrier matrix and matrix thermal stability at animal body temperature. Digestion rate depends on the type of compounds and their structural ordering. Consequently, digestion of long-chain-triglycerides (LCT) is slower than the digestion of proteins. Digestion of polysaccharides is more rapid. However, polymer structural ordering in crystal domains could slow the digestion compared with amorphous domains. A good example of this is starch. The digestion of polysaccharides can be slowed by forming various types of polysaccharide-protein hydrogel carriers. Consequently, oil-carriers can be classified as either polymer-based particles or lipid-based particles.
