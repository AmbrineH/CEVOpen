<p class="p">Oil carriers protect essential oils and ensure their delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Without proper protection, most orally administrated essential oils may not reach the lower intestine where most foodborne pathogens reside and propagate. In addition, essential oils tend to interact with food or feed components, leading to reduced antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B123-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. Consequently, the optimization of carrier performance in terms of chemical stability under gastric conditions and mechanical stability during mixing with feed components are prerequisites for whole process optimization. For example, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>] evaluated alginate-whey protein microcapsules use for intestinal delivery of lipophilic compounds (carvacrol) in pigs and concluded that large particles increase delivery of carvacrol to the end of the small intestine.
