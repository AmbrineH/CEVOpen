<p class="p">Due to the high sensitivity of EOs to temperature, pH, and other factors, they need to be encapsulated to ensure stability and consistency of the bioactive components of PFA and programmed release in the gastric tract. Maltodextrins, as carriers for volatile thymol and cinnamaldehyde (TC), reduce TC evaporation and increase the shelf life of feed that contains TC [

Moreover, encapsulation is a reasonable choice due to the strong odor and high volatility of EOs influencing the feed intake, in addition to their high reactivity where too-high concentrations can have negative effects [
