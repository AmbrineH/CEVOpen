<p class="p">Liposomes include a vesicular self-assembled system comprised of one or more bilayers, usually formed using a phospholipid surrounding an aqueous core. Liposomes can contain: (1) one bilayer forming unilamellar vesicles, (2) several concentric bilayers forming multi lamellar vesicles, or (3) non-concentric bilayers forming multi vesicular vesicles [
