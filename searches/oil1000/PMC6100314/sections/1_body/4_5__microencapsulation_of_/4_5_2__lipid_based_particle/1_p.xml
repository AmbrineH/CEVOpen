<p class="p">Lipid-based particles include some vegetable oils and liposomes. Vegetable oils are a mixture of triglycerides (major components) and minor components that account for less than 5%, such as glycerolipids (as mono- and di-glycerides), phospholipids, and non-glycerolipids, including sterols, tocopherols, tocotrienols, free fatty acids, vitamins, pigments, proteins, phenolic compounds, and water [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. Vegetable oils with long-chain triglycerides, such as corn oil, nut oil, and canola oil, can be applied as lipid-based particles due to the small digestion rate [

The water is then removed by evaporation under stirring, providing the formation of compact lipid particles in which essential oils are already encapsulated. These techniques can be combined with the spray cooling encapsulation technique. Spray cooling microencapsulation is considered the cheapest encapsulation technology as it uses lower temperatures and with the potential for scale-up [
