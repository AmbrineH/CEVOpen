<p class="p">Extrusion techniques ensure the encapsulation of more nanometer-sized oil droplets within polysaccharide hydrogel beads. It is the most popular method for encapsulation of food ingredients due to the simple procedure, relatively low preparation temperature, and larger production capacity. This encapsulation technique involves preparing a hydrocolloid solution, adding food ingredient, and then the solution is dripped through a syringe needle or nozzle into a solution that promotes gelation. The size of particles is influenced by the diameter of the needle or nozzle, the flow rate, the viscosity of the solution, and the properties of the gelling environment [

Combination of oil coacervation obtained by proteins and further entrapment within polysaccharide hydrogel matrix using the extrusion technique has been applied for preparing complex beads. These complex beads are more rigid than the simple polysaccharide beads [
