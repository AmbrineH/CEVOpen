<p class="p">Corresponding encapsulation techniques could include: (1) simple and complex coacervation of essential oil droplets; (2) extrusion; and (3) combination of simple coacervation and extrusion. Spray drying is not suitable for encapsulation of essential oils due to their thermal sensitivity. Coacervation ensures single droplets are covered by viscoelastic shell. Simple coacervation involves only one polymer and separation phase via salt addition or pH and temperature changes. Complex coacervation involves the formation of a two-layer shell. The inner layer should be made from amphiphilic materials. The outer layer usually consists of polysaccharides to ensure the mechanical stability of oil carriers and satisfy process conditions. PVA and proteins have been used as the inner layer [
