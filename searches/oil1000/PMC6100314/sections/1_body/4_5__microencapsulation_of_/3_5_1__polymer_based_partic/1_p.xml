<p class="p">Polymer-based particles are usually composites of natural polymers such as protein-polysaccharide hydrogels. They are stiff enough to ensure mechanical stability of particles during mixing with granular feed. Proteins like wheat proteins [

 <xref rid="B123-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>], soy proteins, and gelatin are frequently used. Applied polysaccharides and their mixtures in the form of hydrogel include: alginate [

 <xref rid="B128-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. The level of protein-polysaccharide interactions depends on many factors including biopolymer characteristics (size, conformation, mixing ratio, biopolymer type, and type and distribution of reactive sites), solvent conditions (pH, salts, and temperature), total biopolymer concentration, and emulsion preparation method [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Combining the amphiphilic properties of proteins and the hydrophilic properties of polysaccharides can improve the functional properties, including thermal and mechanical stabilities of the complex shell around the oil droplets. Polysaccharides electrostatically associate with proteins, forming a coacervate for pH values in the range between isoelectric points for proteins and polysaccharides.
