<p class="p">Most of the studies focused on the growth-promoting features of PFA, to achieve that purpose, production parameters, such as feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), were monitored [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Many reports reported results on the positive growth-promoting effects of PFA on pigs and poultry; however, inconsistent data between species and among same species were recorded in the comprehensive review papers of Windisch et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], Franz et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and Zeng et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Variability in the effects were explained by the complexity of EOs and other PFA, and differences in animalsâ€™ gastro-intestinal tract anatomy and function [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The problem in estimating the reliability of in vivo results was also stressed, considering that some trials are commercially oriented and therefore information on phytochemical composition and feed formulation are scarce or missing [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The growth-promoting feature of PFA and EOs is associated mainly with effects on the gastro-intestinal tract to: increase the palatability of feed, stimulate secretion of digestive fluids, improve intestinal morphology, stabilize intestinal microbiome, and reduce inflammation [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Enhanced palatability of animal feed stimulates appetite and increases feed intake differently among species [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Namely, poultry is less sensitive to odor [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], whereas the reaction of pigs to PFA presence in feed is inconsistent and variable [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. For example, pigs prefer garlic and rosemary in feed rather than ginger or oregano [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The lack of preference to feed supplemented by thyme and oregano by weaned piglets has been documented [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Oregano has a strong aroma that can cause feed refusal [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, the refusal of all feed in weaning period is also related to a lack of contact with flavor in the perinatal period [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. PFA is proposed to prevent animal feed spoilage and later release of undesirable smells due to their antioxidant attributes [
