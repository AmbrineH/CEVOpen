<p class="p">The antioxidant effects of EOs and their individual components were reported [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], whereas their prooxidant activity is thought to be connected with reducing tumor cell proliferation, either by apoptosis or necrotic effects [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Essential oils are thought to not have any specific cellular targets due to the number of its constituents [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of EOs related to their ability to act as an anti-inflammatory agent. A large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages through the process of bacterial phagocytosis. ROS oxidative damage on biological macro molecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA is considered as the initial phase of various diseases, aging, and cancer [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Another inflammatory role of ROS is the modulation of transcription factors Nrf2 and NF-ÎºB, which are involved in the expression of important cytokines [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. EOs are able to scavenge ROS and decrease the oxidative damage of a tissue that has been linked to the reduction of inflammation [
