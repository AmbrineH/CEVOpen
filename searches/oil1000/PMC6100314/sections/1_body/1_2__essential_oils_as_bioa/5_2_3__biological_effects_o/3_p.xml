<p class="p">Antibacterial effects of EOs are a result of their lipophilic characteristic and related ability to penetrate through the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, disrupting the structure of the membrane and inner cell structures [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The permeabilization of the bacterial membrane is linked to the leakage of ions, the reduction in the membrane potential, and disruption of membrane enzymes [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Lipophilic hydrocarbon compounds were postulated to accumulate in the membrane lipid bilayer of bacterial cell, affecting the lipid–protein interaction, in addition to direct interactions with the membrane’s hydrophobic proteins [

 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. QS particularly mediates the expression of bacterial genes responsible for synthesis of virulence factors; therefore, it is important for bacteria–host interactions [
