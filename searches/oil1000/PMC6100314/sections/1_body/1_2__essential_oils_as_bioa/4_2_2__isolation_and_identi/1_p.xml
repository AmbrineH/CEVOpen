The most common method for isolation of essential oils is hydro or steam distillation used for the different components of aromatic plants, like leaves, seeds, roots, and flowers. Cold pressing is also used for some fruit peels, such as with citrus [

Organic solvent extractions and a range of new and advanced isolation techniques mainly for the volatile fraction have been developed. These include supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE), subcritical extraction liquids using H
