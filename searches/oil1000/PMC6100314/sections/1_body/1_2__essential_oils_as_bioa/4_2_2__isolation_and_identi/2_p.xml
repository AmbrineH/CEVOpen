<p class="p">Two main approaches are available for screening the composition of essential oils and their related products and adulterations: the chemical fingerprint of the total sample and determining the particular marker (single compound or group of compounds) of an essential oil. A group of advanced techniques for chemical fingerprinting has been developed, in addition to some standard and “first choice” methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]: (1) sensory analysis to assess the odor and the color; (2) physical analysis to obtain information on viscosity, moisture, solubility, optical rotation, specific gravity, refractive index, residue on evaporation, and freezing point; and (3) chemical analysis for determination of the acid, ester, carbonyl, and aldehyde index, in addition to the phenol content. The main instrumental methods used in determining essential oils chemical composition are spectroscopic techniques, including UV and visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, together with separation techniques, such as gas chromatography (GC), chiral GC, liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, (HPLC), and coupled and multidimensional chromatography [
