Generally, EOs play important roles in the protection of the plant against external agents, including direct and indirect plant responses to pathogens, herbivores, and pollinators, and responses to climate impacts and environmental stresses, such as drought, high temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) light [

Plants are known to produce a high number of terpenoids used for specialized purposes, such as volatile defensive signals (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, defensive toxins (mainly diterpene and sesquiterpene phytoalexins), and photoprotectants (isoprene and carotenoids), as reported by McCaskill and Croteau [
