<p class="p">Essential oils are a complex mixture of different volatile and non-volatile compounds. Terpenoids are known as a major class of essential oil components. Among natural compounds, the terpenoids are the largest family of plant secondary metabolites, with over 40,000 different chemical structures described to date [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Terpenoids are synthesized in different types of plant glandular tissues, primarily glandular trichomes, both peltate and capitate [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Such micromorphological structures are a typical feature of the Labiatae family [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Essential oils could also be found in secretory canals, ducts, and other specialized secreting structures, such as translucent glands occurring on the leaf surface of some Hypericum species [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In fact, terpenoids are found to be produced by each plant organ, including the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. More than 80,000 plants are recognized for their bioactive properties [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], and EOs are a feature of more than 17,000 plant species [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], belonging to about 60 plant families, among which the Alliaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, and Rutaceae are the most distinctive [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The EO composition among plants varies considerably, with differences among different organs and parts of the same individual, as well as differences occurring during development and ontogeny of a species and those caused by the influence of environmental conditions [
