<p class="p">EOs contain various compounds, including terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, and phenolics [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] that all contribute to the specific and often unique aromatic and bioactive properties of a range of herbs and spices [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. EOs predominantly contain monoterpenoids (C10) and sesquiterpenoids (C15); the latter are highly pharmaceutically relevant [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Apart from terpene compounds (mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes), essential oils contain alcohols, esters, aldehydes, acids, ketones, epoxides, amines, and sulfides [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Isoprenoids or terpenoids, the main compounds of essential oils, are formed by combining of isoprene units (C5H8), which further build monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20) of two, three, or four isoprene units, respectively [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The basic carbon terpene skeleton is additionally modified by isomerization, oxidation, reduction, and conjugation, leading to a range of different terpenoid compounds [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Monoterpenes include hydrocarbons aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, and lactones, whereas the sesquiterpenes exhibit a high range of structures with more than 100 different skeletons [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Terpenoids are formed by multiple biosynthetic pathways where two main precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), are formed by two independent reaction chains of a plant cell [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The acetate-mevalonate pathway of a cytoplasm, starting with the condensation of acetyl-CoA, results in the creation of sesquiterpenoids, whereas the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway that uses pyruvate and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate results in the synthesis of isoprene, monoterpenes, and diterpenes [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Many of resulting monoterpenes (e.g., limonene, thymol, carvacrol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, Î³-terpinene, and menthol) and sesquiterpenes (e.g., caryophyllene, cadinene, humulene, germacrene, and zingiberene) have a cyclic structure [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. However, the complex route that evolved for terpene biosynthesis in plants has been reported, where monoterpenes are synthesized in plastids and the cytosol by canonical monoterpene synthases, in addition to existence of a terpene synthase-independent pathway [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. High variability in the chemical structure of terpenoid compounds is a consequence of the diversity of terpene synthases, which can convert a phenyl diphosphate into different products through a range of reaction cycles [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Aromatic compounds of essential oils, which are less reported than the terpenoids, are synthetized by a separate shikimate pathway [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>].
