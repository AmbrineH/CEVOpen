<p class="p">The high reactivity of EOs represents another obstacle for their direct application and incorporation into food and feed products; their mode of action must also be interpreted. Maintaining their biological activity presents a challenge, as do suppressing their reactivity and minimizing the impact of expressed organoleptic properties. The stability and bioactivity of EOs can be compromised by temperature, light, metals, and water and oxygen availability in production systems [
