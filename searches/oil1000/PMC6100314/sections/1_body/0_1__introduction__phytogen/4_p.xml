<p class="p">PFA are considered as a first line alternative to antibiotic growth promotors (AGP) based on their complex bioactivity, mainly due to antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties of plant bioactive compounds [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Biological activities of PSC are positively reflected on feed palatability, digestive functions, and animal intestinal microbiome structure, as well as improved production performance in poultry, pigs, and ruminant and aquaculture animals [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Most reports are related to PFA growth-promoting effects [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In addition, the effects on reproduction [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], milk [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], egg [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and meat [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] quality parameters have been documented. Evidence has shown that PFA may minimize the environmental impact of the livestock industry by reducing emissions into the atmosphere of ammonia from pig production, and methane from fermentation in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Foot dermatitis caused by increased levels of ammonia is used as a parameter to evaluate poultry welfare [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Similarly, by decreasing ammonia levels, PFA have potential to impact animal welfare. However, PFA are not recognized as a reliable AGP replacement. Inconsistent results have been reported between in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as between studies where in vivo effects on animal health and production were studied [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The mode of action of bioactive plant metabolites is not completely understood [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], hence the ability to control of quality and proper placement for PFA in the animal industry is limited. In general, PFA have a dual role: to improve the feed quality and to improve animal health and the performance of animal products. PFA include a wide range of plant bioactive compounds. Based on their biosynthetic origins, plant secondary metabolites can be divided into the following major groups: phenolics, nitrogen-containing alkaloids, sulphur-containing compounds, and terpenoids. All these metabolites share basic functional groups, including alkyls, benzyl rings, hydroxyls, alcohols, and steroids [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], whereas the combination of various chemical groups leads to the generation of new molecules with unique chemical structures and related biological activity. DNA sequencing of genes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites indicates that thousands of genes potentially encode enzymes of secondary metabolic biochemical pathways [
