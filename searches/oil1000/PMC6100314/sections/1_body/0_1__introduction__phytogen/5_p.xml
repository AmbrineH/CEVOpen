<p class="p">Different databases indicate an existence of more than 320,000 secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and up to 1,000,000 different metabolites are thought to be produced in the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Genetic, ontogenic, morphogenetic, and environmental factors are important in the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. A single plant has the capacity for biosynthesis of up to 25,000 compounds at any given moment [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Secondary plant metabolites are synthesized in different types of plant cells and are derived from nitrogen metabolism through a range of modifications, such as deamination. In contrast to the primary metabolites, which are key photosynthetic products aiming at maintenance of plant life, the secondary metabolites are characterized by low abundance, often less than 1% of the total carbon [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01717" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. These molecules largely contribute to plant fitness by interacting with the environment, as well as playing a range of roles in signaling and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses [
