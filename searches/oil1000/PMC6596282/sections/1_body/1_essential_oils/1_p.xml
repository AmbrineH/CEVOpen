<p class="p">Essential oils extracted from plants contain compounds produced during plant secondary metabolism. They constitute one of the most important groups of raw materials for the food, hygiene, and cleaning products and pharmaceutical industries, perfumery, and others. They are complex mixtures of low molecular weight substances (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hussain et al., 2008</xref>). Several studies demonstrate that certain EOs, used as anesthetics and/or sedatives, reduced plasma cortisol levels and attenuated stress response (

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Souza et al., 2017b</xref>). Moreover, some EOs when added to therapeutic baths (concentrations lower than those that induce sedation) are able to prevent oxidative stress. The EO of

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), thus demonstrating the possibility to be used as a stress-reducing agent in aquaculture practices. For example, anesthesia with the EO of

 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Souza et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to note that EOs have lipophilic properties and liposolubility, contributing to rapid dispersion through biological membranes, including the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system (CNS), modulating brain function (

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Manayi et al., 2016</xref>). It is known that several EOs exert their anesthetic effects by regulating the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS (
