<p class="p">The EO extraction methods are among the aspects that most affect the chemical characteristics. The main methods of EO extraction are steam distillation and its variants, cold pressing, supercritical fluid extraction, and solvent extraction (

Consideration should also be given to the relative low stability of EOs, which may undergo chemical changes mainly due to loss of volatile compounds, oxidation reactions and/or polymerization. However, various strategies can be observed to prevent their deterioration, including storage in small volume glass containers, maintaining them under low temperatures and protected from light. Further information on the stability of EOs can be obtained in
