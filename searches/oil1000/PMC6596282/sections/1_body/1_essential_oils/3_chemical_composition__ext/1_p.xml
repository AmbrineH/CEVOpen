<p class="p">The genetic characteristics of the producing plant are the most important factors determining the chemical composition of an EO and, consequently, interfere with their biological/pharmacological activities. In addition, the chemical composition is generally specific for a given organ and characteristic of its stage of development, but edaphic and environmental conditions, as well as the extraction method used may cause significant variations (

 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reyes-Jurado et al., 2015</xref>). Since chemical variability is often high among plants from their natural habitat, whenever possible, EOs should be obtained from cultivated plants that have genetic homogeneity, to ensure the consistency of the composition. However, it is also necessary to observe other aspects that influence the composition of an oil (
