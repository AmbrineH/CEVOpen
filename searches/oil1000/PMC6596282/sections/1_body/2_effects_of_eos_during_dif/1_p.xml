<p class="p">The interpretation of the general effects of EOs is somewhat complicated because only a few were tested in more than one fish species during different stress events. Furthermore, type and characteristics of stressors used may differ complicating the comparison between EOs. In addition, most studies were performed in freshwater species but not in marine species. Finally, other factors that hinder the comparisons are the existence of different chemotypes for the same plant and the variability of the composition of EOs even from the same chemotype.</p>
