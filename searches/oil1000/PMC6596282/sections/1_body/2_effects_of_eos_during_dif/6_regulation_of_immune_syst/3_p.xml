<p class="p">The EOs may also have an immunostimulatory effect when added to the diet. For example, diet supplemented with the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Zataria multiflora</italic> enhanced common carp immunity to some extent even though fish could not express their potential immunity during stress caused by low temperature (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soltani et al., 2010</xref>). After 35 days of supplementation with EO 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> (0.5%), the Nile tilapia presented the lowest value of hematocrit and the highest numbers of neutrophils at 35 days. It can be inferred that this reduction is due to an energy offset for production of defense cells â€“ in this case, neutrophils (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Adel et al. (2015)</xref> also observed a significant increase in neutrophils in the cyprinid kutum (
 <italic class="italic">Rutilus frisii</italic>) after dietary supplementation with the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>, asserting that there was stimulation of the innate immune response. However in spite of improving survival of silver catfish after 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> infection, the addition of 2.0 mL per kg diet of EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> showed an immunosuppressive activity because the total count of leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils decreased (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santos et al., 2017b</xref>). In addition, supplementing the diet with EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic> peels (0.5, 0.75, and 1%) improve non-specific immune parameters and decreased mortality rates in the Mozambique tilapia 
 <italic class="italic">Oreochromis mossambicus</italic> challenged with 
 <italic class="italic">Edwardsiella tarda</italic> (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baba et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). These results indicate that diets enriched with EOs often present promising results for fish, and some EOs may even aid in improving the immune system as well as helping to prevent disease outbreaks in aquaculture systems.
