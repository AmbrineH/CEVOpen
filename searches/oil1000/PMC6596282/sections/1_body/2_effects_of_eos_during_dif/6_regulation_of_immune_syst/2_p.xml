<p class="p">Some EOs used as anesthetics were also related as good immunostimulants for fish (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Anesthesia of gilthead seabream with 44.5 mg⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> clove oil did not change serum lysozyme activity, respiratory burst, and pinocytosis activity of head kidney (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bressler and Ron, 2004</xref>), but a concentration of 55 mg⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> increased serum leucocyte peroxidase activity and decreased hemolytic complement activity, which led to the conclusion that this EO did not change immune response in this species (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bahi et al., 2018</xref>). However, rainbow trout anesthetized with 25 mg⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> clove oil enhanced lysozyme and bactericidal activity, as well as protease, esterase, and alkaline phosphatase activities in the skin mucus, indicating potentiated skin mucosal immunity (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soltanian et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, preventive baths with the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">H. ringens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. americanum</italic> (20 mg⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) for 5 days increased survival in silver catfish infected with 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sutili et al., 2015</xref>). Some EOs can have antimicrobial effects and, at the same time, act as immunostimulants. This is supported by the effects of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, which showed an antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic>, increased the non-specific immune system and prevented oxidative damage in silver catfish in fish exposed to 50 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> for 7 days prior to infection (
