<p class="p">Despite the purpose of using an anesthetic being to mitigate stress, a common observation is that the substance itself may pose as a stressor, thus activating the stress response mechanism (

In this sense, an increasing attention has been focused on the use of plant extracts in fish anesthesia due to a wide range of beneficial health benefits, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, stress-relieving and immune-promoting effects (
