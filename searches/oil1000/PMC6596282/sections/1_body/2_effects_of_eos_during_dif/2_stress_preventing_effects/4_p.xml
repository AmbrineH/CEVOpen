<p class="p">The effect of the EOs may also change according to the species and the type of application. For example, Nile tilapia anesthetized with 300 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> and then exposed to air for 1 min decreased plasma cortisol levels respect to control fish (handled as the anesthetized fish) (

 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> and submitted to the same procedure did not change plasma cortisol values compared to control fish (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gressler et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, silver catfish fed diet supplemented with 2.0 mL per kg of this EO for 21 days and handled for blood collection presented lower plasma cortisol and lactate levels, but not glucose, than fish that received control feed and were submitted to the same procedure (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, the same dietary dose of this EO did not change whole body cortisol content in zebrafish handled for biometry (
