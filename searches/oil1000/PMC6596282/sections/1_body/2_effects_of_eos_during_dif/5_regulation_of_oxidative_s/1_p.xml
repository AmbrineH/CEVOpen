To maintain homeostasis, fish eliminate ROS to counteract oxidative stress and prevent or repair oxidative damage by antioxidant defense system, which includes antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and also some non-enzymatic antioxidants such as non-protein thiol (NPSH) (

In this sense, the presence of ROS in the cells triggers biochemical reactions that will culminate in decreased cellular function due to oxidative damage caused in proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, which can lead to apoptosis and accumulation of oxidized molecular aggregates. Normally, an oxidative stress frame is triggered due to an imbalance between the oxidant and the antioxidant production, detected by low concentrations of antioxidant enzymes and higher prooxidant levels, culminating with a lower immune system response (
