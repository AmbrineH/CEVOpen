<p class="p">We highlight the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> because it presents different responses to oxidative stress, which varies according to its concentration, chemotype, and fish species. For example, the addition of this EO (10–20 μ⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, linalool chemotype) during transport suppressed oxidative stress in silver catfish (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Azambuja et al., 2011</xref>). However, this EO (linalool chemotype) at higher concentrations (30–40 μ⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) induced physiological and oxidative stress in silver catfish and gilthead sea bream (

 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Toni et al., 2015</xref>). On the one hand, silver catfish anesthetized with the chemotypes linalool and citral did not increase renal and hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive species levels after anesthesia, avoiding lipid damage. On the other hand, fish anesthetized with the citral chemotype showed higher protein carbonylation levels, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase activities as well as non-protein thiol group values in both tissues compared to controls. Therefore, the EO of both chemotypes present antioxidant capacity, but anesthesia with higher concentrations of the linalool chemotype does not cause damage to lipids or proteins, being more effective in anesthetizing silver catfish (
