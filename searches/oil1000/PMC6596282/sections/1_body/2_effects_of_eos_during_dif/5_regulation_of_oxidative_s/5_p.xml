<p class="p">In addition, the use of EOs in water during transport is also useful in order to activate the antioxidant defense system. Silver catfish transported with the EOs of

 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> for 3 min) and transported for 6 h (with 30 or 40 μL⋅L

This study also revealed that hepatic TBARS, protein oxidation levels, and the lipid peroxidation/catalase+glutathione peroxidase ratio were significantly higher in fish transported with both concentrations of this EO, indicating the existence of oxidative stress at hepatic level.
