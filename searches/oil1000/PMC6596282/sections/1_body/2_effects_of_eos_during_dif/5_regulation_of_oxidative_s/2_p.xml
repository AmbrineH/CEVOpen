<p class="p">Several EOs, when used as anesthetics or sedative for manipulation and/or transport, exhibit antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This antioxidant activity is also observed when the EOs are used at concentrations lower than those that induce sedation and as dietary supplements (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Thus, the antioxidant effects of several EOs are not only due to the possibility of lower ROS production when fish are sedated or anesthetized.
