<p class="p">Live transportation of larvae, juvenile or broodstock is one of the major causes of stress in fish due to the capture, packing, high loading density, changes in water quality, the transport itself, unloading, and the final storage (

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sampaio and Freire, 2016</xref>). In all transport systems, including simple closed systems, such as sealed plastic bags partly filled with water and oxygen, homeostasis of the transported fish is mainly challenged by the build-up of ammonia (NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) from respiration (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Becker et al., 2016</xref>). These events cause changes in pH (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Golombieski et al., 2003</xref>), which may alter fish metabolism and induce activation of the stress system. So, transportation can lead to a number of physiological responses such as catecholamines and corticosteroids release as well as blood glucose levels enhancement (
