<p class="p">The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> has also been tested for transport procedures in freshwater and marine species. The use of this EO (40 and 50 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) during a 6 h transport reduced net ion loss (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parodi et al., 2014</xref>), ammonia excretion and plasma cortisol levels in silver catfish compared to control fish submitted to the same procedure (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zeppenfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Plasma cortisol enhancement in fat snook due to transport was reduced by adding 20 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> of this EO to the water (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parodi et al., 2016</xref>), whereas 30 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> decreased ventilatory rate, ion loss and plasma glucose levels, with no effects preventing cortisol increase in Nile tilapia (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>), both compared to their respective control fish subjected to the same procedure. In addition, this EO (25 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) also decreased ventilatory rate of pacamã, 
 <italic class="italic">Lophiosilurus alexandri</italic>, as well as ammonia excretion during 4 h transport (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Becker et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), also reducing the swimming activity of black piranha at concentration of 10 μL⋅L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Almeida et al., 2018</xref>) both compared to their respective control fish subjected to the same procedure. Overall, this EO seems to be effective in reducing stress of transport in fish, irrespective of whether they are fresh- or seawater-adapted.
