<p class="p">Most studies show that EO also have promising potential for maintaining and promoting health, as well as preventing and potentially treating some diseases, ameliorating growth and antioxidant status. However, besides the high volatility, EOs can easily decompose, owing to direct exposure to heat, humidity, light, or oxygen, which would imply the loss of their effectiveness (

Studies regarding the use of diets supplemented with several EOs to minimize the stress caused by handling or air exposure remain scarce. In addition, due to the species-specific effects of EOs, it would be interesting to check the efficacy of these EOs on more fresh- and seawater species.
