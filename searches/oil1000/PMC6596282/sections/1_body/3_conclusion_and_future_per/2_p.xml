<p class="p">the EOs to obtain more refined products that combine their beneficial effects with a better control of composition and maybe avoid undesired effects of uncontrolled compounds. Some isolated compounds, as linalool, have proportional anesthetic effect to the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> chemotype linalool in silver catfish, but eugenol, which is the main compound of 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>, presents a narrower safety range that this EO. Additional studies comparing the effects and side effects of EOs and their isolated compounds are necessary to evaluate the advantages of using a given EO or its main compound(s). In addition, it is important to emphasize that the use of different concentrations of the EOs and the different fish species used can alter behavioral and physiological responses, as observed in synthetic anesthetics. As explained in a previous section, the stress-reducing effect of eugenol is better the faster the anesthesia induction. Is this relationship concentration/time to induce anesthesia/stress-reducing effect similar for EOs and their isolated compounds? Could this possible relationship explain, at least partially, the species-specific effects of the EOs studied so far?
