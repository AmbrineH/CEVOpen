<p class="p">Some EOs demonstrated advantages when used as sedatives/anesthetics compared to synthetic compounds because they are not aversive to fish, and reduce the stress responses related to handling and transport. On the other hand, their effects may vary according to plant variables such as chemotype, place of collection, climate, anatomical part from which the EO was extracted, altering significantly their composition and consequently their effects. Consequently, EOs should be obtained from cultivated plants that have genetic homogeneity, to ensure the consistency of their composition. Another perspective to be followed by future studies and by the pharmaceutical industry would be isolating/purifying the active compounds present in</p>
