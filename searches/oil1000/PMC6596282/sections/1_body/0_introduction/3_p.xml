<p class="p">In addition, essential oils (EOs) derived from plants have been used in aquaculture studies because of their diverse properties that can improve health, growth and welfare of animals (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoseini et al. (2018)</xref> focused on stress-reducing effects, but only related to anesthetic effects of the EOs, while the other two reviews did not deal with this subject. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to discuss the possible mechanisms by which the different ways of applying EOs (waterborne and dietary exposure) may minimize stress responses induced by aquaculture procedures, as well as a future perspective of their use.
