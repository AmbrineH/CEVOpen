<p class="p">Stress response is usually triggered by a wide range of physiological mechanisms in order to compensate the imbalances produced by the stressor and recover the homeostatic status of fish. The stress response is initiated and controlled by two hormonal systems, which lead to the production of catecholamines (such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, and their precursor dopamine) by the hypothalamus-sympathetic-chromaffin (HSC) axis, and corticosteroids (mainly cortisol) by the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis (

Long-term consequences of repeated or prolonged stressful exposures are maladaptive by negatively affecting other necessary life functions, such as growth, development, disease resistance, behavior or reproduction and may even culminate in fish death (
