<p class="p">A 12 week, randomized, double-blinded study on healthy female volunteers with sensitive skin reported a positive improvement in skin properties with the ingestion of flaxseed oil. A significant decrease was noted in skin sensitivity, transepidermal water loss, skin roughness and scaling, with an increase in skin hydration and smoothness [

Compared to a younger population, older individuals have higher concentrations of proinflammatory oxylipins including 5-HETE, 9,10,13-TriHOME and 9,12-13-TriHOME, which could explain higher levels of inflammation in this older demographic [
