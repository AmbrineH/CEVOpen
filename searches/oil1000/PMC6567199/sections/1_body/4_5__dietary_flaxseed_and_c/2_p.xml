<p class="p">Flaxseed lignans are nonsteroidal phytoestrogens that have a chemical structure that resembles mammalian estrogens, and hence produce estrogen-like effects in mammals. Flax lignans are metabolized by intestinal bacteria to become bioavailable in the plasma [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Lignans derived from food occur mainly as glucosides and undergo deglycosylation by β-glucosidases from gut microbiota before their intestinal absorption. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is hydrolyzed in this way to release secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Deglycosylation of SECO is followed by demethylation by microbiota to produce dihydroxyenterodiol, which further results in the formation of enterodiol through dehydroxylation. Finally, dehydrogenation of enterodiol produces enterolactone. Enterodiol and enterolactone are absorbed from the large intestine, and ultimately appear as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in body fluid and are excreted in urine [

 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. A pharmacokinetic study in humans demonstrated the appearance of enterolignans in the plasma 8–10 h after ingestion of SDG, with the mean maximum plasma concentrations of enterodiol and enterolactone attaining ~14.8 h and ~19.7 h, respectively, after consumption [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The mean elimination half-life reported for enterodiol is ~4.4 h, and enterolactone is ~12.6 h [

Epidemiological studies in postmenopausal breast cancer patients have reported an association of higher blood concentrations of enterolactone with a reduced risk of breast cancer, decreased mortality rate and better survival. Clinical evidence also supports the protective effect of enterolactone in cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, gut and lung [
