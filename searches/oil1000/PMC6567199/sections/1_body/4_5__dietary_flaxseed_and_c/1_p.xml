<p class="p">Flaxseed is already used extensively in animal studies to treat a variety of cancers [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Perhaps the most studied cancer with respect to the impact of dietary flaxseed is breast cancer. In both experimental animal studies [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] and in human trials [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], dietary flaxseed has significant protective effects against breast cancer. A systematic review of 10 human trials led to the conclusion that flaxseed reduced tumour growth in women with breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. They also found evidence in support of flax-associated protection against primary breast cancer as well as a reduced risk of mortality in women living with breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Beneficial effects were observed with 25 g doses of milled flaxseed [
