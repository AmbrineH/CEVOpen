<p class="p">Another potentially toxic compound is linatine (antipyridoxin factor), which has been identified as a vitamin B6 antagonist in chicks [

 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Other compounds such as phytic acid and trypsin inhibitor have also been suggested to induce negative effects on the nutritional status after flaxseed ingestion. However, once again, no studies have reported any alterations in zinc status due to phytic acid, or any difference in trypsin inhibitor activity in flaxseed compared with canola or soybean seeds [

 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. In conclusion, it is important to recognize that no definitive scientific data have been produced to support the concept of toxicity from dietary flaxseed because of any of these compounds.
