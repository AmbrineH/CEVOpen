<p class="p">Although no toxicity has ever been reported in clinical studies with dietary supplementation of flaxseed, some compounds within flaxseed such as cyanogenic glycosides and linatine have been identified as potential toxic compounds. Cyanogenic glycosides such as linamarin, linustatin, neolinustatin, lotaustralin and amygdalin are nitrogenous secondary plant metabolites [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. These compounds are not exclusively found in flaxseed, but are also present in other food items including apples, spinach and cassavas [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. The glycoside is converted by intestinal β-glycosidase to cyanohydrin, which then decomposes to hydrogen cyanide [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. In flaxseed, this process is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes: linustatinase and linamarase β-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Hydrogen cyanide could cause acute cyanide poisoning, which may place the respiratory and nervous system at risk [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, no increase in plasma cyanide levels above baseline have been observed with the consumption of 15–100 g of flaxseed [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. The linustatin and neolinustatin found in flaxseed are thought to be the lowest cyanide producers compared to other cyanogenic glycosides. This is because flaxseed glycosides have a gentiobiose moiety that needs to be hydrolyzed to glucose. The cyanohydrin formed by metabolism is highly stable [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], which, therefore, resists any spontaneous decomposition to hydrogen cyanide. Theoretically, 1–2 tablespoons of flaxseed will produce approximately 5–10 mg of hydrogen cyanide after ingestion. This is highly unlikely to cause toxicity for three reasons: a) 50–60 mg dose of cyanide is required to cause acute toxicity; b) the human body can routinely detoxify up to 100 mg/day of cyanide [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] and c) cooking destroys cyanide (cyanide is heat labile [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]). Human studies with 50 g/day flaxseed did not increase urinary thiocyanate levels [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Based on these data, humans would need to consume the unrealistic amount of 1 kg of flaxseed daily for cyanide toxicity to ever manifest itself.
