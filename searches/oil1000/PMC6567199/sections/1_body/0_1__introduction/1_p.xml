<p class="p">Dietary flaxseed has an impressive and growing research literature supporting its use in a variety of health conditions. Whereas in the late 20th century, little was known of the health-related benefits of flaxseed as well as how to consume flaxseed to achieve any health benefits, today is an entirely different time. Research information on the effects of dietary flaxseed has increased dramatically. We now know what diseases flaxseed can treat or prevent, the health impacts dietary flaxseed can provide, the bioactives within flaxseed that provide these health-related effects in many cases and the forms of flaxseed that are required to provide these bioactives to the body. Data on the impact of dietary flaxseed on disease have been translated, albeit in limited amounts, from animal research studies to human trials. Many of these trials have been conducted with the highest standards of control available in order to provide solid, reliable information on its value to the general public and, more specifically, to those in a disease compromised condition. These data have sparked the food processing industry to create a greater variety of foods that contain flaxseed, giving the public an increased opportunity to incorporate flaxseed into their everyday diet. With this growing availability of flaxseed in the marketplace and the increasing awareness of the public to its impact on human health when supplemented into the diet on a daily basis, it would be expected that flaxseed will also grow in the coming years in economic importance to the farmer, the food processer and the retailer in the marketplace [
