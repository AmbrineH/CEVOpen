<p class="p">Supplementation of the diet with milled flaxseed has many healthy benefits to the body. Although cardiovascular disease and canceer are probably the best researched areas that have shown convincing evidence of a beneficial action for dietary flaxseed, other areas like gastro-intestinal health and diabetes have also been receptive to the beneficial effects of dietary flaxseed. Other areas in human health require further research to make definitive conclusions but the preliminary data is encouraging. With little or no evidence of toxicity for dietary supplementation with flaxseed, there appears to be a clear argument to support its inclusion in the daily diet and little reason to oppose it.</p>
