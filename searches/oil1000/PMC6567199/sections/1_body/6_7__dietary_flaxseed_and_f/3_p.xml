<p class="p">Postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of osteoporosis. In a short 6 weeks study by Arjmandi et al [
 <xref rid="B68-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], a slightly lower bone resorption marker (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) was observed in postmenopausal women receiving flaxseed. However, no influence was reported when using anabolic bone agents. Conversely, most studies have shown no effect of flaxseed consumption on bone mineral density, bone mineral content or bone turnover in postmenopausal women [
 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In an animal model, flaxseed supplementation resulted in an additional benefit when combined with estrogen therapy. Flax oil rich in ALA showed a positive effect on bone health, particularly in pathological conditions such as obesity and kidney disease. ALA may be more responsible for this improvement in osteoporotic bone conditions than the estrogenic lignan content of flaxseed [
