<p class="p">Caution has been advised for flaxseed consumption during pregnancy and lactation. SDG and flaxseed oil given to pregnant rats have shown opposite effects on total fat mass of the body. SDG administration resulted in higher fat mass, whereas flaxseed oil lowered fat mass. Furthermore, flax oil also reduced serum and milk triglyceride and cholesterol levels in female rats during lactation [

With such changes in maternal and offspring biochemical parameters, it may be prudent to exercise caution when using flaxseed or its components in pregnancy. However, as no other studies have reported similar changes, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in pregnant subjects are warranted to provide any conclusive evidence.
