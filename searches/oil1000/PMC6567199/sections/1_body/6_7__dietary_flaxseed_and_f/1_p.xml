<p class="p">Dietary flaxseed may also exhibit a protective effect against menopausal symptoms [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Several studies have examined the effects of flaxseed or its bioactive ingredients on the quality of life and the frequency and severity of hot flashes in post-menopausal women. The estrogenic action of certain metabolites of flaxseed suggested a potentially positive effect on these post-menopausal symptoms. In a study of 140 postmenopausal women, menopausal symptoms decreased and the quality of life increased in women who ingested a flaxseed supplemented diet [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. A particularly large trial (199 women) of an unusually long duration (1 year) on a high dose of flaxseed (40 g per day) reported a significant decrease in menopausal symptoms, but this effect did not differ from the control group that ingested a wheat germ placebo [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Another study reported similar inconclusive evidence of a positive effect of flaxseed on menopausal symptoms with up to 90 g of flaxseed per day [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Further randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of clinical trials found no significant effect of flaxseed on quality of life or hot flashes during menopause [

 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. It is concluded that randomized, placebo-controlled trials are necessary to determine conclusive effects on menopausal symptoms. When carefully controlled trials are carried out in this manner, it would appear that flaxseed does not induce a significant effect on quality of life or the incidence and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women.
