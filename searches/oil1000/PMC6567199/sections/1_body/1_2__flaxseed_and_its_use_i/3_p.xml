The addition of flavouring to the baked good also makes it possible to disguise any less than optimal flavour profile induced by the bitterness of flaxseed or any minor rancidity. Flavourings like banana and nuts, banana chocolate chip, cinnamon apple raisin, cinnamon raisin, cinnamon spice, gingerbread raisin, cappuccino chocolate chip, sunflower sesame and cranberry orange have been used in research studies [

In a study of the daily preferences of the ingestion of food products containing 30 g of milled flaxseed over one year, bagels were consumed &gt; muffins &gt; snack bars &gt; sprinkles &gt; tea biscuits &gt; pasta &gt; sundried tomato buns [
