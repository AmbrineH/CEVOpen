<p class="p">Recently, a concern was raised about the presence of components in flaxseed that may have undesirable effects that could affect the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of essential nutrients [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. These include the presence of protease inhibitors, phytic acids, linatine and cyanogenic glycosides in flaxseed. However, there are no deleterious effects reported of these components in human studies. The concentrations of these components delivered through dietary flaxseed may be below that needed to induce any biological actions. Nevertheless, it is prudent to take into account the raised concern. Plant bio-breeding and/or food processing methods may be considered to reduce the levels of these components in flaxseed.
