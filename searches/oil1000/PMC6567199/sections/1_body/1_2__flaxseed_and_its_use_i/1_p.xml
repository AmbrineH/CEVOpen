<p class="p">The main bioactive compounds in flaxseed include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), lignans and fiber. Four common forms of flaxseed available for human consumption include whole flaxseed, ground flaxseed, flaxseed oil and partially defatted flaxseed meal [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. A new form available in the marketplace is flax “milk” (Pizzey Ingredients Inc, Manitoba, Canada). An alternative to “milks” like almond milk, flax milk is finely milled flaxseed mixed with filtered water and other minor compounds. Flax milk is high in ALA and is an excellent alternative to dairy milk, as it has no cholesterol or lactose. It is suitable for people allergic to soy, nuts and gluten, and it contains more health benefits than almond milk.
