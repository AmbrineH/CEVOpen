<p class="p">Each of these different food matrices can influence the stability of the flaxseed. Processing of the seed, storage temperature and duration as well as the form of flaxseed (milled flaxseed versus whole seed versus flax oil) will also influence the stability of the product. Milling, grinding or crushing flaxseed will destroy the hard protective seed coat on flaxseed, exposing the ALA and SDG to oxidation [
