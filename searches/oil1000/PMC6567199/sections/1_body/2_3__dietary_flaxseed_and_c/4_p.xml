<p class="p">In humans exhibiting symptoms of cardiovascular disease, dietary flaxseed has displayed powerfully protective effects. The most impressive involves the decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Both brachial and central blood pressures were significantly reduced by dietary flaxseed in this trial [

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized FlaxPAD Trial [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], PAD patients fed 30 g of milled flaxseed every day for 6 months exhibited significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01171-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, not all patients responded to the flaxseed diet with decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP). In the placebo group, fifteen subjects showed a decrease in SBP over the 6 months, whereas twenty-one exhibited an increase in SBP. In the flax-fed group, twenty-seven subjects exhibited a decrease in SBP over the 6 months and twelve had an increase in SBP over this time. The SBP in two subjects was unchanged over this time period. The average drop in the flax group was substantial (10 mm Hg) and statistically significant. This hypotensive effect was shown as early as 1 month after commencing the flaxseed in the diet and was maintained for up to one year [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The decrease was sufficient to predict a 50% decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarctions and strokes [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This action was shown to be associated with a significant change in lipid metabolism such that the generation of oxylipins with less vasodilatory and more pro-inflammatory action was blocked [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This action was suggested to be due to the ALA content of the flaxseed [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Alternatively, in animal studies, flaxseed protein hydrolysates and flax oil decreased blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat in acute or chronic conditions, respectively [

 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. As well, a flaxseed lignan concentrate reduced blood pressure in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA-salt) induced renal hypertensive rats [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and in the high fat, high sugar-fed rat [
