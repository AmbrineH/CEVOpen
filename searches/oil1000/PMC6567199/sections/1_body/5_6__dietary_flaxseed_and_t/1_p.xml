<p class="p">The critical role that omega-3 fatty acids obtained from marine sources play in brain development is well known [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This work has focused in the past primarily on the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Whereas research has established an essential role for DHA in pre- and post-natal brain development [
