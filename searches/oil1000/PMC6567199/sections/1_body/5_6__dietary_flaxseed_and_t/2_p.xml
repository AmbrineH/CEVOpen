<p class="p">These data suggest that another omega-3 fatty acid, ALA, which is enriched in flaxseed, may have similar functional significance for the brain. When mothers of rats were fed flaxseed during pregnancy, the brains of newborn pups were heavier and contained significantly greater amounts of both ALA and DHA [
