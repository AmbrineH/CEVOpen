<p class="p">Dietary flaxseed may also improve aspects of brain function during conditions of neural disease. Maternal intake of flaxseed prevented depressive symptoms in offspring and demonstrated neuroprotection during experimental neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy by lessening brain mass loss together with improvements in motor hyperactivity and spatial memory [
