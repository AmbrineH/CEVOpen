<p class="p">The influence of the microbiome on human and animal health is receiving increasing attention from the research community [
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. However, our understanding of the impact of dietary flaxseed on the gut microbiome in either healthy or diseased populations is limited. It was known that the lignans that are unusually high in content within flaxseed need to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria in order to gain access to the systemic circulation in humans. The production of enterolignans like enterodiol and enterolactone from SDG is best generated from milled flaxseed and defatted flaxseed meal, in comparison to a variety of other foods that contain SDG [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This intestinal metabolism is accomplished via the biotransformative action of specific intestinal bacteria [

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> were important for the digestion of whole flaxseed in order to increase enterodiol bioaccessibility [
