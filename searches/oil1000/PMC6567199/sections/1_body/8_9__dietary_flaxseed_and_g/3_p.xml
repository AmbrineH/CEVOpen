 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Daily intake of flaxseed mucilage resulted in changes in the abundance of 33 different metagenomics species in the gut microbiota, including eight different species of

 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-01171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], who found that flaxseed did not significantly change the fecal microbiome nor the abundance of the dominant bacterial species present. Others have also challenged the efficacy of dietary flaxseed to alter the appearance of disease based upon a change in the gut microbiome. For example, a 5% flaxseed supplemented diet had no protective effect against the development of intestinal tumours [

Caution in the use of flaxseed in the diet has also been introduced by the results of Maatanen and co-workers, who showed that whereas a reduced fat diet could protect against colitis, the high levels of PUFAs provided by flaxseed supplementation to the diet diminished these beneficial effects [
