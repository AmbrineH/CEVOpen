 <p> Individual values of systolic blood pressure at baseline or after 6 months of dietary supplementation with a placebo ( A) or 30 g of milled flaxseed per day ( B). Baseline systolic blood pressures in the placebo group were 143.5 ± 2.88 at baseline and 144.8 ± 3.33 after 6 months ( n = 36). Baseline systolic blood pressures in the flax group were 146.6 ± 3.37 at baseline and 136.5 ± 3.53 after 6 months ( n = 41). Results are obtained from Rodriguez-Leyva et al, 2013 [ 5]. </p>
