 <p> Slab views of the substrate binding pockets for HaFatA (a,c,e) and HaFatB (b,d,f). The residues involved in the substrate interaction described by Feng et al. (2017) are shown in green, those involved in catalysis are in red and those involved in the positively charged surface patches surrounding the opening of the pocket are in blue. </p>
