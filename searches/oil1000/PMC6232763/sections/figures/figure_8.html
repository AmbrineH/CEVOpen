 <p> Representative confocal laser scanning microscopy images images of Cherry-tagged HaFatB-Cherry or HaFatBΔ Cherry expressed transiently (via biolistic bombardment) in BY-2 tobacco cells. Images in column (A) show FatB-Cherry row (1) and FatBΔ-Cherry row (2), while those in column (B) represent fluorescent Alexa 488 dye-conjugated to Anti-N-acetyl glutamate kinase (Anti NAGK). The corresponding merged images of all the cells are shown in column (C). The amino acid alignment of sequences corresponding to HaFatB and the mutant HaFatBΔ, highlighting the hydrophobic region removed in black. This hydrophobic region was localized using different bioinformatics programs and it was removed by PCR splicing using the sequence of HaFatB. The first 50 amino acids correspond to the signal peptide: I, Inside amino acid; M, transmembrane helix amino acid; O, outside amino acid. </p>
