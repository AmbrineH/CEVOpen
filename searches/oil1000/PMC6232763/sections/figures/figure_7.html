 <p> Representative confocal laser scanning microscopy images of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HaFatA or HaFatB expressed transiently (via biolistic bombardment) in BY-2 tobacco cells. Images in column (A) show FatA-GFP row (1) and FatB-GFP row (2), while those in column (B) represent the fluorescent rhodamine Red dye-conjugated to Anti-N-acetyl glutamate kinase (Anti NAGK). Corresponding merged images of all the cells are shown in column (C). </p>
