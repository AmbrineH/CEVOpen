   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> SDSâ€“PAGE protein gel stained with Coomassie blue of: the molecular weight markers (line M), total plastid protein (lane 1), soluble subcellular fraction (lane 2), and membrane fraction (lane 3).

   <italic class="italic">At</italic>FatB antibodies showed that 
   <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB was in the total and membrane fractions. Results from biochemical assays to determinate the purity of the soluble and membrane fractions. LACS (long chain acyl-coA synthetase, membrane fraction control) in the total, soluble and membrane fractions of plastids was assayed to determine the purity of the soluble fraction. Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP, soluble fraction control) in the total, soluble and membrane fraction of plastids was assessed to determine the purity of the membrane fraction. Data corresponded to the average of three determinations from different biological replicates plus minus SD.
