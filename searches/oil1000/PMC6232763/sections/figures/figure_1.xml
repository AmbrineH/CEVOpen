  <p class="p">Sunflower acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) thioesterases expression levels and oil composition. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Relative mRNA expression (RT-QPCR) of 
   <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
   <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB in sunflower seeds at different developmental stages and in vegetative tissues. The bars corresponded to the SD calculated using the Livak method from three biological and two analytical replicates. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Fatty acid composition (mol %) and oil deposition (expressed as mg of fatty acid per g FW) during seed development. DAF, Days after flowering; C16, saturates of 16 carbons (palmitic acid content); C18, saturates of 18 carbons and more (the sum of stearic, arachidic, and behenic acids); and C18u, unsaturated of 18 carbons (the sum of oleic and linoleic acids). Dashed line corresponds to the Boltzmann fit of oil content experimental data from 20 seeds per DAF. Standard deviations for fatty acid composition, being smaller than 3% than the average value, are not shown for figure clarity
