 <p> Detail of the catalytic domain in the modeled HaFatA enzyme. Catalytic amino acids are shown in red and amino acids conforming the hydrophobic pocket in green. The amino acids that altered activity when they were substituted by tryptophan (W) were labeled in blue ( Moreno-PÃ©rez et al., 2014). When there was a coincidence between the residues modified by mutagenesis and those described by Feng et al. (2017) they are indicated with an asterisk. </p>
