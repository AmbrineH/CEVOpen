 <p> Comparison between the deduced amino acid sequences ( HaFatA, HaFatB, and Umbelullaria californica UcFatB) and predicted secondary structures ssHaFatA and ssHaFatB. Asterisks designate identical residues, a colon indicates conservative changes and a dot the weakly conserved changes between the sequences. Structural elements: H, α-helix; S, β-sheet. Residues involved in the substrate binding pocket and catalysis ( Feng et al., 2017) are highlighted in black and gray, respectively. Positively charged surface patches ( Serrano-Vega et al., 2005; Jing et al., 2018), and the N- and C-terminal domains are boxed in blue and black, respectively. </p>
