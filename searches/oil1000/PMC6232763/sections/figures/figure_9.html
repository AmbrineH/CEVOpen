 <p> Representative confocal laser scanning microscopy images of GFP-tagged HaFatA or HaFatB expressed transiently (via biolistic bombardment) in BY-2 tobacco cells. Images in column (A) show FatA-GFP row (1) and FatB-GFP row (2), while those in column (B) represent the expression of sub-cellular marker proteins co-expressed in the same cells, specifically the inner chloroplast envelope protein Tic40-RFP. Corresponding merged images of all the cells are shown in column (C). </p>
