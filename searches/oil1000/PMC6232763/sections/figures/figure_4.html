 <p> Proposed structural models for sunflower acyl-ACP thioesterase homodimers, HaFatA (a,c) and HaFatB (b,d), modeled from UcFatB (5X04.A) ( Feng et al., 2017). Ribbon diagrams (a,b), residues in the substrate binding pocket are green and those involved in catalysis are in red. In c,d, the molecular surfaces show the electrostatic potential according to Coulombâ€™s laws with positive charged patches surrounding the substrate binding pocket. Circled areas in a,b correspond to highly no conserved structural motifs between both proteins. </p>
