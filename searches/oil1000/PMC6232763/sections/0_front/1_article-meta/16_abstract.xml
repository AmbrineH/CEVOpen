 <p class="p">Sunflower seeds (
  <italic class="italic">Helianthus annuus</italic> L.) accumulate large quantities of triacylglycerols (TAG) between 12 and 28 days after flowering (DAF). This is the period of maximal acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) thioesterase activity 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, the enzymes that terminate the process of 
  <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the acyl-ACPs synthesized by fatty acid synthase. Fatty acid thioesterases can be classified into two families with distinct substrate specificities, namely FatA and FatB. Here, some new aspects of these enzymes have been studied, assessing how both enzymes contribute to the acyl composition of sunflower oil, not least through the changes in their expression during the process of seed filling. Moreover, the binding pockets of these enzymes were modeled based on new data from plant thioesterases, revealing important differences in their volume and geometry. Finally, the subcellular location of the two enzymes was evaluated and while both possess an N-terminal plastid transit peptide, only in FatB contains a hydrophobic sequence that could potentially serve as a transmembrane domain. Indeed, using 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> imaging and organelle fractionation, 
  <italic class="italic">H. annuus</italic> thioesterases, 
  <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
  <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB, appear to be differentially localized in the plastid stroma and membrane envelope, respectively. The divergent roles fulfilled by 
  <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
  <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB in oil biosynthesis are discussed in the light of our data.
