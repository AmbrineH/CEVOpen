Biolistic bombarded BY-2 cells were incubated for 6 h to allow the expression and sorting of the gene products introduced, and to ensure that any potential negative effects due to protein over-expression were diminished. Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.01% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Kyowa Chemical Products, Osaka, Japan) and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v: Sigma-Aldrich). When necessary, the fixed and permeabilized cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy, first incubating the BY-2 cells with a rabbit anti-
