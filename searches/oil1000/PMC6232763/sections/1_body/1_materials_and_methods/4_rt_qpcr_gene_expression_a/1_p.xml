<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted from different vegetative tissues and the developing seeds were extracted with the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) according to the supplier’s instructions. The corresponding cDNAs were synthesized using the Ready-To-Go T-Primed First Strand Kit (Amersham Bioscience, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). The cDNAs obtained were amplified by RT-QPCR using specific primer pairs (
