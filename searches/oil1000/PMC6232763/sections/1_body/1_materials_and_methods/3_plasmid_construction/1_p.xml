<p class="p">In this work, the previously cloned sunflower 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Serrano-Vega et al., 2005</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Serrano-Vega et al., 2003</xref>) sequences (GenBank Accessions AY078350 and AJ242915, respectively) were used to design the primers for cloning and RT-QPCR (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The open reading frames of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB were amplified (minus stop codons) using the NheFatA-F/NheFatA-R and NheFatB-F/NheFatB-R primer pairs, respectively (all primers were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany), introducing 
 <italic class="italic">Nhe</italic>I restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. In addition, the 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB gene without the hydrophobic, putative membrane association domain (
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatBΔ) was generated by PCR splicing (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heckman and Pease, 2007</xref>). The sequences before and after the hydrophobic sequence were amplified using the NheFatBΔ-F/NheFatBΔ-R and FatBΔ-F/NheFatB-R primers, respectively (stop codon removed). A mixture of both PCR products was used as template to amplify 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatBΔ with the primers for each end NheFatB-F/NheFatB-R (stop codon removed). The putative hydrophobic sequence was checked according to 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krogh et al. (2001)</xref>, and the resulting PCR products were cloned into pMBL-T (Genaxxon BioScience GmbH, Biberach, Germany) and sequenced (SECUGEN, Madrid, Spain). The plasmids were then digested with 
 <italic class="italic">Nhe</italic>I, and the 
 <italic class="italic">Nhe</italic>I DNA fragments were ligated into 
 <italic class="italic">Nhe</italic>I-digested pUC18/
 <italic class="italic">Nhe</italic>I mGFP and pRTL2/mCherry to generate 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA-GFP, 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB-GFP, 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB-Cherry and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatBΔ-Cherry.
