<p class="p">Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP) activity was assayed in the reverse direction. The reaction mixture contained 0.1 mM Fru-1,6-diphosphate, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NADP, 100 mM Hepes buffer pH 8.0, 9U phosphoglucose isomerase, 2U glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 1 mL. A suitable amount of enzyme solution was added to the mixture and incubated for 1â€“8 min as described above, then reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM orthophosphate and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored in continuous to measure activity.</p>
