<p class="p">Plastids were isolated from seeds harvested at 15–18 DAF according to the protocol of 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jain et al. (2008)</xref>, with minor modifications. Sunflower seeds (5–10 g) were kept on ice in a plastid isolation medium (PIM: 0.5 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES/NaOH [pH 7.4], 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) ethanediol, 5 mM DTT) and they were homogenized by chopping with a razor blade. The sample was filtered into a fresh tube on ice through one layer of miracloth (25 μm: Calbiochem, United States and Canada) and the filtrates were then centrifuged at 750 g for 5 min at 4°C, recovering the pellets in 2 mL of cold PIM. The material was layered onto 10 mL of 35% Percoll and 3% (w/v) PEG-4000 and centrifuged at 1000 ×

The upper band (1 cm from the surface) and the pellet that contained the plastids, were gently washed in 10 mL of PIM and centrifuged again at 750 g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was again recovered in 400 μL PIM. Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase activity was used as cytosolic marker (according to 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kang and Rawsthorne, 1996</xref>), and the plastids were then lysed by applying five freeze/thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and water at 50°C. We recovered 100 μL of the lysed plastid sample and isolated the stromal fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet containing the membrane fraction was resuspended in 300 μL of PIM and the protein concentration in these fractions was determined by the 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bradford (1976)</xref> method. Proteins from the stromal and membrane fractions (10 μg) were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and the 10% polyacrylamide gel was then stained with Coomassie™ Brilliant Blue G (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) or analyzed by Western blotting (Amersham, United States: see
