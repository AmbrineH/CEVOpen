<p class="p">The standard sunflower line RHA-274 was used as a control in this work, the seeds of which were germinated in wet perlite at 25°C and transferred to a germination chamber for 2 weeks for full seedling development. These seedlings were then moved to growth chambers at 25°C/15°C (day/night) equipped with fertirrigation lines, and they were maintained on a 16 h photoperiod at a photon flux density of 300 μmol m
