The membrane was washed gently three times for 10 min with TPBS buffer and then antibody binding was detected with a goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugated antibody (1:10,000 in TPBS: Thermo Scientific, United States) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed again three times with TPBS and the protein bands were then visualized using the ECL western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were recorded in a Chemi Genius
