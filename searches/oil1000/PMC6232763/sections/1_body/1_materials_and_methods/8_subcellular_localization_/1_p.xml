<p class="p">Fluorescence microscopy images of BY-2 cells were obtained on a Leica DM RBE CLSM using a 63× Plan Apochromat oil-immersion objective, a TCS SP2 scanning head and the TCN NT software package (version 2.61: Leica). Samples were excited with an argon laser at 488 nm (GFP) and 543 nm (Cherry, RFP, rhodamine RedX), and fluorescent emission was collected at 500–530 nm for GFP, or at 590–640 nm for RFP, cherry and rhodamine RedX. Fluorophore emissions were collected sequentially in double-labeling experiments, while single labeling experiments exhibited no detectable crossover at the settings used for data collection. Confocal images were acquired as a z-series of representative cells and single optical sections that were saved as 512 pixel × 512 pixel digital images. All fluorescence images shown in the figures are representative of &gt;20 cells from at least three independent transformation experiments.</p>
