<p class="p">The expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatB</italic> genes in seeds at different developmental stages (from 12 to 28 DAF) and in vegetative tissues (roots, stems, cotyledons and leaves of 20-day-old seedlings) was analyzed by RT-QPCR (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>
 </bold>). Both sunflower genes were expressed most strongly in seeds, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic>. During seed development, the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic> doubled in intensity from 12 to 18 DAF, thereafter falling from 20 to 28 DAF. The expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatB</italic> remained more or less constant, or with a small reduction from 12 to 28 DAF (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>
 </bold>). 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatB</italic> was always the more strongly expressed in vegetative tissues, except for leaves. In this period, the total amount of lipids increased eightfold (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>
 </bold>), with a maximum rate of fatty acid synthesis from 15 to 25 DAF, where the maximum levels of 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic> coincide with an increase in oleic acid synthesis.
