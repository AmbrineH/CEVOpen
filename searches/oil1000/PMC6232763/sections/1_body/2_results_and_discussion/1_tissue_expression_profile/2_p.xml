<p class="p">The pattern observed here suggests that sunflower FatA acyl-ACP thioesterase is important not only for oil deposition in the seed but also, for the final oil composition. Sunflower oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids derived from oleate released mainly via FatA (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>
 </bold>) and thus, the synthesis of sunflower oil requires this fatty acid to be exported from plastids at a high rate. This is consistent with the strong 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic> expression during the oil deposition period (10–30 DAF, see 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>
 </bold>). The expression of 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatB</italic> was maintained during the period of oil accumulation, although it was not as tightly regulated as that of 
 <italic class="italic">HaFatA</italic>. This profile of FatA and FatB in developing sunflower oil seeds was very similar to that observed previously in Arabidopsis (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sánchez-García et al., 2010</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Camelina sativa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>). Both these species express more FatA than FatB, at least one order of magnitude more in the period of oil accumulation, pointing to an important role of FatA in the export of the fatty acids that accumulate in the oil. A different profile was observed in castor seeds (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sánchez-García et al., 2010</xref>), where FatB expression was similar to that of FatA. However, this species has many peculiarities in terms of its oil synthesis, specializing in the accumulation of large amounts of a single fatty acid in its oil. Thioesterases of the FatB type are mainly related to palmitic and stearic acid export from plastids (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bonaventure et al., 2003</xref>). Sunflower oil accumulates small amounts of saturated fatty acids, so the role of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB must be related to the supply of saturated acyl chains destined to maintain the correct balance of fatty acids in the plant membranes and that serve as substrates for other biosynthetic pathways. This fact was supported by the high specificity of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB toward saturated fatty acids (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et al., 2016</xref>) and the decrease in the flux observed in sunflower mutants with a high-saturated oil phenotype (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the relationship between the FatA and FatB thioesterases in providing the necessary activity to supply fatty acids according to the experimental data (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>
 </bold>) assuming similar substrate availability would be 100:1 for oleate export. This ratio cannot be explained through the expression of these enzymes (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>
 </bold>), indicating limited substrate availability for the FatB thioesterase or distinct interactions between this enzyme and the other enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. This issue could be influenced particularly by the membrane location of FatB, which could affect the metabolic channeling in conjunction with the soluble fatty acid synthase (FAS;
