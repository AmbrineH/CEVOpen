<p class="p">As a intial step to investigate the subcellular localization of the 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB proteins, their deduced amino acid sequences were assessed using several web-based protein location prediction programs, including ChloroP

 </sup>. Overall, both proteins were assigned a high probability of plastid localization. That is, as described previously for plant acyl-ACP thioesterases in general (

 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATB were strongly predicted to contain N-terminal plastid transit peptide (
