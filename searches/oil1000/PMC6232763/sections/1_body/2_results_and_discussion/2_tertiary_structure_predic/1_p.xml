 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB display important differences in their kinetic parameters for the different acyl-ACP substrates present in plant plastids. Preliminary studies of the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of these enzymes indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA is likely to be specific for the hydrolysis of oleoyl-ACP, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB displayed a broad specificity profile, displaying similar activity toward oleoyl-, palmitoyl-, and stearoyl-ACP derivatives (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno-PÃ©rez et al., 2014</xref>). However, later studies demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB displayed a highly specificity profile toward saturated acyl-ACP derivatives (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, the plastidial export of oleate and of saturated fatty acids (palmitate and stearate) probably takes place independently, mediated by the action of the two different thioesterases. The expression of these two enzymes (

 </bold>) was also consistent with this hypothesis. The differences in the substrate specificity of these enzymes appears to be driven by their N-terminal domain (
