 </bold>). Thus, the only known plant acyl-ACP thioesterase structure was used as model for these sunflower proteins. As shown in the sequence alignment and through the secondary protein structure, there was 32.5% identity and a high degree of conservation (24%) in the remaining residues. Strong variability was found in the flexible linker located between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are involved in substrate specificity and catalysis. The secondary structures of the enzymes were also pretty similar, conserving the catalytic residues (D270, N272, H274, and E308 in 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA; and D317, N319, H321 and E354 in 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB), although the N-terminal domain shows the highest divergence, the region where the residues conforming the substrate binding pocket can be found. This weaker conservation was possible responsible for the differences in substrate specificity. Indeed, the positively charged surface patches involved in the interaction with ACP (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jing et al., 2018</xref>), and that surround the substrate binding pocket, were also well conserved (263-RRLSKI-268 292-RKLSKL-297 in 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA; and 212-RRLQKV-217 246-KKIAKL-251 in
