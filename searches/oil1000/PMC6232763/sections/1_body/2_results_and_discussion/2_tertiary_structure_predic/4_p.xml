<p class="p">The formulation of three-dimensional models (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </bold>) allows the structural differences of these proteins to be better understood, particularly since the general structure of these enzymes appeared to be conserved (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4a,b</xref>
 </bold>). The external region involved in the interaction of the enzymes with the acidic ACP protein had a very similar shape and positive charge, indicating that the main differences between these enzymes probably lies in the binding pocket (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4c,d</xref>
 </bold>). A detailed view of the substrate channel shows that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB has a tighter gate and less volume (18% less, calculated from volume data for narrow cavities obtained with the PDB viewer program), which would make the interaction with voluminous unsaturated fatty acids difficult (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </bold>). By contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA displayed a longer and curved hydrophobic cavity that would interact much better with longer and unsaturated fatty acids.
