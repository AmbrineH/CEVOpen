<p class="p">The 3D structural data for 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA provided details of the position of the residues that affected activity in previous site-directed mutagenesis studies (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>). In that study, four changes were demonstrated to significantly affect activity: L118W, T182W, M206W and Q215W. In all cases, the original amino acids were changed for a hydrophobic and voluminous tryptophan in order to alter the hydrophobic pocket. The changes L118W and T182W induced an important decrease in the activity, with both residues lying close to amino acids W186 and I148 that conformed hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </bold>), suggesting that they probably hampered the correct assembly of the acyl residue within it. Conversely, the amino acid changes Q215W and M206W increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by 2.4 and 3.5-fold, respectively. Interestingly, both amino acids were close to the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket and thus, they probably increase the hydrophobicity of this region, facilitating the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </bold>). The M206W change also enhanced the substrate specificity for 18:1-ACP (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>) and the transient expression of this allele made important modifications to the TAG content of tobacco leaves possible. In 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB those residues position corresponded to L169/M233/M257/S266, being Q215/S266 the most conservative change. The influence of these residues in the activity of this enzyme have not been studied yet. Therefore, this new model of plant thioesterase structure could represent a useful tool to engineer these enzymes, providing important information about the amino acids that determine their activity and specificity (
