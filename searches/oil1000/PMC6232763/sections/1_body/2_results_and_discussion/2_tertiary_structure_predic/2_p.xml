<p class="p">The ORF of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB cloned in this work encodes a predicted protein of 430 amino acids, which corresponds to a calculated molecular mass of 47.64 kDa with a pI value of 7.1. Like 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA, the first 60 amino acids of the N-terminal domain were predicted to be a transit peptide (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>) and thus, L90 was considered to be the first amino acid of the mature 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB protein, as proposed for many other plants (

 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB has a hydrophobic domain from L90 to Q109 (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>) that is absent from FatA thioesterases, and it could be involved in membrane anchorage but is not related to the catalytic properties of the enzyme (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salas and Ohlrogge, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, it maintained strong homology to other FatB enzymes in the domain containing the three residues that represent the papain-like catalytic triad required for this activity (
