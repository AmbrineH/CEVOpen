<p class="p">When western blots of the soluble and membrane fractions were probed with the anti-
 <italic class="italic">At</italic>FatB antibody, a protein band of the expected size was detected in both the total and membrane fractions, but not in the soluble fraction (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </bold>). Hence, it appears that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB localizes predominantly to plastid membranes of developing sunflower seeds, while the distribution of the protein in plastids in BY-2 cells appears to be influenced by its ectopic over-expression, including when co-expressed with other plastid proteins, namely TIC40 (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </bold>). Unfortunately, the western blot record does not give notice of the role of the hydrophobic domain within 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB. The different location of these two enzymes probably influences in their interaction with the other enzymes involved on plastidial fatty acid synthesis, which are soluble and located in stroma and enforces the hypothesis of these enzymes having different roles in plant lipid synthesis.
