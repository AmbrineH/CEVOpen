<p class="p">The latter data support the conclusion that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB is localized to the soluble stroma, like 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATA, and does so in the absence of its hydrophobic sequence. Nevertheless, the results from additional experiments involving co-expressed TIC40-RFP, which consists of the 40-kDa subunit of the translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts fused to the red fluorescent protein (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Breuers et al., 2012</xref>), revealed that the plastid localization of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATB can sometimes vary. Thus, as shown in

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9-1A–1C</xref>

 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATA-GFP displayed a fluorescence pattern that was delineated by the characteristic, cresent-like fluorescence pattern attributable to co-expressed TIC40-RFP. This is attributable to the ectopic expression of TIC40 causing a proliferation and remodeling of the inner envelope membrane (

 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB-GFP readily co-localized with co-expressed TIC40-RFP (

 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATB, unlike its counterpart, is associated with the inner envelope membrane in plant cells. Taken together, these subcellular location studies confirm that both sunflower thiosterases target to plastids, but that 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATB differ with regards to their localization to the stroma or stroma and/or inner envelope membrane, respectively.
