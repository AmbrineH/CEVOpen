<p class="p">In higher plants, 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesized fatty acids can be used to produce glycerolipids in the plastid through the activity of plastidial acyltransferases (prokaryotic pathway: 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li-Beisson et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, they can be hydrolyzed from the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) by acyl-ACP thioesterases that release free fatty acids and the free

Furthermore, a recent study has also reported the export of acyl moieties from thylakoid phosphatidyl glycerol mediated by a specific lipase (
