<p class="p">Thioesterases are key enzymes in oilseeds, playing an essential role in determining the amount and composition of fatty acids that enter the storage lipid pool (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Voelker, 1996</xref>). They are plastid targeted enzymes encoded by nuclear genes (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yuan et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mayer and Shanklin, 2005</xref>) and acyl-ACP thioesterases fall within the group of thioester active enzymes, which are classified into 25 families of which the plant acyl-ACP thioesterases constitute family TE14

 </sup>. Based on sequence alignments, these enzymes have been further classified into two sub-families, called FatA and FatB (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). The FatA and FatB enzymes differ in their substrate specificity, with FatA showing high substrate specificity for monounsaturated oleoyl-ACP (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salas and Ohlrogge, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Serrano-Vega et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sánchez-García et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno-Pérez et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). Within the FatB subfamily, two groups of enzymes can be found that are referred to as FatB1 and FatB2. The former is only found in plant species accumulating short or medium chain fatty acids, like

 <italic class="italic">Umbellularia californica</italic> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). They are soluble enzymes that display specificity toward short chained acyl-ACPs and have been very important in plant biotechnology (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eccleston et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Voelker, 1996</xref>). By contrast, FatB2 enzymes are widely distributed among plant species, and they display specificity toward palmitoyl- and stearoyl-ACPs when assayed with their physiological acyl-ACP substrates (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dörmann et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salas and Ohlrogge, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aznar-Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). The role of these enzymes in correct plant development has been demonstrated by reverse genetics (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bonaventure et al., 2003</xref>), and they are probably involved in supplying the saturated fatty acids necessary for the synthesis of distinct essential metabolites, such as sphingolipid long chain bases (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Another differential feature of the FatB2 enzymes is the presence of a hydrophobic domain, possible an outside to inside transmembrane helix anchor (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Facciotti and Yuan, 1998</xref>). This feature indicates that these enzymes probably differ in their location as well as their substrate specificity, although this has not as yet been supported by specific data regarding their subcellular locations.
