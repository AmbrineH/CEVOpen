<p class="p">In this study, we have analyzed different aspects of the 
 <italic class="italic">Helianthus annuus</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Ha)</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB thioesterases, addressing the role of these enzymes in sunflower oil biosynthesis by analyzing the oil composition of standard sunflower lines, as well as their kinetics when acting on their natural substrates and the differences in their expression assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). Furthermore, to gain insight into the influence of both enzymes on the final composition of sunflower oil, we carried out three dimensional (3D)-structural modeling. The new data regarding the crystal structure of FatB1 made it possible to model the substrate-binding pockets of both 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB, which differed in size and geometry in accordance with the different substrate specificities of these enzymes. Finally, we assessed the subcellular localization of both sunflower thioesterases in transiently transformed tobacco suspension-cultured cells via confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM). In doing so, we show that both 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB localized to the plastid stroma, although 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FATB also localized to the plastid inner envelope membrane when co-expressed with an inner membrane marker protein. Consistent with these latter results, the association of 
 <italic class="italic">Ha</italic>FatB with plastidial membranes was also demonstrated through western blotting of isolated plastid soluble and membrane fractions. The apparent different functions of these two enzymes are discussed in the light of these results.
