<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technoloies-7890A equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m ×  0.25
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>mm, film thickness 0.25 µm). The column temperature was kept at 60
 <bold class="bold">°</bold>C for 3
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>min and programmed to 210°C at a rate of 3°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, heated to 240°C with 20°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and held for 8.5
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>min. The injector and GC/MS interface line were maintained at 280°C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min
