<p class="p">GC analysis was carried out on an Agilent Technoloies-7890A gas chromatograph with a split/splitless injector (280
 <bold class="bold">°</bold>C), split ratio of 1 : 50 and a flame ionization detector (290
 <bold class="bold">°</bold>C). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas (1 ml min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and the capillary column used was a DB-5 (30 m ×  0.32
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>mm, film thickness 0.25 µm). The column oven temperature was kept at 60°C for 3
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>min and heated to 210°C with a 3°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> rate, then increased to 240°C with 20
 <bold class="bold">°</bold>C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> rate and the final temperature held for 8.5
 <bold class="bold"> </bold>min. Relative percentage amounts were calculated from the peak area without the use of correction factors.
