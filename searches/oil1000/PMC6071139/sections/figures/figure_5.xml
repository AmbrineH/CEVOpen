  <p class="p">Effects of milk thistle seed oil (MTSO from Zaghouan area, Tunisia) on 7-ketocholesterol (7KC)-induced caspase-3 cleavage and activation of LC3-I in LC3-II. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) After 24 h of culture, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were cultured for 24 h without or with 7KC (25 µM or 50 µM) in the absence or presence of MTSO (Zaghouan; 0.1%

   <italic class="italic">v</italic>) or α-tocopherol (400 µM), which was used as positive control. MTSO and α-tocopherol were added to the culture medium 2 h before 7KC. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activation (cleaved caspase-3) and autophagy by conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio). (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) The means ± SDs of the densitometric values of 3 independent experiments are shown. The ethanol (EtOH) value corresponds to the highest final EtOH concentration present in the culture medium with 7KC (50 µM) associated with MTSO. The significance of the differences between vehicle and cells treated with 7KC, MTSO or α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); * 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05. The significance of the differences between the cells treated with 7KC, 7KC with MTSO, and 7KC with α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); # 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05. No significant differences between control, vehicle (ethanol)-treated cells, MTSO, and α-tocopherol were observed. No differences were observed between the control, vehicle (ethanol), MTSO, and α-tocopherol.
