 <p> Evaluation of the effects of milk thistle seed oil (MTSO) on 7-ketocholesterol (7KC)- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell growth inhibition in 158N murine oligodendrocytes with the MTT (Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) and crystal violet tests. After 24 h of culture, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were cultured for 24 h without or with 7KC or 24S (25 µM) in the absence or presence of milk thistle seed oils (MTSO; area: Zaghouan, Bizerte, and Sousse; 0.1% v/ v) or α-tocopherol (400 µM), which was used as a positive control. MTSO and nigella seed oil (0.1% v/ v), and α-tocopherol were added to the culture medium 2 h before 7KC and 24S. The cytoprotective effects of MTSO on 7KC- and 24S-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased activity of succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme belonging to the Krebs cycle) and inhibition of cell growth were evaluated with the MTT and crystal violet tests, respectively. Data are the means ± standard deviations (SDs) of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. The significance of the difference between vehicle and cells treated with 7KC, 24S, MTSO and nigella seed oil or α-tocopherol was calculated with ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); * p ≤ 0.05. The significance of the difference between cells treated with 7KC alone, 7KC or 24S with MTSO, or 7KC and 24S with α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); # p ≤ 0.05. No significant differences were found between control and vehicle-treated cells (ethanol). </p>
