  <p class="p">Effect of milk thistle seed oil (MTSO) on 7-ketocholesterol (7KC)- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S)-induced plasma membrane permeability in 158N murine oligodendrocytes. After 24 h of culture, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were cultured for 24 h without or with 7KC or 24S (25 µM) in the absence or presence of MTSO (Area: Zaghouane, Bizerte, and Sousse; 0.1%

   <italic class="italic">v</italic>) or α-tocopherol (400 µM), which was used as a positive control. MTSO, nigella seed oil, and α-tocopherol were added to the culture medium 2 h before 7KC. The cytoprotective effects of MTSO and nigella seed oil on 7KC and 24S-induced plasma membrane permeability were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide (PI). Plasma membrane permeability was determined by the percentage of PI positive cells. Data are means ± SDs of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. The significance of the differences between the vehicle and cells treated with 7KC, MTSO, nigella seed oil, or α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); * 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05. The significance of the differences between the cells treated with 7KC or 24S, 7KC or 24S with MTSO, and 7KC or 24S with α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); #
