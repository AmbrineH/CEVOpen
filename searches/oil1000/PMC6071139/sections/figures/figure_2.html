 <p> Evaluation of the effect of milk thistle seed oil (MTSO) on 7-ketocholesterol- (7KC) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S)-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 158N murine oligodendrocytes. After 24 h of culture, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were cultured for 24 h without or with 7KC (25 µM) or 24S (25 µM) in the absence or presence of MTSO (Area: Zaghouan, Bizerte, and Sousse; 0.1% v/ v) or α-tocopherol (400 µM), which was used as the positive control. MTSO, nigella seed oil, and α-tocopherol were added to the culture medium 2 h before 7KC and 24S. The cytoprotective effect of MTSO on 7KC- and 24S-induced ROS overproduction, mainly superoxide anions, was evaluated by flow cytometry after staining with dihydroethidine (DHE). ROS overproduction was determined by the percentage of dihydroethidine (DHE)-positive cells. Data are means ± SDs of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. The significance of the differences between vehicle and cells treated with 7KC, MTSO, nigella seed oil, or α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); * p ≤ 0.05. The significance of the differences between cells treated with 7KC or 24S, 7KC or 24S with MTSO, and 7KC or 24S with α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); # p ≤ 0.05. No significant differences between control, vehicle (ethanol), MTSO, and α-tocopherol were observed. </p>
