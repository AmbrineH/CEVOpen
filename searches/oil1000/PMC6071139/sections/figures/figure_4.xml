  <p class="p">Effects of milk thistle seed oil (MTSO) on 7-ketocholesterol (7KC)- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S)-induced apoptosis evaluated by condensation and/or fragmentation of the nuclei. After 24 h of culture, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were cultured for 24 h with or without 7KC (25 µM) in the absence or presence of MTSO (Area: Zaghouan, Bizerte, and Sousse; 0.1%

   <italic class="italic">v</italic>) or α-tocopherol (400 µM), which was used as the positive control. MTSO and α-tocopherol were added to the culture medium 2 h before 7KC and 24S. Apoptosis was evaluated by the percentage of apoptotic cells characterized by condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, whereas control cells (untreated cells) had round and regular nuclei. Data are the means ± SDs of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. The significance of the differences between the vehicle and cells treated with 7KC, MTSO, nigella seed oil, or α-tocopherol was calculated by ANOVA tests (Sidak’s multiple comparisons); *
