<p class="p">Ageing and age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, are dependent on genetic and epigenetic factors, including environmental and lifestyle parameters. In nerve cells, these factors can favor neurodegeneration and increase the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinson disease which are age-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. It is therefore important to determine the main causes of these neurodegenerative diseases and to better understand their physiopathology. Indeed, this will permit further identification of natural or synthetic compounds that are capable of preventing neurodegeneration which has increased in developed and developing countries mainly due to the enhancement of life expectancy [
