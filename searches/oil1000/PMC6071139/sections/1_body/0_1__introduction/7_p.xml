<p class="p">The extract of pistachio seeds induces a decrease in the proliferation of MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation–

 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Other plant extracts have also shown anti-proliferative effects, such as milk thistle seed extract and pumpkin seed extract which inhibit the proliferation of Human Colon Cancer Cells (HT-29) [

 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] highlighted the biological activity of milk thistle oil on a colon cancer cell line, Caco-2. These extracts contain bioactive components which could be responsible for their therapeutic effects, such as antioxidants, tocopherols, and carotenoids [

 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. It has also been shown that black and red raspberry extracts and grapes, which have anti-proliferative activity against human HT-29 cancer cells, contain elevated concentrations of phenols and anthocyanins, tocopherols and carotenoids, and α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) [

 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The α-linolenic acid found in these extracts can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA: C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: C22:6 n-3) which can have cytoprotective activity against several chronic human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer [
