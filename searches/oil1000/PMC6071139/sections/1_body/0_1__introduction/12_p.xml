<p class="p">In the present study, the chemical compositions (fatty acids, polyphenols, phytosterols, tocopherols) of milk thistle seed oils from different area of Tunisia (Zaghouan, Bizete, Sousse) were determined as well as their antioxidant properties. The ability of milk thistle oil to attenuate 7KC- and 24S-induced side effects (inhibition of cell proliferation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy) was also studied on 158N murine oligodendrocytes. As nigella seed oil is considered potentially cytotoxic based on popular empirical knowledge, the chemical characteristics of this oil were also determined as well as its ability to prevent, or not, 7KC- and 24S-induced side effects on 158N cells. It is noteworthy that, whereas no cytoprotective effects were observed with nigella seed oil, a marked attenuation of 7KC- and 24S-induced side effects was observed with milk thistle seed oil from different areas of Tunisia (Zaghouan, Bizerte, and Sousse).</p>
