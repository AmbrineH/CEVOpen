<p class="p">Work realized by Kittur et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], which evaluated the effects of milk thistle extract on the differentiation and survival of neural cells, demonstrates that this extract can promote differentiation and neuronal survival (evocating neurotrophic activities), and protect the neurons of the rat hippocampus against cell death induced by oxidative stress. These latter data suggest a potential benefit of the chemicals present in milk thistle on the nervous system.
