<p class="p">The DPPH assay for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (C18H12N5O6) (Sigma-Aldrich) can be regarded as a free radical scavenger test. The DPPH assay is used to measure the anti-radical activity of compounds or mixtures of compounds. The absorbance was read at 517 nm (Sunrise spectrophotometer, Tecan, Lyon, France). The negative control contained 100 μL of water and 100 μL of the DPPH solution. The antioxidant potentials of α-tocopherol, silymarin, ferrulic acid, and resveratrol (used as positive controls) were estimated in Trolox equivalents (1 mole of α-tocopherol, silymarin, ferrulic acid, or resveratrol is equivalent to X mole of Trolox; the calibration curve was obtained with Trolox) [
