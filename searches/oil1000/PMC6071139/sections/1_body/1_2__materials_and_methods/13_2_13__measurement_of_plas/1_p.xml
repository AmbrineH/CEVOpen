<p class="p">The measurement of plasma membrane permeability was based on the property of propidium iodide (PI) to enter in dead cells and/or in cells with damaged plasma membranes [
 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The fluorescence of PI (used at 1 Âµg/mL) was collected with a 630 nm pass filter on a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec). Ten thousand cells were acquired, and Flomax (Partec) or Flowjo (Tree Star Inc.) was used to analyze the data.
