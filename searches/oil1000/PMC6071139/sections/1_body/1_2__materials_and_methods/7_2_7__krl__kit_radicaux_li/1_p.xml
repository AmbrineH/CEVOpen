 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The data are presented in Trolox equivalents. Hemolysis was recorded using a 96-well microplate reader by measuring the decay of the optical density at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer. For each well, absorbance measurements were made 75 times, once every 150 s.
