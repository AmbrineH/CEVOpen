<p class="p">The Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) test, which measures the antioxidant potential of compounds or mixtures of compounds by reducing ferric iron (Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>) to ferrous iron (Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>), was realized as previously described [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The absorbance of the reaction medium was read at 700 nm against a blank prepared by replacing the extract with distilled water to calibrate the spectrophotometer. An increase in absorbance corresponded to an increase in the reducing power of the extracts tested [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The reducing power of the extracts in mg of Trolox per g of dry matter (mg of Trolox/g of dry matter) was calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Iron reduction power (%) = [Absorbance control 700 − Absorbance sample 700)/Absorbance control 700] × 100.</disp-formula>
