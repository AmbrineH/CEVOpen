<p class="p">To evaluate the mitochondrial activity, the MTT test was used. It is based on the reduction of MTT salt to formazan in metabolically active cells [

 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. At the end of the treatment, the cells were incubated in the presence of MTT for 3 h, formazan was solubilized by the addition of dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and the optical density was measured at 570 nm with a microplate reader (Sunrise spectrophotometer).
