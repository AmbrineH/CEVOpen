<p class="p">7-Ketocholesterol (7KC; Ref: C2394) was from Sigma-Aldrich (St Quentin Fallavier, France) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S) was provided by Mohammad Samadi (University of Lorraine, Metz, France). The stock solutions of 7KC and 24S were prepared at 800 μg/mL (2 mM), as described by Ragot et al. [
