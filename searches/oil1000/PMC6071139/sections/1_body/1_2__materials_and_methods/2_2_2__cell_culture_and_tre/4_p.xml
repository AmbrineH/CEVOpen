<p class="p">When the cells were treated with 7KC and 24S, associated with milk thistle seed oil, nigella seed oil, or α-tocopherol, these compounds were added 2 h before 7KC and 24S. Based on the concentrations of 7KC and 24S used, it was assumed that the intracellular oxysterol content obtained in vitro was in the range of those that occur in vivo [
