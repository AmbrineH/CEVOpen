<p class="p">The analysis of caspase-3 and LC3 was realized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, as previously described by Nury et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Briefly, cell lysis was performed in a Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation (20 min, 20,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>) to remove cell debris. Seventy micrograms of protein were separated on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel for caspase-3 and LC3 and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Marne La Coquette, France). After blocking nonspecific binding sites for 2 h with 5% milk powder in PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2), the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in PBST—antibodies to caspase-3 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Ozyme/Cell Signaling, ref: # 9662) and LC3-I/II (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, ref.: L8918)—at a final dilution of 1/1000. To standardize the results, an antibody directed against β-actin (mouse monoclonal antibody, ref: A2228, Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a final concentration of 1/10,000. After 2 washings with PBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling, No. 7074) diluted to 1/5000. The membrane was then revealed using an improved chemiluminescence detection kit (Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Thermo-Scientific) and ChemiDoc
