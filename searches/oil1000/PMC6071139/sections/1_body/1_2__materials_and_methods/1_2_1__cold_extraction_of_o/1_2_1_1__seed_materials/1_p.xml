<p class="p">The present study mainly concerns milk thistle (
 <italic class="italic">Silybum marianum</italic>) seeds originating from three different area of Tunisia, namely Zaghouan (36°24′ N 10°09′ E), Bizerte (37°16′28′′ N 9°52′26′′ E), and Sousse (35°50′ N 10°38′ E). The plants were harvested in May and June 2014, during which time the plants reach maturity and senescence. Currently, as little is known about the effects of the environment (soil, climate) on the characteristics of milk thistle seed oils, the seed were collected in three different area of Tunisia.
