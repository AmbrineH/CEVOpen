<p class="p">The nuclear morphology of apoptotic cells can be determined after staining with Hoechst 33342 (2 Âµg/mL). Observations were performed by fluorescence microscopy under a UV light with an Axioskop microscop (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The percentages of cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, which are characteristic of apoptotic cells, were determined [
