<p class="p">Three grams of each oil were dissolved in 6 mL of petroleum ether and then, were cleaned on a cartridge of silica for solide phase extraction (SPE) (conditioned with 6 mL of petroleum ether). The cartridge was then washed with 12 mL of petroleum ether and dried under a stream of nitrogen for 10 min. The polyphenolic compounds were eluted with 8 mL of methanol/distilled water 80/20 (

 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The phenolic compounds were identified using a combination of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Agilent 1100 diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS) based on their ultraviolet (UV) spectra, comparing the spectra with those of the authentic standards available.
