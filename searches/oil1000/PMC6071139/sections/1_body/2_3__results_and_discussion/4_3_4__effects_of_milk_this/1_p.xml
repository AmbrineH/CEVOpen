 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, final concentration) and α-tocopherol (400 μM) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction under treatment with 7KC and 24S (25 μM, 24 h) were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining with dihydroethidium (DHE). Under treatment with 7KC and 24S, an overproduction of ROS (compared to vehicle-treated cells) was observed. Thus, after treatment with 7KC and 24S, the percentage of DHE-positive cells significantly increased. Treatment with MTSO or α-tocopherol alone had no effect on the production of ROS. When MTSO and α-tocopherol were added with 7KC and 24S, the overproduction of ROS was greatly and significantly attenuated compared to the condition with 7KC and 24S alone (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-07-00095-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). However, an enhancement of ROS overproduction (similar to with 7KC and 24S) was observed with nigella seed oil, and no cytoprotective effects of nigella seed oil were found; nigella seed oil did not prevent 7KC- and 24S-induced ROS overproduction.
