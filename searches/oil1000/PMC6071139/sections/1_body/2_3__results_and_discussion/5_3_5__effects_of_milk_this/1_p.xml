In 158N cells, 7KC and 24S induce an increase in plasma membrane permeability (evaluated by the percentage of PI-positive cells). Compared to control cells and vehicle (ethanol)-treated cells, the percentage of PI-positive cells under treatment with 7KC and 24S significantly increased. When MTSO and α-tocopherol were added with 7KC and 24S, the increase in plasma membrane permeability was strongly attenuated (

However, an enhancement of plasma membrane permeability (similar than with 7KC and 24S) was observed with nigella seed oil, and no cytoprotective effects of nigella seed oil were found with oxysterol-induced enhancement of membrane permeability.
