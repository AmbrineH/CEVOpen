<p class="p">Currently, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are considered key events in several degenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B77-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Interestingly, the chemical profile of MTSO reveals the presence of numerous compounds that can prevent oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, MTSO contains high levels of antioxidant molecules (tocopherols, polyphenols) capable of reducing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS: ROO•, RO•) [
 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], which can induce lipid peroxidation leading to protein carbonylation and several types of cellular dysfunction that may contribute to neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B79-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The presence of these compounds is consistent with the antioxidant properties of MTSO determined with the KRL, DPPH, and FRAP tests. In addition, MTSO is also rich in oleic acid (C18:1 n-9). Although (C18:1 n-9) is not an antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], it has been shown in 7KC-treated murine microglia BV-2 cells that this fatty acid is able to attenuate the overproduction of ROS [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In addition, oleic acid as well as α- and γ-tocopherol have been shown to prevent mitochondrial, lysosomal, and peroxisomal dysfunction in different types of nerve cells [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. As these compounds, which have been shown to inhibit 7KC- and 24S-induced neurotoxicity are present at low levels in MTSO (the final concentrations of oleic acid, and α- and γ-tocopherol were more than one hundred-fold lower than those in the culture medium when these compounds were used alone), it is possible that some of them may act in synergy to exert cytoprotective effects and/or that several other compounds of MTSO (polyphenolic compounds, sylimarine, etc.), could be involved in the beneficial effects. We must also consider that the different compounds present in MTSO could activate and suppress several signaling pathways contributing to cytoprotection.
