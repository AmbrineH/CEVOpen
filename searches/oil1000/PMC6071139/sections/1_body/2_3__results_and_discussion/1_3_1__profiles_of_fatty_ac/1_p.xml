 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In the present study, we focused on the fatty acids, phytosterols, polyphenols and tocopherols present in MTSO. Data obtained were compared with nigella seed oil which is mainly empirically known for its toxic activity.
