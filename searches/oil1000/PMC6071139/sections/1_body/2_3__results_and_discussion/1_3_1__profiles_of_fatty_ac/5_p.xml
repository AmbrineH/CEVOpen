<p class="p">As many compounds present in MTSO (phytosterols, polyphenols, tocopherols) are able to prevent nerve cell dysfunction and can cross the blood–brain barrier [

 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], these data reinforced our interest in evaluating the ability of MTSO to prevent the toxic effects of 7KC and 24S [

 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. So, the ability of MTSO to prevent the side effects induced by 7KC and 24S was compared to α-tocopherol (used as a positive cytoprotective control) and to nigella seed oil (supposed as potentially cytotoxic).
