<p class="p">As phytosterols are components that are present in the unsaponifiable lipid fraction of plant cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] and are abundant in vegetable oils (nuts, cereals), it was important to determine the content and composition of the sterols in the MTSO studied (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-07-00095-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Î²-Sitosterol was the main sterol in all oils. Schottenol was also detected at a high level in MTSO and, in particular, in Zaghouan MTSO. Campesterol was determined in appreciable amounts, especially in the MTSO from Sousse. The presence of cholesterol is in agreement with the results reported by Fathi-Achachlouei and Azadmard-Damirchi [
 <xref rid="B61-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] as well as by Dabbour et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Cholesterol could be formed by demethylation of sitosterol. The synthesis of cholesterol in plants remains to be clarified [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Cholesterol can be localized in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and microsomes in free or esterified form. Cholesterol is an important constituent of the leaf wall. It should be noted that high levels of cholesterol have been reported in palm, corn, and sunflower oils [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Cholesterol has never been identified, even at very low levels, in olive and argan oils, whatever the geographic origin of the oils [
