With the MTT test, measurement of the enzymatic activity of succinate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme of the Krebs cycle) showed lower MTT values following 7KC and 24S treatment, supporting a loss of ΔΨm and/or a reduced cell growth and/or a loss of cell adhesion [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-07-00095-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The crystal violet test, which permits the evaluation of cell growth, also showed a significant decrease in 158N adherent cells and/or a loss of cell adhesion after treatment with 7KC and 24S for 24 h (

 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-07-00095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], the toxic effects of 7KC (lower MTT values, lower crystal violet values) were significantly reduced, whereas no cytoprotective effects of nigella seed oil were found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-07-00095-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the controls, vehicle (ethanol)-treated cells, MTSO, and α-tocopherol for cell growth evaluated with the crystal violet test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-07-00095-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). However, lower MTT and crystal violet values, similar to those observed with 7KC and 24S, were observed with nigella seed oil, and no cytoprotective effects of nigella seed oil were found; nigella seed oil did not prevent 7KC- and 24S-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell growth inhibition.
