<p class="p">Based on the biochemical and antioxidant characteristics of MTSO, this oil may be beneficial for age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, and may be associated with diet as functional foods. Indeed, these oils contain numerous molecules (fatty acids, polyphenols, phytosterols, and tocopherols) that are theoretically capable of crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier [

In addition, the various compounds present in the MTSO could act in synergy to counter the toxic effects of 7KC of 24S identified at increased levels in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The data shown in this study also validate the development of a cellular model (158N cells treated with oxysterols) to apprehend the biological activities of oils on brain cells.
