<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of BTEO on human fibroblasts was determined via an MTT test (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) according to a modified Carmichael’s method. The 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells were plated on 96-well plates. After reaching 90% confluency, the cells were incubated with 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/g of the studied oil for 24 h. As a positive control, we used cells incubated with 100 μM of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Following the incubation, DMEM was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Afterward, 20 µL of the MTT solution (2 mg of MTT dissolved in 1 mL of PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 60 min. The product of the conversion - formazan derivatives was dissolved in isopropanol, after MTT solution removal. The absorbance was measured applying the microplate reader at the 570-nm wavelength (Asys UVN 340). The number of viable cells was calculated as a percentage of the control.
