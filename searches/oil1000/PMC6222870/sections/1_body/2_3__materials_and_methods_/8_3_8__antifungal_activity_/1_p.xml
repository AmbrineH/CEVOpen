 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In the first step, 200 mg/mL stock solution of BTEO was prepared in DMSO. Subsequently, series of two-fold dilutions were prepared with a working concentration range of 200–1.56 mg/mL. Analysis of BTEO activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. yeast was performed on RPMI agar supplemented with MOPS (Biomaxima, Poland). The BTEO oil solutions (volume of 50 µL; oil content range 10–0.08 mg) were placed in 6 mm diameter wells that were previously cut from the inoculated plates. The RPMI plates were incubated under aerobic conditions at 35 °C for 24 h [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], and the growth inhibition zone diameters were measured in millimeters. The aim of the initial phase of the study was to determine the antifungal activity of BTEO in the above method at the lowest possible concentration. Based on the results obtained in the first phase of the study, a 100 mg/g BTEO concentration was selected for the preparation of three formulations based on a oleogel, bigel and hydrogel. In the next stage of the study, reference (
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6528, 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019) and clinical strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. were used (
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis</italic>). In the gel activity investigation, we utilized the agar-well diffusion method described for the initial phase of the study. Approximately 50 µg of the particular gel supplemented with BTEO was applied to the wells. The activity of BTEO at corresponding concentrations in DMSO (50 µL) was analyzed in the same RPMI plates. Antifungal activity of the gels supplemented with 
 <italic class="italic">B. tripartitia</italic> essential oil was determined in three technical repetitions. Solutions of ketoconazole and clotrimazole in DMSO and commercially available products with Nizoral
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> and Clotrimazol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> were used as a positive controls in antifungal susceptibility testing, respectively.
