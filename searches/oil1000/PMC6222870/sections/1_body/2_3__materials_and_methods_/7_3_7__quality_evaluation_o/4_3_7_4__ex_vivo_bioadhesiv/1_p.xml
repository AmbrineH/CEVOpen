<p class="p">Bioadhesiveness was evaluated by the TA.XT.Plus Texture Analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK) with hairless mouse skin as an adhesive layer. The skin was stored at −20 °C for maximum four weeks. Before the experiment, the skin was defrosted and cut into 5 mm diameter pieces, then thawed in a physiological saline solution (0.9% NaCl) at 25 ± 0.5°C for 30 min. Parameters of the study were as follows: pretest speed—0.5 mm∙s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, test speed—0.1 mm∙s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, contact time—120 s, post-test—0.1 mm∙s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, applied force—0.5 N. The adhesive properties were expressed as the maximum detachment force (F
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) and the work of adhesion (W
 <sub class="sub">ad</sub>). W
 <sub class="sub">ad</sub> was computed using the formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">W
  <sub class="sub">ad</sub> = A × 0.1 × 1000
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>where A—the area under the force versus distance curve, multiplication by 0.1—conversion time measurement to distance (the sampler was raised at 0.1 mm·s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), then multiply by 1000 in order to express the result in units of work µJ. The results were reported as the mean of six tests [
