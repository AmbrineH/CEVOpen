 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) was gradually added to purified water and stirred using the mechanical stirrer. Then, during continuous mixing, bronopol and glycerol were added. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> (BTEO) at a concentration of 100 mg/g was uniformly dispersed in the hydrogel. The oleogel was prepared by dissolving Tween 80 in heated castor oil (70 °C) with continuous mechanical stirring at 300 rpm, followed by dispersion of the gelling agent Aerosil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 200 in the oil. After complete mixing of the gelling agent, tocopheryl acetate was added as an antioxidant. When the mixture was homogeneous, heating was stopped to gradually solidify to form the oleogel. BTEO at the same concentration as the hydrogel was uniformly dissolved in the oleogel. The bigel was produced by separately preparing the oleogel and hydrogel, and then mixing them at room temperature. The bigel formulation was made at an oleogel to hydrogel weight ratio of 30:70. During the bigel preparation, BTEO was dissolved in the oleogel, then the oleogel was mixed with an alginate hydrogel under constant mechanical stirring at 800 rpm. The concentration of BTEO in the designed preparation was 100 mg/g. A control hydrogel, bigel and oleogel without BTEO (placebo) were also prepared.
