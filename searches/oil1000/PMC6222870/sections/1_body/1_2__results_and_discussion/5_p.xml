In thixotropic systems, viscosity decreases over time at a steady shear rate. With removing the shear stress, a viscosity increment to the initial value is observed. Interestingly, a distinctive type of rheogram was observed for the oleogel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02517-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). An almost linear dependence between shear rate and shear stress, which is typical for the Bingham model rather than pseudoplastic flow, was observed. The Bingham model describes a viscoplastic material that behaves as an elastic solid at low stresses and flows as a viscous fluid at high stress. In addition, the hysteresis loop of the oleogel indicates that its thixotropic properties are negligible. The hysteresis loops may be caused by the rigid structure of oleogel, created with using fumed silica and castor oil and resulting from a strong particle-particle interaction which lead to a firm network formation.
