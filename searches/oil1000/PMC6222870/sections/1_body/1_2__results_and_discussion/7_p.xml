<p class="p">Bioadhesion is phenomenon when two materials are joined for a prolonged time by interfacial energies [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The bioadhesive properties of the vehicles used as topical drug carriers enable them to adhere to the skin, and as a result, elongate the drug retention. The results of the experiments carried out using hairless mice skin as a model of the adhesive layer are demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02517-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. All prepared formulations were characterized by bioadhesive properties, and the greater values of F
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and W
 <sub class="sub">ad</sub> were noticed in the case of the oleogel and bigel, which were characterized by higher viscosity and higher values of mechanical properties. No significant difference in the bioadhesiveness of preparations containing BTEO and placebo formulations were noted.
