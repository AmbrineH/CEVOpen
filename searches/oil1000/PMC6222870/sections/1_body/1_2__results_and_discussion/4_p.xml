<p class="p">The viscosity and rheological properties of the dosage forms for topical administration are related to the spreading, application behavior and contact time with the skin surface. The obtained gel formulations containing BTEO were found to have different viscosity values (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02517-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The highest viscosity was noticed in the case of the bigel (11,833, mPa·s), and the alginate hydrogel (6879, mPa·s) possessed the lowest viscosity. The addition of essential oil increased viscosity values, which was particularly noticeable in the bigel formulation.
