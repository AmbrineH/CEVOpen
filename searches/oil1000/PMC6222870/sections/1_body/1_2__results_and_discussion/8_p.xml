<p class="p">The antifungal activity of the hydrogel supplemented with 100 mg/g BTEO concentration was demonstrated against all tested 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains, except for 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> (clinical strain). Essential oils are well-known antifungal agents. Many of them inhibited both the growth and the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains more efficiently than known antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The highest activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> (3.7 mm difference compared to hydrogel without BTEO). In the case of the bigel formulation with essential oil, the growth inhibition zone diameters were observed in 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> (mean of diameters 8.0 mm), 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>, and both 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> strains (mean 7.7 mm). The minimum antifungal activity of the oleogel in combination with BTEO (mean 7 mm) was demonstrated only for the clinical 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> strain, and for individual measurements of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>.
