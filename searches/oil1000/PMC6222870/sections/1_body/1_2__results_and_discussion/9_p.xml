<p class="p">Among all of the tested gel formulations combined with BTEO, the hydrogel-based formulation appears to be the preferred combination that exhibited antifungal activity against all tested 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains. Interestingly, in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> strains, the antifungal activity of the hydrogel itself was noted. A similar phenomenon in the antifungal activity of the carrier, oleogel, was noted in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> strains. The antifungal activity of the oleogel-based formulation was observed in the form of a zone with a reduced growth density of the tested strain. In the case of the bigel, its antifungal activity was not demonstrated against 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> strains, whereas the combination with BTEO resulted in the appearance of a growth inhibition zone up to 7.3 mm on average. Irrespective of the emerging full activity of the essential oil, the appearance of the zone in the form of the reduced growth density of the tested strain was observed. The above phenomena could possibly be related to the specificity of the particular species of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>. The obtained results of antifungal activity tests demonstrate that our formulations had inhibitory effects on the growth of fungi (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02517-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The essential oil consisted of a complex of numerous components. Possible synergistic and antagonistic effects of these phytoconstituents play an important role in 
 <italic class="italic">Candida species</italic> inhibition. Previous studies on the antifungal activities of essential oils of other 
 <italic class="italic">Bidens</italic> species have shown that they have varying degrees of growth inhibition effects against pathogenic fungal species [
