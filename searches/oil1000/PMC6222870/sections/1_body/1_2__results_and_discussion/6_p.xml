<p class="p">Local drug carriers should be characterized by optimal application properties. The textural parameters provide information about the response to an external force, and are crucial to verifying the removal facility of preparations from the container, or their spreadability on the skin surface. Firmness is the maximal force needed to accomplish a deformation, compressibility is the work needed to deform the formulation during the compression of the probe, and adhesiveness is defined as the work overbear forces between the investigated sample and the model adhesive layer. The results of the texture analysis (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02517-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) confirmed findings from the rheological measurements. The highest values of the mechanical parameters were recorded in the case of the bigel containing BTEO and the lowest for the alginate hydrogel, which can be attributed to the nature of the ingredients used. Higher values for firmness, compressibility and adhesiveness observed for the bigel and oleogel were possibly due to the presence of castor oil in these formulations. Formulations without BTEO possessed slightly lower firmness, compressibility and adhesiveness.
