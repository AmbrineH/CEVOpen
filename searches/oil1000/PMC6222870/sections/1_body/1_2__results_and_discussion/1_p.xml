<p class="p">The essential oil from dried herb of 
 <italic class="italic">Bidens tripartita</italic> (BTEO) was obtained and analyzed by GC-MS using the pharmacopeia method. The amount of oil calculated for the BTEO was 0.19% (
 <italic class="italic">v/w</italic>). Ninety-eight compounds were identified in the oil of BTEO, which represents 94–98% of the total components detected. The oil was mainly composed of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen (4.82%), β-linalool (2.85%), (Z)-cymen (2.60%) and α-fellandren (1.10%). The chemical composition of the essential oil depends on the many factors such as climate, method of extraction as well as vegetation stages. Kaskoniene et al. have studied the variation of essential oils composition of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> after supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction during three years 2009–2011. The obtained results revealed that the essential oils composition was highly dependent on the meteorological data such as temperature or precipitation. In contrast, the differences obtained in the essential oil composition are mainly due to a variety of extraction methods used [
