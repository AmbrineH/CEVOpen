<p class="p">When designing local dosage forms, selection of the proper carrier is a crucial issue, as it affects characteristics of the final product. In this study, three gel formulations (a hydrogel, bigel and oleogel) containing BTEO were designed, and their physicochemical features were investigated. The designed formulations containing BTEO possessed homogenous consistency and no phase separation was observed. Essential oil tinged the formulations for yellow. In the case of the alginate hydrogel and the bigel, BTEO was uniformly suspended in the vehicle, while in the oleogel it was completely dissolved. The pH values of the obtained preparations with BTEO were in the range of 6.4 to 7.2 (

Moreover, the pH values of all of the formulations were suitable for topical delivery, enabling safe application to the skin without the risk of its irritation.
