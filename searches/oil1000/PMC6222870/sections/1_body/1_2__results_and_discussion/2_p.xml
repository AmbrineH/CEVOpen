<p class="p">To evaluate the potential toxicity of the oil, a MTT and COMET tests were conducted in human dermal fibroblasts culture. The MTT test indicated the dysfunction of mitochondria in cells treated with the tested compounds. The Comet assay is a fast and sensitive fluorescence method that allows the detection of DNA damage at the single cell level. The test provides a measure of DNA strand breaks. As a positive control, cells incubated with 100 Î¼M of H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were used. The results of both tests did not reveal significant changes in the cells treated for 24 h with 50 and 100 mg/g of BTEO (

Addition of the oil at concentrations of 150 and 200 mg/mL induced a significant increase of cytotoxic effect and tail moment in fibroblasts. This result suggests that BTEO is not toxic in human dermal fibroblasts culture at concentrations below 100 mg/mL. For further experiments, BTEO was used at a concentration of 100 mg/mL. The safety of the BTEO prompted us to prepare the formulations.
