<p class="p">A wide variety of plants found in Central and Eastern European flora have been identified through ethnopharmacological studies as antifungal agents. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Bidens</italic> L. (Asteraceae) consists of approximately 230 plant species that are used as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antidiabetic, analgesic and antioxidant agents [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The broad biological activity of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> is associated with phytochemicals, particularly, flavonoids, essential oils, and coumarins, as well as polyynes [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Gel formulations are very important group of local dosage forms and their use in therapy is becoming more widespread. They are characterized by many favourable features such as mucoadhesion, tixotropy, or ease of spreadability. Hydrogels constitute three-dimensional, hydrophilic polymer networks, whereas oleogels are composed of lipophilic fluid gelled with suitable gelling agents. Bigels combine the features of hydrogels and oleogels and they can be designed to deliver both lipophilic such as essential oils and hydrophilic drugs [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02517" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In this regard, the scope of this study was to develop and characterize different novel gel formulations containing the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> herbs (BTEO). Additionally, the antifungal activity of the obtained formulations on many different 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains was examined. To exclude any potential toxic effects of BTEO on human dermal fibroblasts, MTT and COMET assays were performed for the first time.
