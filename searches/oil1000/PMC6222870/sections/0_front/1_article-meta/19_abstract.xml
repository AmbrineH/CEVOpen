 <p class="p">The genus 
  <italic class="italic">Bidens</italic> L. (Asteraceae) refers to several species of plants used in traditional phytotherapeutic preparations. 
  <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic>, also known as bur marigold, is the most familiar plant and has been known as a remedy for chronic dysentery. The hydrodistilled essential oil of the aerial parts of the Polish 
  <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. To exclude any potential toxic effects of the oil on human dermal fibroblasts, the MTT test (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) and COMET assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) were performed. Novel gel formulations as topical carriers for essential oil obtained from 
  <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> were developed and characterized. The bioadhesive properties of the designed preparations in the ex vivo model using the skin of hairless mice were also evaluated. The therapeutic efficacy of the topical formulations is influenced by active phytoconstituents and vehicle characteristics. The antifungal properties of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">B. tripartita</italic> were also tested against 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, and this oil appears to be a promising topical anticandidal agent.
