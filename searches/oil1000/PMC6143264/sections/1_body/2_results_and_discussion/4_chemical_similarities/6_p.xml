 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> in different seasons, which expresses 96.42% of the data variations in the two components. We found that elemol is a common substance in all the seasons, located in the center of the graphic. Summer is located far from the other seasons, which are also far from the grouped compounds; this indicates differentiation in the chemical composition of the EOs collected in this season. However, we observed that among the compounds related to winter, spring, and autumn, the monoterpenes α-pinene and β-pinene are the major compounds of

 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Myrcene and limonene showed similarities in their phytochemical profiles between seasons and the highest relative proportions during winter, spring, and autumn.
