<p class="p">Some studies have emphasized that EOs containing oxygenated sesquiterpenes show antimicrobial activity, such as the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study performed to determine the antimicrobial activity of EO from a species of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum suave</italic> collected from Tanzania had 14% germacrene B and a moderate antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic> (1.35 mg/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> (1.95 mg/mL). Germacrene B has already been evaluated separately [

 <italic class="italic">Artemisia indica</italic> (containing 8.6% germacrene B as the isolated compound) exhibited antimicrobial activity. This compound was screened 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and showed spectrum antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic> and especially against gram-negative bacteria [
