<p class="p">Some substances were shared between autumn and summer as well as between spring and winter, which shows the chemical similarities between the EOs under the seasonality effect. On the basis of HAC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204132.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>), we can affirm that the high similarity observed in class 3 (spring and autumn) is due to the compounds shared between these two seasons, and, at the same time, these compounds are different from those in classes 1 and 2 (summer and winter, respectively), which also share many compounds.
