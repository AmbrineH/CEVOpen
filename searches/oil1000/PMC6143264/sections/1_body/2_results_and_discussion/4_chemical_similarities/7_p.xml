<p class="p">Although PCA shows clear differences between summer and the other seasons, the influence of the monoterpenes on the antimicrobial activity is unclear because a lower MIC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204132.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> and the differentiating substances for spring, winter, autumn, and summer. Besides elemol, specific compounds, i.e., the sesquiterpenes Î²-selinene and bicyclogermacrene, were observed in spring (

 <xref rid="pone.0204132.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The substances related to winter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204132.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>) were kaurene, rosadiene, and linalool, which also showed higher contents in this season (
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). For summer and autumn (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204132.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), the discriminating substances was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon isobicyclogermacrenal; the major compounds were epi-zizanone and germacrene B, which showed a more significant increase in these seasons than in autumn (
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we verified a lower MIC for

 <xref rid="pone.0204132.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Thus, these substances are possibly responsible for the high antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria. However, it is important to point out that the observed antimicrobial activity may not be directly related to the major compounds, but to the synergy between the compounds.
