<p class="p">The chemical similarities among the EOs extracted from the leaves harvested in different seasons were studied by performing multivariate analysis of the chemical compounds, regardless of the species. The Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster (HAC) analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204132.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) showed the formation of three classes for the seasons, regardless of the species. Class 1 is formed by the EO obtained in summer; class 2, winter; and class 3, spring and autumn, demonstrating the chemical similarities between these two seasons.
