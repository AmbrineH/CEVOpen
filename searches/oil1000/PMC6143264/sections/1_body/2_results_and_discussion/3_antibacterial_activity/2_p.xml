<p class="p">The inhibitory action against bacterial growth can be attributed to the effects of the secondary compounds, which have shown higher inhibitory action against gram-positive bacteria than against gram-negative ones and yeast [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This is because the gram-negative bacteria have a diversified cell wall, with an external membrane composed specially by lipopolysaccharides, granting higher resistance by avoiding the diffusion and accumulation of EOs in the bacterial cell [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The antimicrobial effects generally occur because of structural and functional damage to the plasmatic membrane, mainly due to the hydrophobicity of the compounds present in EOs [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], as well as the influence on the enzymatic systems and genetic material of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, qualitative analyses of EOs can reveal potentially important substances for bacterial control.
