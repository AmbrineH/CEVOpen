<p class="p">In all the EOs from the studied species of 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic>, we identified substances from the classes of monoterpenic hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenic hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The chemical compositions of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> were similar; both had the highest relative proportion of substances from the class of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. However, the EO profile of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> showed more substances from the classes of monoterpenic and sesquiterpenic hydrocarbons (
