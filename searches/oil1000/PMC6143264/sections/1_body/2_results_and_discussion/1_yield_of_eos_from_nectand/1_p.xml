 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> were higher in spring and autumn, and these species showed their lowest yield in winter (

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic> in spring (0.23%) did not differ from that in autumn (0.2%); however, it was higher than the EO yield in winter (0.08%), which is a season of low relative humidity. For 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic>, the highest yield was obtained in spring and autumn (0.17%), without significant variations between these seasons.
