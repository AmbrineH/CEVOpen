<p class="p">Our production results differ from the data found in the literature, and these variations could be attributed to the specific climatic conditions of the studied region. High EO yields (0.45% and 0.33%) were found in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> harvested in spring and summer, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]; however, higher EO yields were obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic> (0.75%) harvested in spring [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In our study, we did not observe significant differences among the seasons with respect to the EO content of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic>; however, we found higher EO contents in autumn and spring than in winter and autumn for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic>. Thus, to achieve higher EO yields, the harvest of the leaves from these two species should be performed in autumn, when the plants are in their vegetative stage, because the leaves harvested during the reproductive period (spring) can show alterations due to pollination and fructification. Another important factor for determining the best time for harvesting the leaves is the phytochemical profile of the EOs.
