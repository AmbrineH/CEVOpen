<p class="p">The seasonal variations had significant effects on the content and chemical composition of the EOs from the 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> species. The EO contents from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">grandiflora</italic> were higher in spring and autumn. These two species were also characterized by their similar EO chemical compositions, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> had a distinct chemical profile, constituted a separate class, and did not show variations in the EO content. Alterations to the EO chemical profile with seasonality were also observed, and class 1 was formed by the EO of leaves harvested in summer; class 2, EO of leaves collected in winter; class 3, EO of leaves harvested in spring and autumn. The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> collected in winter and spring showed the highest control of growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic>. Thus, the action on gram-negative bacteria may be related to the monoterpenes α-pinene and β-pinene, which are the major compounds of the EO, besides myrcene and limonene, which had a relation to winter, autumn, and spring. 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> showed high antibacterial potential against the gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic>, and this bioactivity can be related to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons isobicyclogermacrenal (major EO compound), epi-zizanone, and germacrene B, which showed an increase in summer and autumn (seasons when the EO showed a lower MIC). In the literature, the data for the biological activity of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> species are limited, and, certainly, future studies should be performed to elucidate which compounds of the EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> are truly responsible for the growth of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively.
