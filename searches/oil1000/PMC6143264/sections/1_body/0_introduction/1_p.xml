<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> (family, Lauraceae) has a great diversity of essential oil (EO) constituents that may be influenced by seasonality; biome diversity; and plant age, part, and developmental stage [

 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Several environmental and climatic factors, such as atmospheric pollution, solar irradiation, soil, and water availability, as well as factors inherent to the plant may induce variations in the composition of secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Thus, all these factors associated with harvest time are important and should be considered when assessing active plant compounds. For some species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Laurus novocanariensis</italic>, the EO yield ranging between 0.3 and 0.4% (v/w), this is, were nearly identical in the leaves collected during spring and autumn, respectively [
