<p class="p">Species that belong to the family Lauraceae have confirmed antimicrobial activity, and the EO antifungal activity of some species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, was high against several strains. However, 
 <italic class="italic">Aniba rosaeodora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sassafras albidum</italic> showed lower inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Low EO concentrations (0.12% to 0.25%) from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rosaeodora</italic> had potential antibacterial effects on 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. EOs from other Lauraceae species (
 <italic class="italic">Lindera pulcherrima</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Dodecadenia grandiflora</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Persea gamblei)</italic> were also studied, and they showed antibacterial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pasteurella multocida</italic>; however, only the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Persea gamblei</italic> proved to be efficient against 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether the yield, chemical composition, and antibacterial activity of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra megapotamica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra grandiflora</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra lanceolata</italic> leaves are dependent on seasonal variations. In addition, we verified the chemical similarities of the EO by performing multivariate analysis, to identify compounds potentially related to antibacterial activity.
