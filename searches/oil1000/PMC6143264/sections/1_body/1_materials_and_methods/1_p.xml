 <italic class="italic">lanceolata</italic> were harvested from the experimental farm of Sao Paulo State University (latitude, 22° 50′ 48″ S; longitude, 48° 26′ 06″ W; and altitude, 817.74 m). The period of the experiment was characterized by high average temperatures (20–24°C) and significant precipitation in spring and summer (±132 mm). For sampling, we considered four plants of each species, and the leaves were harvested in the middle of each season, corresponding to winter (August), spring (November), summer (February), and autumn (May). The harvest was performed randomly for each plant (about 1.5 kg), and well-developed leaves (expanded and green) were selected. After the harvest, the material was homogenized, dried, and manually ground. Voucher specimens of
