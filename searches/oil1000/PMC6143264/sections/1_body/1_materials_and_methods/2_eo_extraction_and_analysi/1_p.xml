<p class="p">The extraction of EOs from dried leaves (100 g) was performed by hydro-distillation with a Clevenger apparatus for approximately 2 h. For calculating EO yield, the extractions were performed in triplicate. The EO yield was 0.2 ± 0.03% (w/v), and the EOs were stored in amber glass bottles at 0°C.</p>
