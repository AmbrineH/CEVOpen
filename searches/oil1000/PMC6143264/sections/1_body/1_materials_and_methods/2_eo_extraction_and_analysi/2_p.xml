<p class="p">Quantitative analyses (area standardization method) of the EOs were performed gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC–FID) and the chemical composition by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Shimadzu, model QP-5000, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a silica capillary column DB-5 (J&amp;W Scientific, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Purified helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and the injector and detector temperatures were 230°C and 240°C, respectively. The initial temperature of the oven was 60°C, and it was increased at 3°C/min up to 240°C. The EO (1 μL) was diluted in 1 mL of ethyl acetate (Tedia Brazil), and 1 μL of the mixture was injected in the split mode (1:20). The EO qualitative analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph connected to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS; Shimadzu, model QP-5000) operating by electron impact (70 eV), in scanning mode, at 1 scan/s, with a range of mass acquisition of 40–500 m/z, and interface temperature of 230°C. The chromatographic conditions were the same as those used in the quantitative analyses. EO components were identified by comparing their mass specters with literature data [
