<p class="p">The standard strains of gram-negative (
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, ATCC 43895) and gram-positive (
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, ATCC 25923) bacteria were grown on brain heart infusion agar plates at 37°C for 24 h under an aerobic environment. Then, inocula from each strain were prepared in Mueller-Hinton broth at 0.5 on the McFarland scale to obtaining concentrations of around 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. To assess the antibacterial activity of the EOs, viable cells were determined using the resazurin-based assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0204132.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Two-hundred microliters of each inoculum was added to 96-well plates to verify the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The EOs from each species were added to the wells to reach the following concentrations: 0.5% to 10.5% (v/v) for the tests with 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> and 0.025% to 3% (v/v) for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic>. After inoculation, the microplates were incubated (37°C/24 h), and bacterial growth was measured after the addition of 50 μL of 0.01% resazurin, an oxidation-reduction indicator. The tests were performed in triplicate, and the MIC was confirmed as the lowest concentration without bacterial growth.
