 <p> Number of protein spots showing increased and decreased (≥ or ≤of 2-fold, P &lt; 0.05) levels of synthesis when Listeria monocytogenes Scott A cells were treated for 1 h at 37°C with antimicrobial compounds. C, untreated cells, control; EtOH, cells treated with ethanol (1% v/v) alone. Other antimicrobial compounds were: citral at 85 (C85) and 125 (C125) mg/L; carvacrol at 20 (CA20), 35 (CA35) or 50 (CA50); (E)-2-hexenal at 150 (ESE1), 250 (ESE2) or 400 (ESE4) mg/L; and Thyme essential oil at 40 (OT40), 70 (OT70), or 100 (OT100) mg/L. The comparison was performed by using untreated cells (A) or cells ethanol-treated cells (B). </p>
