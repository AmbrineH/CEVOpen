 <p> Heat map of the identified proteins involved in nucleotide and nitrogen metabolisms in cells of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. Only protein spots showing different (≥ or ≤ of 2-fold, P &lt; 0.05) relative amounts under stress conditions compared to untreated cells were showed. Permutation analysis was performed using the relative amount of protein spots as found in each condition. Changes in the protein amount (average of three replicates) are represented colorimetrically, with red and green indicating the highest and lowest values of the standardized data, respectively, for each protein of different conditions. All data were shown as a percentage of dissimilarity using Euclidean distance. C, untreated cells; EtOH, cells treated with ethanol (1% v/v) alone. Other antimicrobial compounds were: citral at 85 (C85) and 125 (C125) mg/L; carvacrol at 20 (CA20), 35 (CA35) or 50 (CA50); (E)-2-hexenal at 150 (ESE1), 250 (ESE2) or 400 (ESE4) mg/L; and thyme essential oil at 40 (OT40), 70 (OT70) or 100 (OT100) mg/L. </p>
