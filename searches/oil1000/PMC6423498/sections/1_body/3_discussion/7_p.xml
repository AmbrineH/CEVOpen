<p class="p">Compared to other stresses, few data are available about the cross-protection between antimicrobial adaptation and acid stress resistance in 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. Ethanol alone, ethanol plus citral or (E)-2-hexenal increased the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A to survive and grow at pH 4.5. Interestingly, treatment with thyme EO reduced the acid stress resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A also under the food-like system. The different acid resistance induced by antimicrobials could be related to the proteome plasticity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> that improve the cell survival to specific environmental conditions.
