<p class="p">The results of this study highlighted the cell adaptation of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A during treatments with sub-lethal doses of antimicrobials (ethanol, citral, carvacrol, E-2-hexenal, and thyme essential oil). Adaptation and shaping of proteomes primarily concerned cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome, motility and regulatory related proteins, carbohydrate, pyruvate, nucleotide and nitrogen metabolism, cofactors and vitamins and stress response with contrasting responses for different stresses. Cells adapted to ethanol, citral (85 mg/l) or (E)-2-hexenal (150 mg/L) exhibited increased survival during acid stress imposed under model (BHI) and food-like systems. A detailed understanding of the effects of natural antimicrobials on the microbial cell physiology and virulence is needed for their exploitation in the food industries as alternatives to traditional preservatives. The findings of this study can favor the use of natural antimicrobials for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in the food industry as alternative preservatives to improve food safety. A full understanding of adaptive and survival strategies of pathogenic species such as L. monocytogenes should combine gene expression studies with proteome and phenotypic shifts. Otherwise, the fate of pathogens can be verified/and or predicted in real foods only by studying the proteome reprogramming and phenotypic switching associated with gene expression shift due to stress exposure. To improve food safety, a holistic approach is needed due to the incomplete information provided by individual analytical approaches. In contrast, the correlation between the genotypic, proteome, and phenotypic data is pivotal to fully understanding the activities and biological functions of pathogens under harsh conditions (i.e., those characterizing foods during storage and human gut). In this framework, this study determined the proteome shift in relation to the exposure to the natural antimicrobials considered to aid in controlling 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in foods to improve their safety.
