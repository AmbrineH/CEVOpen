 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A cells with 35 mg/L carvacrol increased the levels of the 30S ribosomal proteins S3 and S8. In contrast, compared to the use of ethanol alone, the levels of the 30S ribosomal proteins L5 and L25 decreased in cells treated with citral and (E)-2-hexenal. The highest levels of ribosome recycling factor (Frr) were observed in cells treated with carvacrol (35 mg/L) or thyme EO at 100 mg/L.
