<p class="p">The lowest levels of the transcription elongation factor GreA were observed in citral-treated cells. Compared to ethanol alone, the addition of other antimicrobials to the growth medium resulted in a reduction in the level of the protein DegU, with the exception of cells exposed to citral at 125 mg/L. The lowest levels of a GntR family transcriptional regulator were observed in cells treated with citral at 35 mg/L.</p>
