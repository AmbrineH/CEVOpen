 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In detail, ethanol-stressed cells exhibited increases in the levels of 87 protein spots compared to the control. In contrast, the relative amounts of 17 other protein spots were higher in control cells. The highest number of induced protein spots was observed for cells treated with thyme EO at 70 (130 spots) and 100 (120 spots) mg/L, as well as for cells treated with carvacrol at 35 mg/L (161 spots). Higher protein induction was observed in cells exposed to doses corresponding to 1/3 of the MIC values of citral, carvacrol (E)-2-hexenal and thyme EO. In contrast, the number of underexpressed protein spots was the highest using doses of antimicrobial products corresponding to 1/5 (E-2-hexenal and thyme essential oil) and/or 1/2 (citral and carvacrol) of the MICs. Proteins showing different relative amounts were analyzed by PCA. The proteome profiles differed between the treatments. The highest similarity among the different proteomes was observed for cells treated with citral (at 85 and 125 mg/L), or (E)-2-hexenal (150, 250 and 400 mg/L). Compared to the cells treated with ethanol, cells treated with other antimicrobials showed a strong reduction of the relative amount of various proteins (
