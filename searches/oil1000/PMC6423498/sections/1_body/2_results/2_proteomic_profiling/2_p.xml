<p class="p">All of the proteins (223 spots) with relative abundances that were up- or downregulated were identified. Except for hypothetical or unknown proteins, the identified proteins were arranged by functional categories according to the KEGG database (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The identified proteins were primarily involved in the following functional categories: (i) cell morphology and motility; (ii) ribosomal and regulation system proteins; (iii) carbohydrate transport and metabolism and energy production; (iv) nucleotide and nitrogen metabolism; (v) cofactor and vitamin metabolism; and (vi) general stress response. Numerous proteins were resolved as two or more spots on the 2-DE gels, possibly due to post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein cleavage or the presence of different isoforms (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ignatova et al., 2013</xref>). The identified proteins are described in detail in the following paragraphs.
