<p class="p">The acid stress resistance of both control and treated

Acid stress was imposed at pH 5.5 and 4.5 using a laboratory medium (BHI) and a food-like model (mixture of rice drink and pear juice). Compared to the control cells, cells treated with ethanol alone or ethanol plus citral at 85 mg/L increased (
