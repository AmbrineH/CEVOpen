<p class="p">After reaching the mid-exponential phase, cells were exposed for 1 h to sublethal dose of antimicrobial compounds [ethanol, citral, carvacrol (E)-2-hexenal and thyme EO]. Ethanol was used at 1% (v/v) alone and was also used to convey the other antimicrobial compounds assayed. Citral was used at concentrations corresponding to 1/3 and 1/2 of the MIC. Carvacrol (E)-2-hexenal and thyme EO were used at concentrations corresponding to 1/5, 1/3, 1/2 of the MIC. According to observed MIC values,
