<p class="p">The treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> cells with ethanol and other antimicrobials affected the levels of proteins related to nucleotide and nitrogen metabolism differently. The highest levels of GMP synthase [GuaA, EC:6.3.5.2], which is involved in purine metabolism (ko00230), were observed in cells exposed to ethanol alone for 1 h and especially in cells treated with ethanol plus citral (85 mg/L), carvacrol (20 or 35 mg/L) or thyme EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The lowest levels of adenylate kinase [EC:2.7.4.3], which is involved in both purine and thiamine metabolism (ko00730), were observed in carvacrol-treated cells. The highest levels of CTP synthase, which is involved in pyrimidine metabolism (ko00240), were detected in cells treated with ethanol plus carvacrol (35 mg/L) and thyme EO (100 mg/L). The highest levels of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase [Upp, EC:2.4.2.9], which is involved in pyrimidine metabolism, were observed in cells exposed to carvacrol (at 20 mg/L). Purine-nucleoside phosphorylase [PpnP, EC:2.4.2.1], which is involved in purine, pyrimidine, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism (ko00760), was induced in cells treated with ethanol plus carvacrol (up to 35 mg/L) (E)-2-hexenal and thyme EO (up to 40 and 100 mg/L). The lowest levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in cells treated with carvacrol (50 mg/L) (E)-2-hexenal (all concentrations tested) or thyme EO at 40 and 70 mg/L. Except for aspartate aminotransferase, all of the other proteins related to the nitrogen metabolism were observed at higher relative amounts in cells exposed to the natural antimicrobials compared to the control ones cells. The highest relative amounts of peptidase enzymes were observed in
