<p class="p">The highest levels of the molecular chaperone DnaK were observed in the stressed cells with ethanol plus thyme EO at 100 mg/L (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Cells treated with ethanol plus carvacrol at 20 and 35 mg/L strongly increased GroEL, whereas the levels of GroES differed depending to the dose of antimicrobial used. Superoxide dismutase (Sod) was found at the maximum level in cells treated with ethanol plus carvacrol (35 mg/L) or thyme EO at 100 mg/L. Glutathione-disulfide reductase was specifically induced during cell exposure to ethanol plus carvacrol (35 mg/L) or thyme EO at 70 and 100 mg/L. The FeS assembly proteins SufB and SufD, which are associated with post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones, were variably induced in cells exposed for 1 h to the natural antimicrobials tested. Proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthetic pathways and membrane repair (FabG and FabY) were induced under ethanol stress, especially in cells treated with ethanol plus citral (FabY) and ethanol plus citral (125 mg/L), carvacrol (35 and 50 mg/L), (E)-2-hexenal, or thyme EO (FabG).
