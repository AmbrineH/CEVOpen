<p class="p">Transketolase is an enzyme involved in the acyloin condensation reaction between C2 and C3 of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate producing 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) and plays a key role in the thiamine metabolism (ko00730). Transketolase was induced during ethanol stress exposure and remained at higher levels in all of the treated cells compared to the control cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Increased levels of formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase [EC:6.3.4.3], which is involved in the tetrahydrofolate interconversion of one carbon pool by folate (ko00670), were observed in cells treated with ethanol plus citral (all concentrations), carvacrol (35 mg/L) and thyme EO (all concentrations) compared to the control cells. Isochorismate synthase (MenF) and naphthoate synthase (MenB), which are involved in ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis (ko00130), were specifically induced in cells treated with ethanol plus carvacrol (35 mg/L) and thyme EO at 100 mg/L (MenF) and ethanol alone (MenB).
