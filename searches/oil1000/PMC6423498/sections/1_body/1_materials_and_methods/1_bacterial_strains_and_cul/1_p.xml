 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A was stored at -80°C for long-term preservation. To acclimatize the strain to the experimental conditions, 1 mL of the culture strain was inoculated into 9 mL of Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) (Thermo-fisher, Milano, Italy) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the cells were propagated at 37°C for 24 h in BHI broth using a 1% inoculum.
