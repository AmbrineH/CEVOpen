 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A cells in the mid-exponential growth phase (OD = 0.4 at λ = 600 nm) were incubated for 1 h to sublethal concentrations of natural antimicrobials at 37 °C without stirring. Subsequently, the 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A cells were inoculated at 6–7 log CFU/mL in BHI broth at different pH values (4.5 or 5.5). The growth capabilities and adaptation of the cells to acidic environments was evaluated over a 48 h incubation at 37°C by determining the optical density (OD) at 600 nm or counting CFUs on BHI agar-solidified medium. The same trials were also performed in a food model system consisting of a fruit-based beverage (mixture of rice drink and pear juice) at two pH values (4.5 and 5.5) that was obtained by modifying the ratio of rice drink and pear juice.
