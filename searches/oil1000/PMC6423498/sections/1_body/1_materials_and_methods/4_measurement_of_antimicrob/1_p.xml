<p class="p">The harvested cells were resuspended in fresh BHI broth, harvested by centrifugation at 9000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min and immediately resuspended in sterile physiological solution for plate count. Cell numbers were determined by plating on BHI agar medium, with the number of CFU determined after a 24 h incubation at 37°C. The number of surviving microorganisms was calculated as a percentage of the cell number at time zero. The tolerance factor (TF) corresponded to the ratio of the cells that survived the treatment to that of control cells.</p>
