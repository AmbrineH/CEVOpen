 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A cells grown in BHI broth for 24 h at 37°C were inoculated (1% v/v) into 1000 mL of fresh BHI broth at a final density of 4 log CFU/mL. The cells were cultivated at the optimum growth temperature (37°C) until reaching the mid-exponential phase of growth (OD600 nm of 0.4). Next, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9,000 ×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min at 37°C and resuspended in 1000 mL of fresh BHI broth alone (untreated cells, control) or supplemented with antimicrobial compounds (treated cells). The concentrations and the conditions used were the same those reported in 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Braschi et al. (2018a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). Antimicrobial treatments were performed using ethanol (final concentration in BHI broth of 1% v/v) alone or with citral (final concentrations in BHI broth of 85 or 125 mg/L, corresponding to 1/3 and 1/2 of the minimal inhibitory concentration – MIC), carvacrol (20, 35, or 50 mg/L, corresponding to 1/5, 1/3, and 1/2 of the MIC) (E)-2-hexenal (150, 250, or 400 mg/L, corresponding to 1/5, 1/3, and 1/2 of the MIC) and thyme essential oil (40, 70, or 100 mg/L, corresponding to 1/5, 1/3, and 1/2 of the MIC).
