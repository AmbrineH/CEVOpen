<p class="p">For each spot, the ten strongest precursors were selected for MS/MS fragmentation, which was performed in LIFT mode without the introduction of a collision gas. The default calibration was used for to obtain MS/MS spectra, which were baseline-subtracted and smoothed (Savitsky-Golay, width 0.15 m/z, cycles 4). Monoisotopic peak detection was performed using a SNAP averaging algorithm (C 4.9384, N 1.3577, O 1.4773, S 0.0417, H 7.7583) with a minimum S/N of 6, and Bruker flexAnalysis (version 3.3) was used to perform spectral processing and to generate peak lists.</p>
