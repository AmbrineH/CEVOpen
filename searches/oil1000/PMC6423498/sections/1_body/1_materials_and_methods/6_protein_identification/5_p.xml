<p class="p">Tandem mass spectral data were used in database searches using a locally run copy of the Mascot program (Matrix Science Ltd., version 2.5.1) through the Bruker ProteinScape interface (version 2.1). The criteria specifications were as follows: Enzyme, Trypsin; Fixed modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C); Variable modifications, Oxidation (M) and Deamidated (NQ); Peptide tolerance, 100 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.5 Da; and Instrument, MALDI-TOF-TOF. A minimum of two peptides with an ions score of at least 40 was required to get a reliable identification (
