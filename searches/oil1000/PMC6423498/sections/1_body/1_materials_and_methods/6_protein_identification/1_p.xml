<p class="p">In-gel tryptic digestion was performed by washing gel pieces two times with 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, after which they were washed once with acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum concentrator for 20 min. Next, sequencing-grade, modified porcine trypsin (Promega) was dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid supplied by the manufacturer and then was diluted fivefold with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to give a final trypsin concentration of 0.02 μg/μL. Next, the gel pieces were rehydrated by adding 10 μL of trypsin solution for 10 min, after which enough 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added to cover the gel pieces and the samples were incubated overnight at 37°C.</p>
