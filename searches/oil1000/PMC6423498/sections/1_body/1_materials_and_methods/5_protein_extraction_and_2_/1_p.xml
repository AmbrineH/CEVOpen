<p class="p">Cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested from BHI broth, washed in Tris-HCl 50 mM (pH 7.5) and used to generate proteins extracts as described by 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Angelis et al. (2001)</xref>. Equivalent amounts of total protein (60 μg for analytical runs or 200 μg for preparative runs for protein identification) were used for each electrophoretic run. The 2-DE was performed essentially as described by 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Görg et al. (1988)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hochstrasser et al. (1988)</xref> using a Pharmacia 2-D-Electro Focusing (EF) system (GE Healthcare, Milano, Italy). Gels were stained using Brilliant Blue G-Colloidal Concentrate (Sigma) or an MS-compatible silver method. The protein maps were scanned using LabScan on an ImageScanner (GE Healthcare) and were analyzed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum v.6.0 (GE Healthcare). Three gels from three independent experiments were analyzed, and the spot intensities were normalized (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Angelis et al., 2001</xref>), with the spot quantification for each gel calculated as a relative volume (% vol) that corresponded to the volume of each spot divided by the total volume over the entire image. The comparison between different conditions for the amount of the same protein was carried out as the rate of the relative volume of the same spot found in control (untreated cells) and ethanol or other antimicrobials treated cells (
