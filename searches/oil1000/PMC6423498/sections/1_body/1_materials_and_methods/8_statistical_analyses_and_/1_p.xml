Changes in the protein amount (average of three replicates) are represented colorimetrically, with red and green indicating the highest and lowest values of the standardized data, respectively, for each protein of different conditions. All data were shown as a percentage of dissimilarity using Euclidean distance. To study changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes related to the adaptation to different antimicrobial products, all of the identified proteins were mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways using both the enter gene ID and/or EC number functions

The comprehensive symbolic systems biology Pathway Tools (PT) software version 19.0 and the relative encompassed MetaCyc multiorganism database were used to reconstruct the metabolic pathways. The sample differences were normalized at the reaction, pathway and mega-pathway hierarchical levels. The use of custom scripts and manually checking steps allowed us to improve the functional characterization for the EC numbers, KEGG codes, and multiple subunits taking part in the same enzymatic reaction. To track the enzymes in our datasets, we used the REST-style KEGG API to link KEGG and MetaCyc pathways to EC numbers.
