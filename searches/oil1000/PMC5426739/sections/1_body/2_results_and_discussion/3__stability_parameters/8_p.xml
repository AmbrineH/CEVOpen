<p class="p"> Generally, there were no significant increases in AnV until 30 days of storage, but after that it increased in all samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Increase in AnV of oils stored at room temperature was greater than that in the oils kept at refrigerator. Samples containing 15% of flaxseed oil had higher AnV, but it was still lower than for a standard range for common with high stability edible oils.
