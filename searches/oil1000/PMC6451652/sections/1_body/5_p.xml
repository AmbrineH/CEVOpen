<p class="p">Corn roots not only contain feeding stimulants for western corn rootworm larvae, which are a combination of three sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose in specific ratios) plus one free fatty acid (oleic or linoleic acid) (

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bernklau et al. 2016</xref>). In an artificial diet context, corn roots likely contain ingredients that serve as needed micronutrient sources, token stimuli, or cryptic nutrients making natural host plant-derived materials desirable in a diet (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cohen 2015</xref>). Toward the goal of developing an accessible diet for western corn rootworm larvae, we tested the use of corn root powder in diet formulations for western corn rootworm larvae and attempted extracting bioactive factors from corn roots based on an integrated evaluation of three life history parameters (survival, weight, and molting).
