<p class="p">We previously developed an improved artificial diet formulation for western corn rootworm larvae, hereafter referred to as ‘WCRMO-1’ which was an optimization of the composition of ingredients in the initial western corn rootworm formulation (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>). Our improved diet was created by optimizing the key ingredients (corn root powder, wheat germ, and casein) in the initial western corn rootworm formulation based on integrated evaluation of multiple larval developmental traits (weight, survival, and molting). The WCRMO-1 formulation supported approximately 99% of larvae for both molting and survival, and further doubled the weight of larvae compared to larvae reared on the initial western corn rootworm formulation after 11 d of feeding (
