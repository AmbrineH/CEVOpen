<p class="p">Previous research in developing a diet for western corn rootworm larvae documented an important role of corn root powder as a key ingredient in the western corn rootworm diet. It had significant impact on overall larval performance (survival, weight, and molting) (

Specialized equipment including a mill such as the one we use (ZM200, Retsch, Haan, Germany) and lyophilizer such as the benchtop pro (Omnitronics, SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY) is needed to make the powder. This equipment is expensive, limiting the use of corn root powder-based artificial diets for western corn rootworm larvae, and rendering it practically unavailable to smaller companies, academics, and government researchers. Rootworm research would be expedited if all of the ingredients in the rootworm diet could be purchased. The corn root powder used in our original diet (

In this study, we verified that the milling process developed to produce corn root powder at the Biological Control of Insects Research Laboratory (BCIRL) (USDA-ARS, Columbia, MO) could be used with proprietary seed from Monsanto. Further we verified that Viking seed can be substituted for Monsanto proprietary seed milled either by Monsanto or BCIRL.
