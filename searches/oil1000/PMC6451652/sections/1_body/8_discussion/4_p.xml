<p class="p">All diets with differing corn root powder sources supported over 95% of larvae for survival and molting to the second instar to 10 d of feeding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Data for larval weight at 10 d were not available because weight data were only recorded at the end of experiments (15 d). These results suggest the milling process to making corn root powder was not significantly different between Monsanto and BCIRL, and that Viking seed can be substituted for the industry proprietary seed. Interestingly, the differences in the third instar for weight and molting were seen from differing corn root powder. There was an inverse correlation between time of storage and larval performance. Corn root powder from Monsanto seed and Viking seed provided by Monsanto was used at 12 mo and 7 mo of receipt, respectively. The diets with these corn root powders exhibited lower support of larval performance compared to the diets with corn root powder used within 3 mo of storage (
