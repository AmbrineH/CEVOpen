 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>). Our current results revealed that corn root powder alone without the addition of other macronutrient sources (e.g., wheat germ, casein, sucrose, linseed oil, wheat germ oil) failed to develop a diet that supports larval growth successfully compared to a diet with these factors. The maximum amount of corn root powder that was able to add to agar-based corn root powder diets after eliminating several nutritional components (i.e., wheat germ, casein, sucrose, linseed oil, wheat germ oil, cellulose, and salt mix) from the WCRMO-1 (

The drying process may affect nutritional factors such as proteins. Inadequate dietary protein can cause inhibition of larval molting due to insufficient production of ecdysteroid in the hemolymph of larvae in other species (
