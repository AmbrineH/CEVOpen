<p class="p">Our results suggest it is not possible to quickly isolate and identify essential factors in corn roots that assist in growth and development. Several insect species have been reared successfully on artificial diets by adding natural host material into a base diet consisting of major nutritional and textural features (e.g., soy flour, wheat germ, or casein) (

Since corn root powder is the only ingredient in the western corn rootworm formulation that is not commercially available, the identification of the essential corn root factors could assist in formulation of an open access diet for which all of ingredients could be purchased.
