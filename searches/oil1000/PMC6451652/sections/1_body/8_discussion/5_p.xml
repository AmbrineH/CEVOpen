<p class="p">Diet assays for western corn rootworm larvae are typically limited to 10 d (

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ludwick et al. 2018</xref>). Here we extended the bioassay period to 15 d, which allowed the detection of differences in multiple larval development stages. Data collection from the 5-d and 6-d diet bioassays for western corn rootworm initially included larval weight and survival while ignoring the information about molting (

 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Siegfried et al. 2005</xref>). The limited bioassay duration was possibly due to contamination, which was reported as a major issue of diet bioassays (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pereira et al. 2016</xref>). By minimizing contamination through clean laboratory practices as described by 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. (2017)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ludwick et al. (2018)</xref>, the length of diet bioassays for western corn rootworm testing was extended to 10 d (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ludwick et al. 2018</xref>) or 11 d (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>), which allowed the determination of differences in larval performance (weight, molt, and survival) to the second instar. In this study, we observed &lt;1% contamination during all experiments. Similarly, low contamination rates were reported in 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. (2017)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ludwick et al. (2018)</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meihls et al. (2018)</xref>. The ability to conduct an extended bioassay would facilitate experiments that require longer periods (e.g., dsRNA) and would also allow for continuous rearing of western corn rootworm which optimizes labor and other costs for rearing while avoiding possible physical damage and contamination due to larval manual transfers.
