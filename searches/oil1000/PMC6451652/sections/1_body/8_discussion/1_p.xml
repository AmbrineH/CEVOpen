<p class="p">We demonstrated that factors from corn roots significantly increase survivorship, larval weight, and molting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Adding corn root powder, dry corn roots, or even remnant roots after extraction to a base diet for western corn rootworm significantly improved all measured developmental traits of larval performance compared to larvae reared on the diet without corn roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Overall, dry roots and extracted roots were better than the methanolic extracts of these roots, although there was no significant difference between the extract and the same mass of the corn root tissue from which they were extracted when evaluating molting to the second instar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>). Larval survivorship, weight, and molting to the third instar were better with extracted corn root remnants than with the methanolic extracts, indicating that the solvent did not extract all relevant nutrients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">b</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">e</xref>). Corn root powder was better than the dried corn roots for most factors evaluated, but may or may not have been directly comparable because these samples were made from different drying methods.
