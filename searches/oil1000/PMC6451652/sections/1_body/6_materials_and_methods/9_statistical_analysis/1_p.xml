<p class="p">The experiments were designed as a randomized complete block design. Each formulation tested (treatment) was randomly assigned in a 12-well row of the 96-well plate and replicated at least four times in different diet plates. Each group of 12 larvae (replication) was randomly assigned a different row within each 96-well plate (1 larva per well). The plates were randomly assigned a different portion of a growth chamber. The block (the plate) was considered as a specific portion of the growth chamber. Each group of 12 larvae per plate was used to calculate percentages of survival and molting for that block or replication. Live larvae per each block were pooled and were averaged to calculate larval weight for that block. Larval performance (larval survival, weight, molt to second instar, incomplete molt to second instar, and molt to third instar) was analyzed as a randomized complete block design using PROC MIXED in SAS.</p>
