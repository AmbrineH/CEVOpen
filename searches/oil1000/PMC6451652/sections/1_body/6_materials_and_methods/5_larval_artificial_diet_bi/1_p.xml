<p class="p">Bioassays were conducted as described in 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. (2017)</xref>. All materials used in larval handling were sterilized via exposure to UV light for 10 min in a biological cabinet. One neonate larva (&lt;24 h after hatching) was infested to each well using a fine paintbrush (size #00). A sealing film (TSS-RTQ-100, Excel Scientific, Inc., Victorville, CA) was used to cover the plate and one hole per well for exchange air ventilation was made using an insect pin (size #0). The plates were kept at 25°C in darkness for 15 d. Larval weight, survival, and evidence of diet contamination were recorded at 15 d. For dry weight, surviving larvae were collected and pooled per replicate into 95% ethanol, and then dried at 50°C for 2 d in an oven (602752, Blue M Therm Dry Bacteriological Incubator). Dry larvae for each replicate were weighed using a micro balance (MSU6.6S-000-DM, Sartorius Lab Instruments GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Goettingen, Germany). To determine differences in larval molting to second instar and third instar, larval molting to second instar was recorded at 10 d and larval molting to third instar, and larval incomplete molting to second instar (defined as an inability to complete removal of larval skin) were recorded at 15 d.
