<p class="p">Untreated, dry Viking seeds (Viking 60-01N, Albert Lea Seed, Albert Lea, MN) were soaked for 24 h in tap water, rinsed, and germinated on moist blotter paper (Steel Blue, Anchor Paper Company, St. Paul, MN). Germinating seeds were kept at 25°C in closed polyethylene containers (20 × 40 × 5 cm). Roots (6 g fresh weight) were harvested from 5-d-old germinating seeds, placed in a 150-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and 100 ml of methanol (HPLC grade, A452-1, Fisher Scientific) was added. After 1 h, the liquid was filtered (Whatman no. 1, 1004-090, Springfield Mill, Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom) into a 500-ml round bottom flask and the extract was concentrated to approximately 1 ml using a rotary evaporator. The concentrated liquid was transferred to a clean glass vial (4 ml, 66011-041, VWR International, West Chester, PA), the flask was rinsed twice with 1.5 ml methanol to collect remaining residue from the walls of the flask and the rinses were added to the concentrated solution. The extract was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen to remove the methanol (approximately 0.5 ml final volume). The extracted roots were air-dried overnight, weighed, and the extract concentration was adjusted (with methanol) to 0.1 g equivalents dry root per ml. Agar (5 g, A7002, Sigma-Aldrich) was placed in a glass container and the extract (2.5 ml total) was added 0.5 ml at a time, shaking well after each addition. The agar treated with extracted corn roots was spread out on a Teflon sheet and allowed to dry 48 h before being stored in an air-tight container.</p>
