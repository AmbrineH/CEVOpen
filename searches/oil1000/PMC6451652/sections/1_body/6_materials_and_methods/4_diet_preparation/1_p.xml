 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. (2017)</xref>. All dry ingredients, i.e., casein (1100, Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ), cholesterol (C8503, Sigma-Aldrich), cellulose (3425, Bio-Serv), corn root powder (BCIRL and Monsanto), methyl paraben (H5501, Sigma-Aldrich), salt mix (F8680, Bio-Serv), sorbic acid (S1626, Sigma-Aldrich), sucrose (04821721, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), vitamin mix (V1007, Sigma-Aldrich), and wheat germ (1661, Bio-Serv), were weighed and put in a plastic bag, except for agar (A7002, Sigma-Aldrich). Agar solution (agar plus distilled water) in a 600-ml beaker was boiled in a microwave for 2 min, and then poured into a blender (Hamilton Beach, Inc., Model 51101BZ) in a biosafety cabinet (Nuaire, Plymouth, MN). The dry ingredients were added into the blender and mixed thoroughly for 30 s. Next, liquid components, i.e., linseed oil (430021, Sigma-Aldrich), wheat germ oil (W1000, Sigma-Aldrich), streptomycin (612240500, Across, Morris Plains, NJ), chlortetracycline (C4881, Sigma-Aldrich), and green food coloring (Bulter, Lancaster, PA), were added into the blender and mixed thoroughly for 30 s. The pH of the diet was titrated to pH of 9 by an addition of KOH 10% (w/v) (P250, Fisher Scientific) and monitored using indicator strips (Whatman). The diet mixture was then poured into a low-sided 700-ml beaker placed on a hot plate (Cimarec, Thermo Scientific) at 65°C and mixed using a stir bar. The mixture was dispensed into a 96-well plate (3370, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) using a repeater pipette (200 µl per well) (Eppendorf repeater plus). The diet plate was kept in a biological cabinet for 10 min to allow excess moisture to evaporate, then stored in a refrigerator at 4°C and used for assays within a week. Bio-Serv has sold their insect diets to Frontier Agricultural Sciences and all Bio-Serv ingredients can be found at
