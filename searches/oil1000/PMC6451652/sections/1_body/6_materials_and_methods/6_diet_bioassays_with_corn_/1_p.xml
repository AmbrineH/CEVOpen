<p class="p">To determine if essential nutrients in corn roots could be extracted, the WCRMO-1 diet (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>) was modified. The WCRMO-1 diet includes 17 diet ingredients (e.g., casein, cellulose, wheat germ, vitamin mix, salt mix, oil components, and preservatives) plus corn root powder. In formulations with dry corn root, extracted corn roots, and corn root powder, these ingredients were added to WCRMO-1 diet without corn root powder at the level of 1.5% (w/w), the same proportion of corn root powder in the WCRMO-1 diet. Other ingredients were the same as in the WCRMO-1 formulation (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>). In a formulation with agar treated with extracts from corn roots, the treated agar containing methanolic root extract was added at the level of 1.5% (w/w) to the WCRMO-1 diet without corn root powder and agar. Other ingredients of this formulation were the same as in the WCRMO-1 formulation, except for an increase in proportion of water by 1.5% (w/w). The original diet containing corn root powder was used as a control and all treatments were tested for their effect on larval performance (survival, weight, and molting).
