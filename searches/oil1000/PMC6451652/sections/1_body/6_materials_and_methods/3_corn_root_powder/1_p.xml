<p class="p">In order to evaluate both the milling process and the maize lines, corn root powder was produced by Monsanto and was also produced by the BCIRL (USDA-ARS). Each milling operation used both Monsanto proprietary seed and Viking seed to do so. Corn root powder provided by Monsanto from Viking seed and Monsanto seed was used 7 mo and 12 mo after receipt, respectively, whereas corn root powder made by BCIRL from Viking seed and Monsanto seed was used 3 mo and 1 mo, respectively, after being produced. All were stored at −20°C until use. Briefly, at BCIRL, corn seeds (500 g) were washed in 1,000 ml beaker via exposure to 6% NaClO (10% Clorox Regular Bleach, Clorox, Oakland, CA) solution plus 0.01% Tween 20 (BP337, Fisher Scientific) for 15 min, triple rinsed with distilled water, and then incubated at 24°C for 24 h. The seeds were placed in a straight line on top of germination paper (SD3815L, Anchor Paper Company) with 50 seeds per paper and the paper was folded over the seeds, rolled tightly, and secured with a rubber band below the seed line to make a ‘bundle’. The bundles were placed with the seed at the top in a 5-gallon bucket (40 bundles per bucket) containing distilled water to encourage downward growth of root tissue. The bucket was kept in an incubator at 27°C with RH of 70% and watered every 2 d. After 7 d, corn roots were collected by cutting the bundles below the rubber band with a guillotine-type paper cutter. The corn roots were then cut into pieces less than 2 cm using a cutter (27K0020, American Metalcraft, Inc., Franklin Park, IL), placed in a tray, immediately frozen at −80°C, and then dried in a lyophilizer (benchtop pro with omnitronics, SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY) at −70°C for 7 d. After 7 d of lyophilizing, the dry roots were milled into powder using an ultra-centrifugal mill (ZM200, Retsch, Haan, Germany) at 14,500 rpm.</p>
