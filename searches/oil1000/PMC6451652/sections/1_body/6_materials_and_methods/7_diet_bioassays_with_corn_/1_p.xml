<p class="p">Corn root powder was previously demonstrated as the key ingredient that was used in combination with major nutritional components (e.g., wheat germ, casein, sucrose, linseed oils) (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynh et al. 2017</xref>). To determine if changing corn root powder alone while eliminating other macronutrient sources could be used for western corn rootworm larval growth, we varied corn root powder at varying concentrations namely, 0, 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 10% w/w and added vitamin mix, diet preservatives, food coloring, agar, and water. Other nutritional components (wheat germ, casein, sucrose, and lipid components) were excluded. The maximum concentration of corn root powder in these agar-based diets was 10% w/w. The amount of other ingredients were the same in the WCRMO-1 diet (
