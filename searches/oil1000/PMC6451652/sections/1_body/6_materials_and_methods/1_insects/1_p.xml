<p class="p">Western corn rootworm eggs (a nondiapausing strain) were obtained from the USDA-ARS laboratories in Columbia, MO and Brooking, SD. Egg plates (western corn rootworm eggs in Petri dishes with 70 mesh sieved soil) were incubated in an incubator at 25°C in complete darkness. Once the first hatch of eggs was initiated, the soil was removed by rinsing with water in a 60-mesh sieve (Hogentogler &amp; Co. Inc., Columbia, MD). The eggs free of soil were poured into a beaker and surface-treated using a procedure described by 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pleau et al. (2002)</xref>. Briefly, the eggs were exposed to undiluted Lysol (Reckitt Benckiser, LLC, Parsippany, NJ) for 3 min, and then triple rinsed with distilled water after removing undiluted Lysol. Next, the eggs were treated with 10% formalin (HT501128, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 min, and then triple rinsed with distilled water after removing formalin. Finally, the eggs were distributed to a coffee filter paper (Pure Brew, Rockline Industries, Sheboygan, WI) using a 1-ml disposable pipette (13-711-9a, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA). The coffee paper was dried for 2 min and then placed inside a 16-oz cup with a lid (LG8RB-0090 &amp; DM16R-0090, Solo Cup Company, Lake Forest, IL). For ventilation, several holes were made in the lid using a number zero insect pin. The egg container was kept at 25°C in darkness. Neonates (within 24 h and hatching within 2 d) were used for insect bioassays.
