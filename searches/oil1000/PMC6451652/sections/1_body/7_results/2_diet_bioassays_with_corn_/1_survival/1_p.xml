<p class="p">Diets containing 1.5% corn root powder in combination with other macronutrients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) had close to 100% survivorship, which was higher than the larval survivorship on the diets containing only corn root powder as the major nutritional source (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). When corn root powder was utilized as the main nutrient source of diets, an increase in proportions of the powder resulted in a significant improvement in survival (

No larvae survived when reared on diets with corn root powder at 0 and 1% while only 4.1% larvae survived on a diet with 1.5% corn root powder to 15 d. Diets with corn root powder at 6 and 10% had greater larval survival compared to the other diets tested (
