<p class="p">Larval survivorship to 15 d was high on all diets with corn root powder produced from different seeds or millers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>) and there were no significant differences in survivorship among all diets (

 <sub class="sub">3, 21</sub> = 1.75). For larval dry weight at 15 d, there were no significant differences among the diets with Viking seed milled by BCIRL or Monsanto and the diet with Monsanto seed milled by BCIRL. The diet with Monsanto seed milled by Monsanto had significantly lower larval weight (0.52 mg per larva) than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0028, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3, 21</sub> = 6.49), which ranged from 0.67 mg per larva to 0.78 mg per larva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>). Percentages of larvae molted to the second instar within 10 d on all diets were high, ranging from 95.1 to 97.5%. There was no significant difference between diets (

 <sub class="sub">3, 21</sub> = 0.34) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3c</xref>). The percentages of larvae molted to the third instar within 15 d were significantly different among diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0191, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3, 21</sub> = 4.12). The diet with Monsanto seed milled by BCIRL produced significantly more third instar larvae compared to the diets with Monsanto and Viking seeds milled by Monsanto, whereas the percentage of the third instar larvae reared on the diet with Viking seed milled by BCIRL was significantly higher than that for the diet with Monsanto seed milled by Monsanto (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3d</xref>). Overall, the diets differing in corn root powder sources exhibited no significant difference in larval survivorship to 15 d and molting to the second instar. The differences were seen in larval weight and molting to the third instar after 15 d of feeding. Corn root powder made by BCIRL from Monsanto seed and Viking seed was used 1 mo and 3 mo after being produced, respectively, while corn root powder provided by Monsanto from Monsanto seed and Viking seed was used at 12 mo and 7 mo after received, respectively (stored at −20°C).
