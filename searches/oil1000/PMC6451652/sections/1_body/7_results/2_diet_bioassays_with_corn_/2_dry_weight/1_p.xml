<p class="p">Larval dry weight at 15 d exhibited a sigmoid response, which is typical of dose response, ranging from 0.001 mg per larva for the diet with 1.5% corn root powder up to 0.012 mg per larva for the diet with 6% corn root powder (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>). This was a 12-fold increase, but still at least 43-fold lower when compared to larvae feeding on a diet with corn root powder combined with other macronutrient ingredients (e.g., wheat germ, casein, sucrose) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). Diets with corn root powder at 6 and 10% had significantly higher larval weight than lower percent corn root powder (
