 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">EPA 2016</xref>). Diet toxicity assays can be used as a tool for evaluating resistance. An artificial diet is a critical component of diet toxicity assays. An artificial diet capable of supporting larval growth and development that is similar to larvae reared on corn roots would be greatly beneficial for research programs and continuous rearing for western corn rootworm.
