<p class="p">The first artificial diet for western corn rootworm larvae was developed by

The southern corn rootworm is a generalist feeding on over 100 different plants while western corn rootworm, from a practical standpoint, is nearly monophagous on corn roots, but can survive on a number of different grass species (

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pleau et al. (2002)</xref> developed an initial formulation for western corn rootworm larvae by modifying the southern corn rootworm formulation to include corn root powder, removing formalin, and altering concentrations of several other ingredients including wheat germ, linseed oil, and potassium hydroxide. The initial western corn rootworm formulation doubled larval weight gain when compared to larvae reared on the southern corn rootworm formulation (
