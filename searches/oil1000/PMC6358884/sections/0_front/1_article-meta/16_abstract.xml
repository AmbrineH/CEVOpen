 <p class="p">In this research, the leaves of 
  <italic class="italic">Lepechinia heteromorpha</italic> (Briq.) Epling, 
  <italic class="italic">Lepechinia radula</italic> (Benth.) Epling and 
  <italic class="italic">Lepechinia paniculata</italic> (Kunth) Epling have been collected in order to perform a phytochemical study. The first species was distilled to obtain a novel essential oil (EO), while the others were submitted to ethyl acetate extraction and secondary metabolite isolation. The chemical composition of the EO from 
  <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic> has been investigated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with Retention Indices (GC(RI)), identifying 25 constituents. A major compound, (−)-ledol (21.2%), and a minor compound, (−)-caryophyllene oxide (1.0%), were isolated from the EO and their structures confirmed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Other major constituents of the EO were viridiflorene (27.3%), (
  <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-α-farnesene (1.4%), spirolepechinene and (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (7.1% each), 
  <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-aromadendrene (6.1%), camphor (1.7%), limonene (1.3%) and β-phellandrene (4.6%). The enantiomeric composition of the EO monoterpene fraction was also studied, determining the enantiomeric excess and distribution of α-pinene, limonene, β-phellandrene and camphor. The ethyl acetate extract of 
  <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L. paniculata</italic> were fractionated by column chromatography. Spathulenol, angustanoic acid E and 5-hydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxy flavone were isolated from 
  <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic> extract; ledol, guaiol and (−)-carnosol were found in 
  <italic class="italic">L. paniculata.</italic>
