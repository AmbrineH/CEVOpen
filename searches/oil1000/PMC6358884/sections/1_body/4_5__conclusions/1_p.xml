<p class="p">This is the first phytochemical study on the EO obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic>, and on the metabolic composition of the ethyl acetate extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. paniculata</italic>. The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic> was qualitatively and quantitatively characterized and mainly consisted of 27 compounds (including two undetermined), most of them being sesquiterpenoids (63.9%). A major sesquiterpene alcohol, (−)-ledol (21.2%), and a minor sesquiterpene epoxide, (−)-caryophyllene oxide (1.0%), were isolated and their structures confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Other major components were viridiflorene (27.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-α-farnesene (1.4%), ledol (21.2%), spirolepechinene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (7.1% each), 
 <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-aromadendrene (6.1%), camphor (1.7%), limonene (1.3 %) and β-phellandrene (4.6%).
