<p class="p">An amount of 1.4 g of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. hereromorpha</italic> was submitted to normal phase column chromatography (silica gel). A weight ratio of 1:100 between sample and stationary phase was applied. The elution was achieved isocratically, with a mixture of hexane/dichloromethane 40:60, collecting fractions of 10 mL. The pooled fraction containing sesquiterpenoids (469.2 mg) was again fractionated on normal phase CC to achieve a better purification of the major constituent, with a sample/stationary phase ratio of 1:200 by weight and an isocratic elution (hexane/dichloromethane 50:50). Fractions of 15 mL were collected, from where two compounds were isolated and identified: ledol (459.0 mg) and caryophyllene oxide (8.1 mg). The optical activity of both compounds was determined to be levorotatory.
