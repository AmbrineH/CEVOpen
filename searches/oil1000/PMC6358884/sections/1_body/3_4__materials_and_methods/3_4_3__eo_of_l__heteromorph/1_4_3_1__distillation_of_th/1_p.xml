<p class="p">Four samples of 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic> fresh leaves (1.50, 1.51, 1.63 and 1.50 kg, respectively) were distilled for 4 h in four stainless steel Clevenger-type apparatus. The distillates had to be recovered with a solvent because of their very high viscosity. Hence, 100 ml of dichloromethane, spiked with isopropyl hexanoate as internal standard, were added to the aqueous phase. The separated organic phase was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate for 30 min and directly analysed without solvent evaporation. The yield was calculated analytically, as a mean value of the four distillations.
