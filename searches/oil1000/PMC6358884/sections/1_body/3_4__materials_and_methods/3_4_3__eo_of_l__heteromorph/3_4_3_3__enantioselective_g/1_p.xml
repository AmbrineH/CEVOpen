<p class="p">The enantioselective GC analysis was run with the following oven temperature program: 60 °C for 5 min, a gradient of 2 °C/min up to 220 °C, hold for 2 min. Injection and MS conditions were the same as those reported in the previous paragraph. The elution order of the separated enantiomers was determined by injection of enantiomerically pure standards, available in the laboratory of one of the authors (C.B.).</p>
