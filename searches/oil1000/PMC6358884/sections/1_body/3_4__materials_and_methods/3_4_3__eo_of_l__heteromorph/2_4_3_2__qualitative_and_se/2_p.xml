<p class="p">The semi-quantitative analysis was performed by GC-FID, with the same method and instrumental configuration described for GC(RI). The quantification was achieved by internal calibration, calculating the relative response factor (RRF) of each constituent, referred to the internal standard, on the basis of its combustion enthalpy [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Isopropyl hexanoate, instead of the methyl octanoate reported in the literature, was chosen as internal standard for this application. This approximation is justified by the principle that the RRF, for isomeric compounds analysed in FID, is about equal to 1 because the combustion enthalpy only depends on the molecular formula.
