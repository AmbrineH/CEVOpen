<p class="p">Each sample was analysed by GC(RI), injecting 1 µl of the previously described EO solution in split mode (40:1), with the injector set at 220 °C. The following oven temperature program was used: 60 °C for 5 min, a gradient of 3 °C/min until 180 °C, then a gradient of 15 °C/min up to 250 °C, held for 5 min. The linear retention index (LRI) was calculated for each chromatographic peak, according to Van Den Dool and Kratz [

 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> for compounds purified after solvent extraction, with a 3 min solvent delay. The carrier gas was maintained at the constant flow of 1 ml/min. The EO components were identified by comparison of the respective EIMS spectra and LRIs to those stored in a reference library [
