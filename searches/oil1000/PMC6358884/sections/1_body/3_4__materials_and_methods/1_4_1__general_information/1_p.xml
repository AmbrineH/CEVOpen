<p class="p">The GC(RI) analyses were carried out with an Agilent Technology (Wilmington, DE, USA) 6890N gas chromatograph, coupled to an Agilent Technology single quadrupole mass spectrometer, series 5973 INERT. The ion source was an Electron Impact (EIMS) at 70 eV. Samples were injected with an automatic split/splitless injector, series 7683. The instrument was equipped with a DB-5MS (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane) Agilent 122-5532 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm of film thickness).</p>
