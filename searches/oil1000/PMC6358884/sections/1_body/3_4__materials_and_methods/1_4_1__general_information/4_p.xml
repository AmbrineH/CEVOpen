<p class="p">For preparative column chromatography (CC), silica gel 60, particle size 0.063â€“0.200 mm (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), was used as stationary phase. Normal phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates, with fluorescence indicator at 254 nm, were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). After exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light (254 and 366 nm), the plates were revealed with a sulphuric acid/vanillin based reactive.</p>
