<p class="p">The organic solvents, used for CC and TLC, were purchased from Brenntag (Guayaquil, Ecuador) and carefully distilled before using. For GC applications and optical activity, the solvents were analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich. The specific rotatory power was measured in an automatic polarimeter (Jinan Hanon Instruments Co. Ltd., Jinan, China) model MRC P810. The chiral standards for the enantioselective analysis were provided, as original samples, by one of the authors (C.B.)</p>
