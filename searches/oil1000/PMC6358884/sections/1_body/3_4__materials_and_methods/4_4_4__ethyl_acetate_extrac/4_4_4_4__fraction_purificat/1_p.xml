<p class="p">A normal phase CC was performed with 1.6 g of chlorophyll-free ethyl acetate extract, over 160 g of silica gel. The sample was eluted with a mixture of hexane/ethyl acetate, according to an increasing polarity gradient, from 95:5 to pure ethyl acetate, collecting volumes of about 10 mL. A total of 297 fractions were obtained and then pooled into 18 fractions, according to their qualitative composition in TLC. Purified fraction 7 (3.5 mg) appeared to be a mixture, containing two inseparable major compounds that were identified as ledol (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>) and guaiol (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>) after GC(RI) analysis.
