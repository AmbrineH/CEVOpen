<p class="p">Both species, 
 <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. paniculata</italic>, were submitted to the same extraction process. 300 g of dry leaves were crushed and submitted to room temperature solvent extraction. The plant material was macerated in ethyl acetate for two hours; this operation was repeated three times with fresh solvent, to obtain an almost exhaustive extraction. The resulting solutions were pooled and the solvent removed by vacuum distillation at 30–35 °C, affording 20.2 g dry extract for 
 <italic class="italic">L. paniculata</italic> and 12.1 g for 
 <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic>.
