<p class="p">A normal phase CC was carried out with 1.0 g of chlorophyll-free ethyl acetate extract, over 100 g of silica gel. The sample was eluted with a mixture of hexane/ethyl acetate, according to an increasing eluotropic strength gradient, from 90:10 to pure ethyl acetate, collecting volumes of about 10 mL. Fractions with similar TLC composition were pooled in 18 different samples and evaporated under vacuum. Further normal phase chromatographic fractionation of these fractions, under similar elution conditions and stationary phase ratio, provided spathulenol (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, 1.5 mg), angustanoic acid E (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>, 8.0 mg) and 5-hydroxy-4â€²,7-dimethoxy flavone (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>, 5.1 mg).
