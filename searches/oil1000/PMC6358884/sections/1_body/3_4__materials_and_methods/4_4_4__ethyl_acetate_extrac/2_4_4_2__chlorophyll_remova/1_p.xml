<p class="p">Chlorophylls were removed from the extracts by selective absorption on C18 reversed phase. A vacuum funnel, equipped with a syntherized glass septum, was packed with C18 reversed phase suspended in pure methanol. The ratio sample/stationary phase was 1:10 by weight. After packing, the organic solvent was completely removed by washing with a great excess of a mixture CH

 <italic class="italic">L. radula</italic>. The extract (3.0 g) was then processed by dissolving it in a suitable volume of the same hydro-methanolic mixture used to condition the stationary phase. The whole volume was then eluted under vacuum over the funnel, obtaining a quantitative retention of chlorophylls. Finally, the stationary phase was washed with a large excess of pure methanol, followed by pure ethyl acetate. The resulting solutions were controlled by reversed phase TLC with pure methanol as eluent, to ensure the absence of compounds of interest retained with the chlorophylls.
