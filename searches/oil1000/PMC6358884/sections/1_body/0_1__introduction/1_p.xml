<p class="p">Ecuador is one of the seventeen mega-biodiverse countries in the world [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is a great source of new natural products, since most of the botanical species have never been studied before for their secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Furthermore, Ecuador hosts many indigenous cultures, maintaining an ancestral knowledge that includes traditional medicine. In recent years, this cultural heritage has often been investigated to select interesting botanical targets, in particular to find new biologically active compounds. The secondary metabolites can be classified as volatile or non-volatile. If the volatile fraction is isolated by steam distillation, it is an essential oil (EO). From a qualitative point of view, EOs are often mixtures of known compounds; however, their quantitative composition can be very different from species to species. The quali-quantitative composition of an EO is responsible for its sensorial and biological properties. Furthermore, several components in an EO are chiral compounds and they are often present as pure enantiomers or in an enantiomeric excess and, seldom, in racemic form [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Since the enantiomers of a chiral compound may have different biological and sensorial properties [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], the recognition of chiral compounds by enantioselective GC is a useful but seldom applied step in the chemical study of a plant EO fraction [
