<p class="p">In the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic>, 25 constituents were identified and quantified. Major components were viridiflorene (27.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-α-farnesene (1.4%), ledol (21.2%), spirolepechinene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (7.1% each), 
 <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-aromadendrene (6.1%), camphor (1.7%), limonene (1.3%) and β-phellandrene (4.6%). Sesquiterpenoids were the main fraction of the EO, accounting for about 85% of the whole sample. In particular, (−)-ledol is the only sesquiterpene alcohol in the EO. Its abundance (21.2%) makes this EO a good source of this compound in a seemingly pure enantiomeric form, easy to isolate by normal phase liquid chromatography. Enantioselective GC showed that only α-pinene and β-phellandrene were present with an enantiomeric excess, the others monoterpenes seemed to present as pure enantiomers. However, with the exception of (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-camphor and (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-limonene, it was not possible to attribute the absolute configuration to others enantiomers because of the unavailability of reference standards. Concerning caryophyllene oxide, it has sometimes been considered an artefact, produced by spontaneous oxidation and indicating the aging of the EO. However, in this case, we are inclined to consider it as an original component, as the fraction was properly stored and analysed soon after distillation.
