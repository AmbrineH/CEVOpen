<p class="p">In a previous work [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], some of the authors compared the major constituents of the EOs obtained from many 
 <italic class="italic">Lepechinia</italic> spp. From this comparison, a common qualitative and quantitative profile did not emerge and an almost equal contribution from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes was observed. The most common constituent was δ-3-carene, present in seven of 14 species, followed by (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene that was observed in five. In this respect, 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic> EO did not contain δ-3-carene but showed the presence of abundant (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (about 7.1%). Other major constituents, described at least in two species, were borneol, β-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, ledol, α-pinene and β-pinene. Except for borneol, 1,8-cineole and camphor, all the other compounds were detected in 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic>. A more accurate comparison was performed between the EOs from flowers and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic>, where important quantitative differences were observed [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In fact, while monoterpene fraction was prevalent in flowers (about 55.5% of the whole EO), sesquiterpenes were dominant in leaves (63.2%). However, in both cases a sesquiterpene alcohol was the relative major constituent, being eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol the most abundant in flowers (13.0%) and shyobunol in leaves (10.8%). The situation was quite different for 
 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic>, where most of the compounds detected in 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> were absent. In fact, although its EO was mainly composed of sesquiterpenes (85.0%), it presented only a total of 26 detected metabolites, against about 80 compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">L. mutica</italic> flowers and leaves.
