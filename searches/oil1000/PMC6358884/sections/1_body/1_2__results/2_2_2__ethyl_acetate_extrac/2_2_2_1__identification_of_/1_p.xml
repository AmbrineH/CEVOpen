<p class="p">Spathulenol (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>) is a quite common sesquiterpene alcohol, obtained by normal phase fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract. The resulting white solid was identified as spathulenol by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, electron impact mass spectrometry (EIMS), and GC(RI). LRI is referred to the homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes on a DB-5 column (LRI = 1583). All spectroscopic and gas chromatographic data were in agreement with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Neither 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR nor specific rotatory power experiments were run because of the small amount obtained.
