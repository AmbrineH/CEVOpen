 <italic class="italic">L. heteromorpha</italic> was a yellowish waxy solid, easily melted at low temperatures. Due to its physical state, it was recovered dissolving it in dichloromethane and the yield of each distillation was determined through semi-quantitative Gas Chromatographic analysis with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The resulting average yield was 0.06 ± 0.029 % (
