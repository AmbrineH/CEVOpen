<p class="p">The sesquiterpene fraction of an EO is often very complex and the characterization of single components through preparative isolation and spectroscopic elucidation is usually recommended. The common way is by preparative column chromatography, on normal or reversed phase, followed by NMR and MS experiments. The main problem in achieving this result is the very similar polarity of the isomeric terpenes, which usually does not permit an efficient preparative separation. In the case of our EO, only ledol and caryophyllene oxide could be separated and purified by liquid chromatography, due to the different relative polarity.</p>
