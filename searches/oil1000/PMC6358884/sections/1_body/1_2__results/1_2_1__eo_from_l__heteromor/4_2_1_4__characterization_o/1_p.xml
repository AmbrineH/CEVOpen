<p class="p">During the purification process of compound (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), a second minor sesquiterpene was obtained as a by-product, and it was identified as caryophyllene oxide (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>) by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR experiments [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Its amount and purity were not sufficient to measure reliably the specific rotatory power; however, it showed to be levorotatory. According to 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, the purity of compound (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>) can be estimated of about 85%.
