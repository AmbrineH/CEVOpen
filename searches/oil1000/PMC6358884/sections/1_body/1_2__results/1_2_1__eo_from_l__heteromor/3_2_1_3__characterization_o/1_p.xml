<p class="p">(−)-Ledol (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) is the only sesquiterpene alcohol present in this EO, counting for more than 21% of the total analysis. Its molecular structure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00001" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref>. In order to set up the preparative purification method, four fractions of increasing polarity were previously obtained by normal phase preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC), indicated with numbers from 1 to 4. These fractions were analysed under the same conditions as those adopted for the GC-MS analysis of the total oil. From the GC-MS patterns of the resulting fractions, it can be observed that fraction 3 mainly consists of (−)-ledol (see
