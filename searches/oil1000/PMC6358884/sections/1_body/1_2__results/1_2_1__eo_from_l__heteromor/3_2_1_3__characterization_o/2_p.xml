<p class="p">After column chromatography (CC) fractionation, a sample of (−)-ledol was obtained, whose molecular structure was confirmed by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR. The resulting spectroscopic data were identical to those reported in the literature. Also the specific rotatory power was consistent with the value of literature for (−)-ledol [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, the purity of compound (1) can be estimated of about 95%.
