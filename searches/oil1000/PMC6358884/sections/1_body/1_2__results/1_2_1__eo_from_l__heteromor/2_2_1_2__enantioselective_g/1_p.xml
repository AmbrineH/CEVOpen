<p class="p">The recognition of chiral components in the EO was carried out with an enantioselective GC column, coated with 2,3-diacethyl-6-tert-butylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector. The enantiomers of α-pinene, β-phellandrene and the enantiomerically pure (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-limonene and (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-camphor were recognized. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-aromadendrene was probably present in two enantiomeric forms, however, its configuration was not attributed because of the lack of the reference standard of at least one enantiomer. The percentage enantiomeric distribution and enantiomeric excess (
 <italic class="italic">ee</italic>) of the identified enantiomers are shown in
