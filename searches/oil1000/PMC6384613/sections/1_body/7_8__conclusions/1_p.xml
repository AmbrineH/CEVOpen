<p class="p">Biopolymers, considered as green polymeric matrices or plastics realized from natural feedstock by synthetic routes, frequently have poorer characteristics and performances in respect to traditional polymeric matrices. One route to be monitored for achieving characteristic combinations necessary for the packaging sector is their blending, in the presence or not of nanosized fillers. The present review underlined how hybrid blends containing renewable polymers, in concurrence with synthetic polymers and additives, have great potential in enhancing the moisture and gas barrier properties of bio-based materials, and how they are not economically practicable to be utilized without polymeric blends with low-priced plastics of comparable necessary characteristics. On the other hand, the overall performance of polymeric blends is undoubtedly correlated to blend compositions and phase morphologies that need to be optimized by using compatibilization methods or a nanocomposite approach. In order to consider their potentials and enter new markets, other than the packaging sector where a feeble interest has already risen, scientific research should strongly focus its efforts on extending their use and improving general performance in other parallel or different sectors.</p>
