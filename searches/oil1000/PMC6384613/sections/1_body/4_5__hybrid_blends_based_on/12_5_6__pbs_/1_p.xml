<p class="p">PBS is a costly polymer with limited mechanical properties, consequently it is not good for final use. Because polyethylene terephthalate is a material that is hardly degradable by microorganisms, the possible blending of PET with PBS could enhance the disintegrability of a non-degradable matrix in the blend. Threepopnatkul et al. [
 <xref rid="B259-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">259</xref>] found that PET/PBS blends were totally immiscible. At the same time, an overall decrease of tensile properties, such as strength, modulus, and elongation at break, in the presence of PBS, in comparison with neat PET thin film, was measured. In the case of blending with polyolefins, due to the fact that HDPE has comparable mechanical properties with PBS, the blending of these two matrices not only modified the cost but also improved the overall mechanical performance of the final blend. Aontee et al. [
 <xref rid="B172-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>] found that a HDPE and PBS blend was immiscible, showing many different morphologies depending on HDPE content (from spherical domain to worm-like and elongated structure, up to coalescence;, moreover, it was observed that yielding and breaking strength gradually decreased with increasing HDPE content. The use of PVC was recently considered by Chuayjuljit et al. [
 <xref rid="B260-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">260</xref>], who designed how to recover the stiffness and induce degradability of poly(vinyl chloride) by inserting poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) in the blends: The obtained blends (from 10 to 50 wt % of PBS phase) showed an increase in the impact strength, elongation at break, and inclination to biodegrade when compared to the neat PVC, only with increasing content of the biodegradable PBS phase.
