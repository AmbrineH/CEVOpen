<p class="p">A limited number of papers discussed the blending of bio-based polyolefins, and only one example was found with bio-based PLA. As reported in Brito et al. [
 <xref rid="B262-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">262</xref>], the authors investigated the effect of ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA) and ethylene-methyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate (EMA-GMA) copolymers as compatibilizer agents in PLA/Bio-PE blend. The data underlined that the use of the E-GMA and EMA-GMA copolymers significantly enhanced the impact strength of the PLA/Bio-PE blend, thanks to the reaction between hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in PLA and the epoxy groups in the copolymer matrices.
