<p class="p">Data provided by the literature include evaluation of properties of melt-blended PET containing small amounts of PLA, or blends containing greater amounts of PLA obtained by solution casting: These polymeric blends are characterized by reduced mechanical properties in relationship to the high content of PLA in PET, making it unappealing for industrial use [
 <xref rid="B245-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. The main reasons for these reductions can be found in: (a) PET processing temperature (∼260–300 °C), well over the melting temperature of PLA (∼160 °C), causing the PLA degradation and chain scission during blend compounding; and (b) no miscibility of the two polymeric matrices, which has been observed even for blends containing only small contents of PLA (5 wt %) [
 <xref rid="B246-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. The different polarity is also in charge of the limited compatibility of PLA with polyolefins; therefore, it is common to add a compatibilizer, such as polyethylene-grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MAH), in order to increase the characteristics of blends [
 <xref rid="B247-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>]. Alternatively, taking into account difficulties that need to be overcome in processing, modification by selecting a less expensive polymer, like PVC, is quite limited, so PLA, and a few numbers of articles concerning PVC/PLA-based blends have been published. It was proved that PLA stabilized the thermal degradation of PVC; however, a better compatibility was found only when MAH was considered in the blend (phase separation disappeared in the presence of MAH and the formation of MAH-g-PVC was confirmed by the increase of glass transition temperature of PVC) [
