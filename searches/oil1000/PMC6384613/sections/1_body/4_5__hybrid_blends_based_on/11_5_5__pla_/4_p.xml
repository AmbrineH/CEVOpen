<p class="p">Notwithstanding its good thermal and mechanical properties, the highly hydrophobic nature of PLA leads to low hydrolytic degradation rates. In general, hydrophobicity means the poor ability for holding-up water. As water uptake is an essential step to degradation process, PLA is often blended with synthetic biopolymers, such as PVA, in order to enhance its biodegradability. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B257-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>] recommended that the blending of PVA with PLA could lead to promising ecofriendly materials for packaging applications with high performance, such as good mechanical properties and thermoplasticity. Furthermore, Shuai et al. [
 <xref rid="B258-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">258</xref>] stated that poly(L-lactide) was immiscible with PVA with completely different Tg peaks being observed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, which is ascribed to the absence of hydrogen bonding in amorphous regions.
