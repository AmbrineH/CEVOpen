<p class="p">In the case of PS-containing blends, it is well recognized that polystyrene possessed limited degradation and narrow affinity to the water, which made the disposal of PS difficult after use. In order to modify the degradation process of PS, PS was blended with TPS, realized using several plasticizers, and the results indicated that blending of PLA with PS might be one of the best ways to find an equilibrium between cost effective PLA and also find reduced properties of PS [
