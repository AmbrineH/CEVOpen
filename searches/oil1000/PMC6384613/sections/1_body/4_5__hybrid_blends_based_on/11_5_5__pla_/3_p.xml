 <xref rid="B251-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">251</xref>]. There is a limited number of works proposed in the literature that considered a PLA blend with polyamides, and the system result is still not totally understood [

 <xref rid="B253-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">253</xref>] analyzed the microstructure and mechanical characteristics of this system and assumed that PLA/PA11 is a low interfacial tension blend with quite good compatibility, while Dong et al. [
 <xref rid="B254-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>] analyzed the result of introducing ethylene glycidyl methacrylate-graft-styrene-co-acrylonitrile (EGMA-g-AS) rubber particles in PLA or PA11 phases on the mechanical characteristics of PLA/PA11 blends. They detected a 78- and 5.2-fold enlargement in deformation at break and impact strength, respectively, in ternary blends, in which EGMA-g-AS is mainly dispersed in the PLA phase. They also concluded that the presence of EGMA-g-AS did not modify the dispersion of polymeric phase microstructure of PLA/PA11 blends. In the proposed works, several aspects of the microstructure, interfacial and coalescence characteristics of PLA/PA11 continue to be uncertain or contradictory. The possibility of having a bio-based PA has been also evaluated [

 <xref rid="B256-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">256</xref>], where it was confirmed that low molecular weight epoxy resin could have a substantial role as a reactive compatibilizer in PLA/PA 610 blends.
