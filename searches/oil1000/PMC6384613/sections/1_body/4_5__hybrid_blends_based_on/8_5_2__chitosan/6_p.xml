 <xref rid="B218-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">218</xref>]. The PET/Chitosan blends showed a noteworthy antibacterial characteristic towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which improved at higher content of chitosan films. In addition, tensile strength and deformation at break of PET/chitosan films reduced with increasing chitosan amount. Consequently, the investigations of PET/chitosan systems underlined the possibility to utilize the proposed systems in the food industry as antimicrobial packages.
