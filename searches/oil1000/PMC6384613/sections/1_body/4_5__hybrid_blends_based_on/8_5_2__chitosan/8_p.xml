The presence of chitosan increased the wettability of the films, thanks to its high affinity to the water, while crystallinity and mechanical characteristics of PP reduced with the presence of chitosan (this behaviour could be predictable, due to the limited mechanical performance of chitosan bio-based polymeric matrix). In addition, due to the typical antimicrobial activity of chitosan, this material can be used to develop food containers to increase the conservation of food for a longer time in respect to traditional polymeric matrices.
