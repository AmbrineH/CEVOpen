 <xref rid="B221-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">221</xref>] reported, for the first time, about water barrier blends of chitosan with EVOH copolymers by solution casting: Optimal properties in terms of microstructure, optical characteristics, biocide, and water barrier activity could theoretically support the development of new bio-coatings based on chitosan salts and EVOH. The chitosan/copolymer blend can preserve the transparency and the dimensional stability, even in the presence of humidity, of the neat EVOH, but showing improved water barrier and exceptional biocide characteristics when compared to chitosan.
