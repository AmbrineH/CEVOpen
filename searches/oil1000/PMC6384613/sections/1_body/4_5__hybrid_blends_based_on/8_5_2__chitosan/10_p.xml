 <xref rid="B222-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>] realized chitosan-based antibacterial packages. The diffusion of acetic or propionic acid from thin films (44–54 mm) was analyzed after water immersion at various pH (5.7, 6.4, or 7.0) and temperatures (4, 10, or 24 °C). Due to the antimicrobial characteristics of chitosan, these polymeric blends can be used as antibacterial packages [
 <xref rid="B223-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>]. Nevertheless, chitosan-based films may absorb water and swell on extended time contact. Therefore, the checking of geometric features, such as porosity, is recommended.
