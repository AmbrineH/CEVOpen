<p class="p">The progress of scientific investigations on polyethylene/chitosan composites has gained significant consideration, especially those prepared by melt processing, because of their superior control of the final material’s properties with respect of solvent evaporation methods. The result of the work by Lima et al. [
 <xref rid="B214-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>] specified that chitosan tunes the viscosity, loss modulus, storage and torque modulus (i.e., melt viscosity), and the mixture chitosan/PE-g-MA compatibilizer has a comparable, even if negligible, consequence. In the case of higher fillers amounts, (more than 15 wt %) the PE-g-MA influenced the rheological behavior of the mixtures, maybe improving matrix–filler interactions and working as an active compatibilizer [
