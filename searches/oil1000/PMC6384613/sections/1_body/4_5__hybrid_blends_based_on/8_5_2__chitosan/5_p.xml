<p class="p">Chitosan/nylon 11 blends, at different ratios, were produced [
 <xref rid="B216-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>] and results revealed that the physical properties of nylon 11 were greatly affected by the addition of chitosan in the blended films and that good biodegradability of the resulting blends was observed. Smitha et al. [
 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>] have considered the characterization of crosslinked blends of chitosan/nylon 66 at different weight compositions. The obtained results showed good indication for dehydration of dioxane and moderate water sorption (50â€“90%) of the blends, with no significant effects on the mechanical stability of the blends.
