<p class="p">The selection of the polymers to be blended with the chitosan depends on the property to be conferred or boosted. For example, the affinity to water characteristic of chitosan is changed by blending with polymeric matrices, such as PEG and PVA. Chitosan was similarly blended with a great number of polymeric matrices, such as polyamides, pol (acrylic acid), gelatin, silk fibroin, and cellulose to improve mechanical characteristics. </p>
