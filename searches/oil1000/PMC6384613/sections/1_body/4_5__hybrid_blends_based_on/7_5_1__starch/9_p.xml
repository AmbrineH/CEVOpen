Generally, starch systems show relatively interesting barrier characteristics at low moisture levels and plasticizer amount, with respect of traditional membranes, such as EVOH (copolymer of vinyl alcohol and ethylene) or polyamide, which are frequently mentioned as control materials for oxygen barriera. The difficulty with starch membranes is to verify the appropriate stability between interesting barrier and mechanical characteristics. Commonly, great amount of plasticizer amount is chosen to gain a soft material, but in this situation the barrier characteristics are going to be obviously reduced. Even if starch shows higher diffusion to carbon dioxide and oxygen than ethylene-vinyl alcohol, it is indeed considerably economically advantageous to use it; thus, comparable or higher barrier materials, in comparison with EVOH-based multilayer formulations, can be obtained by considering greater thicknesses.
