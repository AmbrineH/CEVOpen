<p class="p">As an example, a comparison between the effects of carboxylic acids (stearic, palmitic, and myristic acids) and maleic anhydryde (MA)-grafted poly(propylene), used as a compatibilizer agent for PP/TPS polymeric blends, was conducted: Carboxylic acids revealed comparable compatibilization performance with respect to MA-grafted poly(propylene), regarding improved adhesion and better mechanical properties (

Polymeric blends based on the combination of traditional polymeric matrices and starch can also speed up the disintegration of traditional based systems used to realize packages [

 <xref rid="B186-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]: The presence of different amounts of starch into traditional polymeric matrices can decrease the price and enhance the degradation of the blends, due to the fact that, if polymeric blends are buried in soil, the starch phase is degraded by microorganism attacks. This enhanced degradability due to the presence of porosity and voids induces the loss of integrity of polymeric systems (

 <xref rid="B187-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>] analyzed the behavior of LLDPE/TPS systems, obtaining a degree of disintegration of 63%. The systems disintegrated into methane, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and biomass after five months in a composting environment. The results confirmed that LLDPE/TPS blends were disintegrated more rapidly than pure LLDPE, an enhancement in terms of porosity structure with a loss of integrity of the polymeric matrices was evidenced, finally achieving broken plastic small pieces. Consequently, if the PE part of the material is not modified to facilitate its disintegration and the subsequent biodegradation, only the starch part of the blend will biodegrade with fragmentation of the material as a result. However, it is highly questionable and hard to accept, as polyolefins present in the blends do not undergo biodegradation and are still present in the form of a polymer material when the biodegradable part of the blend degrades to water, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and biomass. In the environment, the packaging product made of this kind of blend is only fragmented to small fractions of plastic that can be definitely dangerous for living organisms [

The recycling opportunity still represent a possible solution to this problem, as it has already been demonstrated that the replacement of products based on LDPE with LDPE/TPS blends may not result in substantial changes in the recyclability issues associated with the reprocessing of the involved systems [
