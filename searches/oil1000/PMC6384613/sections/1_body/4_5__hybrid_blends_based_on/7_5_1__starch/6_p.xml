 <xref rid="B200-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] analyzed the preparation of polymeric-based systems composed by an aromatic-aliphatic copolyester, having wheat starch and 35 mol % of aromatic ester units, plasticized by 15, 20, or 30 wt % of glycerol. Blends prepared from copolyester and native starch, at ratios of 55:45, 65:35, or 75:25 by weight, were analyzed; tensile strength values varied between 9 and 30 MPa. Deformation at break of the polymeric blends was very low, while wettability characterization of the analyzed systems would not reduce possible utilization as package products.
