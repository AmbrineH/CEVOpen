In general, PVA/starch blend films show certain limitations, such as high affinity to water and weak mechanical characteristics. In particular, barrier and tensile performance decrease with higher starch amount, resulting from their partial compatibility, especially in the absence of plasticizers. Consequently, the main approaches to overcome these limitations comprise the use of chemicals (such as cross-linkers and surfactants) to modify the compatibility during blending, the use of modified PVA and starch instead of native PVA and starch, respectively, as well as the incorporation of nanofillers to improve their properties. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B209-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>] modified starch to tackle this problem by using methylated corn-starch (MCS) and then blended it with PVA. The water absorption capacity of PVA/MCS decreased by a factor of two when compared with that of PVA/native starch. On the other hand, Jayasekara et al. [
 <xref rid="B210-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>] modified surface compatibility of PVA/starch films with the aid of chitosan since the surface roughness of PVA was lower than that of starch. However, PVA/starch blend surfaces had an intermediate roughness between those of individual PVA and starch, which remained unchanged with the addition of chitosan.
