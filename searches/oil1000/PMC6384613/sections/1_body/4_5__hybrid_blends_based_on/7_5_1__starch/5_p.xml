 <xref rid="B190-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>] investigated TPS-based systems combined with polyamide 11 (PA11) and polyamide 12 (PA12) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00471-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c). In the first research, microstructures and characteristics of TPS/PA11 polymeric systems were investigated. The proposed formulations were modified, applying a compatibilization procedure by considering carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in an amount of 1 g CMC/100 g dry polymeric matrix. The presence of sodium neutralized anionic groups allowed the interaction between CMC and PA11, perhaps by hydrogen bonding of the amide groups and metal complexation. The polymeric blends showed interesting mechanical characteristics (high tensile strength and high modulus), even if TPS was the major element. In the second work, the authors analyzed the compatibilization of TPS/PA12 blends by the presence of poly(ethylene-co-butyl acrylate-co-maleic anhydride) terpolymer (Lotader 3410) and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA). The crystallization phenomenon of PA12 in TPS/PA12 polymeric blends was determined to be deeply dependent on the DGEBA amount; however, no effect was observed for the presence of Lotader 3410 t.
