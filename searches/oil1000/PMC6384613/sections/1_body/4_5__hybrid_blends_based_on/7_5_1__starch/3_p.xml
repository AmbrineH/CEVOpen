<p class="p">In the case of PE, further investigation is mandatory to utilize LDPE-starch blends as bio-based packages, because of the decrease of the mechanical characteristics of PE when the starch amount increases [
 <xref rid="B194-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>]. Generally, the mechanical performance is reduced with the presence of starch because of the limited compatibility between PE and starch. The reduced compatibility is strongly related to the fact that starch granules are extremely hydrophilic, due to the presence of hydroxyl groups at their surfaces, while LDPE generally does not show affinity to water. In several researches, if the content of starch is increased at around 20 wt % the deformability of the PE matrix is changed and converted into a fragile material (in PE/starch based formulations) [
 <xref rid="B195-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>]; even gas diffusion and the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) is changed in relation with the starch ratio, according to Arvanitoyanis et al. [
 <xref rid="B196-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>], that found how WVTR is decreased proportionally when the amylose content increases, due to amylopectin degradation during the thermal processing.
