<p class="p">In the case of starch-based blends [

 <xref rid="B182-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>], the blending of thermoplastic starch with other man-made plastics (e.g., polycaprolactone, polyamide, polyolefins) [

While the blending approach reduces some limits of the TPS systems, the successful approach in improving adhesion can be found by considering non-reactive mixing (blending TPS with graft block or random copolymers) or reactive compatibilization (by polymerization, grafting, or branching).
