 <xref rid="B201-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>] investigated the characteristics of oxidized and native corn starch/polystyrene-based systems under reactive extrusion, using zinc octanoate as a catalyst. The systems were realized by reactive extrusion, and then processed by compression molding. The data undoubtedly showed that the used catalyst induced cross-linking between PS and starch, and that the induced oxidation of the starch magnified its reactivity. Systems did not show signs of swelling or antimicrobial growth. Yongjun et al. [
 <xref rid="B202-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>] realized copolymer by reactive grafting of starch with polystyrene (starch-g-PS) by using ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM]Ac) as the solvent and potassium persulfate as the initiator. The obtained analyses showed that ionic liquid suspension of starch, before polystyrene grafting, is a useful procedure for the synthesis of amphiphilic, polysaccharide-based graft copolymers with high grafting amount.
