<p class="p">It should be also recognized that use of bio-based or biodegradable plastics is often justified by asserting that they biodegrade faster than their conventional petrochemical counterparts; on the other hand, it has to be considered that new demand for biomass inputs could negatively expand uses of land, fossil fuels, chemical inputs, and water. Additionaly, bioconversion may require the use of potentially toxic petroleum-based solvents and results from life cycle assessments could give high energy consumption and emissions for bio-based polymers. When deciding to fully or partially replace conventional petroleum-based plastics with bio-based plastics, it is important to understand the flow of these materials and their adverse impacts in all parts of their life cycles in order to select a material that is more sustainable [
