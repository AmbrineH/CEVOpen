<p class="p">Materials obtained by mixing synthetic polymers with natural polymers can potentially compromise environmental, economic, and social aspects by reducing the recyclability when compared to traditional polymers [

 <xref rid="B178-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>]. Therefore, a main concern associated with the strategy of introducing natural/biodegradable polymers into conventional polymers is related to the chance that these blends have lower levels of recyclability compared to the original polymers, which would then have an adverse impact on both environmental and industrial issues.
