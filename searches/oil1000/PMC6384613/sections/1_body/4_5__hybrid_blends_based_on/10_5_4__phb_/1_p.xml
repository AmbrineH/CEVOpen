<p class="p">Neat PHB shows several drawbacks, such as a high degree of crystallinity and thermal instable behavior. Consequently, its blending with petrochemical-based polymeric matrices showing low degradation values, but superior mechanical characteristics can be an answer to gain environmental and eco-sustainable advantages. The blending approach of PHB and PET might guarantee variations in the performance of the produced disposals, such as the improved mechanical characteristics of the PET or PHB biodegradability (

 <xref rid="B238-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">238</xref>] noted that comparable temperatures during the melting phenomenon were detected for PHB/PET blends without any important interactions between them. Numerous works regarding the investigation of the main characteristics of LDPE/PHB blends have been carried out and are reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B240-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">240</xref>]. There is confirmation that LDPE/PHB blends are not miscible matrices with fine distribution of phase boundaries between dispersed phase and matrix. In accordance to Pankova et al. [
 <xref rid="B241-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>], the morphology of these blends showed that the minor constituent (PHB) forms band-like fibrils entrenched in the LDPE polymer. If the content of PHB is higher than 16 wt %, the blend system undertakes microstructure modification from oriented PHB structure to isotropic one, where the PHB fibrils convert into a network. The dissimilarity between the two microstructures reveals the dissimilar values of water permeability of the produced systems. Consequently, the amount of PHB in the blends adjusts the microstructure and, as a result, determines the water barrier characteristics. The same effect was found in the case of PP/PHB blends [

Olkhov et al. [
 <xref rid="B243-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">243</xref>] investigated the replacement of ether functional groups belonging to PHB, having reduced affinity to water with more hydrophilic groups (amide) belonging to polyamide, while Abdelwahab et al. studied how to advance the compatibility of PHB and PS, which have analogous processing temperatures but are basically incompatible, by using commercial compatibilizing ingredients based on PS random copolymers, containing methyl methacrylate or maleic anhydride comonomers [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00471-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>e). PHB/ Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) or PVA blends were widely analyzed: PVAc and its modification, as the PVA, are miscible with PHB in the melting region. In the case of PHB/PVAc (74/26) blend, a pronounced enhancement in the deformation at break, related to the reduction of crystallinity values of the blend, was noted, determined by the presence of PVAc. Other than this, PVAc addition inhibited the second crystallization phenomenon of PHB at room temperature and; therefore, the blends demonstrated unchanging physical characteristics during storage at room temperature [
