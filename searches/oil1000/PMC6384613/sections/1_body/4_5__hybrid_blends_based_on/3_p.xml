<p class="p">One of the most important aspects of such kind of blending is the recyclability, due to the fact that bio-based plastics could, on one hand, interfere with the current recycling of plastics, and hence hinder the closure of plastic cycles [
 <xref rid="B173-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>] (end-of-life compostable bioplastics may pollute recycled plastic streams if not properly separated and managed, which is undesirable given the current attention on a transition towards a circular economy), while on the other could enhance the recalcitrance of fossil-based mixtures to disintegration and compostability [
 <xref rid="B174-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>,
 <xref rid="B175-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>,
 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. Nevertheless, even if the mechanical recycling of bio-based non-biodegradable plastics, such as bio-PP, bio-PE, and bio-PET, is chemically matched to their fossil counterparts, thus totally compatible with the current recycling methodology, a limiting issue is that these materials (as well as blends of bio-based and fossil plastics) are not compatible with sorting in single polymer streams, even in larger quantities. Therefore, if not mechanically recycled, they can only be incinerated with energy recovery (or anaerobic digested with biogas production).
