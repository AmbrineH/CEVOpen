<p class="p">Bio-based plastics are characterized by costs much higher than traditional thermally-processable polymers (e.g., PP and HDPE), consequently, it is not advantageous to use them without combining these two products. In general, different parameters influence the final microstructure characteristics and mechanical performances of not totally miscible polymeric blends, thus it is evident that the overall performance of polymeric blends is strongly connected to blend composition and its phase morphology [
