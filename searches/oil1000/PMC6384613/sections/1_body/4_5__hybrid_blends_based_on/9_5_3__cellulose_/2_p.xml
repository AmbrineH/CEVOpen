<p class="p">Examples of CA in combination with petroleum based polymers can be found in blends or laminated PET, even if usage today is much reduced with the availability of the lower cost biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) [

 <xref rid="B231-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>], and few studies can be found where authors considered the blending as a way of aiming to reduce the amount of (PVC) waste products in the environment and to increase their biodegradability [
