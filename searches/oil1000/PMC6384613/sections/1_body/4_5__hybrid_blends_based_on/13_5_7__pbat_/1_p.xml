<p class="p">Polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) has great deformation at break comparable to a thermally processable elastomer, a characteristic that should be considered in case of blending with PET, having interesting thermal and mechanical characteristics, low gas diffusion, chemical resistance, and good transparency, but limited degradation in presence of water and microbials. As shown by Thongsonget al. [
 <xref rid="B261-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">261</xref>], with increasing content of PBAT, thermal resistance of PBAT/PET film was decreased in comparison with neat PET film. In parallel, the increase of PBAT would result in lower values for elastic modulus and tensile strength, while the deformation at break would considerably improve, particularly when the PBAT amount is above 40 wt %. Nevertheless, the limited presence of 10 wt % of PBAT could even enhance deformation at break and tensile strength, to give values more elevated than neat PET system.
