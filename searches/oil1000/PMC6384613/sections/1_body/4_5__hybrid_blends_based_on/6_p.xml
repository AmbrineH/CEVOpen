<p class="p">Given, as recognized, that the characteristics of biopolymers must be improved substantially if we want a penetration in the market, the change of these materials toke the attention of researches. In a dissimilar manner to the design of new polymers and polymerization routes, polymer blending is a comparatively low-priced and fast process to modify the characteristics of polymeric materials. As a consequence, this procedure may take part in a critical manner in improving the attractiveness of bio-based polymeric matrices [

It is widely reported in the literature that different chemical modification routes, such as grafting, transesterification, and copolymerization, have been developed to obtain polymeric materials and blends with valuable characteristics.
