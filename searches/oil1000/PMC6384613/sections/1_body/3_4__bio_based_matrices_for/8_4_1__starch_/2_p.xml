<p class="p">Regardless of several published research articles that developed and studied TPS (thermoplastic starch) products, the weaknesses, such as reduced barrier and mechanical performances, are still unsolved. As a consequence, additional strategies, such as the compatibilization, chemical and physical modifications, and development of polymeric blends, have been suggested to solve the disadvantages of using TPS. Polymeric blends combining two or more polymers are a valid possibility to modulate and improve TPS performances. This approach is considered cost-effective, since no modification is required and a wide frame of polymeric material processability can be opened.</p>
