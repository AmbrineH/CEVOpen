<p class="p">Castor oil is the raw material used as a renewable feedstock for the production of commercially available bio-based polyamides. Castor beans are characterized by an unusually high amount of ricinoleic acid (40–60%). The presence of hydroxy groups and double bonds of the acid determine numerous opportunities for its chemical modification. Chemical modifications permit the synthesys of different blocks, such as aminoundecane (decamethylenediamine) and sebacic acid [

In this case, adipic acid, extracted during the fermentation process of glucose or plant-oil and hexamethylenediamine (HMD), which can be quickly extracted from biomass, can be used.
