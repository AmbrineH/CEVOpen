<p class="p">The furanicâ€“aliphatic polymeric class bas been largely investigated in recent years. These polymers based on ester groups are characterized by the presence, in their backbone, of aliphatic and furan units (i.e., obtained from an aliphatic monomer and FDCA (2,5-furandicarboxylic acid)) (

Poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF) is currently considered as an attractive sustainable substitute of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), due to the fact that it has better barrier and interesting thermal characteristics (e.g., lower melting phenomenon and higher glass transition temperature) than PET. The reduced permeability of PEF to CO
