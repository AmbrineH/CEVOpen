<p class="p">Furthermore, molecular weight, physical properties (crystallization phenomenon and crystallization degree), visco-elasticity, and rheological characteristics may induce disadvantages, thus several modifications or adjustments during the processing steps are necessary to modulate the final performances. Consequently, biopolymers should be modified, studying new polymeric blends combining two or more different polymeric matrices or fillers, at the micro/nanoscale level, to expand their characteristics/properties, especially dealing with nature and processability behavior. </p>
