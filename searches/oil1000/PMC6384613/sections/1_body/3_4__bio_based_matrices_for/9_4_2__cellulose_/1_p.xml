It has specific interesting characteristics, such as high mechanical strength, low density, high durability, low price, no presence of toxic elements or substances, biodegradability, interesting and easy chemical modification, and stability [
 <xref rid="B141-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. In the textile sector, the application of cellulose is largely utilized in packaging and fibers, and can be classified into two groups: modified and regenerated cellulose [
 <xref rid="B142-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Different chemical modifications, such as etherification and esterification, are frequently and typically considered to improve the thermal processability cellulosic materials. Numerous modified celluloses are commercially available, the main ones are cellulose esters (for melt compounding), cellulose acetate, and regenerated cellulose for fibers [

The application of plasticizers and polymeric blends are also evaluated considering that the chemical and mechanical characteristics are largely influenced by the blend composition and technical processability followed and applied for their realization [
