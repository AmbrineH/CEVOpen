 <xref rid="B165-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. Major applications of bio-based polyolefins include packaging, building and construction, automotive and transportation, and others including blow molded bottles, stretch and shrink films, and detergents. Packaging emerged as the leading application segment on account of shifting demand from synthetic polymers to bio-based polyolefins in 2013. Automotive and transportation is the second largest market for bio-based polyolefins, owing to its increased application in manufacturing automotive parts. Moreover, building and construction is expected to witness strong growth in the bio-based polyolefins market.
