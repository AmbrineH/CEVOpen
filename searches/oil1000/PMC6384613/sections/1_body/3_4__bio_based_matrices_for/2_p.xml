<p class="p">Bio-based polymers are considered a valid replacement of petroleum synthetic polymeric matrices; they are obtained by the processing of renewable resources (vegetable and animal wastes) and offer several positive aspects, such as environmental advantages, disintegrability and degradability, improved possibility to recycle the polymeric wastes, no presence of toxic components, and high biocompatibility, in respect to the conventional petrochemical polymeric matrices. The interesting barrier properties of different bio-based polymeric films for package designs has been acknowledged in several research review articles [

 <xref rid="B127-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. Due to the fact that numerous biopolymers show water affinity, their barrier and mechanical characteristics are subjected to the humidity and ambient atmosphere, which may decrease their overall performance and the quality of packages when compared with petroleum-based polymers (
