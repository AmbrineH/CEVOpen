<p class="p">Polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) is composed of a linear polymeric chain made by two comonomers (forming a copolyester): a rigid unit consisting of terephthalic acid and 1,4-butanediol monomers, and the elastic unit composed by adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol monomers. PBAT shows interesting thermal and mechanical characteristics when the amount of terephthalic acid is more than 35 mol %; nevertheless, the increasing amount is followed by an important reduction, considering the rate and the percentage of biodegraded quantities [

 <xref rid="B160-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. PBAT is also extremely flexible and soft, to make it applicable in films (mulch), blown bottles, and injection-molded and thermoformed systems and filaments. It is extensively utilized for disposals characterized by a short life, such as food films and compostable systems. This copolyester is commercially utilized for the realization of single-use not reusable packages, organic waste bin liners, compostable bags, and protective plastic systems [
