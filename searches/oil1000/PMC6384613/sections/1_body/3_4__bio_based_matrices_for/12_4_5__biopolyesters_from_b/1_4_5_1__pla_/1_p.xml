<p class="p">(Poly lactic) polymers are obtained by the fermentation process applied to agricultural wastes and byproducts, such as starch-rich materials (wheat, corn starch, and maize). The procedure implied the transformation of corn natural resources into dextrose and following fermentation into lactic acid. PLA is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester and thermally-processable matrix, having interesting properties for the packaging sector [
 <xref rid="B155-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. The monomers based on lactic acid are also polycondensed or synthetized by ring-opening polymerization of lactide [
 <xref rid="B156-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>], and the properties are strongly related to the content of optical isomers of the lactic acid. High crystalline polymers are composed of 100% L-PLA monomers, while the different concentration of 90/10 D/L copolymers is considered to facilitate the processing above the glass transition. PLA is the first biodegradable polymer present on the market and largely commercialized. (Poly lactic) can be utilized to realize injection-molded coatings, films, and objects. In this context, PLA has substituted polyethylene terephthalate (PET), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polystyrene (PS) in the packaging sector. PLA is several times utilized to realize single use material: blister packages, cold drink cups, lids, containers, thermoformed trays, bottles, as well as flexible films [

Even though PLA is, today, advantageous from an economic point of view, and it also has many favorable characteristics for packaging uses (i.e., simple processability, high transparency), it also shows some disadvantages, such as mechanical characteristics and poor barrier properties, which inhibit its industrial utilization [
 <xref rid="B158-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. Significant academic and industrial energies have been dedicated to the improvement of PLA characteristics to enlarge the application of PLA in different commercial applications of crucial importance in the industrial sector, in order to develop ecofriendly disposable materials. In addition, modulation of PLA properties by combining PLA with different polymeric matrices, is realized by melt blending, being this procedure is quite simple. Furthermore, the technologies required for the process are available at industrial level with limited costs. The technique permits the realization of simple packages with modulated characteristics by changing the content of different polymeric matrices, which are utilized to develop the blends.
