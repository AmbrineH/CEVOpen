<p class="p">Conventionally, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is obtained from succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol through catalytic hydrogenation of maleic anhydride. Succinic acid can also be synthesized by microbial fermentation. PBS can be degraded via ester linkages, and retains exceptional mechanical characteristics that permit it to be prepared by using conventional melt processes. Its uses consist of bags, hygiene commodities, and mulching. Their mechanical performance is inferior to polymeric matrices extracted from petroleum. Consequently, aliphatic polyesters could be utilized as transparent thin systems for packaging bags, filaments, blown bottles, agriculture, and thermo-processed or injection-molded systems. In order to enhance their properties, new polymeric blends or chemical modified copolymeric systems (aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters: poly(butylene terephthalate-co-succinate) (PBTS) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) can be realized. Copolymers based on polyesters are frequently composed by terephthalic acid to gain better processability and mechanical performance. Aliphatic-aromatic blends and copolyesters merge the fine useful characteristics of aromatic polyesters and the interesting biodegradability of aliphatic polyesters. Furthermore, the combination of characteristics permits the modulation of the performance of the final product, and address them to the utilization in the industry dedicated to the production of packages. The aliphatic or aromatic polyesters are based on petrochemical extracts and are usually prepared through conventional polycondensation methods. </p>
