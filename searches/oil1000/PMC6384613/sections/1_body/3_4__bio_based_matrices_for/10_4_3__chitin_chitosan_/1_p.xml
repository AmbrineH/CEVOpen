 <xref rid="materials-12-00471-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) is a natural polymeric material that composes the exoskeleton of arthropods, it is also present in the cell walls of yeasts and fungi. In addition, it is an acetylated polysaccharide made up of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Chitin is present also on the market after a chemical treatment (extraction from crabs and prawns wastes). Chitosan is indeed extracted after the treatment of chitin, applying a deacetylation process in which several parameters that should affect the extraction and also modify the main characteristics (e.g., temperature, native origin of chitin, and alkali concentration) need to be controlled. Chitosan does not show affinity to water, in fact it is insoluble in water, but may be without problems dissolved in acidic aqueous solutions. The interesting film-forming characteristics permit the realization of coatings and membranes capable to be utilized for food conservation [
