 <xref rid="B150-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>], represents a valid approach to guarantee an enhancement in terms of mechanical performances, improved characteristics in terms of lower water solubility, and water vapor permeability. Several other approaches, for instance coating, dipping, casting, Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly, and extrusion, have been considered to realize chitosan systems with several characteristics. The promising food sector of chitosan systems as antibacterial active compounds and sensing and barrier systems have had enormous progresses [
