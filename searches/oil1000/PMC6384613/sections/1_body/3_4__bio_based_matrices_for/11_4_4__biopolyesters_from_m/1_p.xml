<p class="p">PHAs are bio-based polyesters produced by microorganisms as a carbon source under nutrient stress conditions. PHAs are realized after the fermentation process of different materials (sugars, organic, agricultural, and municipal solid waste, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B152-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. This class of biopolyesters is biocompatible, biodegradable, and thermally processable. PHAs are utilized in food packaging application to realize coatings, films, boxes, foam materials, and fibers [
 <xref rid="B153-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. The final characteristics of the PHAs are influenced by monomer composition, carbon nature, and source and kind of microorganism utilized during the fermentation. Within PHAs, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) homopolymer has a high degree of crystallinity, resulting in a stiff and brittle nature. PHAs are resistant to hydrolytic degradation, PHAs show interesting and exceptional film-forming ability and offer a low permeation to gases (oxygen and water vapor), good UV resistance, but low chemical resistance towards acids and bases [
 <xref rid="B154-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Two main restrictions for their use and application in large-scale are related to the high cost of polymers and characteristics (they suffer problems during processing because of the limited temperature processing range and a moderately low-impact performance related to high crystallinity values). Some disadvantages of PHB for industrial applications may be overtaken by copolymerization with hydroxyvalerate or hydroxyhexanoate. Monomers can be used in 150 different combinations to produce copolymers with diverse properties. PHB polymeric matrices showed some different characteristics, modulating the copolymers ratio. PHB can be less crystalline and more elastic in the presence of long alkyl side chains, such as hydroxyvalerate (HV) and hydroxybutyrate (HB), that provide, respectively, P(3HB-co-3HV) and P(3HB-co-4HB) [

 <xref rid="B153-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. For example, PHB has been combined with poly(vinyl butyral), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(ethylene oxide), cellulose acetate butyrate, poly(vinyl phenol), chitosan, and chitin. Distinctive characteristics of this set of polymeric matrices are outstanding rigidity, heat, and chemical performances. Isotactic polypropylene (PP) showed characteristics comparable to the cited PHB copolymers. Isotactic PP showed remarkable water vapor resistance, in respect to the bio-based polymeric matrices present in the market. For all these characteristics, bio-based polymeric matrices may be used in several applications, including packaging.
