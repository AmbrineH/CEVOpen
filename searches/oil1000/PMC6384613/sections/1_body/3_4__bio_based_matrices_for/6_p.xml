<p class="p">Typically, 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> class is utilized avoiding the refining step, whereas 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> class polymeric matrices are obtained from natural extracts, and they play a central position in conditions that necessitate biodegradability. The utilization of 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> and 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> class polymeric matrices permits a more proficient manufacture, with materials having preferred and modified physical and functional characteristics, but limited flexibility in the chemical structure. Monomers utilized in 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> class polymers are obtained by modifying natural molecules or by the chemical modification of natural macromolecules combining and applying chemical and biochemical technologies. Several of these 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> class polymeric matrices, such as bio-PET and bio-polyolefines, will not go into natural cycles after utilization, so their concurrence to the reduction of environmental impact is mainly related to the decrease of the carbon footprint. Studies and researches regarding progress, innovation, and applications of the three classes of polymers are described in the following sections, their main important characteristics and chemistries are also described.
