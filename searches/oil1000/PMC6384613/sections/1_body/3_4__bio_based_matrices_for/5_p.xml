<p class="p">Nevertheless, the general principle to be considered to classify biodegradable materials is the raw material origin and their production step. In accordance to this, biodegradable polymers are categorized into three groups: “1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> class” or biomass derived polymers, including cellulose acetate, cellulose, chitin, and starch; “2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> class” or biopolymers synthesized utilizing microorganisms and plants, as poly(hydroxy alkanoates (PHAs); and “3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> class” or synthetic polymeric matrices, as polylactide (PLA), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), bio-polyolefins, bio-poly(ethylene terephtalic acid) (bio-PET), and synthetic polymeric matrices chemically produced from renewable sources [
