<p class="p">A selection of polysaccharides and their modified products have been utilized to realize biodegradable films to be used in packaging and edible coatings. These carbohydrates composed by glycosidic bonds are one of the most important structural components of vegetables (e.g., cellulose) and animal exoskeletons (e.g., chitin), and they can have, in addition, a crucial function in the “green” energy storage (e.g., starch) [
