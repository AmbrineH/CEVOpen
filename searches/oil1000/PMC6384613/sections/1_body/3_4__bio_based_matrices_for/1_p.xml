<p class="p">Presently, packaging films are typically constituted by petroleum-based synthetic polymeric matrices that monitor the market, due to their reduced price and simple accessibility. As already analyzed, these polymeric matrices comprise polyolefins (polyethylene), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), that are responsible for a relevant barrier towards water and oxygen. Nevertheless, they are hindered by margins in petroleum resources and the lack of bio-disintegration, which magnify the ecological and cost-effective concerns. </p>
