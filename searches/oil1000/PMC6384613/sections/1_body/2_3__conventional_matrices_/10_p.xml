<p class="p">PVA is one of the most popular synthetic polymers for packaging sectors, thanks to its good compatibility, processability, and acceptable thermal properties. It also possesses good chemical resistance and high mechanical properties, although its disadvantages include limited barrier and thermal properties and relatively high cost [
 <xref rid="B115-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. The properties of PVA generally depend on its molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis: many hydroxyl groups on the PVA surface makes it one of the most hydrophilic polymers with high moisture sensitivity, and hence its resulting blends and composite materials have become popular for packaging applications [

 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. In general, full-hydrolysis PVA is not considered to be a thermoplastic polymer, mainly due to its melting temperature being very close to the degradation temperature in the absence of plasticizers. Therefore, it is essential to use plasticizers for PVA in order to control the relevant melting temperature, fluidity, and thermal stability, especially for screw extrusion and injection molding processes widely used for the packaging sector.
