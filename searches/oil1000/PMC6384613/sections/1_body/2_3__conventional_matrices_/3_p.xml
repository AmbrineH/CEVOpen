<p class="p">The petroleum-based matrices were developed and studied from the first half of the XX century. As an example, polyethylene (PE) was studied/synthesized in the 1930s and polypropylene (PP) in the 1950s, while polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) were studied in the 1970s [

The common and most used food-packaging polymers are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (applied in food, beverage, and other liquid containers), polyethylene (PE) (cooking oil, milk, and water containers), polystyrene (PS) (mushroom and eggs), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC) (spice ice tea, yogurt and margarine), and polyamide (PA) (stretchy packaging of fresh food, such as cheese and meat) [
