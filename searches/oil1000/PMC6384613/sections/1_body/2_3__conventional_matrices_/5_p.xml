<p class="p">Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is fundamentally applied in sectors requiring low permeability to gases, high mechanical performances (deformation at break and strength), wide temperature resistance (resistance at freezing temperatures, high softening point), and adequate transparency. High density polyethylene (HDPE) is an interesting polymeric matrix that represents more than over half of the food packaging available on the market. HDPE is mainly used in contact with a variety of foods, in addition it is easily shaped; low density polyethylene (LDPE) is extensively used in film to cover foods. High resistance to tear, low heat seal temperature, and low permeability to water (its deformation at break exceeds that of other commercial and largely used plastics) are the main required properties for the specific application. </p>
