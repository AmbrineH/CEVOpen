<p class="p">The triumph of polymeric-based systems in the packaging sector is related to the incessant progress of better performing neat polymers and polymeric based blends, with relevant progresses in polymeric matrix processes. In fact, a clever process control of the thickness of different systems permits the production of lighter packages, reducing the material cost [
 <xref rid="B105-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. The lamination and the coextrusion processes represent a valid opportunity to design and realize multilayer-based systems, selecting individual layers to ensure specific properties (mechanical resistance, barrier, and aesthetical); however, biaxial orientation increases, considerably, the mechanical and barrier characteristics of a film or bottle, positively influencing some attractive behaviors.
