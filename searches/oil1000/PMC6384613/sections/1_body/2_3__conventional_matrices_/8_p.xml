<p class="p">Poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) is a semicrystalline random copolymer with elevated transparency, optical characteristics, and outstanding gas barrier performances to hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B109-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], particularly when low content of ethylene (below 38 mol % ethylene) is considered [
 <xref rid="B110-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>], and excellent chemical resistance [
 <xref rid="B111-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. EVOH-based formulations have been progressively applied in food packaging, being the sector characterized by severe value/standard in terms of gas and chemical resistance, water hydrocarbon permeation, and aroma migration [
 <xref rid="B112-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. The physical (barrier and mechanical) performances of EVOH under dry environments are attributed to the elevated intra- and inter-molecular cohesive energy and semi-crystalline microstructure [
 <xref rid="B113-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. The disadvantage of EVOH copolymers is their moisture sensitivity, which influences negatively their characteristics (barrier, thermal, and mechanical properties) at high relative humidity [
