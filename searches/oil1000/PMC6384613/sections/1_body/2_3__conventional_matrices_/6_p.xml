<p class="p">Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shows good gas barrier performances and high chemical hardiness, this polymer is often considered as a valid option to cover meat and fatty foods. PP is largely utilized for containers and walled cups. Satisfied barrier properties, optical transparency and esthetic quality, strength, and high temperature resistance allow this polymeric matrix to be suitable for the realization of microwave/freeze containers, and sterilized or hot-filled containers [

 <xref rid="B107-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Polypropylene (PP) is gradually substituting polystyrene (PS) in rigid thermally-processed cups (e.g., yoghurt) [
 <xref rid="B105-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Nevertheless, the low barrier properties of PP makes it acceptable for packing limited shelf-life food (e.g., cheese); the high thermal properties suggested the possibility to realize PP in thermal insulation applications by using foams (e.g., disposable packages) and reduced weight, but still not flexible and rigid dishes.
