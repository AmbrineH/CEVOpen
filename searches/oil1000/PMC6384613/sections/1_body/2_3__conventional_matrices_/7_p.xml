<p class="p">Polyamides (PA) are engineered semicrystalline thermoplastics extensively utilized in the food packaging segment, thanks to good barrier characteristics to gas permeation, interesting mechanical and chemical resistance, good printability, and interesting optical properties in terms of transparency. The performances of the final plastic objects are, certainly, strongly related to the chemical structure of the PA, and also related to the selected process utilized to realize the products [
