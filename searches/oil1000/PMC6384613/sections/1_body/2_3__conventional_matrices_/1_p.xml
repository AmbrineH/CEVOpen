Packaging is one of the main important sectors that supports the use and application of polymeric materials derived from fossil sources, with an annual global demand at around 36% [

The packaging sector is influenced by the demands requested by various stakeholders (consumers, producers, and retailers), who have specific necessities and do not, each time, recognize the packaging as an additional significance to the product [

The conventional characteristics of packaging are centered on the protection of food products from degradation processes (mainly induced by several factors such as temperature, light, moisture, and oxygen conditions of the environment), to enclose the food, and to supply consumers with ingredient and nutritional information and the description of several items of information regarding the conservation of food products [
