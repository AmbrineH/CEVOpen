Specific amounts (1, 3, and 5 wt %) of CNC were selected to modulate the barrier properties of PVA/pea starch based film used as control. No changes in water vapor permeability (WVP) were registered adding the different content of CNC; this behavior can be related to the enhancement in the hydrophilic nature of the films, as also observed by the overall migration levels in polar and non-polar food simulants. The nanocomposites are characterized by lightly rigid and more stretchable behavior, crystallization phenomenon of PVA was moderately reduced by CNC addition [
