<p class="p">Another application of chitosan hybrid nanocomposites was analyzed by Sadeghi and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B287-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">287</xref>]. In that work, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and chitosan were combined with nano zinc oxide (nano-ZnO) and glycerol used as plasticizer, these systems were deeply analyzed and developed for food packaging systems. The functional characteristics of EVOH nanocomposites underlined improved barrier, mechanical, and transparency characteristics. The antiseptic characteristics were enhanced by adding chitosan. The addition of plasticizer determined a reduction of barrier properties and, at the same time, an increase of deformation at break (Îµ
