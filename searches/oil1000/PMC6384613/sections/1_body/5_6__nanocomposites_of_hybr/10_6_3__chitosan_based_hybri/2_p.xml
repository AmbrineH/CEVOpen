 <xref rid="B286-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">286</xref>]. Luzi and co-author developed and studied novel PVA and PVA/10CH systems with modulate characteristics of main significance in thefood packaging sector [
 <xref rid="B286-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">286</xref>]. The microstructure analysis highlighted that no changes in the PVA and PVA/CH cross section areas were found due to the addition of nanocellulose (CNC) and/or carvacrol (Carv), underlining the positive synergism among the ingredients. The authors studied the optical and colorimetric characteristics, the data highlighted that no changes were detected on transmittance level and colorimetric appearance of PVA and PVA/CH blend, which were kept also in the case of four components-based formulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00471-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, Panel A). The different produced PVA-based formulations combined with carvacrol showed an important antioxidant effect, whilst the presence of carvacrol and chitosan induced an antimicrobial effect [

Yang and co-authors analyzed the effect of introducing lignin nanofillers (LNP) at two different weight ratios (1 and 3 wt %) on chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hybrid nanocomposite films, realized by using a solvent casting technique [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00471-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, Panel B) revealed the capability to decrease the microbial growth of Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting the possibility of using these films against the growth of microbial plant/fruit pathogens in the food package sector. Additionally, the results from the presence and combined effect of CH and LNP in the antioxidation property (
