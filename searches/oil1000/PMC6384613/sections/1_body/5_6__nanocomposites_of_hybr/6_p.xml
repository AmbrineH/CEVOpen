<p class="p">It has been recommended that intrinsic weaknesses of bio-based packages, such as reduced barrier characteristics, hydrophilicity, low heat deflection temperatures, restricted processing gap, and low mechanical performance, may be overcome by a nanocomposite approach [

The potential of layered clay mineral nanoparticles has been established, thanks to their commercial accessibility, relatively high barrier and mechanical performance enhancements, low price, and moderately simple processability. Nevertheless, it may be underlined that although nanoclays are largely available natural sources, they are not biodegradable or renewable. Several other nanoparticles, comprising nano-metal oxide or metal have been utilized to enhance the matrix thermal performance and add some functions, such as strong antibacterial action.
