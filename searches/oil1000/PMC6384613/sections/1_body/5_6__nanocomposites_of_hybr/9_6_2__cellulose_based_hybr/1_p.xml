<p class="p">Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) added to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) biopolymers have been extensively utilized for advanced biodegradable films in the packaging sector: CMC are compatible and miscible bio-based matrices, due to the existence of multifunctional groups on polymeric chains; as a result the blend strategy of these matrices can facilitate the production of bio-based matrices with characteristics that consent their use in the promising field of bio-packages. PVA/CMC blend can be utilized as a novel bio-blend matrix to develop and realize bio-based nanocomposite systems with improved characteristics. El Achaby et al. [
 <xref rid="B284-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">284</xref>] established that the presence of 5 wt % CNC (cellulose nanocrystals) in PVA/CMC improved the tensile modulus and strength by 141% and 83%, respectively, and the water vapor diffusivity was weakened by 87%. Moreover, the developed systems reinforced with filler at thenanoscale level preserved similar transparency of the PVA/CMC system (transparency level in the visible region was estimated at around ∼90%), highlighting that the CNC were well distributed at the nanoscale. The proposed nanocomposites showed interesting adhesion characteristics and the great number of functional groups present in the CNC’s surface and in the macromolecular chains of the PVA/CMC system are useful to enhance the interfacial relationship between the polymeric blend and CNC. As a result, these eco-friendly organized bio-nanocomposite systems with higher characteristics are estimated to be of practical use in the food packaging sector. By using MMT, Taghizadeh et al. [
