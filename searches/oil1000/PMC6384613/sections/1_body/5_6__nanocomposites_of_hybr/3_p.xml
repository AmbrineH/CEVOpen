<p class="p">(b) Water vapor barrier characteristics: The main restrictions of bio-based packages are their hydrophilic performance. Even if water vapor barrier performances of bio-polymeric matrices are related with conventional matrices, a composite biopolymer can be designed and innovated with transmittance rates rather similar to the conventional plastics. The biodegradable package is a high-quality alternative for products that necessitate high water vapor diffusion. Deep study has been performed to modulate the water diffusion characteristics of bio-systems also realizing numerous layers or developing nanocomposite approach [
