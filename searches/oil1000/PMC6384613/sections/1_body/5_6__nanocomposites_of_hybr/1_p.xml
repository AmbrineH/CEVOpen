<p class="p">Generally, the functional characteristics of bio-based polymers in relation to their physical and functional characteristics are required to be modified to accommodate foodstuff necessities, applying diverse strategies and modifications, as chemical or physical changes (crosslinking) or blending with different polymers and or fillers/components (compatibilizers or plasticizers). Consequently, several works have been made to design polymeric-based materials, extracted from renewable sources, with similar properties to those of traditional ones, with the final scope of reducing the environmental problems induced by the use of plastics [

 <xref rid="B264-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">264</xref>]. The properties to be considered are numerous and may incorporate water vapor and gas diffusivity into polymeric chains, mechanical characteristics, thermal processability, sealing capability, resistance (chemical attacks (acid), grease, water, UV light, etc.), machinability (on the packaging line), antifogging ability, optical characteristics (transparency), printability, and economic aspects. It is significant to understand that no single natural material will assure all possible business areas and utilization. Consequently, an increasing attention is seen in the development of packages involving multilayer systems, in analogy to the conservative approach to create multilayer high-barrier films (e.g., a bio-based laminate implying plasticized chitosan or a starch based system combined with PHA or PLA), the final substance offers the barrier characteristics to gases and mechanical strength similar to a laminate with an external layer of polyamide (PA) or ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) assembled with LDPE [
