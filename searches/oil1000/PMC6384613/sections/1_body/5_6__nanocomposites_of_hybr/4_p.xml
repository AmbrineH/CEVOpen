<p class="p">(c) Light barrier characteristics: The sunlight energy accelerates the corrosion and deterioration processes that unfavorably influence photosensitive foods. Sunlight, in addition, operates as a catalyst to enhance the rancidity of lipids. Additionally, light provokes the oxidative modification in the polymeric, resulting in the deterioration of polymeric materials, counting both bio-based and conventional packages. To prevent the photo degradation of polymeric matrices and foodstuffs, UV stabilizer and absorber components can be included in the package systems [
