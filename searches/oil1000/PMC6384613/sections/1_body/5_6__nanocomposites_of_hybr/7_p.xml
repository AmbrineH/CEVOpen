<p class="p">In this scenario, bio-based nanofillers, obtained from no totally crystalline bio-polymeric matrices, such as cellulose, chitin, or starch, or from amorphous lignin, have recently obtained significant attention owing to their elevated accessibility and low density. Nevertheless, while literature on fully biodegradable nanocomposite blends containing nanofillers from plant and animal origin is quite extensive, research on hybrid systems is relatively unexplored. According to this, a deep revision of current results and overall performance of hybrid (bio-based plus synthetic matrices) polymeric nanocomposites containing different nanofillers (mainly bio-based ones) will follow.</p>
