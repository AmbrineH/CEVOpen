Results highlighted that the blends realized without clay are characterized by high thermal stability and tensile durability, compared to those realized with sepiolite. The nanocomposite blends showed comparable thermal profile, lower tensile strength and Young’s modulus values, and enhanced deformation at break and tensile toughness with respect of PLA nanocomposites. These data evidenced how clay dispersion, type of microstructure of the various blends, localization of the sepiolite in several phases, thermomechanical degradation of the PLA through melt blending, and grafting level of the utilized compatibilizer ingredients were critical for the successful performance of the materials.

 <xref rid="B289-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">289</xref>] considered the blending of poly lactic acid (PLA)/linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) polymeric nanocomposites, realized using two commercial-grade nanoclays: due to the selective localization of the nanoclays in the PLA phase, the systems that were realized applying a two stages mixing procedure showed interesting biodegradability, microstructure, and improved melt resistance in comparison to the one step mixing process.
