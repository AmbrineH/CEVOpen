 <xref rid="B278-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">278</xref>] determined an enhancement in the material stiffness, mechanical characteristics, water resistance, and thermal stability. Tang and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B279-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">279</xref>] developed several PVA–starch/nano-silicon dioxide (SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) biodegradable blend films and discovered that the mechanism responsible for the improved tensile strength and water resistance of the composites was the formation of a strong chemical bond between nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and PVA–starch blend. They also analyzed the biodegradability of nano-SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reinforced starch/PVOH nanocomposites and the results underlined that nanoparticles had no important control on biodegradability of films. Spiridon et al. [
 <xref rid="B280-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">280</xref>], on the other hand, analyzed degradation of clay/starch/PVOH nanocomposites and determined that films biodegradation is related to both typology and number of nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles delayed the biodegradation degree.
