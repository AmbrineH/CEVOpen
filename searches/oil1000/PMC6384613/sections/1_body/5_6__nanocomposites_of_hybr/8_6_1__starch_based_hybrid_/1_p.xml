Two nanofillers (sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and SNCs (starch nanocrystals)) were used and their achievements on overall performance of nanocomposites were investigated. This study unfolded the synergistic influence of SNC and Na-MMT to modulate mechanical characteristics, mostly in 3 wt % of the total amount of nanofillers in 50:50 (
