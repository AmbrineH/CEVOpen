<p class="p">(a) Gas barrier properties: It was studied that biodegradable polymeric matrices show fine resistance to the oxygen transmission and, presently, several strategies are achieved to adjust their barrier characteristics. Nevertheless, the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) is superior in bio packaging with respect to conventionally-utilized polymeric matrices, with the consequence that the shelf-life of foods decreased. Similarly, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> barrier performance of polymeric matrices is also largely significant in packages for fresh foodstuffs. Conventional high barrier systems contain the presence of numerous layers to create a system with the necessary features; similarly, two or more bio-based polymeric matrices can be arranged to design a polymeric system taking the essential requirements [
