<p class="p">(d) Compostability: It is one of the main significant conditions of bio polymeric matrices, as it changes their attitude to the disintegration and modifies the degradation behavior of wastes into advantageous soil products. The disintegration of polymeric materials in composting soil depends essentially on characteristics of the polymeric sources. The first stage of disintegration in composting soil is typically based on the hydrolytic process that damages the polymeric materials, and hydrolytic level is related to the water vapor diffusion of the substance [
