<p class="p">In the last decades, after the signing of the environmental treaty on the 11th December 1997, that became law on the 16th February 2005, the environmental issue related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate changes was definitively raised and made one of the most important worldwide concerns, particularly in the face of toxic waste, pollution, contamination, exhaustion of natural resources, and environmental deterioration. As a result, different studies have been followed at diverse stages to develop different and strategic alternatives [

A serious alarm is the field of packaging, which, every year, causes enormous quantities of petroleum-based wastes that are stored in particular areas around the planet (26% of the plastic manufacture volume has been applied in the packaging sector) [

 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In the future years, especially in 2030 and 2050, it was estimated that the quantity of plastic wastes due to the packaging sector will be grown by two-fold and three-fold, respectively [

Notwithstanding the environmental impacts, plastic materials are extremely useful in the packaging sector, due to positive and synergic combination of main characteristics, such as transparency, strength ability, flexibility, thermal performance, permeability, and simple sterilization methods, all of which making them appropriate for the food packaging sector. Hitherto, petroleum-based polymers (i.e., ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PU), poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene, polyamides (PA), and poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC)) have led in the packaging function, for excellent mechanical and physical characteristics. However, according to results from plastics recycling and recovery data obtained from European associations in 2014, only 39.5% of post-consumer plastic waste is going to be re-used, while 38.6% of post-consumer plastic waste is considered for energy recovery [

With the intention of minimizing the environmental impacts induced by post-consumer plastic waste, bio-based polymers should be selected to realize short-lifespan devices. Environmentally friendly systems are appropriate solutions to realize disposable systems [

 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; on the other hand, green polymeric systems are only used for some specific applications, due to their limiting characteristics, such as high cost and scarce mechanical and thermomechanical properties with respect of traditional commodity polymers. Developing green and eco-friendly polymeric blends with acceptable characteristics can overcome these limitations, even if it has been recently demonstrated that biodegradable plastic blends need both accurate cautious postconsumer organization and additional design to consent fast biodegradation in numerous environment conditions (as their release into the environment can determine plastic pollution) [
