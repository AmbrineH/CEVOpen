<p class="p">In the present review, the blending of commodities and bio-based and/or biodegradable polymers will be taken into account (limiting the study to this class of materials and not considering blends where both components have a bio-based composition or origin), and special emphasis will be given to their functional behavior in terms of packaging application (compostability, gas/water/light barrier properties, migration, antioxidant performance). In addition, to better analyze the effect of green nanosized ingredients on the overall behavior of systems composed of synthetic polymers, combined with biodegradable and/or bio-based plastics, the effect of the inclusion of bio-based nanofillers has been investigated.</p>
