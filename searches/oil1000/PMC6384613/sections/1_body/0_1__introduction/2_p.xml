 <xref rid="B13-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], who studied and investigated blends based on starch and ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers and still now starch, being cheap, continues to be an attractive substitute to realize systems for the packaging sector [

 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], growing the renewable amount or lessening the overall weight of petroleum-based plastics have been considered as suitable options. Todayâ€™s sustainable plastics are not automatically biodegradable and even contain polyolefins made from renewable feedstocks [
