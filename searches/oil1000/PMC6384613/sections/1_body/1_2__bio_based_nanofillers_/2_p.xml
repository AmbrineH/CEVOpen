<p class="p">In this review, the current status of nanotechnology in packaging and also in food packaging systems are briefly reviewed and summarized. Nanofillers can be extracted from organic or inorganic sources; here the authors focused their attention to describe the main characteristics of nanofillers extracted from bio-based/natural sources (plant and animal origin and nanofillers from proteins) applied in the packaging sector. An explanation of different nanofillers, with an emphasis on the functionality, synthesis, characteristics, and structure is included.</p>
