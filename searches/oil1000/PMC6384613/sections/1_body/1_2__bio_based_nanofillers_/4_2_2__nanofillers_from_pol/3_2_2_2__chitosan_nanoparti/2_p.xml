The nanoparticle dimensions of PEGMA-graft-CSNPs were distributed from 30 to 100 nm. The strategy was studied to improve the compatibility, the mechanical, and the thermal characteristics of poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The mechanical properties of the PEGMA-graft-CSNP/PLA blends showed an improvement in terms of deformation at break, and a reduction of the tensile modulus brittle behavior to a more ductile behavior. In the case of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) films, antimicrobial packaging systems, combining different quantities of chitosan nanofibers (CS-NF), have been obtained by applying the solvent casting procedure; the biocomposites had high stiffness, strength, and glass transition temperatures, and low ductility, water vapor, and oxygen permeability. For all the nanocomposites, the migrated quantities in polar and non-polar food simulants were significantly under the overall limits recognized by the present legislation on food contact products. The produced films showed antimicrobial effect towards foodborne pathogens [
