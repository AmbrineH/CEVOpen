<p class="p">Nanochitosan is a green extract with exceptional physicochemical characteristics; it is characterized by bioactivity that does not damage humans [
 <xref rid="B76-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. It is largely utilized as a controlled release drug carrier, and, for gene transfer, Nanochitosan has been applied to realize systems with improved strength and wash ability of textiles, conferring antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B77-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Chitosan at the nanoscale can be realized considering precipitation or coagulation, ionic cross-linking, emulsion droplet coalescence, and covalent cross-linking procedure. Berthold and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B78-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] obtained chitosan particles by considering sodium sulfate as a precipitation agent and incorporating a dispersant (Tween 80) to the chitosan acidic solution. Tian and Groves and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B79-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] enhanced this procedure and obtained chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs, 600–800 nm). Ohya and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B80-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] proposed the use of glutaraldehyde to cross-link the free amino groups of chitosan; this was a water-in-oil (W=O) emulsifier, realizing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chitosan particles (size: 0.8–0.1 mm).
