<p class="p">Nanochitin has received a crucial position in nanocomposite materials as the filler phase, due to its intrinsic properties [
 <xref rid="B63-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The physiochemical and biological properties (light weight, small size, natural and biodegradable character, chemical stability, and non-cytotoxicity) of chitin at nanoscale dimensions make this material a valid candidate for utilization in food packaging and biomedical sectors [
 <xref rid="B63-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], especially thanks to its high antibacterial effect [

 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Chitin is characterized by antimicrobial activity, this character is related to its chemical organization consisting of (1,4)-b-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-replicating units. Likewise to starch and cellulose nano-fillers, a broad variety of nanocomposites exploited the interesting mechanical characteristics of nanochitin in polymeric-based systems [
