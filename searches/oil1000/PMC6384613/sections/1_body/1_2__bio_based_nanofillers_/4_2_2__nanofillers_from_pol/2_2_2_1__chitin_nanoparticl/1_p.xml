<p class="p">Chitin is one of the most copious natural polymers obtained from shellfish waste (exoskeleton/shells), and it is used in combination with biopolymers to realize nanocomposites with modulated properties, in respect to the neat matrices, principally for food packaging and biomedical applications. Chitin is extracted from cuticles of insects and exoskeleton of arthropods at the micro/nanoscale (length: 200–300 nm; diameter: 10–20 nm) [
