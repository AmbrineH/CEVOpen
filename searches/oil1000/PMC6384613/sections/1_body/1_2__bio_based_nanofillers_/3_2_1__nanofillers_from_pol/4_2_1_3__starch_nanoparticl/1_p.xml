<p class="p">Starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin. The amylose is a linear and long molecule built up of 1,4-linked β-D-glucose, although in the amylopectin chains the glucose monomers are linked through α-1,6-linkages, determining an extremely branched arrangement. Therefore, the molecular structure of amylose is simpler than amylopectin, showing a linear structure with few α-1,6-branches [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Amylopectin generally is the main component of starch, composed by short chains and a high number of α-1,6-branches (5% of the molecule) [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], while amylose, in general, is randomly arranged among the amylopectin molecules in the amorphous regions. Amylose plays an important part on the structure of the amylopectin in the crystalline lamellae by cross-linking the two polysaccharides [
