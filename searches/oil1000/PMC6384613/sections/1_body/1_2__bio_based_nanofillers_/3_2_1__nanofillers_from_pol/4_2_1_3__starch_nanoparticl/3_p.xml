<p class="p">The purification of starch granules with appropriate chemical treatments allow one to obtain nanoparticles (SNP). In general, many different approaches can be selected and applied to starch with the intention to obtain granules, while their conversion in NPs is usually carried out by applying acid hydrolysis. The structural differences in starch granule sizes affects the outcome of the process in terms of starch purification, characteristics, and nanocrystal yield [
