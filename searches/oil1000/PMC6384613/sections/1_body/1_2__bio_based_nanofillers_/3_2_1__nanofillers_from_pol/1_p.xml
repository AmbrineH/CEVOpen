<p class="p">In literature, different works have proposed the study of extraction and analysis of nanofillers from polysaccharides with a plant origin: cellulose nanofibers/nanocrystals, lignin, and starch nanoparticles. The lignocellulosic source is one of the most copious renewable materials existing in the world; these materials are natural, eco-friendly, sustainable, biodegradable, and considered as low-cost materials, with advantageous properties and with a significant value for packaging and industrial sectors. In comparison with petroleum-based natural sources, some interesting advantages are found: (i) low density and low cost, (ii) high variety, (iii) specific modulus and strength, (iv) reactive surfaces that can be changed and functionalized by a large variety of reactive chemical groups, (v) high applicability in nanocomposites, (vi) high recyclability in respect to inorganic fillers [

Lignocellulosic materials are generally composed by cellulose (40–50 wt %), hemicellulose (20–30 wt %), and lignin (about 10–25 wt %), and the quantities of the different components can be different according to the native lignocellulosic origin source [
