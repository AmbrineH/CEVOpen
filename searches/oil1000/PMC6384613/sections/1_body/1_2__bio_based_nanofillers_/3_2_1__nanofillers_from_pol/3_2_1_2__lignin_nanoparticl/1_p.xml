<p class="p">Lignin is the second most abundant aromatic polymeric material on earth. It is a cross-linked macromolecule in a three-dimensional shape, composed by three typologies of alternative phenols, yielding numerous functional groups and linkages, with a mutable chemistry as a consequence of its native source [

Furthermore, the lignin tendency to self-aggregate shows some disadvantages in terms of their dispersion in thermoplastic, thermoset, or elastomer-based systems. Therefore, many strategies have been considered and attempted in order to improve the dispersion of lignin particles into bio-based polymers [
