<p class="p">Cellulose is the natural polymer largely diffused on Earth, with excellent biocompatibility, good chemical and thermal stability, and high hydrophilicity. These attractive characteristics have determined cellulose as an interesting material for different applications in packaging and in biomedical applications. The cellulosic nanofillers are categorized on the basis of preparation methods considered for their extraction from native cellulose; they can be found as bacterial cellulose (BC) synthesized through microorganisms, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) or nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), or cellulose nanocrystals/nanocrystalline cellulose, also named cellulose nanowhiskers, (CNC). MCF is pulled out by means of a mechanical retting/disintegration method, starting from a variety of cellulosic extracts, including wood and non-wood fibers [

This effect influences a number of extremely interesting characteristics, such as an exceptionally high-water holding capability and the capacity to realize a configuration with strong gels at low concentrations. Although microfibrillated cellulose is not soluble in water, it can show several characteristics of water-soluble cellulose derivatives. Simultaneously, it has some advantages, such as stability over the whole pH range, at elevated temperatures and at elevated salt concentrations [

This elevated aspect ratio characterizes the material high strength as functional in several applications, such as the reinforcement phase for composites and films, and as an agent to modulate the barrier performance. Chemically extracted CNC are characterized by acicular structure and rigid rod-like particles, monocrystalline domains of 100 to hundreds of nanometers in length, and 1–100 nm in diameter (

The extraordinary mechanical characteristics (Young’s modulus is higher than glass fibers and comparable to Kevlar (60–125 GPa)) give to cellulose crystal the role of a perfect filler material for the preparation of polymer composites. CNCs exhibit enormous applications in the biomedical sector and in bio-based material science [
