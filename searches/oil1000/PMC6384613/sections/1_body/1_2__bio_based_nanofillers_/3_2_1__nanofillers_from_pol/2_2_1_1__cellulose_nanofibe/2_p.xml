<p class="p">Cellulose nanocrystals were largely used and applied to realize nanocomposites with modulated properties in respect to the neat matrices. Several studies, reported in literature, analyzed their effect in biodegradable matrices and polymeric blends, even in the presence of natural active ingredients and antimicrobial nanoparticles [
