Different nanocomposite-based systems have been realized by combining different polymers (petroleum-based and biodegradable/bio-based), and fillers at the nanoscale level. The nanofillers show strong reinforcing effects, several works have also analyzed their positive behavior in terms of barrier and mechanical properties, characteristics of essential importance in packaging and food packaging applications [
