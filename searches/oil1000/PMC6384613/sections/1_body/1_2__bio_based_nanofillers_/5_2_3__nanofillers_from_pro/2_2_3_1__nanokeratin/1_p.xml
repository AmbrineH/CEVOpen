<p class="p">Keratins are natural proteins [
 <xref rid="B82-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] mostly diffused in poultry feather horns of animals, hair, and wool [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Keratin-based biomaterials have been essentially studied to realize hydrogels, films, scaffolds, and dressing, which were applied to get several biomedical disposals, as well as wound healing, cell culture, bone, and nerve regeneration, due to their essential biocompatibility and biodegradability [
