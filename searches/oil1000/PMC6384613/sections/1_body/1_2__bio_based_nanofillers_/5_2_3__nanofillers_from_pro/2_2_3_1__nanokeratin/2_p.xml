Nanobiocomposites with high-barrier properties, based on the mixture of PHAs with nanokeratin, showed different morphologies, such as spherical nanoparticles and fibrillar sizes (

They were productively designed and realized via both: (i) direct melting technique; and (ii) pre-incorporated into an electrospun masterbatch of PHA, which was then melt compounded with PHA. Improved barrier characteristics for nanocomposites were experientially investigated and were seen to be related to PHA grade. Secondly, nanokeratin films, extracted using the solvent casting technique, were hydrophobized by coating them with electrospun PHA fibers. The multilayered selection was characterized by good adhesion and led to the improvement of the ultimate barrier properties.
