<p class="p">Gelatin is a biodegradable protein extracted from natural sources by applying acid- or base-catalyzed hydrolysis of collagen. Gelatin is largely used in biomedical application. It is a polyampholyte macro-molecule characterized by the presence of anionic, cationic, and hydrophobic groups [
 <xref rid="B89-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Gelatin molecules have repeating strings of alanine, amino acid triplets, proline, and glycine that influence the triple helical structure of gelatin. The high reliability of gelatin is due to its exceptional triplehelix organization, due to three polypeptide chains [
