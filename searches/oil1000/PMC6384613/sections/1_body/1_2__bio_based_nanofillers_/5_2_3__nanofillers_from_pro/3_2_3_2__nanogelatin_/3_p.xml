 <xref rid="B100-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>] efficiently made hybrid nanocomposite films realized with chitosan, polyethylene glycol, gelatin, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), applying a solvent casting procedure, and the researches on packaging of red grapes underlined that the shelf life of the fruit was prolonged for a supplementary two weeks in case of the hybrid film. Other than blending, gelatin as nanoparticles can find application in the food sector as nanocarrier systems for the controlled delivery of a variety of food supplements and additives.
