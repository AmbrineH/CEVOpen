<p class="p">On the other hand, even though it is obvious that important development has been completed in reducing numerous characteristic issues with aliphatic polyesters, there is still a requirement for further advancements. Almost all the processes that are practicable nowadays utilize, also, traditional petrochemical and non-compostable ingredients, or do not present the development economics needed (the content of these ingredients that can be utilized are also restricted if compostability is yet a condition). In detail, in some blanket positive assessment of bio-based and biodegradable plastics, it is frequently forgotten that energy from petroleum fuels is also utilized in their fabrication—be it in the sowing of crops, harvesting, fermentation, transport, etc. It is, consequently, necessary to evaluate a product’s complete life cycle, because only after this evaluation is it feasible to carry out scientifically sound life cycle assessment comparisons and reach a logical conclusion about a product’s sustainability.</p>
