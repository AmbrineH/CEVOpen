<p class="p">Every year, 125 million tons of plastic materials are utilized worldwide, of which 25% is utilized for packaging aims. It is obvious that the possible business for packaging systems is massive if they can be realized with good functionality, processability, and at an interesting and advantageous price. This is the high request for the producers of biopolymers oriented to the packaging sector, that have to deal with conventional plastics, which are available at low price, are easy to be realized, and with modulated and improved packaging characteristics [
