<p class="p">Finally, sustainability of the polymeric matrix production will center on the successful presence of novel polymeric matrices that are extracted/obtained from yearly renewable sources. These resources must have reasonable end of life possibilities (e.g., they should be able to be reused by chemical or physical means, biodegraded to inoffensive mixtures, or minimally destroyed to recuperate the energy amount). Alternatively, “unsustainable polymers” may yet contribute as key roles in advancing sustainability, as lately underlined in a research work in Chemical and Engineering News [
 <xref rid="B283-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">283</xref>], centered on food packaging systems with whole multilayered polymeric systems, where it has been conclusively remarked how the cost of plastic packaging is certainly high, but the cost of not using it may be higher.
