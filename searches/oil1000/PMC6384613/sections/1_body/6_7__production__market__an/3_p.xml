<p class="p">The “Bio-Based Polymers Producer Database,“ which is incessantly updated by the Nova-Institute, exhibits that Europe’s running situation in creating bio-based polymeric matrices is restricted to a few number of polymeric matrices. The European community has so far determined a solid role, principally in the area of starch blending materials (polymeric blending based on the combination of polymers with starch or thermoplastic starch) and it is anticipated to continue to be solid in this specific sector for the following few years. Commercial examples of starch-based blends with conventional polymers (Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene (PP), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS)) can be found, such as Cereplast and Teknor Apex products (Starch/LLDPE, Starch/PP, Starch/HIPS from 30/70 up to 50/50 wt %, Starch/LLDPE and Starch/PP up to 50/50 wt %), TPS/synthetic copolyesters/additives from BIOP and TPS/polyolefins hybrid from Biograde and Cardia Bioplastics. Similarly, for polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), new progresses in the realization of bio-based 1,4 butanediol (BDO) have established that the ecofriendly course to the polymer is commercially operable and its realization is deliberated to be introduced by 2020. The market size is quite differentiated, taking into account that some sectors taken by conventional plastics (PS, PVC, PET) have been now targeted by eco-friendly compostable plastic materials, such as poly lactic acid (PLA), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA’s). Exact objective markets contain the catering-service manufacturing in single uses, such as plates, disposable eating utensils, foamed cups, containers, and bowls (
