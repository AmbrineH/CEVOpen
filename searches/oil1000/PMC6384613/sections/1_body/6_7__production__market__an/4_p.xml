<p class="p">Other markets are represented by green or moderately bio-based non-biodegradable thermally-processable materials, such as eco-friendly PVC, PP, PE, or PET: In 2010, the inclusion of a 100% bio-material comparable to HDPE by Braskem changed the bioplastics sector, requiring at the same time a renewable resource component and a compostability behavior. Obtained from sugar cane ethanol, this material is chemically comparable to petrochemical extracts, thus can be utilized in the same sector. Similarly, bio-PVC can be realized totally from natural sources. Since 2007, Solvay Indupa, the Brazilian arm of Belgium-based chemical colossal Solvay, established strategies to utilize Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as a PVC raw material. At the moment, Bio-PET contains bio-based glycol extracted from sugar cane ethanol and the amount of renewable carbon was estimated at around 20%. </p>
