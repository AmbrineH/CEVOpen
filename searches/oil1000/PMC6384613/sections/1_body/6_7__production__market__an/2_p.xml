<p class="p">The large amount of green food packaging systems are quite expensive in respect to fossil-based systems [
 <xref rid="B291-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">291</xref>]. The price for commodity plastics is largely centered in the range $1.32â€“$3.3/kg. Unluckily, no exact evaluation of price for traditional and bio-based systems is accessible. It was estimated that bio-based materials are three to five times more expensive in comparison to traditional packaging systems [
 <xref rid="B292-materials-12-00471" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">292</xref>]. The higher drivers of the cost to realize green materials include the cost for mobilizing biomass wastes, cost for technical and scientific innovations, and the lack of economies-of-scale (introduction of a eco-friendly bio-based creation chain, from natural wastes and biomass wastes to final bio-based material is a difficult and expensive procedure, moreover novelties are required to adjust present bioconversion procedures to new typologies of feedstock, or improve new procedures).
