<p id="Par29" class="p">Thus, the optimum growth for all mutated strains was after 96 h of culture, with significantly higher rates than the wild strains. The kinetics monitoring of the biomass productivity suggests that for all mutated strains, the maximum growth coincided with the optimum of the biomass recovered at 96 h. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a, b showed that BP augmented significantly to reach 0.68 and 0.61 mg/ml/h for MR-2 and MY-2, respectively. For MT-2, MD-2 and MC-2, the biomass productivities were estimated to be 0.29; 0.19 and 0.21 mg/ml/h and which were significantly higher than the wild strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c–e). The noticeably increased growth rate of mutants may be explained by the fact that some mutants have an enhanced metabolic pathway to improve cell growth. Analogous improvements of growth using random mutagenesis were mentioned to be in various other mutant microorganisms, including

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], the reduction of cell growth is correlated with the inhibition of lipid biosynthesis metabolism that is stimulated by a different mutant agent such as UV, EMS, and MNNG.
