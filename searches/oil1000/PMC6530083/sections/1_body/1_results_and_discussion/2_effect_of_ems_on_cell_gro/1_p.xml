<p id="Par27" class="p">During the last decades, mutagenesis on marine yeast was performed using various agents such as irradiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], heavy-ion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] or UV/EMS/NTG on a random mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Studies on marine yeast related to the effect of EMS are scarce and the present work is the first study using such agent following various times of exposure. Using the optimal condition of EMS concentration (75 mM) and volume (50 µl), the effect of EMS on cell growth of the different yeast strains following various time of exposure is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> where codes were added for each strain at each time of EMS exposure. Statistical analysis (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) showed that each strain reacted differently, but with similar trend of change. Thus, each strain has a specific response that can be summarized with cell death rate that ranged from 13.17 to 88.78%; 12.54 to 88.42% and 21.86 to 92.30%, respectively, for YlTun15, RmTun15 and TaTun15 between 15 and 60 min. For 
 <italic class="italic">D. hansenii DhTun2015</italic>, the mortality rate varied between 22.07% at 15 min and 96.84% at 45 min, reaching 100% at 60 min. Regarding 
 <italic class="italic">C. tenuis CtTun15</italic>, the total mortality rate was reached at 45 min and increased from 54.46% at 15 min to 93.89% at 30 min. It is worth noting that the effect of EMS is also related to its concentration in the medium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Mobini-Dehkordi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] found that EMS mutagenesis affects cell viability of the yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reaching 43% after 45 min of exposure to EMS. Tapia et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>] reported that after 40-min irradiation, the colony number of the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Lipomyces starkeyi</italic> was reduced to approximately to 5% of the total colonies present in control plates. Ma et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] found that heavy-ion mutagenesis had the same effect on the mortality rate of 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis</italic> that was enhanced from 15 to 89% with increasing irradiation doses. Doan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] and Anandarajah et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] in EMS mutagenesis for 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis</italic> had also reported similar phenomenon. 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> cells exposed to 0.28-M EMS showed a survival rate of 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] and Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] observed that 0.6–0.8 M of EMS was the optimal mutagenic range for 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodesmus</italic> sp. S81 and G41 with survival rate of 30.66 ± 0.57% and 39.28 ± 1.13%, respectively, for 30 min of treatment. Nojima et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] found for the strain 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorococcum</italic> sp. FFG039 that the treatment with 0.25–0.5-M EMS or MNNG results in a survival rate between 0 and 10%. The effect of EMS on survival rate was also detected in the red algae 
 <italic class="italic">P. yezoensis</italic>, the percentage of living cells decreased upon exposure to 1 and 2 mM of EMS to 52 and 10% at day 5, respectively, and was null for higher concentrations of EMS (3 and 4 mM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>].
