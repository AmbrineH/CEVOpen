<p id="Par30" class="p">The effect of the treatment with EMS was also detected on the yield of lipid and lipid productivity. The lipid yield (L), lipid content (wt%) and final lipid productivity (LP) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. Thus, the increase in biomass induced an increase in the lipid yield with a maximum of 3.21 ± 0.09 g/100 g of wet biomass of the strain MC-1. The final lipid productivity increased significantly from 0.022 in wild CtTun15 to 0.027 mg/ml/h in MC-1 and then decreased to 0.024 mg/ml/h in MC-2. Wild strain of 
 <italic class="italic">D. hansenii</italic> DhTun2015, MD-1 and MD-2 had a mean yield of 2.19 g/100 g of wet biomass (mean LP 0.019 mg/ml/h) and then decreased significantly to 1.36 ± 0.19 g/100 g wet biomass with a lipid productivity of 0.112 mg/ml/h in MD-3. The wild strain 
 <italic class="italic">R. mucilaginosa RmTun15 and Y. lipolytica YlTun15</italic>, known as oleaginous yeasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] produced 8.18 ± 0.02 and 10.32 ± 0.21 g/100 g lipid (wet biomass). Among the four mutant strains of RmTun15, MR-2 showed the highest lipid productivity with 0.130 mg/ml/h. This mutant strain showed 11.82 ± 0.33 g/100 g of wet biomass, which was significantly higher than the lipid yield of the wild strain, MR-1, MR-3 and MR-4. The mutant strains showed a higher lipid content than the wild strain (36%) with a maximum of 46%, 38% and 39% for MR-2, MR-3 and MR-4, respectively. An increased lipid yield (13.22 ± 0.11 g/100 g of wet biomass) and a high lipid productivity (0.130 mg/ml/h) were found in MY-2 strain. Concerning TaTun15, a significant rise of 0.82% was noticed in MT-1 when compared to the wild strain. For MT-2, MT-3 and MT-4, however, the mean lipid yield was 5.77 g/100 g (wet biomass) and a mean lipid productivity of 0.058 mg/ml/h. According to Dai et al. [

Kitahara et al. [
