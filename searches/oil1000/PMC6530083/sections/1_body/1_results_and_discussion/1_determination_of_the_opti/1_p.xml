<p id="Par25" class="p">A preliminary study was carried out to determine the optimum of growth for each wild yeast strain as well as the number of colonies formed. During a cultivation period of 144 h in YPD, all species showed an optimum growth after 120 h, but with different values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). To determinate the effect of mutagenesis, the wild species were subjected to various levels of EMS (25, 75 and 100 mM) in different volumes (15, 50 and 100 µl) during a fixed period (20 min). Using

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1). As single factors, the concentration and the volume of the mutant agent have significant effects on both colonies numbers counted and growth (
