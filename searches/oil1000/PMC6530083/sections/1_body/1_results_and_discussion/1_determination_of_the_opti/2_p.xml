<p id="Par26" class="p">The relationship between independent and dependent variables has been illustrated by the three-dimensional (3D) representation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). To each plot and for each strain, individual contour curve corresponded to an infinity responses of the tested variables combination including their impact on cell viability (number of colony) and growth (OD at 600 nm). Hence, for all strains, the number of colonies decreased with increased EMS concentration and volume. However, the cell growth increased with both rising variables up to 75 mM EMS level than showed significant decrease. As shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, the lethal doses and volumes for CtTun15 species corresponded, respectively, to 75 mM/100 μl in experiment 1; 100 mM/50 µl in experiment 2; and 100 mM/100 μl in experiment 5. Such lethal doses/volumes were depicted in experiment 5 for the remaining strains but additionally for DhTun15 in experiment 1. In experiment 9, where EMS volume was 50 μl and concentration was 75 mM, all surviving mutated yeast strains presented the best growth. The combination defined in experiment 9 was considered as optimal as it reflected the best growth in all strains, although the high mortality rate was recorded in such conditions indicating the mutagenic efficiency of the procedure as suggested in other study [
