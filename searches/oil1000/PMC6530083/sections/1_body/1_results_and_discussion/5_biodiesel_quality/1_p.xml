<p id="Par36" class="p">According to international standards, biodiesel must follow some criteria such as ASTM 6751-3 (USA), EN 14214 (Europe) and Bureau of Indian Standard (IS 15607-05) for biodiesel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. The fatty acid profile determines the quality of biodiesel and it has been recommended that higher proportions of methyl esters of both C16 and C18 SFAs and MUFAs with reasonable amounts of PUFAs are required for a good quality of Biodiesel [

The choice of such strains was based on their optimum lipid yield and fatty acid profile. Biodiesel proprieties can be classified into different categories with the most important being those related to engines, weather conditions, transport and depositing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. The cetane number (CN) was considered as a primary indicator of fuel quality that gives idea on the speed and the compression needed for the ignition. In this study, CN varied significantly from wild to mutant stain. Thus, CN increased from 45.26 ± 2.62 in RmTun15 to mean value of 55 min in MR-2 and MR-3 values that are near to the recommended value of standard fuel. The mean value of CN in MY-2 and MY-3 was 32.65 min which statistically is &lt; wild strain CN (59.53 ± 0.39 min). However, for TaTun15, this parameter increased meaningfully from 50.96 ± 4.36 to 67.15 ± 1.29 in MT-2 and 60.08 ± 0.94 in MT-3. To evaluate the stability to oxidation of biodiesel, the iodine value (IV) was estimated. For RmTun15, MR-2 and MR-3, the mean value of this index was 107.43 ± 2.86 gI

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/100 g). Regarding the saponification value (SV) or the acid value, the statistical analysis showed that all wild strains (TaTun15, RmTun15 and YlTun15) have a mean value of 213.81 ± 3.47 mg KOH which decreased significantly in mutated MY-2 and 3 (195.19 ± 1.02 mg KOH); MR-2 and 3 (153.23 ± 3.74 mg KOH) and MT-2and 3 (146.78 ± 2.29 mg KOH). This variation can be explained by the modification of the fatty acid composition with an increase of the medium and long-chain fatty acid. The oxidation stability was evaluated for the mutated strain with a mean value of 19.74 ± 1.10 h for MR-2 and MR-3; 20.94 ± 2.26 h for MT-2 and MT-3 and 18.26 ± 1.03 h for MY-2 and MY-3.

Comparing the results of biodiesel predicted to the different strains of this study, we found a similarity with the genus mentioned in some indices such as the cetane number, the iodine value, the kinematic value and cold filter plugging point which was close to the standard parameter of biodiesel (ASTM D6751, EN14214, Indian Biodiesel IS15607 and the commercial biodiesel). According to Knothe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>], the quality of biodiesel depends on the fatty acid composition of the biolipids. Conferring to Khot and Ghosh [
