 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. To evaluate the effect of the chemical mutagenesis using EMS on the quality and the composition of oil, we determine the profile of fatty acid from lipid produced by the wild and mutant strains (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The fatty acid composition of CtTun15-wild strain showed a high content of saturated fatty acid (32.78%), of which C15 accounted for 27% of the total identified FA. Moreover, this strain is rich in PUFA with essentially C16:2 (15.5%) and C18:2 (15.26%). Changes in the FA profile and concentration occurred following mutagenesis. Thus, for MC-1 and MC-2, the C15:0 fraction decreased significantly with an average of 10.87%; while C18:0 increased from 3.74 to 5.54% and 9.45% for MC-1 and MC-2, respectively. The C18:2 represented 22.66% at MC-1 and about 30% at MC-2. The level of MUFA doubled in MC-1 (9.36%) and then decreased to 6% for MC-2, while remaining higher than the control strain (4%). The increase in the PUFA level is dependent on the occurrence and detection of new PUFAs such as C18: 2, C20: 1; C20: 4, C20: 5, C22: 5, and C22: 6. As for RmTun15, the control strain profile is distributed mainly in SFA (38%), mostly C16 (27%) and C18 (6%), and PUFAs (45%), where C16: 2 and C18:2 represent 29 and 8%, respectively, of the total fatty acids. After mutagenesis, the lipid profile changed and there was a significant increase in MUFA levels with an average of 43.53% represented by C18: 1 (30.55%) in MR-2 and MR-3. In the MR-4 strain, the FA composition changed as the wild and MR-1 strains remained statistically different and the percentage of SFA and PUFA increased to 43 and 45%, respectively, whilst MUFA decreased to 2%. The lipid profile analysis of the wild strain DhTun2015 showed that the SFA fraction represented 66% of which C15:0 fatty acid was predominant (47%) and MUFA and PUFA represented 15 and 18%, respectively. After mutagenesis, the saturated fatty acid composition of MD-1 is similar to the wild type (with 47% C15:0). This content decreased significantly in MD-2 and MD-3. The PUFA fraction increased significantly from 18% in wild strain to 20; 23 and 32% in MD-1, MD-2 and MD-3, respectively.
