 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. In addition, French et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>] reported that EMS is a powerful chemical mutagen and its effect on cells is allied to its concentration in a medium. This study may conclude that chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methane sulfonate affects not only biomass productivity and lipid productivity but also the lipid profile, which guides the application of the strains according to desired, ends (Biofuel, PUFA production, etc.). For a betterÂ understanding of lipid metabolism in both mutated and wild strain of RmTun15; DhTun2015; CtTun15; TaTun15 and YlTun15, RNA sequencing and comparison of differential gene expression will be investigated in the future.
