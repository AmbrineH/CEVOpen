<p id="Par33" class="p">For TaTun15, there was a significant decrease in SFA content in MT-2 (22%) and MT-3 (18%) compared to the wild species with an average of 20%. This decrease is mainly dependent on the fall of C15:0 followed by C16:0 and C18:0. For MT-2 and MT-3, the average of the MUFA and PUFA fractions were 34 and 18% respectively with C22: 5, representing 10% of the total identified PUFA fraction. Concluding with YlTun15, a relatively balanced profile of FA was found in MY-2 and MY-3 with 21% AGS; 40% MUFA and 33% PUFA. Regarding MY-1 and MY-4, a profile similar to that of wild strain was found with the fraction SFA &gt; PUFA &gt; MUFA. The spectacular variation in the fatty acid profile of the different mutant strains can be related to the modification and the regulation of the gene involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acid [
