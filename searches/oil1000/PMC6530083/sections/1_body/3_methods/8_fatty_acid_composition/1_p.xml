 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. The lipid fraction was diluted in toluene. To 500 µl of the reaction mix, in screw-capped glass tubes, 50 µl of nonadecanoic acid (C19:0) was added to the reaction as an internal standard. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 1 ml of sodium methoxide were added and the sample was mixed briefly then placed in a shaking incubator (900 rpm) at 80 °C for 30 min. The mixture was cooled for 10 min at room temperature and 1 ml of HCl/methanol was added before repeating the incubation. After cooling, 1 ml of bidistilled water and 0.5 ml of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-Hexane for GC were added and the tubes were mixed by vortexing. The upper hexane layer containing FAMEs extract was transferred to vials for GC and kept at − 20 °C until analysis. The analysis of the fatty acids was carried out by GC HP model 6890 equipped with an INNOWAX polar capillary column (30 m in length and 0.25 μm in diameter), a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and an injector splitted. The volume of injection was 1 μl. Fatty acids were identified by comparing the retention times of FAME with SUPELCO™ 19-component FAME mixture (PUFA no. 3, Sigma-Aldrich). Three replicate GC analyses were performed.
