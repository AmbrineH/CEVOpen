<p id="Par42" class="p">Optimizing concentration and volume of EMS for the different marine yeast species was carried out using the surface response method and 
 <italic class="italic">Statistica 13.3 software</italic>. The following values were adopted for determining dependent and independent variables: x-concentration of EMS varying from 25 to 100 mM; 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-volume of EMS (ml) from 15 to 100 µl, 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>1-number of colonies forming (CFU) and 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>2-growth measured by the optical density at 600 nm OD (600 nm). In this study, the experiment was planned using the 3**(2-0) full factorial design, 3 blocks, 9 runs in the 
 <italic class="italic">Statistica 13.3 software</italic>. Central composite design was used for planning, and 9 experiments were performed for two independent factors as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. According to the presented plan, 9 random experiments were performed for each species with three replicates for each experiment.
