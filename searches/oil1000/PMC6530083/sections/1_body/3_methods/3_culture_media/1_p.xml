<p id="Par40" class="p">From the plate culture of each strain stored at 4 °C, a loop of cell mass was transferred aseptically to 30-ml YPD media (2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract and 100 ppm chloramphenicol) and then incubated in an orbital shaker (LabWit ZWY-240) at 160 rpm and 30 °C for reactivation. Then, from this preculture, YPD cultures were prepared in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks (50-ml working volume) with a starting OD of 0.4 at 600 nm. 100 ppm chloramphenicol was added to the culture medium which was incubated at 26° C with a stirring speed of 160 rpm. Samples were taken at 24-h intervals, in triplicate, to determine cell growth, biomass, and lipid accumulation.</p>
