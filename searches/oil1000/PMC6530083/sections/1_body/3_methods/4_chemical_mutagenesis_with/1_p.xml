 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>]. Briefly, the different species were grown in a YPD medium at 30 °C for 12 h. For each culture, 108 washed cells were placed in 15-ml tubes and suspended in 5-ml phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH:7). Under the hood, EMS was added to each tube, except the non-mutagenized control, and the cells were incubated on a roller at 30° C for varying time points between 0 min and 1 h. At each time point, 8 ml of sterile 5% sodium thiosulfate was added to inactivate the EMS and to stop the mutagenesis. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in distilled water, from which plating was applied on YPD agar for 2–3 days until colonies appeared. Finally, the plate was stored at 4° C to await further analysis. Mutated strains are designed as mentioned in Table
