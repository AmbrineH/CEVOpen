<p id="Par37" class="p">The modification induced by the mutant EMS changed the biomass and the lipid productivity of the strains TaTun15; YlTun15; DhTun2015 CtTun15 and RmTun15. This has made it possible to provide competent strains that can be oriented towards various uses (production of carotenoids, EPA, etc.). The fatty acid compositions confirm the oleaginous proprieties of the identified yeasts that were similar to other oily microbes. In addition, depending on the fatty acid profile and the physical properties of the biodiesel, it was concluded that the mutated strain incubated with EMS (75 mM) for 30 min of

 <italic class="italic">T. asahii</italic> TaTun15 (MT-2; MT-3) and 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> YlTun15 (MY-2), constitute a potential for the production of Biodiesel. Further study will be conducted to isolate and identify the genes responsible for the over-production of lipid and fatty acid.
