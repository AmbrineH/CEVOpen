 <p class="p">Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) are the major effluent deriving from olive oil production and are considered as one of the most challenging agro-industrial wastes to treat. Crude glycerol is the main by-product of alcoholic beverage and oleochemical production activities including biodiesel production. The tremendous quantities of glycerol produced worldwide represent a serious environmental challenge. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of 
  <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 to grow on nitrogen-limited submerged shake-flask cultures, in crude glycerol and OMW blends as well as in media with high initial glycerol concentration and produce biomass, cellular lipids, citric acid and polyols. The rationale of using such blends was the dilution of concentrated glycerol by OMW to (partially or fully) replace process tap water with a wastewater stream. The strain presented satisfactory growth in blends; citric acid production was not affected by OMW addition (Cit

  <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub>~0.39 g/g) simultaneously with high amounts of produced citric acid (Cit
  <sub class="sub">max</sub>~79.0 g/L, Y
  <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub>~0.46 g/g). Fatty acid analysis of microbial lipids demonstrated that OMW addition in blended media and in excess carbon media with high glycerol concentration favored oleic acid production.
