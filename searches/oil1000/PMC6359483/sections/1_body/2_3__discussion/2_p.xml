 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 presented satisfactory growth in OMW and crude glycerol blends. Increased phenolics concentrations (due to larger volumes of OMW added) did not affect biomass production (X
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>~11.6 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>~0.17–0.18 g/g) compared to the control experiment (X
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 11.96 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>~0.17 g/g) except for the trial with the highest Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~3.5 g/L (X
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 8.72 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>~0.13 g/g). In line with the results of the present study, no significant differences in biomass production were noted, when 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 50109 was grown on OMW-based nitrogen-limited media (enriched with commercial glucose) with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~0.7–1.8 g/L [

 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> strain MAK 1 was grown on blends of OMW and molasses with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~2.6–6.3 g/L [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and when selected Zygomycetes strains (

 <italic class="italic">Thamnidium elegans</italic> CCF-1465 and 
 <italic class="italic">Zygorhynchus moelleri</italic> MUCL 1430) were grown on solidified media with OMW up to 50% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In contrast, in a study where 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-YC 5033 was grown on OMW-based nitrogen-limited media (enriched with commercial glucose) with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~1.8–2.0 g/L, biomass values were depleted in parallel with increased phenolic content of the medium [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Moreover, when OMW-based nitrogen-limited media (enriched with commercial glucose) with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~1.0–1.6 g/L were used for the growth of three 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strains, two of them (
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-YC 5028 and ACA-YC 5033) were negatively affected by OMW addition, whereas the third one (
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain W29) presented high biomass values with the increment of OMW [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. It could be assumed that the yeast tolerance against the presence of phenolic compounds into the media, is strain-dependent.
