 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 was evaluated for its ability to grow on nitrogen-limited submerged shake-flasks cultures containing blends of OMW (a food industry waste stream) and crude biodiesel derived glycerol (constant Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~70 g/L and various volumes of OMW used, offering Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~1.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L and 3.5 g/L), in order to produce citric acid, cellular lipid and polyols. At the same time, color removal and phenolic compound concentration reduction in the media was monitored. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first report in literature in which blends of OMW and crude biodiesel-derived glycerol are used as substrate for (high-) added value compounds by yeasts; blends of OMW and pure glycerol have been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Additionally, experiments including media with higher Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> concentration of ~120 g/L and of ~170 g/L were conducted. The overall aim of the study was to investigate the impact of carbon excess culture conditions on the kinetic behavior of the strain and to assess the potential of valorizing greater volumes of OMW, by means of subsequent enhancement of microbial metabolites production.
