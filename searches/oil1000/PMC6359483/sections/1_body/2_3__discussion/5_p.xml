<p class="p">The yeast strain used in this study presented a shift of its metabolism towards lipid accumulation since a notable increase in cellular lipid production proportional to the addition of volumes of OMW into the blended media occurred. Increasing quantities of intra-cellular lipids were secreted (L

It should be noted also that a scarce number of studies indicate the significant enhancement of lipid accumulation process in yeast cells by the addition of natural compounds (e.g.,
