<p class="p">The strain 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> ACA-DC 5029, presented the ability to produce the polyols mannitol, arabitol and erythritol when crude glycerol was used as substrate, in both control and blended cultures (regarding OMW and glycerol blends: Man
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 13.1 g/L; Y
 <sub class="sub">Man/Glol</sub> = 0.21 g/g; Ara
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 3.1 g/L; Y
 <sub class="sub">Ara/Glol</sub> = 0.05 g/g; Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 13.5 g/L; Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.19 g/g). Mannitol and arabitol production was negligibly affected by the addition of OMW into the media, compared with control trials. On the other hand, erythritol production was vastly reduced when OMW was added into the media (Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 2.4 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.04 g/g; Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~3.5 g/L), compared to control cultures (Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 14.9 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.23 g/g). There seems to be a shift of the metabolism towards citric acid production at the expense of mainly erythritol production, due to the addition of OMW into the medium [though exception was the trial with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~2.0 g/L, where the value of Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 13.5 (Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.19 g/g)]. This is a result that cannot be further explained since the present study is the first report in literature including blended media of crude glycerol and OMW (besides the study of Dourou et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] where blends of OMW and pure glycerol were used) dealing specifically with erythritol accumulation.
