 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In the present study, it is assumed that the addition of OMW in the media affected negatively citric acid production. Nevertheless, in blended media, it seems that OMW addition favored the accumulation of citric acid (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Such a fact may be of great importance since in a potential process scale-up OMW could partially or in some cases totally substitute tap water for glycerol dilution, thus offering an attractive alternative in terms of preserving water resources. When comparing the values of citric acid production of this study (when OMW and crude glycerol blends used as substrate) with literature (where glycerol was used as carbon source; see below) the achieved values are regarded as low. However, if citric acid production is compared with the few studies that include OMW-based media (to produce extracellular metabolites and specifically citric acid), the values of the present study are among the highest reported. Specifically, in the present study, Cit
