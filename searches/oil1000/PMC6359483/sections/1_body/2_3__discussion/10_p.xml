<p class="p">With regards to the composition of microbial lipid produced by the yeast strain, the main FAs of lipids accumulated, on blended media (OMW and glycerol mixtures) and in control media (no OMW but only glycerol added), were C16 and C18 aliphatic chains. Palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C16:1), oleic (
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1) and linoleic (
 <sup class="sup">Δ9,12</sup>C18:2) acids were the predominant FAs. This is in accordance with some cases in international literature where 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strains were grown on OMW-based media [

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] and on blends of OMW and pure glycerol [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, when 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strains use hydrophilic compounds (glucose, glycerol, ethanol etc.) as substrate, the distribution of intra-cellular FAs seems to be generally strain-dependent. There are also other parameters influencing the FA composition of lipids produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strains, such as the initial (for batch cultures) or the inlet (for continuous cultures) substrate concentration, the fermentation time and the dilution rate [

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strains on OMW-based media, it should be noted that similarly with the present study, concentration of oleic acid increased (together with palmitoleic acid linoleic acid) with the addition of OMW into the media [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Rather than yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>, this feature seems also to happen with other yeast species (such as 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These findings could be attributed to microbial adaptation on the high-phenol concentration media.
