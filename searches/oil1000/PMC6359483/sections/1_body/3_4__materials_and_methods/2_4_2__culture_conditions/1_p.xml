<p class="p">All cultures performed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ± 1 mL of sterilized growth medium. Media were inoculated with 1 mL (2%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic> inoculum) of exponential (24 h) pre-culture. The pre-culture was carried out in a synthetic medium containing glucose ~10 g/L, peptone ~10 g/L and yeast extract ~10 g/L. All fermentations carried out under fully aerobic conditions [Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) &gt; 20%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>] as flasks were placed in an orbital shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Edison, NJ, USA) at an agitation rate of 180 ± 5 rpm (T = 28 ± 1 °C). Flasks were incubated aerobically in an orbital shaker at an agitation rate of 180 ± 5 rpm and T = 28 ± 1 °C, thus, all cultures were performed under fully aerobic conditions [Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) &gt; 20%

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], by adding measured quantities of 5M NaOH, pH of the culture maintained between the values of 5.0 and 6.0. All trials performed in duplicate (each experimental point of the kinetics presented is the mean value of two independent determinations; SE &lt; 10%).
