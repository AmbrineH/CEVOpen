<p class="p">Yeast cells were harvested from broth by centrifugation [9000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C; (Universal 320R Centrifuge, Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany)], washed once with distilled water and centrifuged again. The determination of biomass concentration was from dry weight (~85 °C until constant weight). Cellular lipid was determined gravimetrically using a mixture of chloroform/methanol 2/1 (

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Subsequently, lipids were converted into their fatty acid methyl-esters (FAMEs) and qualitative analysis took place in a gas chromatograph (8060 unit, Fisons Instruments Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) with flame ionization detector (FID) and using a Chrompack column (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm, J&amp;W Scientific Inc., Folsom, CA, USA), according to Fakas et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. FAMEs were identified by comparison with authentic standards. DOT was determined off-line with the aid of a selective electrode (oxi200 Sensodirect, Lovibond, Amesbury, UK) according to a protocol suggested by Papanikolaou et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The determination of total intra-cellular polysaccharides (IPS) were conducted as described in Tsakona et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] but slightly modified. Briefly, 0.05 g of dry yeast biomass was initially disrupted by adding 10 mL of 2M HCl. Heat treatment (100 °C) followed for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by filtration and the neutralization of the filtered liquid took place by adding 10 mL of 2 M NaOH up to pH 7.0. The concentration of total sugars was determined with the assay of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] and IPS were expressed as glucose equivalents. Filtered aliquots of the supernatant culture medium including glycerol, citric acid, mannitol, arabitol and erythritol were analyzed with the aid of a Waters 600E HPLC system (Waters Association, Milford, MA, USA) using a 30.0 cm × 7.8 mm Rezex ROA column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) coupled to a differential refractometer (RI; Waters 410) and a UV detector (Waters 486) (sample volume 20 μL; mobile phase 5 mM H

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; column temperature T = 65 °C. Phenolic compounds concentration in the fermentation supernatant was determined according to the Folin–Ciocalteau method measured at 750 nm and expressed as gallic acid equivalent [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The decolorization assay of the treated media was performed according to Sayadi and Ellouz [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The samples were diluted 30-fold, the pH adjusted between 6.0 and 6.3 and the absorbance measured at 395 nm. In all trials, initial phenolic compounds concentration and initial color content were determined after sterilization.
