<p class="p">The repeatability of the experiments as regards biomass biosynthesis, citric acid production and glycerol assimilation seems satisfactory. Moreover, flasks for the five different experiments were removed from the shaker and analyses were carried out at t = 142 ± 1 h after inoculation and t = 242 ± 2 h after inoculation. The obtained result for t = 142 ± 1 h after inoculation and for the 5 individual cultures showed the following feature: for biomass production, maximum and minimum values were 9.08 and 11.99 g/L respectively, with a mean value of 10.51 g/L, an obtained standard deviation of 1.196, a standard error of 0.535 and a variance of 1.429. For the case of remaining glycerol, maximum and minimum values were 21.10 and 14.00 g/L respectively, with a mean value of 17.75 g/L, an obtained standard deviation of 2.775, a standard error of 1.241 and a variance of 7.699. Concerning produced citric acid, maximum and minimum values were 23.50 and 18.34 g/L respectively, with a mean value of 20.99 g/L, an obtained standard deviation of 1.922, a standard error of 0.859 and a variance of 3.694. </p>
