<p class="p">In the present study, 
 <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 belonging to the collection of Laboratory of Dairy Research Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Agricultural University of Athens, was used. The strain was grown on media including blends of OMW and crude industrial glycerol (deriving as by-product from biodiesel production) and tested towards its ability to produce biomass, citric acid, polyols and lipids. It was conserved in yeast peptone dextrose agar (YPDA; T = 6 ± 1 °C) and for viability maintenance, it was sub-cultured every 2 months. OMW was received from a three-phase decanter olive mill located in Chania (Crete, Greece) and were frozen at T = −20 ± 2 °C. Prior experimental use, OMW was de-frozen and the solids removed by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 15 min, T = 21 ± 1 °C) in a Universal 320R centrifuge (Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany). OMW phenolic content expressed as gallic acid equivalent was ~3.5 g/L, while (surprisingly enough) no reducing sugars were found (therefore crude glycerol was the sole carbon source in the blended media). Moreover, negligible quantities of olive oil (~0.2 g/L—determination of oil conducted after triple extraction with hexane) were present. Crude glycerol with a purity of ~81%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> methanol. In the trials regarding blended media (OMW and crude glycerol added), the initial glycerol (Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) concentration was set to ~70 g/L. OMW was used as process tap water substitute to dilute glycerol. Thus, specific volumes of OMW and tap water were added in the blended media, offering initial concentration of phenolic compounds (Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) of ~1.0 g/L, ~2.0 g/L and ~3.5 g/L (in the latter case, no tap water was added but only OMW). A control experiment (no OMW addition) was also performed. To investigate the impact of higher glycerol concentration and increased carbon excess on kinetics of the strain, shake-flasks control experiments (no OMW addition) with media containing Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> concentrations (in g/L): ~120 and ~170 g/L, were conducted. All other culture parameters remained stable. Mineral salts were added into the media (concentration in g/L): KH
