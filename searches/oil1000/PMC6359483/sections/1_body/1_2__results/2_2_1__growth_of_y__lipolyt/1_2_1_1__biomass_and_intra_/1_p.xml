 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 presented satisfactory growth in both control (no OMW addition) and blended media. In all cases, the applied substrate was totally assimilated. Maximum biomass production (X
 <italic class="italic">max</italic>) ranged between 8.72–11.96 g/L, with the respective yield of biomass per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>) in the range of 0.13–0.18 g/g (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the maximum biomass production was noted in control trials reaching 11.96 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.17 g/g). With regards to trials with blended media (initial phenolic compound concentration of ~1.0 g/L and ~2.0 g/L), biomass production was not significantly different compared to control experiments. Specifically, in cultures with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~1.0 g/L, maximum biomass production reached 11.56 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.18 g/g) and in cultures with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~2.0 g/L, maximum biomass production reached 11.58 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.17 g/g). On the other hand, when maximum OMW volume was added to the media, resulting in initial phenolic compound concentration of ~3.5 g/L, cellular production was notably reduced (X
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 8.72 g/L; Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.13 g/g) compared to both control and blended cultures (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This fact suggested that the addition of phenolic compounds (due to OMW presence) into the media seems to obstruct biomass production.
