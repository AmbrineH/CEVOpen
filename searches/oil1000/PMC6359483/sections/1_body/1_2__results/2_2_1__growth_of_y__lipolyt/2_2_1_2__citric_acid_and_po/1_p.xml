<p class="p">In the control experiment (no OMW addition), citric acid secretion by the strain reached a maximum value (Cit
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) of 42.5 g/L with the respective yield of citric acid per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub>) 0.59 g/g. The addition of OMW in the media affected negatively citric acid production, compared to control trial. Specifically, in cultures with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~1.0 g/L, Cit
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 28.8 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub> = 0.41 g/g), reaching 31.5 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub> = 0.45 g/g) at Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 2.0 g/L and 37.4 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub> = 0.55 g/g) in OMW-based media with Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 3.5 g/L. On the other hand, by comparing blended media only, it seems that OMW addition favors the accumulation of citric acid (
