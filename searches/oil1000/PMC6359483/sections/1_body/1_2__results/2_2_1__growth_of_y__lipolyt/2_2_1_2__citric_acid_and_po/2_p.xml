<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> ACA-DC 5029 strain presented the ability to produce the polyols mannitol, arabitol and erythritol when crude glycerol was used as substrate, in both control and OMW-blended cultures. The maximum values of produced mannitol (Man
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) were in the range of 5.3 g/L and 13.1 g/L, with respective values of yield of mannitol per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">Man/Glol</sub>) in the range of 0.08 g/g and 0.21 g/g (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Compared with control trials, the addition of OMW did not affect mannitol production, except for the experiment with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~2.0 g/L, where Man
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> reached 5.3 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">Man/Glol</sub> = 0.45 g/g). A similar trend occurred in arabitol production, as it was not majorly affected by the addition of OMW (Ara
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 2.0–3.2 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">Ara/Glol</sub> = 0.03–0.05 g/g) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, erythritol production was notably reduced when OMW was added into the media, compared to control cultures. Specifically, the maximum value of produced erythritol (Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) in control cultures was 14.9 g/L, with the yield of erythritol per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub>) equal 0.23 g/g. In blended media with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~1.0 g/L, the value of Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 8.9 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.19 g/g). In blended media with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~3.5 g/L, erythritol production was highly affected (Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 2.4 g/L, Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.04 g/g) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These observations indicated a shift of the microbial metabolism towards citric acid production at the expense of mainly erythritol production, due to the addition of OMW into the medium. The only exception from this trend was the trial with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~2.0 g/L, where the value of Ery
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 13.5 (Y
 <sub class="sub">Ery/Glol</sub> = 0.19 g/g).
