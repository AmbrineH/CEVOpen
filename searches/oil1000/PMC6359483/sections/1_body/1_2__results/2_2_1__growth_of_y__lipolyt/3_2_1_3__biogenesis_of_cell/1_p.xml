<p class="p">Total microbial lipids were extracted from dry cells in all growth phases in all media (control and blended). The maximum values (L

These findings are in accordance with the present study, as it may be assumed that microbial metabolism was shifted towards extra-cellular compounds biosynthesis (citric acid and polyols) rather than cellular lipids. In the control experiment, lipid concentration reached the maximum value (L
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) of 1.27 g/L with respective yield of lipid per biomass produced (Y
 <sub class="sub">L/X</sub>) equal to 10.6% (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, in cultures with initial phenolic compound concentration of ~1.0 g/L, the value of L

 <sub class="sub">L/X</sub> = 17.8%
