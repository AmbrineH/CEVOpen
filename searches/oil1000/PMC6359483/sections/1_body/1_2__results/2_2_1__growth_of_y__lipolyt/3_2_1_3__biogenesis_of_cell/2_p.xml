<p class="p">The fatty acid (FA) composition of the intra-cellular lipids was analyzed at various growth phases for control and blended cultures (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The principal FAs detected were C16 and C18 aliphatic chains. It should be noted that in all cultures (control and blended) the unsaturation index (UI) of FA was different in various culture phases. In most cases, the UI increased during the stationary growth phase as the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C16:1, 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 and 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9,12</sup>C18:2 increased, whereas the concentration of C16:0, C18:0 decreased. Compared to control experiments, UI of lipids produced by the yeast in blended media seemed to remain unaffected. The addition of OMW resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 (in the blended cultures with Ph
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>~2.0 g/L the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 reached ~60%

 <sup class="sup">Δ9,12</sup>C18:2 concentration (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, C18:0 concentration was decreased proportionally to the addition of OMW and 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C16:1 concentration value presented a noticeable fall in the blended cultures with Ph
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>~3.5 g/L (compared to the rest of the experiments) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Finally, to estimate the fatty acid desaturase activity during yeast cultivation, the ratios between the desaturase product and substrate (C16:1/C16:0, C18:1/C18:0, C18:2/C18:1) were calculated (data not shown). High values of the C18:1/C18:0 ratio indicate high activity of Δ9-desaturase, especially in the citric acid production phase. In all cultures (control and blended) those ratios (mainly C18:1/C18:0) were raised at the citric acid production phase (~144 h) compared to yeast growth phase (72 h).
