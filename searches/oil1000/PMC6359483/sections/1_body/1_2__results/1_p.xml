 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 grown on media with blends of OMW and crude glycerol was studied. Various volumes of OMW and tap water were added in the blended media, resulting in initial concentration of phenolic compounds (Ph
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) of ~1.0 g/L, ~2.0 g/L and ~3.5 g/L. The initial concentration of crude glycerol remained constant at ~70 g/L. Control trials (no OMW addition) were also performed, as the addition of phenolic compounds could act upon the physiological and kinetic behavior of the yeast. The ability of the yeast strain to grow on such blends and produce citric acid, polyols (mannitol, arabitol, erythritol), biomass and cellular lipid was evaluated in submerged shake-flask nitrogen limited cultures (as nitrogen depletion is essential in order the above-mentioned compounds to be synthesized [

Furthermore, additional experiments (submerged shake-flask nitrogen limited cultures) including media (no OMW addition) with high initial crude glycerol concentration of ~120 g/L and of ~170 g/L were conducted.
