<p class="p">As mentioned above, in experiments with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~70 g/L, citric acid secretion reached the maximum value (Cit
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) of 42.5 g/L with respective yield of citric acid per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">Cit/Glol</sub>) 0.59 g/g (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In crude glycerol excess media, a significant raise in citric acid accumulation was noted reaching Cit

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~120 g/L;

Nevertheless, the conversion yield of citric acid produced per glycerol consumed was clearly decreased in comparison with trials with the lowest initial crude glycerol concentration (~70 g/L).
