These observations indicated a shift of the yeast metabolism from citric acid accumulation towards erythritol production. In the literature, it has been reported that polyols function as osmolytes stored inside microbial cells (by means of cell protection by osmotic stress), thus act as soluble compounds that maintain the cellâ€™s fluid balance and protein folding [
