<p class="p">The fatty acid (FA) composition of intra-cellular lipids was analyzed at various growth phases for all cultures (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). As expected, the principal FAs detected were the C16 and C18 ones. In all cultures UI of FA changed within culture phases and seemed to increase proportionally to the evolution of the culture as the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C16:1, 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 and 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9,12</sup>C18:2 increased and the concentration of C16:0, C18:0 decreased (or remained stable). The addition of higher volumes of crude glycerol in the media seemed to increase the UI (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, this addition led to an increase of the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 (compared to cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~70.0 g/L). In the cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~120.0 g/L the concentration of oleic acid reached the value of ~63%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic> and in the cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~170.0 g/L 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9</sup>C18:1 concentration was ~53% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>. Likewise, palmitoleic acid concentration increased proportionally to crude glycerol addition (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). It should be noted that, compared to cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~70.0 g/L, the excess of carbon source into the media (Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~120.0 g/L) favored the synthesis of 
 <sup class="sup">Δ9,12</sup>C18:2, as it raised from ~14.0% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> in the former case up to ~52.0% 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> in the latter. Surprisingly, the concentration of linoleic acid was reduced in cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~170.0 g/L (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). As stated previously in this study, to estimate the fatty acid desaturase activity during yeast cultivation, C16:1/C16:0, C18:1/C18:0, C18:2/C18:1 ratios were calculated (data not shown). High values of C18:1/C18:0 ratio were noted, indicating a stimulated activity of Δ9-desaturase, especially in the citric acid production phase. In all cultures those ratios were raised at the citric acid production phase compared to yeast growth phase. Increased Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> into the media led to a clear increase of all ratios (except C18:2/C18:1 ratio in the trial with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~170 g/L) leading to the conclusion that (Δ9- and Δ12-) desaturase activity was stimulated proportionally to crude glycerol addition in the cultures.
