<p class="p">In trials with initial glycerol concentration of ~70 g/L, as mentioned above, the strain presented satisfactory growth with maximum biomass value of 11.96 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.17 g/g). With a view to valorize larger volumes of crude glycerol and potentially enhance the production of cellular metabolites (i.e., citric acid and/or cellular lipid and/or polyol production), cultures with high excess of carbon (with nitrogen concentration remaining stable) were conducted. Thus, trials were performed with increased initial crude glycerol concentration to ~120 g/L (total substrate assimilation in 360 h; 15 days) and to ~170 g/L (total substrate assimilation in 528 h; 22 days). In both experiments, crude glycerol was completely assimilated. As reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00222-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, maximum biomass production (X
 <italic class="italic">max</italic>) reached 12.40 g/L with respective yield of biomass per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>) 0.10 g/g in cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~120 g/L and 12.48 g/L (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub> = 0.08 g/g) in cultures with Glol
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>~170 g/L. Carbon excess conditions seemed not to affect biomass production in terms of absolute values. Nevertheless, the yield of biomass per glycerol consumed (Y
 <sub class="sub">X/Glol</sub>) was significantly reduced (see
