<p class="p">The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 to grow on blends of crude glycerol and OMW (constant initial glycerol concentration and increasing volumes of OMW in the media) and produce (high-) added value compounds. Citric acid, cellular lipid and polyols production was monitored and analyzed. Additional experiments including media with high initial crude glycerol concentrations were conducted. The rationale of such experiments was to evaluate routes for the valorization of large amounts of glycerol and potentially enhance the production of yeast metabolites. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report in the international literature in which blends of OMW and crude biodiesel-derived glycerol are used as substrate for (high-) added value compounds by yeasts. Such a fact may be of great importance since in a potential process scale-up (application in large-scale bioprocesses) OMW could partially or, in some cases, totally substitute tap water for glycerol dilution, thus offering an attractive alternative. In terms of waste bio-remediation, an additional aim of this study was to simultaneously reduce the color and phenolic compound concentration of the media (appearing due to OMW presence) via the proposed bioprocess.
