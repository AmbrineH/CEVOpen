 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain ACA-DC 5029 was tested for its ability to grow on blends of crude glycerol and OMW. Even though this food industry-derived waste stream includes in its composition microbial inhibitors, the yeast presented satisfactory growth, suggesting that OMW could be characterized as a “lipogenic” medium. Additionally, citric acid production was not affected by the addition of OMW to the blends, indicating that it could partially or in some cases totally substitute tap water for concentrated glycerol dilution in the bioprocess proposed; thus, offering an attractive alternative in a potential industrial (large-scale) application. Partial removal of phenolic compounds and of color of the media occurred. Moreover, the yeast strain presented the ability to grow on media with ascending concentration of crude glycerol and produce significant amounts of citric acid and erythritol. This fact is of great importance as the surplus of crude glycerol deriving not only from biodiesel industry but also from oleochemical and food industry activities will negatively affect glycerol price. The strain studied, could be considered as a candidate for the biotransformation of crude biodiesel-derived glycerol and blends of OMW and crude glycerol towards the production of chemical compounds of added value.
