<p class="p">Previous studies have focused on cashew protein isolate and concentrate. According to Ogunwolu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], the functional properties of cashew protein concentrate and isolate were significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the functional properties of cashew nut proteins were comparable to soybean, lupin and peanut protein, which are already being used in many food products as functional ingredients. Their study also indicated that protein isolate and concentrate had superior water/oil absorption capacity and foaming capacity than defatted flour. Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] reported the functional properties of protein isolate from raw and heat processed cashew nut were different, and whatâ€™s more, the functional properties showed excellent correlation with solubility [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Previous findings also showed that globulin was the major protein fraction of cashew nut. However, there is scant information on the different cashew nut protein fractions corresponding to these functional and molecular properties.
