<p class="p">Recently, plant proteins are attracting more and more interest due to their digestible and nutritional character. With the increasing demand for plant proteins, great efforts have been aimed at taking full advantage of new plant proteins as food ingredients, such as soapnut seed proteins [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], pumpkin seed proteins [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], mung bean proteins [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], bitter melon seed proteins [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], etc. Cashew nut protein, with abundant nutritional and great economic value, requires more detailed functional and molecular data. Therefore, this study attempted to determine the molecular and functional properties of albumin, globulin, glutelin as well as protein isolate from cashew nut, which may provide opportunities to effectively utilize these proteins as functional food ingredients.
