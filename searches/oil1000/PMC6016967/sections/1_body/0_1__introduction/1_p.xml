 <italic class="italic">Anacardium occidentale</italic> L.) is native to the Brazil and now widely cultivated throughout the world. Cashew nut is one of the four famous nuts in the world and plays an important role for its products with high nutritional value and unique flavor. Cashew nut in a healthy diet can not only lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, especially stroke, but also reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome [
