<p class="p">The molecular and functional properties of protein fractions and isolate from cashew nut kernel were investigated. The properties of the albumin, globulin, glutelin and CNPI fractions were considerably different. Globulin had a higher yield and purity than the other proteins. Cashew nut proteins were nutritionally equipped with abundant essential amino acids. SDS-PAGE indicated cashew nut proteins consisted mainly of polypeptides with ≤53 kDa, albumin and globulin showed more small polypeptides. The main secondary structure of cashew nut protein was β-sheets. Different solvent extraction procedures could change the structure of the proteins and led to the changes of their functional properties. Cashew proteins were observed to have the lowest solubility between pH 3.0 and 5.0, albumin and globulin almost fully dissolved in a neutral environment. Although CNPI showed the lowest solubility, it was found to have remarkable emulsifying properties and the highest H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> value. Glutelin had the best water/oil absorption capacity and foaming properties due to its amphipathic nature. This work investigated the molecular and functional properties of cashew nut proteins, and revealed that protein structure was an important factor for the functional properties. Different functional properties of cashew nut protein could be achieved by different production methods. NaOH-soluble glutelin exhibits superior water/oil holding capacity makes it suitable for cake, sausage and meat products. Water-soluble albumin with excellent solubility and emulsifying properties is strongly recommended for drinks. The results suggested that cashew nut proteins were potentially excellent protein sources for the food industry, meanwhile providing useful information for the development and utilization of global cashew nuts.
