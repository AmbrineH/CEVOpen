<p class="p">Protein solubility was determined by the method of Lowry with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Briefly, protein samples (50 mg) were dispersed in deionized water (25 mL) followed by stirring 30 min at ambient temperature (25 °C), the pH of suspensions was adjusted to the desired value (3.0–9.0) with 0.1 M HCl or NaOH. These suspensions were magnetically stirred for another 30 min then centrifuged at 7000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 15 min. The total protein content was measure by dissolving the CNPI or CNSPI in 0.1 M NaOH. PS was expressed as the percentage ratio of supernatant protein content to the total protein content.
