For determination, 20 μL of ANS-solution was added to 4 mL of each dilution, and the fluorescence intensity (FI) of the mixture was measured at 390 nm (excitation) and 470 nm (emission) using a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Company, Tokyo, Japan). The initial slope of the FI versus protein concentration (mg/mL) plot (calculated by linear regression analysis) was used as an index of H
