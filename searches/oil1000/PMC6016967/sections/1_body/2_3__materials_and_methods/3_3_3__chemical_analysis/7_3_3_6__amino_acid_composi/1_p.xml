<p class="p">The amino acid composition of protein samples were determined according to the method previously described by Du et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Protein samples were hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h at 110 °C, 20 μL of hydrolysate were loaded into an L-8800 automatic amino acid analyser (Hitachi). Amino acid compositions were expressed as g/100 g protein.
