<p class="p">SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Malomo and Aluko [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Samples were treated by mixing with loading buffer containing 0.5 M Tris-HCl, glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% SDS only (non-reducing buffer) or 10% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (reducing buffer) at ratio of 1:1 (
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>), then boiled at 100 °C for 3–5 min. After cooling and centrifugation, 10 μL of the treated samples were loaded on the 5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel, with electric current of 8 mA and 16 mA. When electrophoresis was over, the gels were stained with 0.025% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 in 25.2% methanol and 6.4% glacial acetic acid for 30 min, then destained with 5% methanol and 7.5% glacial acetic acid until the background was near colourless. The molecular weight markers used were 14.4, 18.4, 25.0, 45.0, 66.2 and 116.0 kDa.
