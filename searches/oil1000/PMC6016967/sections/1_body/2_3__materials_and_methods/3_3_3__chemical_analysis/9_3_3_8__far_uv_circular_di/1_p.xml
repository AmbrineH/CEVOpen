<p class="p">Far-UV CD spectroscopy was carried out to calculate the secondary structure of samples using a MOS-450 spectropolarimeter (French Bio-Logic SAS Co., Claix, France). Protein was dissolved in the 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and the concentration was confirmed by Lowry’s method to obtained 0.1 mg/mL protein concentration. The CD spectroscopy was measured using quartz cuvette with path length of 1 mm, 100 nm/min scan rate, 1.0 nm of bandwidth, and 8 scans scanning from 190–250 nm. A mean residue weight of 110 was assumed in calculating the secondary structure and the data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity. The secondary structure compositions of the samples were estimated from the far-UV CD spectra using the CONTIN programe in Dichro Web.</p>
