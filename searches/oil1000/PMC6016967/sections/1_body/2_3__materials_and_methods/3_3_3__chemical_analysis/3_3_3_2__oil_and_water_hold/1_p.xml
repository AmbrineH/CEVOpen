 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] with some modifications. Protein samples (0.5 g) were mixed with soybean oil or deionized water (5 mL) in a 50 mL pre-weighed centrifuge tube. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min, left standing at room temperature for 30 min then centrifuged 10 min at 2000 r/min. The supernatant was decanted, excess oil (or water) in the upper phase drained for 30 min and the sample weighed again to determine the percentage of oil or water retained per gram of sample.
