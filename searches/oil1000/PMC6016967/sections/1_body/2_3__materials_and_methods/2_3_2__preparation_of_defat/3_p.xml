<p class="p">The protein fractions of cashew nut were extracted using the Osborne method as follows [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The defatted cashew nut flour was dispersed in deionised water (1:10, 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was then centrifuged at 6000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 30 min and the supernatant was collected as the albumin extract. The precipitate was extracted with 1 M NaCl (1:10, 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>) for 2 h and centrifuged to give the globulin fraction. The residue was then extracted with 70% ethanol to give prolamin, followed by glutelin extraction with 0.1 M NaOH. To further clarify the supernatant of insoluble residues, each extraction was performed twice. Then the protein fractions were dialyzed (6–8 kDa cut off) against water at 4 °C for 72 h, freeze-dried and stored at 4 °C.
