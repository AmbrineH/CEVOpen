<p class="p">Cashew nut protein isolate (CNPI) was prepared according to the process described by Skevkani et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Briefly, the defatted cashew nut flour was dispersed in deionized water (1:10, 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>) and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 using 1 M NaOH. After magnetic stirring for 2 h at room temperature (about 25 °C), the suspension was centrifuged at 6000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 30 min. Then the supernatants were collected, the sediments were resuspended in deionized water to repeat the extraction as described above. The two supernatants were pooled and the pH adjusted to 4.6 using 1 M HCl. The precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation for 30 min then resuspended in deionized water, neutralized, and subjected to dialysis (6–8 kDa cut off) against water at 4 °C for 72 h. After freeze-drying, the CNPI was stored at 4 °C until use.
