<p class="p">Raw cashew nuts were ground using a grinder and defatted with petroleum ether (boiling range: 60–90 °C) at a material/solvent ratio of 1:10 by extracting for 22 h. The dispersion was filtered through a Buchner funnel at ambient temperature and the residue used for the next extraction. The defatting procedure was repeated three times. Finally, the defatted flakes were air-dried in a fume hood until the solvent was removed completely, then ground to a powder to obtain defatted cashew nut flour (DCNF).</p>
