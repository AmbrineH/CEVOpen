<p class="p">Oil holding capacity (OHC) plays an important role in food flavor retention and food formation, especially for the meat industry, and also affects the emulsifying capacity. Glutelin was found to have the highest oil holding capacity value of 27.47 g/g compared with that of globulin (9.34 g/g), albumin (5.94 g/g) and CNPI (1.05 g/g). The OHC of glutelin was higher than a previous study of cashew nut protein concentrate (3.32 g/g) and isolate (4.42 g/g) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], indicating cashew nut protein fractions obtained by the Osborne extraction method may have more outstanding functional properties than protein isolate and concentrate. These results were also comparable to the value of 1.7 g/g for chickpea protein isolate [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], 4.75 g/g of globulin from African yam bean seed [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and 3.0 g/g for sunflower protein concentrate [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Glutelin had higher OHC and WHC, indicating it might be a kind of natural amphiphilic substance, while the other protein samples contain more Î²-sheet and turn structures that may limit their interaction with water and lipid phases. Glutelin has a more open structure that may be another reason for its prominent water/oil holding capacity. Proteins possess excellent surfactant character and for this reason can be widely utilized in the food industry, since oil and water holding capacity is essential in food processing [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Ogunwolu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] reported that OHC increased with purity in protein products, which may be the reason why the OHC of globulin was higher than that of albumin.
