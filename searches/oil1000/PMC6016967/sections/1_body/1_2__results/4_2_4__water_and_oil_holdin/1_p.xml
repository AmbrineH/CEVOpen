<p class="p">Water holding capacity (WHC) is described as the ability of a protein to retain water against gravity, including hydrodynamic water, bound water, capillary water and physically entrapped water [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The WHC of cashew nut albumin, globulin, glutelin and CNPI is listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Glutelin had the highest WHC of 15.85 g/g, significantly higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than CNPI (1.75 g/g), albumin (1.25 g/g) and globulin (0.95 g/g). The high WHC of glutelin might be due to its flaky microstructure that enhanced its interactions with water. The WHC values of cashew nut proteins in the study were comparable to Chilean hazelnut protein (1.34 g/g) [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], albumin (0.41 g/g) and globulin (1.51 g/g) from ginkgo seed [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Glutelin and CNPI, with their high WHC values, are considered as a potential food ingredients in viscous food [
