<p class="p">The chemical compositions of cashew nut protein isolate (CNPI), defatted cashew nut flour (DCNF), albumin, globulin, glutelin and prolamin are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The protein content, moisture, crude fat, ash and soluble sugar in DCNF were 31.9%, 9.24%, 0.5%, 4.46% and 19.15%, respectively. This result indicated that DCNF was rich in protein. The crude protein contents of albumin, globulin, glutelin and CNPI were 83.6%, 95.5% and 81.3%, higher than CNPI (80.7%). Whatâ€™s more, the soluble sugar content of all samples was lower than 3.23%, the crude fat of globulin and glutelin even lower than 1%, which indicated the Osborne fractionation method was practicable to preliminarily purify cashew nut protein. A similar result was observed in the study of Tang and Wang [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] where buckwheat globulin (96.7%) had higher protein content than albumin (57.0%). The differences in protein content suggested the water-soluble protein had other minor components such as soluble sugars and polyphenols. These results revealed that it was practical to sequentially extract proteins from cashew nut using water, salt and alkali solution, which should promote the economical industrial processing of cashew nut proteins [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the gross yields of albumin, globulin and glutelin were 7.69%, 17.30% and 7.80% (
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic> of flour), total output was higher than CNPI (19.67%). The Osborne solubility-based protein extraction method indicated that water-soluble (albumin), NaCl-soluble (globulin) and NaOH-soluble (glutelin) were the main fractions in cashew nut protein, accounting for 22.87%, 51.44% and 23.19% (
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>), respectively, while only 2.5% of ethanol-soluble fraction (prolamin) was obtained, hence, in the following research we will investigate in the properties of albumin, globulin and glutelin from cashew nut kernel.
