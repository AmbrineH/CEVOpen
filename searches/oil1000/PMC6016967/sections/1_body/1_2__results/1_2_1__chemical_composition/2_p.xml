 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, where the recommended FAO/WHO (2007) patterns for children and adults were taken as reference. As it shows, the amino acid composition of albumin, globulin, glutelin and CNPI exhibited distinct differences. The four samples are all rich in valine, isoleucine and cysteine, while the glutamic and arginine content of albumin and globulin were significant higher than in glutelin, accounting for over 37.87%. According to the FAO/WHO/UNU recommended essential amino acid patterns, the valine, isoleucine and lysine levels of the four protein samples could satisfy the childrenâ€™s requirement, that means cashew nut proteins could be used as a replenisher in food for babies or young children. Furthermore, the essential amino acid content of cashew nut protein fractions was higher than CNPI, especially in glutelin, where the ratio of essential to total amino acids was as high as 41.11%. According to a previous study, sulphur amino acids are the limiting amino acid in legume seed proteins [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], but our study showed that albumin and globulin could be used as an excellent source of supplements. Comparing with albumin and globulin, glutelin has higher aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid content, which could enhance protein-protein interactions and result in higher oil holding capacity. Albumin had a lower aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid content that may explain its higher solubility. The ratio of arginine and lysine was higher in globulin than albumin and glutelin, indicating a better nutritional property of globulin because a high arginine to lysine ratio may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease [
