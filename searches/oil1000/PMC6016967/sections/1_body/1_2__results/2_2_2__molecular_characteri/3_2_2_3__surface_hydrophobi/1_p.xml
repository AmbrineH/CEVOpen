<p class="p">The surface hydrophobicity value reflects the extent of exposure of the hydrophobic clusters on the protein molecule surface and is related to its interfacial activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that the H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> values of CNPI and glutelin were 2717.81 and 2145.18, respectively, which were significant higher (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-molecules-23-00393" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref> whereby albumin and globulin had better solubility in neutral pH. A lower H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> value indicated there was less hydrophobic groups on the protein surface, therefore resulting in higher solubility. The higher H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> of glutelin and CNPI may be attributable to their flaky and irregular microstructures. Proteins with high H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> values tend to exhibit greater levels of surfactancy, which character may result in excellent foaming and emulsifying capacity [
