<p class="p">In the study, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure composition of cashew nut proteins. The quantitative estimation of the relative amounts is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The secondary structure of albumin was composed of 9.5% α-helix, 36.4% β-sheet, 18.6% turns and 35.5% random coils. Globulin was composed of 8.6% α-helix, 41.1% β-sheet, 22.5% turns and 29.5% random coils. The α-helix proportion of glutelin was 11.7%, the other was similar to albumin. CNPI had a similar content of turns and random coils as globulin, but more α-helix and less β-sheets. The secondary structures of cashew nut proteins were mainly β-sheets and random coils. Since the α-helix, β-sheet and turns were found to account for about 70%, the globulin and CNPI could be considered as proteins with highly ordered and stable conformations [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The higher proportion of turns in CNPI suggested that this protein unfolded and dissociated during the acid precipitation process [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] showed that plant globulins were rich in β-sheet, such as amaranth globulin (46.3%), soybean globulin (42.2%) and wheat 11S globulin (53.3%). Yin et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] also reported that protein fractions from soapnut contained predominantly β-sheet structures. Compared with globulin, higher amounts of α-helix and random coils were observed in albumin, indicating a more flexible conformation.
