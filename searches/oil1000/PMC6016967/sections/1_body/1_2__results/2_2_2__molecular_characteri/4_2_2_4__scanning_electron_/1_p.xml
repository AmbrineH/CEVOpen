 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Albumin and globulin displayed obvious globular structures combined with some rhabditiform and irregular lamellar parts. Glutelin showed a big flaky structure with a smooth surface and no globular structures were observed. On the other hand, CNPI show bigger globules with less irregular shape and some indentations. The flaky structure of glutelin may be due to the strong alkali environment, and the loose and lamellar structure after extraction is similar to the result of other physical and chemical modifications, such as enzymatic hydrolysis [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], high-pressure homogenization and succinylation [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], and these microstructure changes may result in the exposure of hydrophobic amino acid residues and the alteration of protein functional properties. The particle size of CNPI was bigger and with surface depressions because the acid treatment process may lead to aggregation and the formation of a more compact structure.
