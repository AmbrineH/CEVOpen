<p class="p">The SDS-PAGE profiles of raw cashew nut protein, CNPI, albumin, globulin and glutelin under non-reducing (A) and reducing conditions (B) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Under non-reducing conditions, the CNPI and DCNF showed a large similarity with the 53 kDa being in the highest proportion. There were five main polypeptides with the estimated molecular weight (MW) of 6.5, 19, 34, 44, 53 kDa, the MW distribution was similar to that reported in a previous study by Sathe et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. For the albumin and globulin, there were additionally two polypeptides with MW of 16 and 10 kDa. The highest proportion of albumin was around 7 kDa while in globulin was 34 kDa. Glutelin exhibited three weak bands with MW about 15, 20 and 43 kDa, while the stain was intense between the separation and stacking gel. This indicated that glutelin may have bigger MW and lower solubility in gel buffer, and most of glutelin cannot enter the gel [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. After adding β-mercaptoethanol, the subunit composition of all protein samples presented marked changes. For all samples, the 53 kDa polypeptide band narrowed and presented two bands with MW of 32 and 21 kDa. The polypeptide of 53 kDa was barely visible in globulin but was quite clear in albumin, which was consistent with previous work by Sathe [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Meanwhile the polypeptide of 44 and 34 kDa disappeared and the band of 27 kDa was darker in albumin and globulin, evidencing that the polypeptides contained inter-molecular disulfide bonds. The disappearance of high MW protein with the presence of β-ME had been reported in hemp seed proteins [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. What’s more, there were several small polypeptides with MW less than 14 kDa. Compared with albumin and globulin, glutelin had a larger molecular weight.
