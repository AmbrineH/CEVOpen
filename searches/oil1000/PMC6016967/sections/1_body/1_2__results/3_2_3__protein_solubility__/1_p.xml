<p class="p">Protein solubility plays a key role among the functional properties because the protein should initially form solutions before other propertiesare performed [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the solubility of cashew nut proteins was found to be extremely sensitive to pH, and the solubility of protein fractions increased with increasing pH, while the solubility-pH profile of CNPI shows a U curve shape. The minimum solubility of cashew nut proteins was observed around pH 3.0 and 5.0, which might be due to the increased protein-protein interactions near the isoelectric point, while the maximum protein solubility was observed at pH 9.0. In a neutral environment, the solubility of albumin and globulin was 96.55% and 94.65%. Similar results have been reported for the solubility of cashew nut protein isolate (95%) and concentrate (95%) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The solubility of glutelin also reached to 79.88%, but the PS of CNPI in our study was only 35.36%. The PS of all samples were significantly higher (

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The excellent protein solubility indicated cashew protein fractions had potential practical applications in the food industry, since most food is produced in neutral or weak acidic/alkaline environments. The PS of cashew nut protein fractions in a neutral environment was higher than that of other plant protein fractions, such as African yam bean protein [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and kidney bean protein [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The higher solubility of albumin could be attributed to its higher soluble sugar content (2.03%), as carbohydrate components may enhance protein-water interactions and thus increase the solubility [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The solubility pattern indicated that cashew nut protein fractions could be adequate for most food formulations.
