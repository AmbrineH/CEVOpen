<p class="p">The term emulsion stability (ES) represents the ability of emulsions to resist physiochemical changes over time. In general, CNPI showed significantly higher emulsion stability (61.78 min), followed by albumin (41.84 min), globulin (28.08 min) and glutelin (21.57 min), respectively. CNPI produced by alkali extraction and acid precipitation not only excelled in emulsion formation, but also was more stable than other proteins, while albumin with higher solubility and lower surface hydrophobicity could be responsible for the higher emulsion stability value. The result was consistent with the results for hemp [
