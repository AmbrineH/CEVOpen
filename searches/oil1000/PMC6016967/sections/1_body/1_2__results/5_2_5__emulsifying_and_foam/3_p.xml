<p class="p">The foaming capacity (FC) and foam stability (FS) of cashew nut proteins are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. In the natural pH environment, the foaming capacity of glutelin and CNPI was 101.93% and 92.00%, respectively, more than that of globulin (54.05%) and albumin (20.48%). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A, glutelin has the highest foaming capacity, as its excellent amphiphilic property enhance interactions with the aqueous phase that then possesses better capacity to encapsulate air particles. Globulin with high purity can form higher protein concentration solutions, though it can easily unfold and enhance protein-protein interactions to form stronger protein interfacial membranes, then showing better foaming capacity [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Like foaming capacity, the foam stability of glutelin and CNPI was 79.18% and 76.70%, respectively, higher than globulin (46.00%) and albumin (19.50%). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00393-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>B, the foam volume after 30 min was decreased to different degrees. This is an important property in the food industry since the effectiveness of whipping agents depends upon their ability to retain the whip as long as possible [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Glutelin has excellent foaming properties that may be attributed to its high content of hydrophobic amino acids, which easily to form stronger interfacial membranes between the air-water interface via greater protein-protein interactions. Overall, glutelin and DCNF can be considered as appropriate foaming ingredients in food production, such as ice creams, bakery products and drinks.
