<p class="p">The emulsion activity index (EAI) represents the ability of a protein to form emulsions via absorbing at the oil water interface. The EAI can be influenced by many factors, including protein concentration, pH and the presence of non-protein compounds. The emulsifying properties of the cashew nut protein fractions in a neutral environment are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00393-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. CNPI had a distinctly higher EAI (20.21 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g), followed by albumin (10.46 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g), globulin (7.98 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g) and glutelin (7.03 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g), suggesting water-soluble and acid precipitation proteins could stabilize a higher interfacial area. However, the EAI of CNPI was higher than that of canola protein isolate (15.0 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g) in previous work from Karaca et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and cashew nut proteins reported by Ogunwolu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thus, cashew nut protein isolate was comparable to other plant proteins in EAI and suitable for emulsified foods such as ice cream, baked sweets and sausages. The EAI of albumin was significant higher (

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. According to Kato and Nakai [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-00393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], proteins with more hydrophobic groups could decrease interfacial tensions and increase the emulsifying capacity. Higher EAI of CNPI may be attributed to high surface hydrophobicity while in the case of albumin it may be due to its excellent solubility.
