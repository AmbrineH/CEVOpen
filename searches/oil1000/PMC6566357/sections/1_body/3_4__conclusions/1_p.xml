<p class="p">In conclusion, to successfully design a lotus-inspired superhydrophobic AA5083 surface with a facile, cost-effective and fluorine-free strategy, we provide an approach combining etching texture followed by chemisorption of HDTMS hydrophobic molecules. It was shown that the surface topography of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 possesses a micro-nano hierarchical petaloid structure with a contact angle of 156.3° ± 1° and a sliding angle lower than 1°. The wetting behavior investigations presented water-repellence, extremely low adhesivity and a self-cleaning ability. The EIS and fitting results showed that the

 <sub class="sub">dl</sub> of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 was four orders of magnitude lower than the pristine AA5083. The inhibition efficiency in this case was approximately 96.11%. In addition, after 90 days of air exposure and 12 days of a 3.5 wt.% NaCl immersion/contact, the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface sustained a durable and stable superhydrophobicity. Therefore, the resultant superhydrophobic AA5083 surface possesses superior corrosion-resisting performance and long-term stability. We greatly anticipate that this research work has important significance for the large-scale manufacturing of water-repellent superhydrophobic surfaces for long-term marine and industrial applications.
