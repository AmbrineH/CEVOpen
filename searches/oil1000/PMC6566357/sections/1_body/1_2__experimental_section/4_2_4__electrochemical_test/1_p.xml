<p class="p">The electrochemical tests were all carried out in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution through an Ametek Parstat 4000+ electrochemical workstation. A typical three-electrode measure system, including counter electrode (Pt sheet), reference electrode (saturated silver/silver chloride) and working electrode (pristine/superhydrophobic AA5083), was employed to proceed with the electrochemical tests. Prior to the test, the working electrode was exposed to a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution for more than 1 h, achieving a stable measuring system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under OCP (open circuit potential) at a frequency range of 100 kHzâ€“10 MHz. 
 <italic class="italic">ZsimpWin</italic> software was utilized to analyze and fit the EIS data for anti-corrosion evaluation.
