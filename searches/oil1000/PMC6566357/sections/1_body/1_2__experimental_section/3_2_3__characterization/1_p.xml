<p class="p">The surface topography of pristine and as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Nova Nano SEM450, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode 8, Karlsruhe, Germany). The AFM images were obtained under tapping mode. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford X-Max
 <sup class="sup">N</sup>50, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi, Massachusetts, MA, USA) were performed to determine the existence of the key elements upon the specimens. The XPS measurements were performed using a monochromated Al Kα irradiation and the chamber pressure was 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup> Torr during the test. The binding energy of adventitious carbon C1s (284.8 eV) was used as a basic reference. A Dataphysics OCA25 instrument (Stuttgart, Germany) was used to measure the static water contact angles and sliding angles of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 samples. For each measurement, at least three different positions were performed to obtain average data.
