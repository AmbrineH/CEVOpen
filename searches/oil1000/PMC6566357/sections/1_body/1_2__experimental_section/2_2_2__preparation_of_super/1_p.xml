 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, involving an etching-texture process and HDTMS assembly. Firstly, the pristine AA5083 substrates were sanded through SiC sandpaper with different grades (400, 800, 1200, etc.) and cleaned by sonication in ethanol and deionized water for more than 5 min, respectively. The cleaned and pristine AA5083 specimens were rinsed with deionized water and dried under an air blower before etching. Subsequently, the pristine AA5083 samples were immersed in 15 g/L sodium hydroxide aqueous solution for 30 min to accomplish the etching texture. After deionized water cleaning, ethanol cleaning and an 80 °C oven drying treatment, the etching-textured AA5083 specimens were immersed in a 3 vol.% HDTMS/ethanol solution for 1 h to chemically assemble HDTMS molecules. After the modification process, the modified AA5083 specimens were heated at 120 °C in a drying oven for 20 min.
