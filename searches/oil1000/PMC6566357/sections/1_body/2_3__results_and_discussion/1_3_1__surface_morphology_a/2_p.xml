<p class="p">As is well known, wetting behavior of a solid surface is mainly determined by roughness and surface energy. The microscale roughness and height relief of the pristine and as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces were revealed by AFM, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b display the topographic fluctuation of pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 specimens. It was found that the height relief of the pristine AA5083 substrate was about 160 nm. On the contrary, the height relief of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 was approximately 970 nm, presenting a significant improvement.

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values (scanning area 20 μm × 20 μm) were apparently increased to 107 nm, 142 nm and 1229 nm, respectively. As discussed above, the resultant superhydrophobic AA5083 surface features an obviously improved surface roughness. The etching-textured process contributes to this roughness enhancement, which is in favor of the air cushion formation and Cassie–Baxter contact of the water/solid/air interface.
