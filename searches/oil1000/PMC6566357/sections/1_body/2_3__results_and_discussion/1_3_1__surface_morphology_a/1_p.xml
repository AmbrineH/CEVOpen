<p class="p">The surface topography of pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces were characterized by FE-SEM. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> displays the SEM images of the pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. As for pristine AA5083 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a, some micro-grooves/scratches can be seen, which is attributed to the pre-treatment of the pristine AA5083 specimen. The surface of the pristine AA5083 is relatively smooth. For the etching-textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface, displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b, some micro-textured rough structure can be found.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b and presents an obviously nano-scale petaloid surface architecture of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 sample. These micro-nano hierarchical structures contribute to the increase of surface roughness and provide sufficient structural clearance for the formation of the trapped air cushion between the solid surface and the water droplet, which is beneficial for the final Cassie–Baxter contact state. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d shows the static water contact angle of pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The contact angle of the pristine AA5083 surface is about 81.6° ± 1°. After the etching texture and HDTMS assembly, however, the contact angle of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 surface is about 156.3° ± 1° with a sliding angle lower than 1°. The etching-textured, dual-scale surface rough structure and the low surface energy of the HDTMS molecules endowed the AA5083 substrate with a high static water contact angle and a low sliding angle.
