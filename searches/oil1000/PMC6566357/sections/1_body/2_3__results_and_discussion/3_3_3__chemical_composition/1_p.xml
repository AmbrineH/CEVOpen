<p class="p">The chemical composition of the pristine and HDTMS assembly superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces were characterized by EDS (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b). The surface is rich in C, O, Mg, Al and Si elements as evidenced by the EDS spectrum, preliminarily verifying the assembly of the long carbon-chain tail on the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. As is well known, the XPS spectra present a surface chemical composition with a detecting depth of a few nanometers. The detailed elemental composition was further investigated through an XPS spectrum, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b. It is obvious that C, O, Si and Al elements were detected and demonstrated in the XPS spectrum of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. Strong binding energy located at 284.7 eV, 532.4 eV, 102.3 eV and 74.6 eV were confirmed and ascribed to C 1s, O 1s, Si 2p and Al 2p, respectively, further confirming the existence of HDTMS species in the superhydrophobic AA5083 substrate. The C 1s, O 1s and Si 2p peaks in XPS spectra of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 sample were contributed to the HDTMS molecule assembly. This is in accordance with the EDS spectrum. It can be concluded, based on the analyses of surface topography, microscale roughness, wetting property and chemical composition, that the AA5083 substrates were endowed with excellent water repellent superhydrophobicity.
