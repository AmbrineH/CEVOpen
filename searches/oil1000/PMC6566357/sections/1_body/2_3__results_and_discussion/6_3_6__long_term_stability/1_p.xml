<p class="p">For practical applications, it is significant to characterize the stability of the superhydrophobic AA5083 specimen subjected to air exposure and a corrosive solution immersion for prolonged period. In this case, we carried out air exposure and a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution immersion experiments to evaluate the durability of the as-produced superhydrophobic AA5083 substrate, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a,b. After 90 days of air exposure and 12 days of a 3.5 wt.% NaCl immersion/contact of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface, it can be found from the contact angle and sliding angle variation that the as-prepared surface causes nearly no degradation of water-repellent superhydrophobicity with a contact angle higher than 155Â°, indicating outstanding long-term stability. The multiscale hierarchical structure and chemisorbed HDTMS hydrophobic molecules facilitate the formation of an air cushion, significantly contributing to the eventual water-repellence, air-exposure stability and corrosive-medium immersion stability.
