<p class="p">The larger etching-textured roughness and lower HDTMS surface energy played key roles in the resultant water-repellent superhydrophobicity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a displays the optical image of spherical water droplets, illustrating a waterproof property. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b,c show the surface response with a dynamic jet of water flow and faucet water impact. It can be clearly seen that the water flow jet and faucet water cannot remain on the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The water flow reflects, bounces and finally reflecting/rolling away easily from the specimen. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>dâ€“f presents the optical images of platform movement to contact and departing of the water droplet using the Dataphysics OCA25 instrument. With the gradually approaching, contacting and departing, the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 surface could completely depart from the water droplet after tight contact, suggesting an extremely low adhesivity.
