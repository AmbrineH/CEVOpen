<p class="p">The above wetting property and low adhesivity of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 can be explained by the combination action of the two-tier hierarchical rough structure and the HDTMS modification. Hierarchical petaloid rough structures benefit from the formation of the trapped air cushion, which significantly restrain the interfacial contact of the waterâ€“solid phase. Furthermore, the introduction of HDTMS molecules decrease the surface energy and further suppresses the penetration of water droplets into the surface structure. Thus, it can be concluded from the interaction between water and the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface that the water-repellent superhydrophobicity is attributed to the microscale roughness of the etching-textured surface and the low surface energy of HDTMS molecules. </p>
