<p class="p">As for real-world applications, the self-cleaning ability of superhydrophobic material is an essential and promising function. In this work, MnO powder and graphite powder were successively applied as surface contaminations of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 samples. The superhydrophobic AA5083 specimen was firstly inclined at an angle lower than 10Â°. Water droplets were subsequently dropped from above to evaluate the self-cleaning effect of the specimen. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a,b display the optical photos of the self-cleaning process. Given the excellent water repellence of the superhydrophobic AA5083 specimen, the water droplets can instantaneously roll off the sample surface, effectively picking up and taking away the MnO powder and graphite powder without difficulty. The water droplets rolled down the superhydrophobic AA5083 sample without moistening the solid surface, leaving several traces of rolling upon the surface. After washing, the contaminated AA5083 samples were totally clean and had no differences compared to the original uncontaminated specimen.
