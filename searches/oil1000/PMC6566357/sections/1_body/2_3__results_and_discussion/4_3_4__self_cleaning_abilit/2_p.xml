 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c presents the NaCl self-propelling property of the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The NaCl particle was put on the surface of the sample. After the water droplet fell to the surface, the NaCl particle was fused with the water droplet. The outstanding water-repellence of the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface overcame the gravity of the NaCl particle, exhibiting a typical droplet/NaCl bouncing and deformation. An extremely low sliding angle propelled the droplet/NaCl coalition.The NaCl self-propelling process only takes 360 ms from the water droplet falling to the final sliding away. The self-cleaning and NaCl self-propelling ability mentioned above can be mainly ascribed to the extremely low surface energy, low adhesivity and water-repellence property of the surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 substrate possesses an excellent self-cleaning ability resisting different surface contaminations.
