 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows the anticorrosion mechanism of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. When the pristine AA5083 is exposed to environments containing aggressive corrosive ions, the natural oxide film breaks down at specific points leading to the formation of localized corrosion on AA5083 surface, viz. pitting corrosion or intergranular corrosion. On the contrary, the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 surface could trap air within the micro-nano petaloid hierarchical structure, presenting a greatly decreasing fraction of the water/solid interface. The superior corrosion resistance is mainly attributed to the air cushion trapped in the petaloid rough structure, which suppresses the penetration and diffusion of aggressive corrosion species crossing the superhydrophobic protective film to the underlying AA5083 substrate. So, it can be implied that the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 specimen could largely improve the corrosion resistance of the substrate, displaying an outstanding protection ability towards marine corrosion attack.
