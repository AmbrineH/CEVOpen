<p class="p">In order to quantitatively characterize the corrosion behavior of the as-prepared superhydrophobic AA5083 film, we carried out and analyzed the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in an open circuit condition of a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous corrosive solution. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a presents the EIS plots and fittings of pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 substrates. It can be seen from superhydrophobic AA5083 EIS plots that the diameter of the capacitive loop is much larger than that of the pristine AA5083 specimen. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01592-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b displays Bode plots of log |Z| vs. frequency and fittings of the pristine AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces, presenting a three orders of magnitude higher impedance modulus value than that of the pristine AA5083 substrate. The anti-wetting and water-repellent property of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface contributes to the remarkable improvement of impedance modulus.
