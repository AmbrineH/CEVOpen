<p class="p">However, most of the fabrication methods above are hindered by several shortcomings, such as being time-consuming, high-cost and fluorine reagents employment, etc., restricting their large area usage and severely threatening ecological environments and human security. Until now, only limited attempts have been achieved to develop scalable and fluorine-free superhydrophobic aluminum surfaces for marine corrosion protection. So, these issues push us to explore a cost effective, facile and non-fluorinated approach, transforming intrinsically hydrophilic AA5083 with a Wenzel contact [
