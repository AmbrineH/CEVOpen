 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-01592" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] have been devoted to exploring the fabrication and investigating the consequent corrosion-resistant behavior of a superhydrophobic surface on aluminum/aluminum alloy substrates. For instance, Boinovich et al. [

 <xref rid="B33-materials-12-01592" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] reported a combination of nanosecond laser texturing and fluorinated hydrophobic agent chemisorption, achieving a superhydrophobic aluminum-magnesium alloy with an extremely low corrosion current. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-12-01592" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] used a hydrothermal in situ growth method to fabricate superhydrophobic Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide films on 6061 aluminum alloy substrates, presenting a highly improved corrosion resistance. In our previous reports, we developed an ammonia etching approach [

 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-01592" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] followed by 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane chemisorption to achieve superhydrophobic surfaces on aluminum/aluminum alloy substrates with multiscale hierarchical topography, and greatly enhanced corrosion inhibition performance.
