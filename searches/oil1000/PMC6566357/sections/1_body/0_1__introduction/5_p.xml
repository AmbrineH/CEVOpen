<p class="p">Herein, we report a facile, cost-effective and non-fluorinated fabrication strategy to prepare a superhydrophobic surface on an AA5083 substrate by combining etching texture and a hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS) hydrophobic molecules assembly. Detailed studies about the surface morphology and chemical composition were carried out successively. In addition, wetting property, self-cleaning ability, corrosion-resisting behavior and long-term stability were investigated to display the typical characteristics and promising functional applications. </p>
