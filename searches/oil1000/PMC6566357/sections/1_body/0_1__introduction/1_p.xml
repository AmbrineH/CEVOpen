<p class="p">Metals and their alloys are central engineering materials in numerous industrial fields. As a typical representative, 5083 aluminum alloys (AA5083), featuring a high strength-to-weight ratio and good weldability, are widely employed in military equipment, marine constructions, automobile manufacture and aerospace applications. However, proneness to localized corrosion attacks [

Corrosion attacks in aggressive environments can produce a premature failure of AA5083 structural materials, resulting in environmental disruption, enormous economic loss, as well as catastrophic safety accident. Thus, how to endow AA5083 materials with superior corrosion resistance is an extensively concerning issue.
