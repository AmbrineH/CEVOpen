 <p class="p">Though Collembola is a widespread hexapod its use of chemical compounds for defense has been reported for only a few European species. Chemical composition analyses of the hemolymphatic secretion of Neotropical Collembola using Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) has been performed for the first time. The GC-MS analysis revealed 32 constituents, such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, a phenol, an aldehyde and a ketone. Benzyl benzoate, the main component (at 46.98%), is a compound with known acaricide and insecticide properties. This is the first report on chemical constituents produced by Neotropical Pseudachorutinae, genus 
  <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic>, and will permit future secretion comparisons for Collembola. The taxonomic description of the species producing the secretion analyzed is provided; 
  <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov. (Collembola, Neanuridae, Pseudachorutinae) is the third known species of the genus; an updated diagnosis of the genus, an identification key, and further remarks on the species 
  <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> Stach, 1949 are provided.
