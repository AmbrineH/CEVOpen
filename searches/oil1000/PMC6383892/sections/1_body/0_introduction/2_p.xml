<p class="p">Collembola is subdivided into four major groups: Entomobryomorpha, Poduromorpha, Symphypleona, and Neelipleona, which are strikingly different in morphology and body tagmosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] compiled species of Collembola which had already been reported as unpalatable or toxic to their predators. Most of such deterrent Collembola species reported belong to Poduromorpha, the most conserved Collembola. According to Messner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], to avoid predation it is possible that all Collembola poduromorphs present at least some type of deterring substance. However, studies so far have been limited to five of the 11 poduromorph families (
