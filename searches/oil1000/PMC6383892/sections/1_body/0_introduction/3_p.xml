<p class="p">Belonging in Onychiuroidae, the families Onychiuridae and Tullbergiidae are characterized by the presence of special cuticular structures called pseudocelli, which secrete repellant substances [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The Neanuridae family subdivided into six subfamilies: Caputanurininae, Morulininae, Uchidanurinae, Frieseinae, Neanurinae

 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and Pseudachorutinae, these last two are the most diversified [

 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The Neotropical Poduromorpha fauna can be largely characterized by Pseudachorutinae, which presents many endemic taxa, including the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> Stach, 1949 [

 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and characterized by the absence of PAO and furca, the presence of 6+6 eyes disposed in a semi-circle, and large sized adult specimens. Today it includes only two species, 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria anura</italic> (Arlé, 1939) and 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria wygodzinskyi</italic> (Arlé, 1943), which have been described in Southeastern Brazil. The species herein described; 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov., was found in the same Brazilian region, a well-known biodiversity hotspot of the Brazilian Atlantic Tropical Forest.
