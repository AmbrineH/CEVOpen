<p class="p">The taxonomic description of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov., together with analyses of 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">anura</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">wygodzinskyi</italic> revealed for the first time (within Collembola) important post-embryonic modifications in the shape and size of the mandibles, with teeth numbers increasing from juveniles to adults. Other original data involved the presence of ten or more chaetae on (Ant. I) of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic>, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">anura</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">wygodzinskyi</italic> which present two pairs of S-chaetae on (Abd. Iâ€“III); being unique features within Neanuridae. Detailed analyses and descriptions of larger species in the tropics, such as those of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic>, will be needed for a better understanding of Pseudachorutinae taxonomic characters as well as generating reliable evolutionary scenarios and phylogenetic hypotheses.
