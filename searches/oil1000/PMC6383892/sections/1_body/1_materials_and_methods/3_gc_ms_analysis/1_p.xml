<p class="p">Chemical composition analysis of the secretions was performed using a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), Shimadzu, model QP 2010. Separation of the chemical constituents was carried out using a DB-5MS column [(5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane] brand Agilent J&amp;W GC Columns, 30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, thickness of the film 0.25 μm. The carrier gas was helium. The gas chromatograph operating conditions were: column internal pressure of 84 kPa, total flow 10 ml min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, column flow of gas at 1.4 ml.min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; Linear Velocity 42.7 cm.sec
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, Purge Flow: 3.0 mL.min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, column ion source temperature 250°C, low vacuum 7.4 Pa, high vacuum 5.9
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> Pa, Injection Mode: Split-less, detector temperature at the (GC/MS) interface: 320°C. The initial column temperature was 40°C for 4 min, followed by increases of 8°C min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> up to 320°C (being then kept constant for 59 min). The split ratio was 5:1. The mass spectrometry was programmed to perform readings in a range of 35 to 600 Da at intervals of 0.25 s, with the ionization EI (electrospray ionization) mode and ionization energy at 70 eV. One μl of secretion was injected (1 drop was dissolved in 2 ml of ethyl acetate). A mixture of linear hydrocarbons (C9-C20, C21-C40) was injected under the same conditions in order to help identify the chemical constituents. The identification of the constituents was based on data libraries; analyzing and comparing mass spectra (FFNSC1.3.lib, WILEY7.LIB, NIST08s.LIB, MY LIBRARY.lib). The GC/MS equipment indices presented similarities of ≥ 90%. Relative quantification of each constituent was obtained from the relative area of the peaks in the chromatogram.
