<p class="p">We note that none of the analyzed specimens present DL S-chaetae on Abd. I–III, suggesting that the absence of such chaetae; in contrast to what has been observed in other species of the genus the presence of a reduced S-chaetae formula (022/11111) is diagnostic for 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov. Two different S-chaetae formulas are proposed as characteristic for the genus, and thus attention must be given to the presence of two pairs of S-chaetae on Abd. I–III. The formula 22/22211 is thus not restricted to Pseudachorutinae, though in Neanuridae as a whole, it is both remarkable and uncommon.
