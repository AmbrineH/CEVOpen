<p class="p">Analysis of specimens deposited at the Collembola Collection of the Museu Nacional/UFRJ–Rio de Janeiro-Brazil, (two previously known species: 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">anura</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">wygodzinskyi</italic>), revealed important characteristics not mentioned in the original descriptions. In addition to conspicuous coloration patterns that clearly characterize the species, these also presented a distinctive S-chaetae body formula: 22/22211, i.e. besides the 2+2 S-chaetae on Th. II and III they also present 2+2 S-chaetae on Abd. I–III; being one pair on the De chaetae group and another on the DL group. The new species 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov., presents neither patches of white or yellow on its dark blue body, nor a pair of DL S-chaetae on Abd. I–III, and the new species presents rather long ordinary body chaetae; with an ordinary chaeta, S-chaeta ratio = 1:4.This remains in contrast to a ratio of at least 1:9 in the other two species (assuming equal length S-chaetae in all three species).
