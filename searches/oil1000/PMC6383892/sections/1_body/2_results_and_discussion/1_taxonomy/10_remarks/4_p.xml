<p class="p">An interesting age-related aspect in specimens of this genus regards their mandibles: juveniles, (generally up to 1.5mm), have mandibles with only 10–12 teeth. This was observed in about ten juvenile specimens. In fact, the description of

 <italic class="italic">anura</italic>, Arlé [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] illustrated the mandible of a juvenile with only ten teeth. Afterwards, Cassagnau &amp; Rapoport [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] depicted a 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">anura</italic> mandible based on specimens from the 
 <italic class="italic">Tijuca</italic> forest in Rio de Janeiro, (its type locality) with twenty teeth. 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">wygodzinskyi</italic> illustrations in turn, reveal the actual shape of an adult 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> mandible. This is the first report of mandible size and shape modification within Pseudachorutinae, and perhaps in Collembola as a whole throughout post-embryonic development. Within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> however, adult mandible shape and number of teeth is very stable, as verified in all three species.
