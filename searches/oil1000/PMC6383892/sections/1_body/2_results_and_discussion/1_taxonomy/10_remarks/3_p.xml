<p class="p">According to Queiroz &amp; Zeppelini [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] the antennal chaetotaxy of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> is similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">Handschinurida</italic>, which is corroborated in the description of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov. Further, antenna scheme differences encompass a group of 3–4 latero-external (almost ventral), smaller, and slender chaetae similar to S-chaetae of Ant. IV, between S8 and S10. These groups of chaetae were observed on all three species of the genus. Another remarkable feature is the number of chaetae on Ant. I, between 10–12 chaetae, higher than the usual 7 chaetae seen in the Pseudachorutinae genera [
