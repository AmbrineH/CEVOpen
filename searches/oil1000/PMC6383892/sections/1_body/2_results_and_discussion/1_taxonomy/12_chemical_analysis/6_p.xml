<p class="p">In our study of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov. secretions we also identified long chain fatty acids: palmitic acid (C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub>) and stearic acid (C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>), in their esterified forms, being methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl esters of palmitic acid, and an ethyl ester of stearic acid. In a study conducted by Dettner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], these same long chain fatty acids (palmitic acid and stearic acid) were identified by GC-MS analysis as major components. Dettner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] also identified three pyrido-pyridazine alkaloids: 2,3-dimethoxy-pyrido[2,3-
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>]pyridazine, 3-
 <italic class="italic">iso</italic>propyl-2-methoxy-pyrido[2,3-
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>]pyridazine, and 2-methoxy-4
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-pyrido[2,3-
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>]pyridazine in the pseudocellar fluid of 
 <italic class="italic">Tetrodontophora bielanensis</italic> (Waga, 1842), which has been shown to present repellent properties against 
 <italic class="italic">Nebria brevicolis</italic> (Fabricius, 1792) (a common predator), causing beetle disorientation and cleansing behavior.
