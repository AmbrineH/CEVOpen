<p class="p">The presence of benzyl benzoate, in 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov. secretions is primarily acknowledged as a consequence of food ingestion and consequent incorporation to the hemolymph. In addition to other substances, decaying leaves and twigs of plants that synthesize the compound may be ingested by the species. This is corroborated by the distribution of two plant species that produce benzyl benzoate, 
 <italic class="italic">Myroxylon balsamum</italic> (L.) Harms, and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hirsuta</italic>; as well as many species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0212451.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], which are congruent with that of 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria assu</italic> sp. nov.
