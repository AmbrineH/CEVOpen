<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Brasilimeria</italic> is characterized by the absence of furca (ventral abdominal appendages of segment IV which are modified for jumping), and by large adult specimens, being generally longer than 3 mm, and even reaching 4 mm. The species thus presents reduced mobility and little potential for predator evasion, depending entirely on short cursorial legs that result in clumsy movements. In this sense, the large presence of insecticidal and acaricide substances, such as benzyl benzoate, may be considered as a great ecological/evolutionary advantage against predators.
