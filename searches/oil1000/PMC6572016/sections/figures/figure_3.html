 <p> The three-dimensional Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (3D CLSM) images of C. albicans ATCC 10321 under the clove oil (I) and thyme oil (II) treatment, scale bar 2 µm. Four-channel fluorescence of thyme/clove oil at MIC: ( A) Transmission Channel, ( B) Red Channel, ( C) Blue Channel, ( D) Green Channel, ( E) stack of Red-Blue-Green Channels, ( F) cross-section of Red-Blue-Green Channels stack (green fluorescence on the cell surface, blue and red fluorescence in the inner part of the cell in cytoplasm, all fluorescence signals in vacuoles). Four-channel fluorescence of thyme/clove oil at ½ MIC: ( G) Transmission Channel, ( H) Red Channel, ( I) Blue Channel, ( J) Green Channel, ( K) stack of Red-Blue-Green Channels, ( L) cross-section of Red-Blue-Green Channels stack (green, blue and red fluorescence signals in vacuoles). </p>
