<p class="p">The results of the analysis are presented as a reduction in the number of yeast in biofilm structure calculated from the formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Reduction [% (CFU/cm
  <sup class="sup">2</sup>)] = (log B − log A)/log B × 100
 </disp-formula>where: A—number of cells in biofilm in the presence of essential oil [CFU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>], B—number of cells in biofilm structure without the addition of essential oil [CFU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>].
