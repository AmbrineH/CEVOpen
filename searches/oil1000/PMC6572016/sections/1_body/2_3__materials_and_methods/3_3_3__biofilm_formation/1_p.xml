<p class="p">The influence of clove and thyme oils on biofilm formation was tested on different surfaces (glass, polypropylene PP, polyethylene terephthalate PET), as described previously [

 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains were grown in liquid Sabouraud medium (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. 2 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> cell suspensions (10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL) were inoculated onto the material slices (20 mm × 20 mm) that were contained in six-well tissue plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and allowed to adhere for 90 min. at 30 °C in an orbital shaker (75 rpm) (adhesion phase). The non-adherent cells were then removed by gently washing twice with 1 mL PBS and essential oil at MIC concentration (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01954-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) in liquid Sabouraud medium was added. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of clove and thyme oils were estimated previously [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] by the means of the broth macrodilution method. Afterwards, the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h (biofilm formation phase). Material slices with adhered 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> cells were incubated in Sabouraud broth without addition of essential oils in the controls. Quantification of biofilm was performed by the standard count plate method and the number of yeast was determined on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 30 °C.
