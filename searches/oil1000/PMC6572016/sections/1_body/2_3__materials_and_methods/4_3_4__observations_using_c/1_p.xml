<p class="p">Cells of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10321 that were treated with essential oils were examined using the Leica TCS SP8 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and the LAS X 2.0.2.15022 software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in the Laboratory of Microscopic Imaging and Specialized Biological Techniques, University of Łódź. The fluorescence excitation of oils was induced using UV (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) diode of 405 nm., while the detection was recorded by three separate detectors with 800 ± 5 gain and -0.5 offset: PMT 1 at a 430–480 nm (Blue Channel), PMT 3 at a 500–550 nm (Green Channel), and PMT 5 at a 600–650 nm (Red Channel). Moreover, a PMT Trans Channel was used to visualize the cells in transmitted light. Each sample was scanned in the ‘xyz’ axes to a depth of 30 µm (three-dimensional (3D) scan) while using HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.40 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) Oil objective. Line Average of 4× was used to improve the quality of images. The images were visualised in 3D view using a surface and blend mode with an adjusted threshold for a cross-section of cells.
