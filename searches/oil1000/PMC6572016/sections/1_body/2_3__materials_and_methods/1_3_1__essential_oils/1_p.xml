<p class="p">The antibiofilm activity against food-borne 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains was estimated for clove (
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry) and thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) essential oils. The commercial oils that were purchased from Pollena Aroma S.A. (Warszawa, Poland) were used. Chemical composition of EOs was analyzed by GC-MSFID using Trace GC Ultra (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) combined with DSQ II mass spectrometer and with flame ionization detector (FID) throughout the MS-FID splitter (SGE; Analytical Science, Trajan, Australia). Analysis was provided using a nonpolar capillary column Rtx-1 ms (60 m × 0.25 mm, with a film thickness 0.25 µm; Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The oven temperature was programmed, as follows: 50–300 °C at 4 °C/min; injector temperature 280 °C; detector temperature 310 °C; carrier gas helium with regular pressure 200 kPa; and, ionization energy 70 eV, ion source temperature 200 °C. The identification of components was based on the comparison of their mass spectra with those in a laboratory-made MS library, commercial libraries (NIST 09, Wiley 275.1, Mass Finder 4), along with the retention indices that were associated with a series of alkanes with linear interpolation (C8–C26). A quantitative analysis (expressed as percentages of each component) was carried out by peak area normalization measurements without correction factors.
