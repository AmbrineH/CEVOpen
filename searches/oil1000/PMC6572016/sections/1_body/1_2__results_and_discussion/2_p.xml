<p class="p">Essential oils were applicated at the early stage of biofilm formation, i.e., after adhesion phase, in order to determine whether thyme and clove oils can prevent the development of biofilm by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains. The essential oils were used at MIC values that were determined for yeasts planktonic forms, appropriate for the oil and each strain. The treatment with clove oil resulted in the total inhibition of biofilm formation by

 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> fo/BM/01, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rugosa</italic> fo/BG/05, and both 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains ATCC 10231 and cl/MP/01 on the surface of glass and polypropylene (PP). On PP,

 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> fo/BM/01, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rugosa</italic> fo/BG/05, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cl/MP/01. Only three isolates, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> LOCK 0009, 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> fo/82/3, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. pelliculosa</italic> LOCK 0007, showed resistance to clove oil in terms of biofilm formation on all of the materials tested. Except for complete inhibition of biofilm development in the presence of clove oil, the number of cells in the biofilm structure was reduced on a statistically significant level in 53.8% yeasts on the surface of glass (by 13.1–77.3%), 78.6% on PET (18.8–87.5%), and 58.3% on PP (34.3–77.9%).
