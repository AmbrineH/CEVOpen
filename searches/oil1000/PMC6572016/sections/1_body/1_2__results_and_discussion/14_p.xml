<p class="p">In conclusion, clove and thyme oils can be used as effective anti-biofilm agents in the prevention of materials colonization by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> sp. Thus, a valuable direction for further research could be the application of these oils as materials coatings to prevent 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> biofilm formation. In addition, yeast seems to be able to actively carry out the detoxification process involving vacuoles, when treated with essential oils in sub-lethal concentrations. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding defence mechanisms of yeast cell against the toxic effects of essential oils.
