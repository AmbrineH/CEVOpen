<p class="p">To date, the methods that were used or developed to eradicate biofilms in industrial conditions can be classified into three groups: physical (mechanical surface cleaning, exposure to high or low temperature, use of ultrasonic waves, electric field or cold plasma, application of photodynamic therapy), biological (matrix-targeting enzymes, phagotherapy), and chemical (drugs, biocides, surfactants) [
