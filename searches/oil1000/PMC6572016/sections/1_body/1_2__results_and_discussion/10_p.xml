<p class="p">The clove and thyme oils differed in chemical compositions, although both of the essential oils are characterized by a high contents of phenolic compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01954-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Regardless of the type and chemical nature of the essential oil, the localization of both oils in yeast cell was similar. At MIC concentrations of the oils, their compounds disparately diffused into the cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01954-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). A green fluorescence was visible on the cell wall surface, indicating that the oil compounds covered the surface of the cell or adhered to the external cell structures, i.e., cell wall or cellular membrane. A blue fluorescence signal has shown the oil compounds penetrating into the cell and probably localized into the cytoplasm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01954-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, I F and II F). Similarly, the red fluorescence signal was noticeable in the cytoplasm. Moreover, three fluorescence signals were detected in the inner part of the cell in vacuoles (Red, Blue, and Green Channels superimposed) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01954" class="xref">Video S1 and S3</xref>), indicating the presence of the oils compounds. Interestingly, after the yeast treatment with clove and thyme oils at Â½ MIC concentrations, all of the detected signals were localized in vacuoles, and the weakest one was registered in the Red Channel (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01954" class="xref">Video S2 and S4</xref>). Besides vacuoles, no fluorescence inside the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> cell or on the surface of the cell was detected. The vacuolar localization of the essential oils indicates the action of cell defense mechanisms against essential oils by isolating them within the cell and limiting contact with cell organelles.
