 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] demonstrated the role of vacuoles in detoxifying the cytoplasm by sequestering e.g., heavy metal ions or calcium ions at toxic concentration. Yeast vacuoles are the largest lysosomes-like organelle in fungi, participating in the degradation of cell components, storage of ions, metabolites, and organic and inorganic nutrients. Vacuoles play a key role in homeostasis, which is important for adaptation to new environments and survival under stressful conditions [
