<p class="p">In this context, the application of essential oils could be promising in reducing the risk of biofilm development. Especially that, according to presented results, at the early stage of biofilm formation, essential oils can be used, even at MIC concentration, usually much lower than the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration. Khan and Ahmad [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] reported the high inhibitory effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> oils on biofilm formation by drug-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., as related to the inhibition of filamentation, matrix disappearance, destruction of three-dimensional structure of biofilm, and shrinkage in the cell membranes of sessile cells. Likewise, eucalyptus, peppermint, ginger grass, and clove oils have been shown to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation by 28.6â€“80.9%, probably by exerting a metabolic interference in 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> biofilm [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> essential oil at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations can significantly reduce 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate resin surface, and thus can be used as an antifungal denture cleanser [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Strong antibiofilm activity have been also reported for 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Carum copticum</italic> oils against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. of various clinical origin, and their effectiveness, even at sub-MICs, was much higher than fluconazole [
