<p class="p">Apart from the inhibitory activity of the essential oils, their antibiofilm action is also presumably linked with the oil location within the yeast cells and it may have an effect on the interactions between the cell and the abiotic surface. We used a confocal laser scanning microscopy technique to visualize the clove and thyme oils placement in the 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> yeast cell. This technique allows for tracing plant secondary metabolites distribution with both the plant and microorganism cells due to the autofluoresescence phenomenon [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This model study was conducted with the use of the reference 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 strain, and essential oils in two concentrations, i.e., MIC, as in evaluation of biofilm development, and ½ MIC to assess the effect of essential oils in the sub-inhibitory concentration. Excitation by 405 nm resulted in an emission of fluorescence being detected in three channels: at 430–480 nm in a Blue Channel, at 500–550 nm in a Green Channel, and at 600–650 nm in a Red Channel, responding to the respective colour images (
