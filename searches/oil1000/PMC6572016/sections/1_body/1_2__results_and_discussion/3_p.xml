<p class="p">After treatment with thyme oil, the total inhibition of biofilm development was observed for three strains (

 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. boidinii</italic> fo/MP/01 on the surface of glass and PP, and also 
 <italic class="italic">C. lusitaniae</italic> LOCK 0004 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> fo/BM/02 on glass, did not grow in a biofilm structure. Furthermore, in the presence of thyme oil 58.3% isolates showed a statistically significant decrease in cells number in biofilm on the surface of glass (by 24.9–66.1%), 68.8% on PET (by 16.0–69.5%), and 50% on PP (by 20.7–71.0%). Only two yeast 
 <italic class="italic">C. colliculosa</italic> fo/KO/02 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> fo/82/3 were insensitive to thyme oil in the concentrations used, which resulted in biofilm formation on the materials under study (
