<p class="p">Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to find the manner in which the independent variables (the type of abiotic surface and the type of essential oil) affected the collectively treated set of dependent variables (reduction in biofilm formation by 19 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains tested). On the basis of MANOVA analysis, no statistically significant direct relationship was found between the type of oil, as well as the material and their effect on biofilm formation. However, some dependencies can be determined. Generally, biofilm development was limited more by clove than thyme oil on the surface of PP and PET (

More significant differences (about 10%) concerned the antibiofilm activity of clove and thyme oils on the surface of PP. Whereas, the impact of both oils on biofilm reduction on the surface of PET varied by 15 to 20%. The antibiofilm effectiveness of the essential oils tested can be related to the physicochemical properties of abiotic materials, since microbial adhesion preferably occurs on hydrophobic surfaces than on hydrophilic ones with lower contact angles. Polymers, such as PP or PET with a higher contact angle (108° and 103°, respectively), are more hydrophobic than glass (38.5°) [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Another important factor can be substratum surface roughness, which enhances the rate of biofilm adhesion when increased. Glass is characterized by very smooth surface and higher ease of the relative biofilm removal when compared to polymers [
