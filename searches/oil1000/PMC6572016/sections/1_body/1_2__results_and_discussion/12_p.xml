<p class="p">Previously we have reported that various essential oils of different chemical composition affected the same cellular targets, and the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects occur by the same universal mechanism [

This assumption was confirmed in this study, and probably the activity of the various essential oils resulted from their complex nature rather than the presence of a particular compound. As we have shown earlier, the anticandidal activity of thyme and clove oils is related to the disruption of the permeability barrier of

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. This finding, together with CLSM observations in the present study, suggests two explanations for the oils different distribution in the cell when used at sub-MIC and MIC concentrations. Probably, at the lower oil concentration, all of its compounds are separated in the yeast cell vacuole, whereas at the higher concentration of the oil this mechanism of a cell defense is not efficient enough. However, the possibility that the oil treatment at the MIC concentration leads to the loss of membranes integrity cannot also be excluded, resulting in the release of essential oils compounds, which were initially located in vacuoles, into other cell compartments.
