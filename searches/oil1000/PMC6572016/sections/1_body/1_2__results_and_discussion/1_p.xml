 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. All of the materials tested in the study (glass, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate) are used in food packaging. Furthermore, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate are representing biomaterials that are used in implantable medical devices, i.e., heart valve structures, sutures, vascular grafts and prosthesis, shunt, and sutures [
