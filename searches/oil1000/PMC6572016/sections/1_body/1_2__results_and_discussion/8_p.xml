 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> biofilm development is of paramount importance in nosocomial environments, since biofilm formation was reported as an independent predictor of increased mortality [

 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species in the form of biofilm associated with food may pose a threat to a massive influx into the human intestinal tract. The risk of candidiasis interlinked with food-borne strains is related to the possibility of yeasts penetration into human oral epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and persorption, even through undamaged mucosa [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Biofilm formation in the food industry may also cause high economic losses. The trends in antibiofilm strategies involve the modification of material surface to reduce the adhesion of microorganisms and interference in the initial phase of biofilm development. To date, some antimicrobial or anti-adhesion coatings have been successfully implemented on materials to avoid microbial colonization, including furanones coated silicone, polypropylene, and polytetrafluorethylene, oregano essential oil introduced into polylactic acid films, or poly(ethylene oxide) with encapsulated tea tree oil and beta-cyclodextrin [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The application of essential oils in materials coatings can provide both anti-adhesive and anticandidal effects. However, further research should be carried out in this area.
