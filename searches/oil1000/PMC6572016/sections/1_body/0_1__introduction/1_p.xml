<p class="p">Some species of the 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> genus are responsible for infections related to biofilm formation, which is considered to be an important virulence factor. Biofilm forming 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains are associated with higher patients mortality, probably correlated with the poor permeability of the matrix to the antifungal drugs [

 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> infections is associated not only with biofilm that is formed on medical devices, such as catheters, implants, endoprosthesis, fixation, and artificial valves, but also with the biofilm produced in food products and on food-packaging surfaces [
