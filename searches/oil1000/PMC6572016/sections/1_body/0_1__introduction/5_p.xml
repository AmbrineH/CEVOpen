<p class="p">The aim of the research was to examine whether the process of initial colonization of chosen abiotic surfaces (glass, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene) by food-borne 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> sp. and the formation of mature biofilm structure can be impeded by clove and thyme essential oils. In the study food-borne 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains of different origin were used, since, as we have shown previously, they exhibit some virulence factors and may be allocated in a group of risk of potential pathogens [

In addition, the similarity of food-borne and clinical strains implies the possibility of circulating of antibiotic-resistant strains outside the hospital environment and the possible yeast infection that is caused by yeasts entered via food [
