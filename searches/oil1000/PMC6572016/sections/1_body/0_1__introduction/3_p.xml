<p class="p">The structure of biofilm enhances the effectiveness of microbial protection against the adverse environmental factors, including antibiotics, reduces the effectiveness of host defense mechanisms and facilitates the acquisition of nutrients [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Biological mechanisms diminishing the sensitivity of the yeast biofilm to antifungal compounds are related to the active drug efflux, the limited drug penetration through the extracellular matrix, a low metabolic activity of cells in mature biofilm, and different expression of genes in biofilm than in planktonic forms [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The active drug efflux plays a principal role in the resistance in the early stage of biofilm development [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The role of the extracellular matrix in biofilm drug resistance seems to be less important, because the resistance occurs shortly after 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> adhesion to the surfaces, before EPS production [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The matrix function in the resistance is rather associated with the support of the biofilm integrity and the limitation of cells access to various compounds. Moreover, the EPS matrix does not affect the reduction of drug diffusion and the diffusion process is not dependent on the structure and maturity of the biofilm [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The drug resistance may also be a consequence of low metabolic activity and the slow growth of cells in a mature biofilm. However, the research on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm with a controlled rate of growth show the relationship between drug resistance and the rate of growth only for the planktonic forms and not for biofilm phenotype [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. An important attribute of biofilm is also the ability to produce a small population of persister cells that are extremely resistant to antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01954" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Rather, the drug resistance of persister cells is the result of the metabolically dormant state of the cells and it is independent of cell membrane composition and efflux pump expression.
