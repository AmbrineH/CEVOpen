 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> essential oils significantly reduced the bean weight losses caused by 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic>, and significantly reduced the number of beans damaged when doses of 60 or 120 μL were applied to them, in addition to concentrating a greater number of holes per bean with the 120 μL dose of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum.</italic> In addition, these essential oils exhibited similar patterns for insecticidal activities over the insects when these oils were sprayed directly in Petri dishes or indirectly over beans in glass jars. These essential oils affected the development of 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic>, since the greatest doses applied on beans decreased the emergence of the bean weevil. The present study supports the insecticidal capacity of basil and citronella essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> and their potential use in environmentally low risk pest control strategies. Supplementary trials should be conducted under real storage conditions
