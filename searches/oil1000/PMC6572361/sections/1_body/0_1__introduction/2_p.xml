<p class="p">The control and management of this pest in big storage facilities relies mainly on the use of phosphine, pyrethroids, organophosphates, and other synthetic insecticides [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], but these products are highly toxic to human health and the environment, to which is added the problem of being able to develop resistances on the part of the insects against these products [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Control applied by small farmers is virtually non-existent. As a result, research focuses on the development of new compounds with greater selectivity, less environmental persistence, and a variety of modes of action and new sustainable alternatives [
