<p class="p">The present study explores the insecticidal potential of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> on stored beans by non-fumigant applications. Moreover, research on the biological activity of essential oils against the bean weevil during storage is extrapolated to the effects on the behavior of the adult insects and their development.
