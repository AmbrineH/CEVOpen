<p class="p">Previous research has suggested that finding new compounds with greater selectivity, less environmental persistence, and a variety of modes of action is the key for a new generation of control strategies [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Plant metabolites and essential oils possess these characteristics and pose substantially fewer risks than those of traditional chemical insecticides. Therefore, natural plant products have been proposed worldwide as an alternative for the control of mites and insect pests [
