<p class="p">These essential oils exhibited similar patterns for insecticidal activity over the 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> when sprayed directly in Petri dishes or indirectly over beans in glass jars using different doses. The insecticidal activity of both oils did not exceed 15 days after application. In the same range, it is well described by Ilboudo et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] for several other essential oils. Losses of activity for essential oils are normally due to degradation of the active compounds. In this respect, essential oils containing more hydrogenated compounds are more susceptible to oxidation [
 <xref rid="B55-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Various studies with essential oils obtained from species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> spp. (
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>) showed good results regarding their insecticidal effect against insect pests that attack grains. Kéita et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] evaluated (by fumigation) the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> for the control of 
 <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> F. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) and obtained 80% and 70% mortality of the insect population evaluated with 25 μL. Rozman et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] reported toxicity of fumigated linalool against 
 <italic class="italic">Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), 
 <italic class="italic">Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), and 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus oryzae</italic> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in fumigation with Linalool, one of the main components of basil essential oil, where Linalool was highly effective for 
 <italic class="italic">R. dominica</italic>, and caused 100% mortality at the lowest tested concentration (0.1 mL/720 mL of volume). Ogendo et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] obtained a 98%, 99%, and 100% mortality against 
 <italic class="italic">R. dominica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Oryzaephilus surinamensis</italic> L. (Coleoptera: Silvanidae) and 
 <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus chinensis</italic> L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) using 1 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> essential oil per litre of air.
