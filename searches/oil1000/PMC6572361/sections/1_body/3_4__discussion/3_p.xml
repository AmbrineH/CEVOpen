<p class="p">The main components for 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> were the terpenoid mix Citral (0.7%), the monoterpenoids Citronellol (11.5%) and Citronellal (34.0%), the monoterpenoid with an alcohol Geraniol (22.0%), and the terpene Limonene (3.5%), coinciding with those described by Leite et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and Rodrigues et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. That is, the main essential oil components of 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> oil are the monoterpenes, citronellol, citronellal and geraniol. Monoterpenes possess insecticidal and insect repellent properties, as described by Isman [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and Chen and Viljoen [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The proportion of main components obtained in 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> oil were very similar to those obtained by Renkema et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], Martins et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], and Vieira and Simon [
 <xref rid="B53-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] described that the chemical composition of essential oils can show large variability, both interspecific and within the same species. It seems to depend on the genetic characteristics of the plant and on the conditions under which it was grown.
