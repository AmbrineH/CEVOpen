 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> essential oil, on the 8th day of evaluation, the 120 μL dose was able to kill 48.66 ± 4.41% of the evaluated insect population, only significantly greater (F = 7.48; df = 5.18; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than the obtained by 60 μL dose. Nevertheless, on day 9, a 120 μL dose was able to kill more than 72% of the insects, being significantly greater (F = 20.09; df = 5.18; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than the obtained by other doses evaluated, with the exception of 12 μL (64.18 ± 5.59%). Finally, when using a 120 μL dose, a total control (100% of insects died) was achieved from day 11th. Doses of 24 and 6 μL, were able to kill 100% of the insects only from day 13. Again, mortality observed for all doses was significantly higher than the control treatment from the 7th day onwards, in which the percentage mortality was 21.60 ± 1.93% on day 15th (
