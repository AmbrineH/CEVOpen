<p class="p">The original population of 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults was collected during the year 2013 in different bean storage facilities, all of them located in the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) “Alubia de La Bañeza-León,” which certifies the quality and high standards of beans from this region (EC Reg. n.256/2010 published on 26 March 2010, OJEU L880/17). The insects were reared in glass jars (150 mm in diameter and 250 mm high) with common bean (
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) seeds and covered with cloth, allowing gas exchange. Every three days all 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults were removed from the jar in order to maintain a population of young adults (1 to 3 day old) ready to use in the experiments. 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults, before and after the treatments, were kept in a chamber with a controlled temperature (24 ± 1 °C), humidity (60 ± 5%), and a photoperiod of 16 h of light (luminous intensity of 1000 lux) and 8 h of darkness.
