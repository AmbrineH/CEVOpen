<p class="p">This bioassay was conducted to determine the dose-dependent toxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults. For the treatments application, a Potter Tower (Burkard Scientific Limited, Uxbridge, UK) [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] of manual loading coupled to an air compressor was used. The total volume used in each spray was 1 mL, applied on Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter) covered with a sterile filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany), to make sure that the treatments were retained, at 40 kPa. Five doses (6, 12, 24, 60, and 120 μL/petri dish) of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> were diluted in ethanol, and four replicates were performed for each of them. A treatment with ethanol (without oil) was used as a control. After application of treatments, twenty unsexed 1 to 3 day old 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> were placed in the Petri dish. From now, ‘Petri dish’ will be considered as the basic test unit. The Petri dishes were kept in a chamber with a controlled temperature (24 ± 1 °C), humidity (60 ± 5%), and a photoperiod of 16 h of light (luminous intensity of 1000 lux) and 8 h of darkness. On the covers of Petri dishes, 8 holes of 1 mm diameter (8 mm

 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults.
