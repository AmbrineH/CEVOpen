<p class="p">The second bioassay was conducted to determine the toxicity (sublethal effects) of the essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults when sprayed over 
 <italic class="italic">P. vulgaris</italic> seeds. The same doses of each essential oil as described above were used. The treatments were applied with a Potter Tower (Burkard Scientific Limited, Uxbridge, UK) [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-10-00151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] over 70 g of bean seeds that were placed in 0.33 L glass jars (80 mm in diameter and 85 mm in height). After the application, the jars were manually shaken for 60 s, ensuring a complete distribution of the essential oil over the beans. After the treatment’s application, twenty unsexed 1 to 3 day old 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults were placed in each jar, and the jars were kept under controlled conditions of temperature (24 ± 1 °C), humidity (60 ± 5%), and a photoperiod of 16 h of light (luminous intensity of 1000 lux) and 8 h of darkness. On the covers of the glass jars, 8 holes of 1 mm diameter (8 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were made to avoid the vapor accumulation effect from the treatments. Daily monitoring was carried out during the following 15 days after the application of each treatment, counting the mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> adults. Five doses (18, 36, 72, 180 and 360 μL/litre) of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. winterianus</italic> were diluted in ethanol. A treatment with ethanol was used as a control. Four replicates were used for each dose, and the doses were calculated as μL of essential oil/volume of the container. From day 32 after the treatment application on the beans, the number of 
 <italic class="italic">A. obtectus</italic> that emerged from the beans (first generation) was recorded. Likewise, from day 48, the number of damaged beans (with at least one hole), holes per bean, and the weight loss of the damaged beans were also recorded in this experiment.
