<p class="p">It can be concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">hydroSOStainable</italic> olive oils had: (i) complied with criteria to be classified as EVOO, (ii) some of them improved contents of total phenolic compounds at moderate stress levels, (iii) an enriched fatty acid profile (~3.5% increased contents of oleic acid and decreased contents of SFAs), (iv) higher contents of several volatile compounds, and (v) higher intensities of key sensory attributes, which may make them more attractive to consumers. Finally, the Confederation RDI (T2) is the recommended irrigation treatment because it (i) saved 66% of irrigation water, (ii) led to high simultaneous contents of phenolic compounds and slightly increased the monounsaturated fatty acids, and (iii) had a balanced sensory profile.
