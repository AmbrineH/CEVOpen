<p class="p">Results of antioxidant activity (AA), measured by two methods (ABTS

 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. No statistical differences between irrigation treatments were found regarding both AA methods, although a different trend was observed for TPC. Treatment 2 showed the highest value of TPC, while T1 had the smallest one. The correlation between TPC and stress level was studied, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02148-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows that this correlation produced a quadratic relationship in which it could be seen that TPV increased as the minimum midday stem water potential decreased until −4 MPa; at this stress level, phenols start to decrease.
