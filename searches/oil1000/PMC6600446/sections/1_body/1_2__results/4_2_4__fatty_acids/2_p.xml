<p class="p">Irrigation treatments induced some differences among the oil composition. In general, the highest content of SFAs was found in control oils, while the smallest one was found in the Confederation SDI (T3) oils. Palmitic acid, the predominant SFA, showed this same pattern (19.93 and 19.05 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> olive oil for T0 and T3, respectively), as well as lignoceric acid. Regarding the MUFAs content, the Optimal RDI (T1) oil showed a lower value than all deficit irrigation treatments. Oleic acid was affected by the irrigation treatments, having control (47.38 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> olive oil) oils the smallest content in comparison with Optimus RDI (50.13 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> olive oil), Confederation RDI (51.29 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> olive oil), and Confederation SDI (51.00 g 100 g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> olive oil). In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9-heptadecenoic acid, all the oils under deficit irrigation increased their concentration in comparison to the control. Finally, and as a general finding, PUFAs were not affected by the irrigation strategies.
