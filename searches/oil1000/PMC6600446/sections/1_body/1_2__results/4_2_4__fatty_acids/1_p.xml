<p class="p">Fatty acids are one of the most important parameters to be analyzed in olive oil, and, in this study, 22 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), providing a very detailed characterization of the composition of the oils. Ten saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were found, with palmitic and stearic acids being the predominant ones. Regarding monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), eight compounds were found, among which, oleic acid was the major one; also, the compounds C18:1 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-11 and C16:1 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9 (palmitoleic acid) had important concentrations. Concerning polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), five compounds were found, standing out linoleic acid.
