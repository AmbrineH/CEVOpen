<p class="p">Results of the atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI) are also shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The oils under study had the smallest indexes compared to different oils [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], which means that olive oil is one of the most healthy oils as reflected by their low AI and TI indexes. Low AI values represent low possibilities of atheroma formation (the possibility of lipid adhesion to cells of the immune circulatory system); besides, low TI values are associated with low chances of formation of clots in the blood vessels [
