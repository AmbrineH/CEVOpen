<p class="p">In order to study the correlation between the accumulative stress in the trees and all the studied functional and sensory parameters, Pearson correlation was done with SI, and significant results are compiled in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Regarding fatty acids, a positive correlation was found between the SI and C17:1 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and a negative correlation with linoleic and the total content of SFAs, meaning that the higher the stress, the better the fatty acid profile (an increase of MUFAs and decrease of SFAs). Regarding volatile compounds, a negative correlation between the SI and the aldehydes was found, but the correlation was positive for the total ester content and six compounds of this chemical family (2-methylbutanal, 2-methylbuan-1-ol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z)</italic>-hex-3-en-1-ol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z)</italic>-hex-3-enyl acetate, hexyl acetate, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z)</italic>-hex-2-enyl acetate), which are associated with increased intensity of key aroma notes, such as apple, fruity, sweet, fresh, green, and grass. Finally, green-herbs and sour showed a negative correlation with the SI, although almond, walnut, sweet, and astringency were positively correlated with the SI.
