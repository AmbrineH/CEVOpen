<p class="p">After the official panel determined the commercial quality of all oils under study as EVOO, (average of 4.0 on fruity attribute), the “Food quality and safety” panel conducted descriptive sensory analysis. The lexicon and reference materials used and the sensory profiles of the studied oils are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Regarding the positive attributes of flavor, all olive oils under deficit irrigation shared a lower intensity of both green-herbs note and sourness in comparison with the control oil but increased intensities of almond and walnut notes and sweetness. In the Optimal RDI (T1), a decrease in intensity was found for most of the attributes (fruity-olive, fruity-green, floral, green-grass, and bitter). Concerning the Confederation RDI (T2) oil, fruity-olive, fruity-green, and green-herbs increased, and woody note decreased. Finally, the Confederation SDI (T3) oils also increased the intensity of the fruity-olive and woody notes but decreased that of the green-herbs note. No negative attributes (defects) were found in any of the oils under study. Concerning mouthfeel descriptors, astringency increased in T2 and T3, which could be correlated with increased polyphenol content, and, lastly, viscosity also showed an increase in the T2 and T3 oils.
