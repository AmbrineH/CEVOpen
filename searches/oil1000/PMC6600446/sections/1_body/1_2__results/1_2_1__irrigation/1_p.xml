<p class="p">Four irrigation treatments were applied to olive trees with different types of stress following crop water status by measuring midday stem water potential. Results of the applied water, stress integral (SI), minimum stem water potential (min ψ
 <sub class="sub">stem</sub>), yield, and mill oil yield are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Not statistically significant differences in min ψ
 <sub class="sub">stem</sub> and SI were found. Such lack of results was likely related with a wide variability of data, and min ψ
 <sub class="sub">stem</sub> in control trees (T0) was low due to irrigation problems (for a few weeks in July). SI described better the levels of stress reached in the irrigation treatments. SI showed a tendency (

While Confederation RDI (T2) had the highest stress (182 MPa × day) because of the reduced volume of water applied. Although Optimal RDI (T1) received a higher water volume than the Confederation SDI (T3), T1 water stress was higher because water deprivation was applied during stage II. The treatments did not affect significantly (
