<p class="p">Analytical parameters for olive oil grading are used to determine oil commercial quality. Following European Regulation [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], olive oil could be cataloged as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin olive oil (VOO), or lampante olive oil, which needs to be refined before consumption. EVOO has the highest quality. Results of olive oil grading are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Acidity index, peroxide value, and UV absorption characteristics were under the limit established by the EU legislation; thus, it could be concluded that all oils evaluated in this study met the criteria to be categorized as EVOOs.
