<p class="p">Volatile profile and composition of oils under study are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02148-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Alcohols were the main chemical family found in all oils, and an increase of concentration was found in all stressed olive trees as compared to the control one. Confederation SDI (T3) was the oil with the highest alcohol content mainly due to the high contents of several compounds, including ethanol (149 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> olive oil), 3-methylbutan-1-ol (15.7 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), 2-methylbutan-1-ol (31.1 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), pentan-1-ol (12.0 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), (Z)-pent-2-en-1-ol (22.7 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol (303 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and (E)-hex-2-en-1-ol (727 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> olive oil). Optimal RDI (T1) and Confederation RDI (T2) oils also showed an increase in the content of several alcohols (3-methylbutan-1-ol, 2-methylbutan-1-ol, pentan-1-ol, (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol and (E)-hex-2-en-1-ol) as compared to the control treatment. Regarding aldehydes, the smallest concentration was found in T1 due to a decrease of pentanal, hexanal, (E)-hex-2-enal, and nonanal (0.01, 38.3, 161, and 5.86 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively). Similarly, 2-methylbutanal and heptanal experienced a decrease in treatment T3. In general, the ketones content decreased in T1 mainly due to a reduction in the content of pentan-2-one; however, its content increased in oils T2 and T3, while pentan-3-one increased in all stressed olive trees. An intensification of the esters contents was found in T1 and T2 oils, mainly as a result of the increased contents of (Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate and hexyl acetate. Finally, a decrease in hydrocarbons was found in T1 and T3 oils, always as compared to the control, due to significant decreases in the contents of 4,8-dimethylnona-1,7-diene and (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene in the T1 oils and of (E)-β-ocimene in the T3 ones. To summarize, the highest total volatile compound contents were those of the Confederation SDI (T3) and Confederation RDI (T2) oil. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">hydroSOStainable</italic> olive oils had higher contents of volatile compounds than oil from fully irrigated trees.
