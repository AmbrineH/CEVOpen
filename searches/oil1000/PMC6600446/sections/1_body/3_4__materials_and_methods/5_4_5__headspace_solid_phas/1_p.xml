<p class="p">For HS-SPME extraction, 5 mL of olive oil was added into a 15 mL glass vial with the addition of 2 µL of carvacrol (325.6 mg carvacrol in 1 L of olive oil) as an internal standard. One gram of NaCl salt was added, and the vial was hermetically sealed with polytetrafluorethilenesilicone septa and maintained in a water bath at 40 °C during equilibration (15 min) and extraction (40 min) and was partially submerged such that the liquid phase of the oils was below the water level. All the experiments were performed under constant stirring (500 rpm) with a magnetic stirrer. After sampling, the SPME fiber was inserted into the injector (250 °C) of the GC-MS for 7 min, where the extracted volatiles were thermally desorbed directly into the GC column. Polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (65 µm PDMS/DVB) fiber, obtained from Supelco Company (Bellefonte, PA, USA), was used previously conditioned according to the manufacturer instructions [
