<p class="p">One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple range test were performed to compare experimental data and determine significant differences among irrigation treatments (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The standard deviation (SD) of the mean is used to perform Tukey´s test; therefore, the SD values were not included in Tables to avoid repetition of the data and to make Tables easier to understand. A three-way ANOVA was used (factor 1: irrigation treatment; factor 2: session; factor 3: panelist) to study the effect of these three factors on the composition, quality, and functionality of the olive oils under study and to check panel consistency. Pearson correlation was also done to correlate all data with water stress integral. XLSTAT (Version 2016.02.27444, Addinsoft, Paris, France) was used to perform all statistical analysis.
