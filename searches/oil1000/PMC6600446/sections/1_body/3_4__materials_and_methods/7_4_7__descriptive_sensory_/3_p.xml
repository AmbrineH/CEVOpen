<p class="p">The panelists did three orientation days in order to determine the scales of each attribute and the reference product. A previous lexicon developed by this panel was used [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] following International Olive Council (IOC) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The scale ranged from 0 to 10, and the reference products were adapted to the Spanish market.
