<p class="p">Experiments were performed in 11-year-old “Arbequina” olive trees located at Carmona (37.49° N, −5.67° W, Seville, Spain). The orchard has a super-high density (4.0 m × 1.5 m), is 360 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and has 60 trees organized in 3 lines (30 m). The design was done with randomized blocks with 4 repetitions per treatment. Harvesting was done with a mechanical harvester, like at super-intensive farming. The trees from the inside row (20) of each orchard were harvested for olive oil production. Harvest was carried out when olives had 1.9 maturity index [
