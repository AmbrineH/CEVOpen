<p class="p">Following the pressure chamber technique and the threshold values of midday stem water potential before and after the pit hardening period, 4 irrigation treatments were carried out: 
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Control (T0): trees were watered to supply the 100% crop evapotranspiration (ETc).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Optimal RDI (T1): trees were under non-limited water conditions during stage I and III while regulated deficit irrigation was applied during stage II (58% of reduction of total water irrigation amount).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Confederation RDI (T2): the same way was followed as in T1 but with the limitation of water dotation of Guadalquivir hydrographic confederation (66% of reduction of total water irrigation amount).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Confederation SDI (T3): sustained deficit irrigation with the water amount allowed by the Guadalquivir hydrographic confederation (66% of reduction of total water irrigation amount).</p>
