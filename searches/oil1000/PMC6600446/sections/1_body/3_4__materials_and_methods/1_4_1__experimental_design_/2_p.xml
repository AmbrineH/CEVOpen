<p class="p">Stem water potential at midday (ψ) was determined using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA) in 4 trees per irrigation treatment, weekly during the experiment (March 24 to October 20, 2017). Water stress integral (SI) was calculated (Equation (1)) [

 </disp-formula> where SI is the stress integral, ψ is the average midday stem water potential for any interval, n is the number of the days in the interval.
