 <sup class="sup">·</sup> radical (2,2-diphenyl-1-pirylhydrazyl) and ABTS
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> (azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity (AA) of the olive oils. The DPPH

 <sup class="sup">+</sup> as described by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Helios Gamma model, UVG 1002E; Helios, Cambridge, UK). Calibration curves (3.5–5.0 mmol Trolox L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) with good linearity (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ≥ 0.999) were used for the quantification of the AA by both methods. Analyses were run in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mmol Trolox L
