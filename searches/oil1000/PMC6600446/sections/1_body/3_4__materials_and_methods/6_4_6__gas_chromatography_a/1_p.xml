<p class="p">An Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7890A equipped with the mass selective detector, model 5977E, and capillary column HP-5MS (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane (Agilent J &amp; W; Santa Clara, CA, USA) GC column, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm was used. The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.5 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The injector was operated in split mode (2:1 split ratio) at 260 °C. The column was maintained at 40 °C for 3 min, heated to 100 °C at a rate of 5 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, heated to 260 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and held to 260 °C for 3 min. MS conditions were as follows: source temperature 230 °C; quadrupole temperature 150 °C; transfer line temperature 270 °C; acquisition mode electron impact (EI 70 eV) by 3 scans s−1, and mass range
