<p class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared following ISO-12966-2 [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The internal standard was added (C13:0; 0.04 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) to calculate the fatty acids concentration. Gas chromatography (C-17A; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to inject oils after transmethylation following ISO-12966-4 [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] with some modifications. The capillary column used was CPSil-88 (100 m × 0.25 mm ID. 0.2 µm film thickness; J&amp;W 112-88A7; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which is appropriate for olive oil fatty acids separation. Detector temperature was 260 °C, and oils were injected with a 1:20 split ratio. The oven temperature was 175 °C for 10 min, then raised to 220 °C (3 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and kept at 220 °C for 5 min. The carrier gas was helium, and detector gases were hydrogen (30 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and air (350 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and helium (30 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was used as a make-up gas. Standard solutions (FAME 37 MIX, Supelco; Bellefonte, PA, USA), were injected under the same conditions as oils for the identification of compounds.
