With respect to nutritional and functional quality, it is well known that the lipid profile is one of the main contributors due to the high proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) of this specific oil. Also, polyphenols have an important role, and, in fact, olive oil is the only food that has an authorized health claim [

 <italic class="italic">Olive oil polyphenols contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative stress</italic>.” Volatile compounds are essential to olive oil quality, with both main and minor compounds having important roles on flavor. The odor-active compounds are responsible for the oil aroma, while the minor ones, even when they are below the olfactory threshold, can be used as quality markers as they can be essential to understand degradation or formation reactions dealing with odor-active substances [
