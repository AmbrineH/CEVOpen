<p class="p">There is contradictory information on the effect of deficit irrigation treatments on the fatty acid profile of olive oil. When stress was applied before the pit hardening stage and at the beginning of the rehydration stage, no clear effect was found neither in the study by Gucci et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] nor in that of Caruso et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], both with the “Frantoio” trees; these latter authors did not find a response to stress of fatty acids with a 46–48% deficit irrigation and 2–6% complementary irrigation. On the other hand, Dag et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and García et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found when studying “Koroneiki” and “Arbequina” cultivars, respectively, an increase of linoleic acid and a decrease of oleic acid, as the water stress increased during all the season. Results found by García et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] (30% RDI and 60% RDI treatments before pit hardening stage) and García et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] (SDI treatment with 2–3 irrigation events per week and ca. 35% of water savings and low-frequency irrigation with recovery irrigation every 3–5 weeks and ca. 35% water savings) on “Arbequina” orchard showed similar fatty acid concentrations to those of the current work; although the water stress behaved in a different way, which could be due, apart from agronomic practices, soil characteristics, climate conditions, etc., because deficit irrigation treatments were performed in a different way. Garcia et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found an increase of linolenic acid and MUFAs and a decrease of oleic acid and PUFAs in 30% RDI oils, and intermediate values for 60% RDI, while García et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] found an increase of oleic acid, a decrease of linoleic acid, and MUFAs and SFAs were not affected. Therefore, it is difficult to reach a clear conclusion, considering that from the beginning of pit hardening to the end of fruit maturation, many types of enzymes contribute to synthesis of fatty acids in the olives. Irrigation has a high impact on fruit physiology, as well as the timing and the stress level [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]; therefore, it could be said that changes in fatty acid profiles of the studied oils in the current work could be due to the stress, but also due to the time when the stress was applied.
