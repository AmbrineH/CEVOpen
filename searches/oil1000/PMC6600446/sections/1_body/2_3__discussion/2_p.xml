 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] on different cultivars and also in “Arbequina” by Gomez Del Campo et al. [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], among others. In the study by Gomez Del Campo et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], highest values of TPC were found when “Arbequina” olive trees were irrigated with 30% of control during the pit hardening stage, and the other irrigation treatments, even being more intense, did not show higher values. These results could be considered similar to those found in the current research, where a nonlinear relationship was found between phenolic compounds and the intensity of the water deficit. There is a previous hypothesis proposed by Horner et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]: water stress in the tree can produce an increase in free phenylalanine (phenolic compounds precursor) and, therefore, phenols synthesis could be more sensitive when moderate water stress is applied.
