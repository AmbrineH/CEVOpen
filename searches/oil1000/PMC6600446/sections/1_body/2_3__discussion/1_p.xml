 <sub class="sub">stem</sub> was affected for variability within treatments and defined timely water stress, but presented a good agreement with some oil features. Although this measurement was not the most accurate for described irrigation treatments, it could be useful in order to describe oil features because of the reported extreme conditions. On the contrary, SI, though was also limited in comparison to irrigation treatments, it presented clear trends but did not influence the oil features. In the literature on irrigation, both indicators presented a good agreement with some yield components, such as fruit drop [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. From our knowledge, there are very few works with the presented relationship between these water status parameter and oil features, probably because of these problems of variability.
