<p class="p">The chemical analysis of the essential oil by GC–MS (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) showed the presence of twenty-three (23) components. Four major classes of compounds were displayed in the chemical profile of the oil which are monoterpenes (24.6%), monoterpenoids (10.9%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (58.7%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (4.8%). The chemical composition of our rhizome oil seems unique when compared to those in literature 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>. Our results showed marked differences in composition of rhizomes collected from North Central Nigeria in which β-bisabolene (13.9%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-ocimene (9.8%) and myrcene (7.6%) were identified as the major constituents 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, the rhizome oil showed a close similarity with an earlier study conducted on a Southwest, Nigerian grown 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> spp. leaf and rhizome essential oils. However, the lower monoterpenes α-pinene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and the monoterpene alcohol 1,8-cineol present in our oil were not detected in the previous report
