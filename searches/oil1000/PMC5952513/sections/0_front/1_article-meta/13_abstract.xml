   <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum acanthopodium</italic> has insecticidal effect in Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, the essential oil from the dried 
   <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> plant was used as a larvicidal compound against the malaria mosquitoes, 
   <italic class="italic">Anopheles anthropophagus</italic> and

  <p id="Par2" class="p">Compounds in the 
   <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum</italic> essential oil were investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). The larvicidal bioassays of the whole oil, as well as the main compounds in the oil (estragole and eucalyptol) were performed using WHO method.

  <p id="Par3" class="p">In total, 63 main compounds (99.32%) were found in the oils, including estragole (15.46%), eucalyptol (10.94%), β-caryophyllene (5.52%), 
   <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-linalool oxide (3.76%), 
   <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-limonene oxide (3.06%). A dose-dependent effect on mortality was recorded with increasing concentrations of essential oil and compounds increasing mortality of the larvae. Larvicidal bioassays revealed that 24 h LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the whole essential oil was 36.00 mg/L and LC
   <sub class="sub">90</sub> was 101.49 mg/L against 
   <italic class="italic">An. anthropophagus</italic>, while LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 49.02 mg/L and LC
   <sub class="sub">90</sub> was 125.18 mg/L against 
   <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic>. Additionally, 24 h LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> of estragole were 38.56 and 41.67 mg/L against 
   <italic class="italic">An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic>, respectively, while the related LC
   <sub class="sub">90</sub> were 95.90 and 107.89 mg/L. LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> of eucalyptol were 42.41 and 45.49 mg/L against 
   <italic class="italic">An. anthropophagus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">An. sinensis</italic>, while the related LC
   <sub class="sub">90</sub> were 114.45 and 124.95 mg/L.
