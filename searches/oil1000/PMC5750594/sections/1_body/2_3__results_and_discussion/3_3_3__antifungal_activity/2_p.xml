<p class="p">The antifungal mechanisms of activity of monoterpenoids are poorly understood. It has been suggested that these hydrophobic compounds disrupt the cytoplasmic membranes or membrane proteins of fungal cells, leading to cytoplasmic leakage, cell lysis, and death [
 <xref rid="B51-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Chirality of monoterpenoids, therefore, may not play a critical role in antimicrobial activity. Nevertheless, Kusumoto and co-workers have shown that (+)-α-pinene showed significantly better antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Heterobasidion parviporum</italic> than (−)-α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B52-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Likewise, Filipowicz et al. showed (−)-β-pinene to be slightly more active than (+)-β-pinene against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], and Omran and co-workers found that (−)-limonene had better antifungal activity than (+)-limonene [
 <xref rid="B54-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. (+)-δ-3-Carene has shown antifungal activity against several fungal strains [
 <xref rid="B47-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], but there are apparently no reports on antifungal activity of (−)-δ-3-carene, which is not commercially available. Overall, these findings indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">P. amazonicum</italic> resin oil has promising potential for further antifungal consideration, in particular against 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> and potentially other yeast-like fungi.
