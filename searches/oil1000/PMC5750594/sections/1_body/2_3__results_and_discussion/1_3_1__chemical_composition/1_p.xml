<p class="p">The clear pale yellow oleoresin essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. amazonicum</italic> was obtained in 0.3% yield and analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. From a total of 56 peaks, 99.6% of the compounds were identified in the oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The major components of the resin oil were identified as δ-3-carene (47.9%), α-pinene (4.0%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (4.1%), limonene (5.1%), α-terpineol (5.5%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymen-8-ol (4.8%) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-04-00070-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). δ-3-Carene has been reported as a major component in several 
 <italic class="italic">Protium</italic> spp. oleoresin essential oils, including 
 <italic class="italic">P. decandrum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]; however, in most oleoresin essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Protium</italic>, δ-3-carene is a minor component or unobserved (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Protium</italic> oleoresin oils show wide variation in chemical composition, depending on species as well as age and color of the resin (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00070-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The age of an oleoresin has a distinct effect on the chemical composition. Some monoterpenes have been found to undergo oxidation upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen [
 <xref rid="B33-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], including oleoresin monoterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B20-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, fresh oleoresin from the same species shows wide variation in chemical composition. Thus, for example, the essential oil from fresh oleoresin of 
 <italic class="italic">P. heptaphyllum</italic> collected from the Restinga of Carapebus, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, had myrcene (35.0%) and α-pinene (27.0%) as the major components [
 <xref rid="B10-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]; the fresh resin oil from Reserva da Campina, Amazonas, Brazil, was rich in 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (36.0%), α-terpinene (18.0%), and γ-terpinene (12.0%) [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]; and the fresh resin oil from Crato, Ceara, Brazil was dominated by terpinolene (28.5%), α-phellandrene (16.7%), and limonene (16.9%) [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The oleoresin in this present work is a relatively fresh resin, reflected in the high concentration of δ-3-carene.
