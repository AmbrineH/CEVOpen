 <p class="p">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a recurring global problem, which constantly demands new antimicrobial compounds to challenge the resistance. It is well known that essential oils (EOs) have been known for biological activities including antimicrobial properties. In this study, EOs from seven aromatic plants of Asir region of southwestern Saudi Arabia were tested for their antimicrobial efficacy against four drug resistant pathogenic bacterial isolates (
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, </italic>and
  <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus typhimurium) </italic>and one fungal isolate (
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans)</italic>. Chemical compositions of EOs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results revealed that EOs from
  <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare </italic>proved most active against all isolates with inhibitory zone range between 17 and 45â€‰mm. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.025mg/ml was observed for
  <italic class="italic"> Staph. aureus</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> with EO of
  <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic>. All the three EOs showed significant anticandida activity. The results related to EOs from
  <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare </italic>demonstrated significant antimicrobial efficacy against drug resistant microorganisms.
