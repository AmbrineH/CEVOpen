<p class="p">In medicine, EOs have been researched for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, anticancer, and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Particularly, the EOs that possess antimicrobial activities have been the subject of many scientific reports resulting in the screening of a wide variety of plant species [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The main advantage of these natural products is that they do not increase antibiotic resistance with the long-term medicinal usage. They tend to have low mammalian toxicity, less environmental effects, and wide public acceptance [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the chemical composition of the EOs that contribute to their medicinal value which is responsible for the antibacterial properties highly depends on various factors like the climatic and geographical conditions, as well as harvesting, isolation techniques, and storage [
