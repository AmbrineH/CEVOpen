<p class="p">Drug resistance is a recurring phenomenon that demands utmost medical attention worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The use of antibiotics is a major strategy for the eradication of pathogen bacteria and antimicrobial agents are commonly used therapeutically and prophylactically in human medicine therapy [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, increased resistance to these drugs is an inevitable side effect. Thus, the unsuitable use and overprescription of antibiotics in human medicine therapy are considered to be the main sources for the expansion and spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics; even very low concentrations of antibiotics released into the environment can enrich the population of resistant strains [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Otherwise, the wide use of antibiotics increases the probability of unfavorable infection outcome in the last years with the intensification in the prevalence of infections caused by drug resistant strains [
