<p class="p">Data of GC and GC-MS analyses for
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare </italic>EO are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. It is obvious from the data that thirty-six compounds accounting for 99.99% of the extracted EO were identified. 1-Terpineol (19.68%), Sabinene (17.17%), Gamma-Terpinene (12.99%), Alpha-Humulene (CAS) (10.57%), Alpha-Phellandrene (9.18%), Cis-trans Sabinene hydrate (6.13%), Cis-sabinene hydrate acetate (6.13%), and 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol,4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-(CAS) (5.64%) are the predominant components of the EOs. While Alpha-Myrcene, cis-Ocimene, Alpha-Terpinolene, and p-Cymene resulted in a relatively low ratio with respective percentages of 3.44, 2.74, 2.31, and 1.35%, respectively, the other components were detected in trace ratios.
