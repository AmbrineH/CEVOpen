<p class="p">In the present study, the
 <italic class="italic"> in vitro</italic> antimicrobial activity of different EOs against the studied microorganisms (
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Escherichia coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic>) and their activity potentials was quantitatively assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition zones using the agar disc-diffusion method. These data were compared to standard antibiotics and antifungals with recommended doses used as positive controls as mentioned above and in the presence of negative control. The results showed great variations in the potency of the antimicrobial activity of selected species.
