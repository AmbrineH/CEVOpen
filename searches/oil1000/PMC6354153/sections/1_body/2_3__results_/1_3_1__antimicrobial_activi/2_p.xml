<p class="p">In fact, it can be noted from Tables 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>(a) and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>(b) that the EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic> were found to have highest activities against all the tested microorganisms studied, and the size of their inhibition zones varied between 19 and 45 mm. The strong antibacterial activity of these EOs may be attributed to the presence of bioactive metabolites of various chemical types, such as Pulegone (58.54%), L-Linalool (60.97%), and 1-Terpineol (19.68%) of
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic>, respectively. However, essential oil (EO) of
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha pulegium L</italic> revealed a moderate activity against all tested strains (from 13 to 45 mm). Further, our results showed that EO of
 <italic class="italic"> Salvia officinalis</italic> was not active against any tested strains except a small inhibition against
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and against
 <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus aureus</italic> with inhibition zones of 10 and 13 mm, respectively. Also EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> Ruta graveolens</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Scirpoides holoschoenus</italic> showed total lack of antimicrobial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> Escherichia coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic> with a moderate activity against remaining strains. Interestingly, all antibiotics showed low inhibition zone (from 0 to 13 mm) with recommended doses which confirms the efficacy of these EOs over standard antibiotics.
