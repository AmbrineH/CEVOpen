<p class="p">In
 <italic class="italic"> Staphylococcus pyogenes</italic>, the best effect was also related to
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic> EO with MIC and MBC of 0.025 and 0.05mg/ml, respectively. Results from MIC and MBC of the EOs on
 <italic class="italic"> Escherichia coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic> revealed that the highest inhibitions were again from
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic>. Best active EO against
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic> was from
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic> which had MIC and MFC of 0.4mg/ml and 0.8mg/ml, respectively. However, it was observed that the antibacterial activity of these EOs depends on its concentration and the tested bacteria strain. Interestingly, the three selected EOs exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (0.025mg/ml–1.6 mg/ml) than Gram negative (0.2–12.5 mg/ml) bacteria. Th
 <italic class="italic">e Candida albicans</italic> was identified as the most resistant strain with MIC and MBC equal to 0.4 and 25 mg/ml, respectively.
