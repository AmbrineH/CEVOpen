<p class="p">The research of alternative and effective drugs from medicinal plants against drug resistant antibiotics has become a priority concern all over the world. The overuse of antibiotics is considered a main cause for antibiotic resistance [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. All EOs displayed highly varying MIC and MBC values against resistant microorganisms tested but the highest values belong to
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic>. Our results are in concordance with previous studies revealing the potential of EOs to exhibit strong activity against drug resistant bacteria [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This resistance is due to intrinsic factors and can be transferred to susceptible strains during horizontal genetic transfer, particularly in hospital environment. Our promising findings provide evidence that EO from medicinal plants of Asir region of Saudi Arabia exhibits efficacy against drug resistant pathogenic microorganisms and they will be clinically valuable.
