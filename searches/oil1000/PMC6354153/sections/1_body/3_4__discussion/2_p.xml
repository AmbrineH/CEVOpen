<p class="p">To our knowledge, there are no data in the literature to evaluate antimicrobial activities of EOs extracted from medicinal plants distributed in Asir district of Saudi Arabia against drug resistant pathogenic microorganisms. All EOs revealed antibacterial properties, but the degree of bacterial growth inhibition induced by plant materials was shown to be related to bacterial strain and herbal source [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Observations from disc-diffusion method inferred that herbal EOs had variable inhibition zones both on Gram-positive (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> S. pyogenes</italic>) and on Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> S. typhimurium</italic>). Interestingly, the most active EOs belong to the
 <italic class="italic"> Lamiaceae</italic> family. EOs of
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha cervina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ocimum basilicum,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic> exposed almost identical antimicrobial potentials. These results are in accordance with the earlier findings [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] that EOs extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> Lamiaceae</italic> family showed the highest antimicrobial activity.
