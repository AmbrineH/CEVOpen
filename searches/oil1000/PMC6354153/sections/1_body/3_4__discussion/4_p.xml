<p class="p">The results of MIC and MBC obtained in this study confirmed our earlier observations of Gram-positive bacteria being more susceptible to growth inhibition by plant EOs than Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These differences could be attributed in part to the great complexity of the double membrane-containing cell envelope in Gram-negative bacteria compared to the single membrane structure of the positive ones [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. These differences may also be attributed to the presence of the lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria, which provides a hydrophilic surface and functions as a permeability barrier for many plant extracts, antibiotics, detergents, and lipophilic compounds [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, the ability of EOs to disrupt the permeability barrier of cell membrane structures and the accompanying loss of chemiosmotic control is the most likely reason for its lethal action [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. It is believed that the EOs can coagulate the cytoplasm and damage lipids and proteins [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>].
