 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) or on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco, Sparks, MD, USA) for 48 h at 35°C. A standardized inoculum isolate of Candida was propagated in SDB at 35°C for 24 h with 200 rpm agitation. One ml of 24 h old culture in SDB was centrifuged (3900 rpm at 4°C for 1 min), and the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of physiological saline. Sterile physiological saline was added to give a McFarland turbidity of 0.5 at 530 nm, corresponding to 5 × 10
