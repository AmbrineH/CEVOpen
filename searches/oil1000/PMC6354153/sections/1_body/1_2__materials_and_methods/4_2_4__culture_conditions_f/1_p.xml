<p class="p">The bacteria and fungi were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from Asir hospital through proper channel for research. These isolated organisms were confirmed for antibiotic resistance by antibiotic sensitivity pattern and were determined by Kirby-Bauer method [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The EOs were individually tested against a panel of microorganisms. Two Gram-positive bacteria,
 <italic class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and two Gram-negative bacteria,
 <italic class="italic"> Escherichia coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic> were chosen for the study. The bacterial strains were cultivated in Luria-Bertani Medium (LB) (Oxoid Ltd, UK) at 37°C. Working cultures were prepared by inoculating a loopful of each test bacteria in 3 ml of Muller–Hinton broth (MH) (Oxoid Ltd, UK) and were incubated at 37°C for 12 h. For the test, final inoculum concentrations of 10
