<p class="p">Microdilution method was used for determination of MIC of the EOs. All tests were performed in LB or SDB, complemented with DMSO (highest final concentration 0.1%). Microbial strains were cultured at 37°C overnight in LB or SDB. Test strains were suspended in LB or SDB to provide a final density of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/ml and these were confirmed by viable counts. Regular dilutions ranging from 0.0125 mg/ml to 200 mg/ml of the essential oil were prepared in 96-well microtiter plate (Iwaki brand, Asahi Techno Glass, Japan), including one growth control (LB+DMSO) and one sterility control (tested oil+ LB+DMSO). Plates were incubated under normal atmospheric conditions at 37°C for 24 h under vigorous agitation for bacteria and 48 h at 35°C for

The wells were then examined for indication of growth and MIC values were determined as the lowest EO concentration that inhibited visible growth of the tested microorganism which was indicated by the presence of a white “pellet” on the well bottom. The negative controls were set up with DMSO in amounts corresponding to the highest quantity present in the test solution (0.1%). The tests were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. These data were compared to antibiotics with recommended doses used as positive controls tested and in the presence of negative control.
