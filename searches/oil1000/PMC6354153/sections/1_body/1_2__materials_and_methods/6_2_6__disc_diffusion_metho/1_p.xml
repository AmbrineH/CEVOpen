 <sup class="sup">7</sup>–10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells per ml) was spread on the solid media plates. Paper discs (9 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 12

 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic>. The diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in millimeters. All the tests were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. These data were compared to antibiotics and antifungals with recommended doses used as positive controls tested and in the presence of negative control.
