<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of EOs was carried out on a Thermo Scientific TRACE 1310 Gas Chromatograph attached with ISQ LT single quadruple Mass Spectrometer, equipped with DB-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm, i, d., 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness, J&amp;W Scientific). The ionization mode is EI with electron ionization energy of 70 eV. The temperature of the column was programmed from 40°C to 275°C at 5°C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were the same at 300°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The identification of the chemical compounds was based on mass spectra (Wiley 275.L, 8th edition mass spectral library), or with standards when available, and confirmed by comparison of their GC retention indices either with those of standards or with data published in the literature as described by Adams (2007) [
