<p class="p">For separating volatile biologically active substances (essential oil), the most well-known classical processes are used, i.e., distillation, rectification, pressing, extraction with various solvents, maceration, and extraction with liquid gases in the supercritical state [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Currently, research is being conducted on the application of physical factors, e.g., ultrasounds or microwaves, for the purpose of augmentation of the classic methods used so far in production processes [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Condurso et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] show that Sicilian red garlic dried by the microwave drying technique was richer in the volatile fraction compared to that dried with the use of the traditional technique. Moreover, this innovative product was preferred by the consumers. The economic aspect of such modifications is also important because it determines whether their applications will be financially viable. Literature data indicate that the technique of distillation, augmented with ultrasounds, is characterised by a higher efficiency factor compared to the classic distillation technique [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], sonication of caraway seeds (
 <italic class="italic">Carum carvi</italic>) prior to distillation improved the efficiency in terms of the amount of essential oil acquired which allowed to shorten the distillation stage. Shortening the process of extracting essential oils from orange peel by applying an ultrasonic horn did not result in any significant loss in their quality when compared to the conventional method in situ [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Moreover, in earlier studies, it was found that the composition of essential oil distilled using the method of ultrasonic augmentation differed from the composition of essential oil distilled with the classic method. The authors of those studies attribute the changes in oil efficiency as well as the qualitative changes to the fact of higher effectiveness of sonication in the extraction process of those substances from the secretory structures of plants. They suppose that certain unstable chemical compounds may undergo, e.g., isomerisation under the effect of ultrasounds [
