<p class="p">Today, essential oils are becoming more and more popular as alternative substances used for improving the quality of food products, i.e., stability or sensory parameters (taste and smell). These ingredients can be directly added during the process of food production either as pure mixtures or in the form of stabilized lipophilic or hydrophilic solutions. In technological applications, methods allowing to obtain the highest quality product are used. The applied technological factors, such as physical parameters of the process, can have a negative effect on the molecular structure of chemical components in food, as they may accelerate their degradation or initiate unfavourable chemical changes. They can also affect the releasing of volatile compounds from the food matrix, which can take place, e.g., in the case of essential oils. One of the known physical factors used in food processing is ultrasound, which is applied mainly in order to intensify the secretion of active ingredients (extraction and support of the distillation process) but can also facilitate the mixing of ingredients (emulsification and dissolution) or influence the product structure [
