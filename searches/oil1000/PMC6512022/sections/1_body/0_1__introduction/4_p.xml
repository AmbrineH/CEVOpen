<p class="p">In the case of extracting an essential oil on an industrial scale, the distillation method is now the principal method. Of course, classical methods are not free from factors that may result in adverse changes to the composition of the obtained essential oil. In addition, the introduction of new physical factors, i.e., ultrasounds, may provoke a number of further significant and undesirable changes in the composition of the essential oils, such as isomerisation, oxidation, and polymerisation. Moreover, it is interesting whether the use of ultrasound in technological processes can interact at the molecular level with the structures of volatile compounds present in various systems, i.e., solvent–essential oil systems or food matrix–essential oil systems.</p>
