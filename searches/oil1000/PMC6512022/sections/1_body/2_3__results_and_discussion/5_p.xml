<p class="p">In methanol and hexane solutions of hyssop oil, the presence of 31 main volatile components was noted (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The dominant component in the analysed solutions was pinocamphone &lt;
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-&gt; with content varying from 27.17 mg/ml (hyssop oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power) to 29.38 mg/ml (methanol solution of hyssop oil subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power). The second main component of hyssop oil solutions was pinene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (up to 13.96 mg/ml). Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant effect of sonication parameters applied in the experiment on changes in the concentration of the main components of hyssop oil. The total content of the main identified components fell within the range from 85.20 mg/ml to 86.48 mg/ml. According to Džamić et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], the main components of hyssop oil are 1,8-cineole (36.43%), pinene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (19.55%), and pinocamphone &lt;
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-&gt; (15.32%). Essential oil from plants cultivated in Italy contains mainly pinocamphone &lt;
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-&gt; with a content of 43.3% and limonene with a content of 12.2% [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], whereas, in hyssop oil from Bulgaria, the main components were pinocamphone &lt;
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-&gt; (48.98%) and pinene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (13.54%) [
