<p class="p">In general, the time of extraction was shortened by three times (mean average) when ultrasound was used for pretreatment of the samples. Nevertheless, the increase of the rate of bioactive compounds and normally present some changes in the chemical composition provide greater features to apply these extracts as natural antioxidants. The increased quality of the essential oils can be attributed to the low level of degradation of thermal compounds [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The minimal degradation of the chemical compounds refers mainly to the low submission time of the plant material to heating. Moreover, essential oils are released faster because ultrasound action breaks the cell membranes of the glands. This phenomenon enables an effective extraction in a considerable shorter time with a better quality in comparison to conventional methods [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The results obtained in this study are promising, but it should be considered that this technique is not always appropriate, as indicated in the work cited by Da Porto and Decorti [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], among others. The changes and differences observed may be caused by a competition between oxidations or other reactions promoted by heating and water acid medium in distillation, and those caused by sonication, acting by different physicochemical mechanisms.
