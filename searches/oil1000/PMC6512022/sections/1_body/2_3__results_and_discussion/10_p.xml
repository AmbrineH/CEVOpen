 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] reported that the application of ultrasounds in ethanol-water extraction (70%) of mint had a significant effect on the content of individual oil compounds distilled from that extract, compared to the composition of oil obtained with the method of classic direct distillation. The above authors concluded that oil acquired with the pharmacopeial method was poorer quantitatively in oxidised monoterpenes (ca. 4097

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/g of the fresh plant matter). Probably, one of the causes of the above quantitative changes was sonication that may accelerate the processes of oxidation, catalysing the formation of reactive forms of oxygen and that may initiate the processes of oxidation. In the results of the presented study being the object of discussion it was not observed that ultrasounds had an effect causing a significant increase in the content of oxygen-derived oil substances.
