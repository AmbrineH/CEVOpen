<p class="p">GC analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of marjoram oil revealed the presence of 28 main compounds (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The highest concentration in solutions of marjoram oil was the characteristic of terpinene-4-ol: from 14.50 mg/ml (oil in methanol subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power) to 15.31 mg/ml (oil in methanol not subjected to sonication). Other dominant components in the analysed solutions of marjoram oil included terpinene &lt;gamma-&gt; (up to 10.62 mg/ml) and sabinene hydrate &lt;
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-&gt; (up to 9.62 mg/ml). Statistical analysis of the results obtained showed that the sonication applied in the experimental systems did not have any significant effect on the levels of the main components identified. The oil composition of marjoram grooving in India showed terpinen-4-ol (31.15%), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate (15.76%), sabinene (6.91%), cymene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">para</italic>-&gt; (6.83%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate (3.86%), and terpineol &lt;
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (3.71%) as the main constituents [
