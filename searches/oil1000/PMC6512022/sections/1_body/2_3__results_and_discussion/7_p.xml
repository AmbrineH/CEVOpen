<p class="p">Chromatographic analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of rosemary oil revealed the presence of 19 main components (
 <xref rid="tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). Dominant concentration in the analysed solutions was that of cineole &lt;1,8-&gt; with levels from 19.06 mg/ml (hexane solution subjected to sonication for 10 minutes at 50% power) to 20.75 mg/ml (methanol solution subjected to sonication for 10 minutes at 50% power), with camphor being the second dominant component in terms of quantity, its concentration varying from 12.70 mg/ml (rosemary oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power) to 13.93 mg/ml (hexane solution of rosemary oil subjected to sonication for 10 minutes at 80% power). Statistical analysis of the quantitative results did not reveal any significant changes in the composition of volatile compounds for solutions subjected to sonication. In general, the total content of the particular identified components varied from 87.30 mg/ml to 89.94 mg/ml. Zaouali et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported that the main components of rosemary oil were 1,8-cineole (35.80%), camphor (14.50%), pinene &lt;
