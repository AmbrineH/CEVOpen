<p class="p">There are few research reports that address the problem of using the ultrasound technique for the extraction of aromatic substances from the plant raw material. Experiments conducted so far demonstrated that ultrasounds can effectively cause an increase in the efficiency of the process of distillation of essential oils [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The cited authors explain that ultrasounds enhance the extraction of aromatic substances from secretory structures of plants, which also takes place in the case of the process of extraction with the use of various solvents [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In addition, Kowalski and Wawrzykowski [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and Da Porto and Decorti [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] demonstrated that composition of oils distilled from the plant material treated with ultrasounds differed from oils obtained with the classical methods. The differences in the quantitative composition of oils obtained with methods augmented with ultrasounds may result from the fact of more effective liberation of certain chemical components from the secretory cells [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], as well as from structural transformations of unstable chemical compounds in the secretory cells (decomposition of dimers and polymers, oxidation, and isomerisation) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The results of the study presented here provide evidence that the sonication applied in the experiment did not have any significant effect on quantitative changes among the main volatile components, which justifies the conclusion that any quantitative changes in oil distilled with sonication are related rather with increased efficiency of extraction of the components from hard-accessible anatomical structures.
