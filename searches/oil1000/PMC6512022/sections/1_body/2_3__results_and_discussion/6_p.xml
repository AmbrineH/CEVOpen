<p class="p">GC analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of lemon balm oil confirmed the presence of 22 main compounds (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). The highest concentration in the analysed solutions of lemon balm oil was the characteristic of citronellal, with levels from 16.38 mg/ml (methanol solution of lemon balm oil not subjected to sonication—control) to 17.44 mg/ml (lemon balm oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 10 minutes at 50% power). Other dominant components of the oil included the following volatile compounds: nerol (up to 11.92 mg/ml), caryophyllene &lt;E-&gt; (up to 9.07 mg/ml), limonene (up tp 7.60 mg/ml), and neral (up to 8.16 mg/ml). Statistical analysis of the quantitative results obtained revealed that the sonication applied had no effect on the content of the identified main components. Generally, the total concentration of the main components in methanol and hexane solutions of lemon balm oil varied from 80.56 mg/ml to 82.87 mg/ml. According to Góra and Lis [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], the qualitative composition of lemon balm oil is subjected to notable variation. Large differences were observed in the levels of the main components, which is supported by the results of this study. The authors cited state that the dominant components of lemon balm oil are geranial (33.6%), neral (22.18%), and citronellal (11.31%). In lemon balm oils obtained from plants grown in Poland, the following main components were assayed: geranial (up to 32.92%), caryophyllene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (up to 31.73%), neral (up to 17.37%), citronellal (up to 15.18%), and caryophyllene oxide &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (up to 12.2%) [

In essential oils isolated from lemon balm grown in Morocco, 33 components were identified, the dominant ones being citronellal (14.40%), caryophyllene oxide (11.00%), geraniol acetate (10.20%), E-caryophyllene (8.10%), isogeraniol (6.40%), and nerol acetate (5.10%) [
