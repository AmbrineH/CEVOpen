<p class="p">The phenomenon of formation, expansion, and disappearance of bubbles or other small enclosed spaces in a solution, containing vapour, gas, or a vapour-gas mixture, taking place under suitable temperature-pressure conditions under the effect of ultrasounds (cavitation) is well known. In a water environment, with the participation of ultrasounds, one can observe the formation of reactive forms of H˙, OH˙, and H

Especially susceptible to such effects are organic volatile compounds that may undergo various reactions in a cavitation “bubble.” The experiment conducted in the study presented here did not demonstrate any significant quantitative changes taking place in methanol or hexane solutions of standards of oil compounds (
 <xref rid="tab9" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>). Chromatographic analysis of the standard solutions did not prove any effect of ultrasounds on transformation or decomposition of the selected substances—in the systems subjected to sonication, no presence was found of other substances that would be registered as chromatographic peaks at the attenuation used, in comparison to the control systems. This allows the conclusion that the application of sonication with technical parameters corresponding to those applied in the experiment does not cause unfavourable quantitative changes in methanol and hexane solutions in relation to the individual components of the volatile fraction.
