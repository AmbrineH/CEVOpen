<p class="p">Chromatographic analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of chamomile oil revealed the presence of 25 main compounds (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Dominant concentration in the analysed solution was the characteristic of bisabolol oxide A &lt;

The main components of solutions of chamomile oil included also farnesene &lt;(E)-

 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (up to 11.28 mg/ml). Statistical analysis of the quantitative results did not reveal any significant differences in the concentration of the main components of chamomile oil for the analysed experimental systems with the use of sonication. According to the literature, the dominant components of chamomile oils are bisabolol oxide A &lt;
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (2%–60%), bisabolol &lt;
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (1–60%), bisabolol oxide B &lt;
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (3–50%), E-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-farnesene (5–40%), chamazulene (2–25%), and bisabolol oxide A &lt;
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-&gt; (0.4–12%), which finds support in the results of the study presented here [
