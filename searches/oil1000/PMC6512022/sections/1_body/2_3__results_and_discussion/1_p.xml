<p class="p">Chromatographic analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of basil oil revealed the presence of 13 main compounds (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The highest content in the solution of the analysed oil was that of methyl chavicol (from 62.18 mg/ml (control sample in methanol) to 64.40 mg/ml (oil in methanol subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power)). In terms of the amount, linalool was the second dominant component (from 10.61 mg/ml (oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power) to 11.78 mg/ml (oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 50% power)). Statistical analysis of the results obtained for the dominant components revealed that the sonication applied had no significant effect on the concentration of volatile compounds in the analysed solutions. Basil cultivars grown in Europe are characterised by the occurrence of linalool as the main component of essential oil (from 46.9% to 71.8%), while those grown in the tropical climate contain methyl chavicol as the main component (up to 94.3%). Oil obtained from basil grown in Poland contained up to 69.7% of linalool and up to 12.2% of geraniol [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] reported that the main components of basil oil acquired from cultivars grown in Iran were methyl chavicol (up to 43.0%) and linalool (up to 33.4%).
