<p class="p">22 main volatile compounds were identified as a result of GC analysis of methanol and hexane solutions of peppermint oil (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The highest concentration in the analysed solution was noted for menthol (from 35.90 mg/ml (peppermint oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 50% power) to 37.34 mg/ml (peppermint oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 80% power)). The second dominant component in terms of its concentration was menthone (from 16.88 mg/ml (peppermint oil in methanol subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 50% power) to 18.37 mg/ml (peppermint oil in hexane subjected to sonication for 2 minutes at 50% power)). Statistical analysis of the results obtained showed that the sonication applied in the experimental systems did not have any significant effect on the levels of the main components identified. Until now, approximately 150 components of peppermint essential oil have been identified, the main ones being menthol (20–80%) and menthone (15–45%) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Mckay and Blumberg [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] reported that the dominant components of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> oil are menthol (33–60%), menthone (15–32%), 1,8-cineole (5–13%), menthyl acetate (2–11%), isomenthone (2–8%), menthofuran (1–10%), limonene (1–7%), myrcene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (0.1–1.7%), caryophyllene &lt;
 <italic class="italic">beta</italic>-&gt; (2–4%), pulegone (0.5–1.6%), and carvone (1%).
