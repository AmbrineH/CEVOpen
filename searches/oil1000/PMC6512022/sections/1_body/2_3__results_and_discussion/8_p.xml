<p class="p">Comparing the composition of alcohol and hexane solutions of essential oils subjected to sonication with that of the control solutions, one can observe only statistically insignificant quantitative differences that result from the uncertainty of the analytical procedure. The experiment demonstrated that parameters of sonication of essential oil solutions applied in the experiment had no significant effect on the composition of these essential oils, which is important in the aspect of qualitative evaluation and has a bearing on the requirements regulated by relevant standards (pharmacopeia). The study shows that the sonication parameters adopted in the experiment can be applied in the case of analogous systems containing essential oils in their composition. The use of physical methods augmenting the processes of isolation is often determined by the stability of those systems at predetermined parameters. The stability of a system, in turn, is related with an absence of quantitative changes among the desirable components that determine the biological activity of the final product. The choice of a suitable extraction method is extremely important since the oil quality is related to its chemical composition. To maintain the quality of the final product, the applied method should not influence negatively its composition; e.g., the interesting compounds should not be decomposed [
