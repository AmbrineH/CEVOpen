<p class="p">The qualitative (MS spectra and retention indices analysis) and quantitative analysis (internal standard addition method—alkanes C12 and C19) were performed according to previously described procedures [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Precision was estimated by evaluating intraday (repeatability) and interday precision in accordance with a procedure described earlier [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Determination of intraday precision was carried out by triplicate injection of terpinene &lt;gamma-&gt;, linalool, 1,8-cineole, menthone, and limonene solutions of three different concentrations (0.5, 5, and 20 mg/ml). The same three samples were injected over three consecutive days in order to assess interday precision. Inter- and intraday precisions were expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) and were within an acceptable range of 2.5% to 4.7%.
