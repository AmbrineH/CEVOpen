<p class="p">The essential oils were analysed using a Varian 4000 GC-MS/MS system (Varian, USA). The compounds were separated on 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA). The column temperature was increased from 50°C to 250°C at a rate of 4°C/min; injector temperature 250°C; split ratio 1 : 50; and injection volume 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L. MS parameters were as follows: EI mode, with ionization voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 271.2°C; scan range 40–870 Da, scan time 0.80 s, manifold temp. 45°C, and transfer line temp. 289.5°C.
