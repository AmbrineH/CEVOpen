 <p class="p">The objective of the experiment was to investigate the stability of the composition of selected essential oils in the model systems containing methanol and hexane solutions which were treated with ultrasound. Solutions of the oils, with a concentration of 90 mg/ml, were subjected to the effect of ultrasounds with a frequency of 20 kHz and an output power of 200 W for periods of 2 min and 10 min at 50% and 80% power. The experiment has shown no significant effect on the composition of the essential oils resulting from the applied parameters of the process in the tested model systems. The study indicates that the sonication parameters adopted in the experiment can be applied in the case of analogous systems containing essential oils in their composition.</p>
