<p class="p">The mixtures of L and MTO during interesterification process formed HMFS with much similar to HMF fatty acids composition. The distribution of fatty acids in synthesized HMFS is also similar to that in HMF that was primary aim of current studies. However, interesterification process decreased the induction time of HMFS as compared to starting materials, which was suggested to be due to relatively high level of FFA in final product. It was further suggested that using HMSF as functional foods nutritional additives should be preceded by removal of at least part of FFA. PDSC and FT-IR occurred to be fast and reliable method that can be used to assess the oxidative sensitivity features of interesterified mixtures of lard and milk thistle oil. The induction times that can be used as primary parameter of the resistance of fats to their oxidative decomposition were measured with PDSC and correlated with spectral data by PLS technique. Chemical changes occurring during interesterification resulted in many alterations in IR spectra due to breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The information on these alterations can be used for discriminant and reference analysis. PCA analysis constructs statistical model that can be used to distinguish and assign unknown samples and to monitor conditions of process the samples were treated with, e.g., duration of interesterification.
