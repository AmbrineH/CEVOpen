<p class="p">Samples obtained were then analyzed with GC due to fatty acids composition and their distribution between three positions in glycerol backbone. First TAG underwent saponification and esterification with methanol to obtain methyl esters. As pork pancreas lipase has ability to select hydrolysis of esters in sn-1,3 position TAG were hydrolyzed with use of this specific enzyme. Products of this hydrolysis were extracted with diethyl ether. Then preparative thin-layer chromatography was used to separate dissolved in ether products of enzymatic diacylation of TAG. Isolated this way sn-2 monoacylglycerols were removed from plates together with gel and eluted with diethyl ether. The fatty acids contained in monoacylglycerols were determined with GC technique. Fatty acids composition and their positional distribution in sn-2 and sn-1,3 positions of TAG were determined as described further [
