<p class="p">The mixture of initial materials, i.e., lard and milk thistle oil (8:2 w/w) obtained from “Zakład Mięsny Wierzejki” (Poland) and “PPHU Maszyny i Przetwórstwo Nasion Oleistych Ol'Vita” (Poland), respectively, were interesterified. Lipozyme RM IM preparation that contained immobilized lipase from
 <italic class="italic"> Rhizomucor miehei </italic>was used as biocatalyst. Reaction was conducted in 70°C for 2, 4, and 6 hours, respectively, in thermostatic shaker. The temperature incubation of substrates lasted for 10 minutes and was followed by addition of biocatalyst (8% mass to mass, heterogenous catalysis) that was considered an onset point of interesterification reaction. Then, after desired time reaction was stopped by separation of biocatalyst, with use of Buchner funnel under reduced pressure.
