<p class="p">OS was evaluated by data obtained with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC Q20 TA) coupled with a high-pressure cell. Given sample was precisely weighted in dedicated aluminium pan. Then the pan with fat was moved to measuring chamber. Chamber was filled with oxygen and initial pressure was set to 1 400 kPa. The isothermal temperature for each sample was 120Â°C. TA Universal Analysis 2000 software was applied to analyze obtained diagrams.</p>
