<p class="p">Human milk is the only food for infants. Energy of chemical bonds of lipids contained in human milk is the main source of energy for newborn. The chemicals provided with fats are also crucial structural component used in formation of membranes of new cells [

The gastric lipase in the stomach and pancreatic or bile salt-stimulated lipases catalyze formation of body-required “breaks” from fat absorbed from small intestine; thus structure of fat absorbed much influences the structure of final product [
