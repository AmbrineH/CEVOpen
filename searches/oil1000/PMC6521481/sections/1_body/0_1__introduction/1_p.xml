<p class="p">The structure of main constituents of food (the so-called food matrix) plays a vital role in the process of food interaction with chemicals present in human digestive track. This results in different uptake/release of nutrients contained in given food. The major form of lipids in foods is TAG that consists of three fatty acids attached with ester bonds to carbon chain of glycerol backbone. Chemical structures of fatty acids, i.e., carbon chain length and degree of saturation, together with their location position in glycerol (sn-1, sn-2, or sn-3), determine chemical, physical, and biological properties of TAG. This results in various digestibility followed by different impact on human health when fats are consumed [
