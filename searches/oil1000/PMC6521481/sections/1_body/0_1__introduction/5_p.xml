<p class="p">Interesterification is well known procedure for modification of physicochemical properties of oils and fats. Within this process fatty acids are exchanged within and among TAG until a thermodynamic equilibrium is reached [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The interesterification can be conducted either chemically or enzymatically. The alkaline catalysts, such as sodium alkoxide and sodium hydroxide, are usually applied as homogeneous catalysts in vegetable oils interesterification [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The use of 1,3-selective lipases allows to maintain the fatty acids in the sn-2 position of the acylglycerols, that is nutritionally desirable and impossible by chemical catalysis [
