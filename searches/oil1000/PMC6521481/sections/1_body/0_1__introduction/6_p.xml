<p class="p">Although an interest from both market and science about HMF continuously increases, no fat of identical or fully acceptable HMF alike properties has been obtained so far. Therefore the aim of current study was to synthesize and evaluate the selected properties, including OS, of HMFS. Synthesis method was enzymatic interesterification of a blend of lard and milk thistle. It was assumed that a combination of lard and milk thistle in interesterification process opens possibility of obtaining HMF alike fat in terms of the fatty acid composition and their distribution in TAG [

To thoroughly evaluate properties of newly synthesized fats, thus achieve stated aim, analytical data obtained by PDSC and FT-IR techniques were processed. The analytical information obtained from thermal analysis is useful in controlling quality changes in food during processing and storage [
