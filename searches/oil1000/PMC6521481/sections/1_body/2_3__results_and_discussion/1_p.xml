<p class="p">DSC experiments are performed in dynamic conditions that means the linear increase in temperature is applied or at isothermal conditions that means constant temperature is applied. The pressure of oxidation medium, i.e., oxygen or air, is kept either at ambience pressure or at increased pressure (PDSC) [
