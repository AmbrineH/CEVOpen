<p class="p">Spectral differences occur in the range 14761450 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. In spectra of 2-hour temperature treated mixtures the middle intensity band at 1466 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> accompanied by weak band at 1459 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> is present. In the spectrum of 4-hour treated mixtures band at 1466 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> is still present, while new band at 1457 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> occurs that is considered shifted band observed at 1459 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> in spectra of 2-hour temperature treated samples. The shift toward lower frequency evidences that bond generating this band is slightly weaker than original one. In the spectrum of 6-hour temperature treated sample band at 1466 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> is present at the same wavenumber, while band at 1457 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> becomes more distinct, i.e., is of greater intensity.
