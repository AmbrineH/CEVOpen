<p class="p">The differences in spectra of lard, oil, and temperature mixtures are obviously due to difference in their chemical compositions. Discriminant analysis of spectra of five groups resulted in separation of five homologous groups presented graphically in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>. Groups are located in Cartesian system with “distance to next group” on x-axis and “distance to oil” on y-axis. The selection of data on x- and y-axis aimed at clear graphical presentation for distinct diversity of homologous groups. They are statistically far away from each other; however 6-hour temperature treated mixtures are most distinct that is due to bigger chemical changes that occurred during longer time of esterification process.
