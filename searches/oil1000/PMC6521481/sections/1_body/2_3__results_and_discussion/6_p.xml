<p class="p">Raw spectra of studied samples are presented on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. They are quite similar to each other with a very strong bands (high transmittance) around 3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> and 1750 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, respectively. Water-free samples are appropriate materials for IR analysis as water absorbance generated by IR very active O–H vibration does not disturb or influence spectral effect of oscillating atoms contained in specific groups, e.g., functional groups of studied compounds. Presented spectra are similar to each other as all are of similar origin and contain similar groups of vibrating atoms that results in similar spectral shape. Direct analysis of wavenumbers difference or intensity difference or bands shift is difficult. Therefore in current approach visual inspection was followed by statistical techniques application.
