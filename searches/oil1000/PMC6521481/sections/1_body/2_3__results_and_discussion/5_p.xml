<p class="p">HMF is believed to be a model for the fat components in infant formulas [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Human milk contains approximately 70% of palmitic acid in the sn-2 position, whereas most vegetable oils contain this specific fatty acid primarily in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Pancreatic lipase selectively hydrolyzes the fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions, yielding FFA and MAG. The 2-MAG are absorbed in digestive track more efficiently than free palmitic acid, which form insoluble salts with calcium and magnesium cations [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> the percentage of most abundant fatty acid in sn-2 position of TAG of lard, milk thistle oil, and HMFS are presented. HMFS, alike HMF, contains from 53.4% to 73.4% of palmitic acid in the sn-2 position of TAG, whereas percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in internal position of TAG in oil is from 18.9% to 26.1% and from 23.0% to 34.8% for oleic and linoleic acid, respectively. In regard to the percentage of the fatty acids esterified at sn-2 position of TAG in HMFS, one can observe that the structure of TAG of HMFS is very alike in the structure of HMF with respect to fatty acids present in sn-2 position.
