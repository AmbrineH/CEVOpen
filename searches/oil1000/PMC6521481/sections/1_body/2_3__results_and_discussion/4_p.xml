<p class="p">The chemical composition, i.e., presence of required fatty acids of initial blend, is essential for the formation of proper HMFS by the interesterification [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> these mixtures of lard and milk thistle oil used for esterification were appropriate to produce HMFS due to ratio of PUFA to MUFA and SFA similar to adequate ratio in HMF. The SFA content in HMFS ranged from 32.3 to 37.9%, the MUFA from 39.6% to 43.3%, and PUFA from 19.1% to 28.0%. Some of unsaturated fatty acids present in milk thistle oil were transferred to backbone of lard substituting some saturated acids. The content of both oleic and palmitic acid in obtained HMFS is similar to the adequate ratio in HMF. TAG of interesterified fats contained from 17.7% to 22.2% of palmitic acid and from 37.1% to 40.3% of oleic acid. HMF contains 40.6% of SFA including about 22% palmitic acid and 39.1% of MUFA including about 34% oleic acid [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. As a result of interesterification the essential fatty acids from milk thistle oil were built-in structure of TAG of lard. The obtained HMFS contain from 19.1% to 28.0% of PUFA including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Therefore the interesterification of a blend of lard and milk thistle oil forms new fats that are of similar to HMF oleic and palmitic acids content, as well as containing nutritionally important essential fatty acids from the omega-6 and omega-3 groups.
