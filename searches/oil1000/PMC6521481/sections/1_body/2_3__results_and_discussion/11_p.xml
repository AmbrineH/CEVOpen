<p class="p">The application of spectral data is versatile. Within current investigation they were referred to results obtained by analysis of different methods data, e.g., DSC. As induction time (IT) is most important parameter of studied samples due to their resistance to oxidation, i.e., OS, its average value determined with DSC technique has been statistically referred to spectral data from selected spectral regions. Reference model has been calculated with use of calibration and validation data sets. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10" class="xref"> Figure 10</xref> presents dependence between actual and calculated with the model values of IT. The application of different regions as well as combining of several regions did not produce significantly better results in terms of correlation coefficients of validation and prediction of RMSEC and RMSEP. In current model correlation coefficient for linear calibration was 0.9735 with RMESC = 1.36 and RMSEP = 5.06. The linear equation between predicted by model against actual values is y = 0.9734 x + 0.8285. Spectral region used for model calibration was 3115–2737 cm
