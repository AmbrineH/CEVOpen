<p class="p">Spectra of samples of lard, oil extracted from thistle, and temperature treated 8:2 mixtures of both were analyzed due to their similarities and differences. Spectral data in some regions differed significantly. In following regions, 3200–2800 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> containing bands originated from C–H oscillations, 1800–1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> in which bands are generated mainly by C=O vibrations affected by configuration of groups of atoms attached to carbonyl carbon, and 1480–1450 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, differences can be observed even directly with visual inspection after computer extension of these regions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref"> Figure 8</xref> presents example spectral data of extension in 1900–1550 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> region. This is very characteristic region for fat-like materials as contain bands originated from C=O vibrations contained in carboxylic groups, ester groups, carbonyl groups, or even amide groups. All spectra have very strong and sharp band at 1746 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. The less intense but still strong band located at 1712 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> is present in the case of spectra of interesterified mixtures only. Lard and oil do not have this band which evidences for creation a new chemical structure during interesterification process. 6-hour processed sample has strongest band at this wavenumber.
