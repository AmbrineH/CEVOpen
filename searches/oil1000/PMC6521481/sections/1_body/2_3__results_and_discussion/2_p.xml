Samples with smaller induction time are less stable compared to those with greater induction time, considering results obtained at the same temperature [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. For HMFS samples induction time measured isothermally at 120°C ranged from 25.6 min to 26.7 min. It was smaller comparing to the initial fats for which results were as follows: MTO-31.2 min; L-48.2 min. Most literature records report a decrease in OS of interesterified fats compared to the initial mixture [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. OS is considered primary factor determining the overall quality of foodstuff of high content of unsaturated fats and oils as well as fats and oils themselves. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are chemically highly reactive molecules due to high content of reactive double bonds and hence susceptibility for oxidation, that results in formation of free radicals, hydroperoxides, and polymers. This in turn leads to decrease in quality, both technological and nutritional [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Induction time measured for lard samples was longer than that measured for milk thistle oil. The long induction time, hence greater OS of lard, is the result of high content of saturated fatty acids. PV of lard was also smaller than that of milk thistle oil. PV determines the current amount of oxygen chemically bounded to an oil or fat, i.e., involved in peroxides. Particularly hydroperoxides, the primary products of oxidation, are significant. Higher value of PV indicates a higher production of primary oxidation products which leads to quicker progression of oxidation. In
