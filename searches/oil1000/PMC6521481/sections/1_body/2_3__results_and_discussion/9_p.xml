<p class="p">Next interesting change observed in spectra of time-differently treated mixtures is band at 1099 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. It is clearly present for 2-hour treated sample while it weakens for 4-hour sample and disappears for 6-hour sample. Similar alteration is observed for band at 1030 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> that is present in 2- and 4-hour samples while absent in 6-hour sample. On the other hand bands at 1047 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, 943 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> and 634 cm
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> are present in 6-hour sample while absent in 2- and 4-hour samples. All the mentioned above assignments are presented in
