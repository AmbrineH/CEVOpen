<p class="p">The ordinary function of lipases is to catalyze the process of hydrolysis of fats to form FFA, partial acylglycerols and glycerol. In the case of reversible reaction the enzyme catalyzes both forward and reverse reactions, i.e., the back formation of acylglycerols from glycerol and FFA. Depending on level of water equilibrium shifts to the reactants that means hydrolysis predominates or to products thus esterification predominates [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Hence, FFA can be present in the reacting mixture. Hamam and Shahidi [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] suggested that FFA may induce oxidation due to catalytic effect of the carboxylic groups on formation of free radicals. The FFA content in lard, milk thistle oil, and HMFS is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The content of FFA in lard was the lowest, i.e., &lt;1%. The content of FFA in milk thistle oil was higher than in lard but numerically lower than 2%. On the other hand, the content of FFA in HMFS was greater compared to both lard and milk thistle oil. These results are in agreement with Bryś et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], who proved that enzymatic interesterification leads to increase in FFA content. The FFA content depends significantly on the duration of the process. In the case of HMFS the shorter reaction time the lower FFA content. The final mixture obtained after lard and milk thistle oil interesterification contained 8.3–12.3% of FFA. Before using HMFS as functional food additive, the FFA should be removed.
