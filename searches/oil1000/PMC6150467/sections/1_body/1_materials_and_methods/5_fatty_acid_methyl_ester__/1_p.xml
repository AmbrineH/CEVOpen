<p class="p">Fifty microlitres of lipid extract was transferred into 15 ml lipid clean vials and concentrated to dryness. Methylene chloride (1.5 ml) and 3 ml of Hilditch reagent (1.5 H

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>: 98.5 anhydrous methanol) were added, then vials were vortexed and sonicated for 4 min. They were filled with nitrogen, capped and heated at 100Â°C for 1 hr. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (0.5 ml) and 1.5 ml hexane were added to the samples which were vortexed, followed by removing the upper, organic layer. The vials were then dried and refilled with hexane to approximately 0.5 ml. They were filled with nitrogen, capped, sealed with Teflon tape, and finally sonicated for another 4 min to re-suspend the fatty acids.
