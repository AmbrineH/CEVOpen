<p class="p">Lipid oxidation was measured according to the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) method [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. To measure lipid oxidation, 1 gram of muscle sample (two replicates per fish) was weighed and transferred into centrifuge tubes (plus 1 blank). The sample was homogenized with 5 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) by polytron. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant (top layer) was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore syringe filter. Five ml of 0.08 M thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and 2.5 ml of TCA were added and heated in a boiling water bath at 94±1°C for 45 min then cooled to room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a UV-spectrophotometer. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values were calculated using a standard curve. Standard curves were prepared using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as a precursor of malondialdehyde (MDA; 0–10 ppm).
