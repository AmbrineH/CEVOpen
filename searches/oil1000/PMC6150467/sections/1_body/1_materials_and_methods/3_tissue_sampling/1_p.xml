<p class="p">Ten fish were randomly sampled at week 0, followed by 5 fish per tank at week 7 and 14. Fish were euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 (400 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, Syndel Laboratories, Vancouver, BC, Canada), then fork length and weight were measured. Gut and liver were removed, weighed, sampled, and placed on aluminum weigh boats. Norwegian quality cuts (NQC) (area from directly behind the dorsal fin to the anus) were removed from the fish body and weighed. With the dorsal fin cut to the right, the skin was cut along the dorsal side, peeled back to expose the skeletal white muscle (hereafter referred to as muscle), and a strip (approximately 0.5 g) of muscle was removed and placed into lipid clean test tubes (rinsed with methanol and chloroform three times each) for lipid analysis. The tubes had been weighed after ashing at 450°C for 8 hrs, and the Teflon lined caps were rinsed three times with methanol and chloroform. Vials were kept on ice during sampling. After sampling, 2 ml of chloroform was poured on the tissues in the tubes and the remaining space was filled with nitrogen. The tubes were then sealed and stored at -20°C. All procedures, including handling, treatment, euthanasia, and dissection were performed according to the guidelines from the Canadian Council of Animal Care (approved Memorial University Institutional Animal Care Protocol 14e71-MR).
