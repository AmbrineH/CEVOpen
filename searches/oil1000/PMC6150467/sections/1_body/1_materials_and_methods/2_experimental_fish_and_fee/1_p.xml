<p class="p">Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) smolts were obtained from Northern Harvest Sea Farms in Stephenville, NL, Canada. Fish were tagged with passive transponders (PIT) and maintained at 11±1°C in a flow-through seawater system under a 12-h light photoperiod in the Dr. Joe Brown Aquatic Research Building in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. Fish (1148 at 139–232 g each) were distributed randomly in 28 tanks (620 L, 4 tanks per diet). There were 41 fish per tank until day 0, when one fish/tank was sampled in order to have a random selection of fish representing every tank at week 0. Fish were hand fed 5 mm experimental pellets to satiation twice a day for 14 weeks. Feed consumption was measured weekly and fish weight and fork length were recorded at the beginning and end of the experiment.
