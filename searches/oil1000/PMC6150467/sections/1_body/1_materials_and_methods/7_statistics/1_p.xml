<p class="p">To ensure representative fish were sampled for analysis, only fish with weight gains within the range of twice the standard deviation from the overall tank weight gain means were considered. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted using Minitab version 17 to compare diet ingredients, lipid and fatty acid composition of muscle and diet, and growth characteristics. For statistical analysis of growth data, lipid class, and fatty acid data, nested general linear models were combined with Tukey pairwise comparisons using Minitab to determine the difference between tanks and diets. The normality of residuals was evaluated with the Anderson-Darling normality test. If the test failed (p&lt;0.05), a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks was performed in SigmaPlot version 13.</p>
