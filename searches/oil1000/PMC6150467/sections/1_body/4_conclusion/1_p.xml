<p class="p">This study evaluated the effects of minimizing marine resource utilization in diets of farmed Atlantic salmon on growth and muscle lipid composition. By replacing fish meal and fish oil in aquafeeds with animal by-products and rapeseed oil at levels used in this study (33 and 27%, respectively), marine resource utilization was reduced to 10% or less; however, this affected growth, lipid class, and fatty acid composition of muscle tissue. When the content of animal by-products and vegetable oil in the diet did not exceed 26% and 22%, respectively most growth, lipid class, and fatty acid parameters remained unaffected.</p>
