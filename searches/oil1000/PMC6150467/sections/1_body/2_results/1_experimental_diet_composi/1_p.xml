<p class="p">Moisture levels in the feeds ranged from 5.0 to 7.5% and diets contained 92.5 to 95.0% dry matter. There were significant differences in proximate composition data among the seven diets; however, these differences were small (
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). While there was no significant difference in the nitrogen proportion among the seven diets, the carbon was statistically different between the marine and ω3LC1.41 diets, which contained the lowest and highest levels of C, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The major lipid class was triacylglycerol ranging from 92 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in the animal by-product diet to 173 mg g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in the ω3LC0 diet (
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). All diets had the same concentrations of 16:0, ƩSFA, and ƩPUFA as well as the same ratios of PUFA/SFA and DHA/EPA. The three diets with 5% fish meal and ~22% animal by-products, ω3LC0, ω3LC1, and ω3LC1.41 had statistically the same content of 18:1ω9, 18:2ω6, 18:3ω3, and 20:4ω6. The 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3 contents were significantly lower in the ω3LC0 diet than in the marine, medium marine and ω3LC1.41 diets (
