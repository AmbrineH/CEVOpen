<p class="p">Apparent feed intake, final weight and weight gain showed a significant positive correlation with the amount of fish oil in the diet, as did HSI; however, SGR, final length, NQC, VSI and CF did not correlate significantly with fish oil level. Ʃω3 in the diet and muscle had positive correlations with growth performance characteristics (r = 0.82–0.87,

By contrast, there was an inverse correlation between HSI and vegetable oil content in the diet (-0.942, P&lt;0.01), which is why the diet with the highest inclusion of vegetable oil (ω3LC0) resulted in the lowest HSI (
