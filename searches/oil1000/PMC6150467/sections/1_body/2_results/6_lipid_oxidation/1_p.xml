<p class="p">Lipid oxidation was also studied to measure the extent it could be affected by muscle tissue lipids, as high content of PUFA could make them susceptible to oxidation. Oxidation results were represented by TBARS values for marine, animal by-product, and ω3LC1.41 diets with mean values of 1.15±0.61, 1.52±0.65, and 1.01±0.59 mg MDA kg
