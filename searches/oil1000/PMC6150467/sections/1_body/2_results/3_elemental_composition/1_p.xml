<p class="p">Elemental compositions were measured at week 7 and 14 in muscle tissue (Norwegian quality cut). The C/N ratio and N proportion in muscle tissues differ significantly among the seven diets after week 7. However, there was no significant difference in the C/N ratio and C proportion of muscle tissue at week 14. Also, no significant differences in muscle N proportion were observed when feeding the seven diets at week 14, except between the marine (lowest N) and animal by-products (highest N) diets (
