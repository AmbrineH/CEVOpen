<p class="p">Marine fish and salmonids require arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4ω6) and high levels of essential omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6ω3), as they cannot synthesize them easily. However, fish have some ability to supply these essential fatty acids by synthesizing them from shorter chain PUFAs (e.g. 18:3ω3 and 18:2ω6). Therefore, it is important that high levels of PUFAs are available in the diet [
