<p class="p">While there have been several studies on replacing marine ingredients with alternative sustainable sources, more effective replacement levels are required. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate how using alternative diets with low content of marine resources can affect growth performance, and muscle lipid class and fatty acid composition in farmed Atlantic salmon. This study improves the understanding of the nutrition requirements of Atlantic salmon under various dietary conditions, and provides an insight into the potential performance of future aquafeed alternatives.</p>
