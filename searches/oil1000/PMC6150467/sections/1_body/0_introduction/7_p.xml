<p class="p">Replacing fish oil with rapeseed oil in diets of Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) on tissue lipid composition showed no effect on growth performance or feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, high lipid levels occurred in the liver in fish fed 100% rapeseed oil, and replacement at 50% or higher significantly reduced levels of 20:5ω3, 22:6ω3, and the ratio of ω3 to ω6 in the muscle making it less beneficial for humans.
