<p class="p">Several studies have evaluated the effect of replacing fish meal and fish oil with terrestrial plant sources in feeds for farmed animals [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] as they are sustainable sources of energy for fish growth that are readily available at lower prices [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, one problem that limits full replacement of fish oil with plant oils is the low level of ω3 fatty acids and high levels of ω6 and ω9 fatty acids. Plant oils can provide the same relative ratios of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and PUFA as found in fish oil, but not the level of highly unsaturated fatty acids in fish oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Nonetheless plant oils can replace a major amount of fish oil in the diets [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] with no significant influence on fish growth as long as sufficient levels of essential fatty acids are provided [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. To minimize any reduction in growth, and nutritional quality in terms of health benefits of farmed fish to human consumers, potential substitutes for fish oil should avoid excessive deposition of 18:2ω6, retain high levels of ω3 PUFA and provide sufficient energy in the form of saturates and MUFA [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. It is claimed that as long as essential fatty acid requirements are met, fish oil can be substantially replaced by MUFA-rich alternative sources. Rapeseed oil is one of the best candidates to replace fish oil because its MUFA are 55–72% of the fatty acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. MUFA cannot be converted to essential fatty acids like LA, ALA, and ω3 long-chain PUFA, so the main reason for using plant oils rich in MUFA is their ability to provide energy [
