<p class="p">Correlation analysis showed that growth performance characteristics are positively correlated with total concentrations of ω3 fatty acids in the diets, but interestingly there was no significant correlation with individual ω3 fatty acids in the diets suggesting that an improvement in growth performance may be obtained irrespective of ω3 fatty acid chain-length or degree of unsaturation. In turn this indicates an interchangeability among these fatty acids in terms of function or biochemically through modification of chemical structures, e.g. chain elongation and desaturation.</p>
