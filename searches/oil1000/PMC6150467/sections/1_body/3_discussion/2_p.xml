<p class="p">Cultured fish need lipid, protein, energy, vitamins and minerals in their diet for growth, reproduction, and other normal physiological functions. Lipid contributes to the structure of biomembranes [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and has a critical role in providing energy for animal tissues and is the source of essential fatty acids. The poor performance of fish fed the ω3LC0 diet is undoubtedly associated with the complete lack of fish oil in this diet [

Fish meal contains valuable eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6ω3) and a relatively high content of fish meal in the diet reduces the possibility of having low levels of essential fatty acids [
