<p class="p">The fatty acid compositions of muscle tissues (

 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], one serving of cooked fish is 75 g. Therefore, a serving of Atlantic salmon fed the seven dietary treatments includes EPA+DHA levels ranging from 112 to 236 mg which would be less than the daily requirement (250 mg) recommended by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], even for fish fed the marine diet. This is consistent with the decreasing trend in the content of EPA+DHA in commercially farmed salmon overtime [
 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Therefore, to meet the recommended daily EPA+DHA value, one would need to eat more than one serving of cooked fish.
