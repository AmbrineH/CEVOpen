 <xref rid="pone.0198538.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]), in which HSI was statistically unaffected by the increase of vegetable oil content in the diet. However, in those studies the maximum vegetable oil content was 20%, whereas here the ω3LC0 diet had the highest inclusion of vegetable oil at 27%.
