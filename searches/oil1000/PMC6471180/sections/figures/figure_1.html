 <p> Effects of essential oil on bacteria. Gram-positive peptidoglycan cell wall allows hydrophobic molecules to penetrate and reach the internal environment. The lipopolysaccharide, which is part of the external layer of Gram-negative bacteria, allows mainly small hydrophilic molecules to pass and is only partly permissive for hydrophobic molecules. The hydrophobicity of essential oils is responsible for the disruption of bacterial structures. The mechanisms of action of essential oil on bacteria are: degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, cytoplasm coagulation and diffusion through the double lipid layer of the membrane, together with alteration of its permeability and function [ 18]. The black ribbon shows a twofold dilution set for aqueous extract of lavender oil and its effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 6.3%; MBC was found to be &gt;50%). </p>
