<p class="p">The most susceptible bacteria were the Gram-positive cocci, followed by the representatives of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family. Negligible differences were noticed between MSSA and MRSA response to the essential oils; though, we have to note that MRSA was more susceptible to MiEO, and less susceptible to AqEO than MSSA. 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> presented the highest resistance against most of the essential oils, except for the oregano and lemon.
