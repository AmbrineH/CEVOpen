<p class="p">As presented in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00015-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00015-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the best activity was achieved by micelles suspension of essential oils, with MICs and MBCs ranging from 0.1% to &gt;50% v/v. The most active oils were oregano, thyme, lemon and lavender. MiEO of oregano managed to achieve bactericidal effect at concentrations as low as 0.1â€“6.3% v/v on all tested bacteria. The aqueous extracts showed generally lower bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity, ranging from 6.3% to &gt;50% v/v. In one specific case, aqueous extract of lavender oil presented good bacteriostatic effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 6.3%), better than its corresponding micellar suspension (MIC &gt; 50%). In two other cases, also for lavender oil, the aqueous extract presented better bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect (MIC/MBC = 6.3%) than its micellar suspension (MIC/MBC = 12.5%) on 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. This can be explained by the presence of polysaccharide capsule of 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella</italic> species, which acts like a barrier against hydrophobic oils, but allows the diffusion of aqueous extracts.
