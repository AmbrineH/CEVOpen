<p class="p">Essential oils, also called volatile oils, are concentrated natural extracts derived from plants, which have been used as alternative medicines since the late twelfth century, and became more widespread in the second half of the sixteenth century. Modern chemistry allowed a deeper approach of essential oils that resulted in many publications during the nineteenth century. The essential oils started to be gradually used in the production of perfumes, foodstuffs or beverages [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Essential oils were proved to be good sources of bioactive compounds, with antioxidative and antimicrobial properties. Many plant parts contain oils that can be extracted: leaves, seeds, bark, resin, berries, flowers, roots or fruits. The essential oils can be purified by steam distillation, hydrodistillation, hydrodiffusion or by solvent extraction [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The composition is complex and consists mostly of terpenes (mostly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), terpenoids (oxygenated compounds such as phenols, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones or ethers) and aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Parts of these compounds are hydrophobic, but some parts are hydrosoluble. Even though terpenes are considered hydrophobic, they may present some water solubility depending on their structure and mixing temperature. Terpenoids present better solubility in water than terpenes [
