<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined in 96-well plates (eight rows marked from A-H and 12 columns marked from 1–12). Two-hundred microliters of each AqEO respectively MiEO were distributed in the first well of each row (A-F). One-hundred microliters of sterile distilled water were distributed in the columns 2 to 12. Using a multichannel pipette, 100 µL of AqEO / MiEO from the first column were sequentially mixed the water, achieving two-fold seriated dilutions. The remaining 100 µL from the last dilution mix were discarded. The final concentrations of essential oils were 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.13%, 1.56%, 0.78%, 0.39%, 0.20%, 0.10%, 0.05% and 0.025% v/v in final volume (or as reported by other authors and rounded: 500, 250, 125, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 µL/ml). Two plates were prepared for each bacterial strain (one for AqEO and one for MiEO testing).</p>
