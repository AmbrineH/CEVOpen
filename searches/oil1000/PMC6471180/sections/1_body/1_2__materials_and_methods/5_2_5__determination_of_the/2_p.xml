<p class="p">Forty-eight hours before the study, the bacterial strains were revitalized on Columbia blood agar (Oxoid Limited, Pratteln, UK) and checked for purity. From an isolated culture, a standard inoculum of 0.5 McFarland units (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> colony forming units/µL) was prepared in sterile saline. Ten microliters of inoculum were transferred in 9990 µL of 2x concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid Limited, Pratteln, UK), and 100 µL were transferred with a multichannel pipette from a pipetting tray over the 100 µL of AqEO/MiEO, obtaining a bacterial inoculum of approximatively 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> CFU/well in a final volume of 200 µL. Negative and positive control wells were prepared for each plate, in the last row (Mueller-Hinton broth and water for negative control in well H11, respectively bacterial inoculum and water, without essential oils for positive control in well H12).
