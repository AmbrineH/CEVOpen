<p class="p">The results were analyzed in spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel 2007) and then organized in tables for better overall comparative analysis of the MIC/MBC. All the values were also normalized against the MIC/MBC values of pure ethylic alcohol (Chemical Company, Romania), as determined in previously published results of the author, using the same methodology and bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. An index of 1 signifies an identical effect with the ethylic alcohol. Indexes higher than 1 or lower than 1 signify a higher respectively lower activity of the essential oil compared with ethylic alcohol. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad InStat 3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 (95% confidence level). In order to be able to calculate the significance in two sample-paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests, all MIC/MBC values that were not quantifiable (&gt;50%) were considered as the next twofold dilution factor (100%).
