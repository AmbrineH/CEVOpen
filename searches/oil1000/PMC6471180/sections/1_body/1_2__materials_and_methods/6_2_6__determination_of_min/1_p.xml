<p class="p">The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined from the last three wells of each row that showed no bacterial growth after plate incubation. For this, 3 µL from the corresponding wells were spot-inoculated on blood-agar plates, which were labeled in a checkerboard pattern with the corresponding wells coordinates. The plates were incubated overnight at 35 °C, and the colony development was followed in each spot-inoculation place. The MBC was noted for the position where no bacterial colonies were developed and interpreted as v/v percentage of stock solution.</p>
