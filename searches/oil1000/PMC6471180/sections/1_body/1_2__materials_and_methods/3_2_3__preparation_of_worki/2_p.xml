<p class="p">The aim of the first method was to obtain homogenous micelle aggregates composed of water and essential oil that could be mixed with the water-based liquid culture medium. For this, 2 mL of sterile water and essential oil were mixed in in microcentrifuge tubes and the micelles were obtained by sonication at 40 kHz, for 20 min at 25 Â°C, in a sonicator water bath (Elmasonic S30, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Germany) using sweep mode. The bottom homogenous opalescent phase was carefully recovered using fine sterile pipette tips and further used as stock micelle solution of essential oil (MiEO).</p>
