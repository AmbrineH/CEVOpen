<p class="p">Myrtle oil is used nowadays in contemporary Christianity as incense. In medicine, it is described to have many protective effects for several conditions, especially digestive and skin disorders [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It is composed of bioactive constituents such as polyphenols, terpenes (which we also found β-pinene—25%), acylphloroglucinol, myrtenyl acetate, limonene, and linalool with antioxidant and antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. We also found a monoterpenoid (eucalyptol) in high percentage (28.7%). For both frankincense and myrtle, we found a very low antibacterial effect, and only on Gram-positive cocci, with high MICs. We have to note that myrtle oil presented a very good inhibitory effect on

 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Metabolic differences may have a role in resistance to frankincense and myrtle, as
