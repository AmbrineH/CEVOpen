<p class="p">Lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>) flowers are usually used for decoration and fresh fragrance. Lavender essential oil is used in cosmetics, and not much about antimicrobial effects was published. Its main constituents are linalool and linalyl-acetate which sum more than 50%, followed by smaller amounts of sesquiterpenes and terpenes [
 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-08-00015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The high content of linalyl-butyrate we found (26.5%) explains the good antibacterial activity of lavender micellar form, while the linalool (25%) and its solubility in water may explain the good inhibitory effect of its aqueous extract.
