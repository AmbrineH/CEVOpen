<p class="p">A PubMed search for the terms [“essential oil” AND (antimicrobial OR antibacterial)] provided more than 3000 results, with an ascending trend from 2000, about half of these dating from 2013. The interest for alternative to antibiotics is necessary, as the antibiotic era will soon end, according to specialists’ opinions. The essential oils, as natural extracts, with low adverse effects, may become reliable alternatives in antimicrobial fight. Many patients could be of benefit to local treatments with essential oils. Use of these alternative topic treatments could be useful in conditions where the bacterial colonization/infection are hard to control, such as necrotic ulcers, diabetic feet, or where the blood flow is reduced, or other situations where the oral or intravenous antibiotics do not reach the infection site. Also, the fight against multidrug resistant strains has to be won by other means than antibiotics, and natural extracts could be part of this. Further studies are needed in order to find the proper ways to deliver the active antimicrobial compounds.</p>
