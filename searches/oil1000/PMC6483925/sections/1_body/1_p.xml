Predefined, commercially available media are preferable as they are made under adequate quality control conditions and standardize embryo cultures among different laboratories. If these media could be used for feline embryo culture, they could contribute to the conservation of endangered feline species by

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] suggested that feline embryos maintain ionic homeostasis differently from rodent embryos. Therefore, the availability of commercially available media for IVC of feline embryos should be investigated. Recently, commercially available serum-free media have been developed for human embryo IVC, with two opposing views emerging on the ideal composition. These are the “single-step media”, which contain all components embryos need for development; and the “sequential media”, having a different composition that aims to fulfill the needs of the embryo during early or late development [
