 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. As generation of feline blastocysts using 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> culture (IVC) is very difficult because of the “morula block” [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], several studies have been undertaken to improve the IVC process [
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Significantly better results were obtained when a two-step culture was used and the culture medium was changed on day 2 or 3 than when a one-step culture was used [
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Specifically, the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) instead of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the late period of culture was a key factor for the improved results.
