 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>-matured Grade 1 and 2 oocytes from ovaries of ovariohysterectomized cats and showed that the proportion of blastocysts was 6.7%. In the study, the oocytes were incubated in modified Earleâ€™s balanced salt solution (MK-1) with BSA during early culture and subsequently in the same medium but with added FBS (5%) during late culture. These results suggest that the commercial human single-step media used in the present study are highly beneficial for IVC of cat embryos. Moreover, the results obtained using Grade 3 oocytes indicate that the present culture condition can promote the development of poor-grade feline oocytes
