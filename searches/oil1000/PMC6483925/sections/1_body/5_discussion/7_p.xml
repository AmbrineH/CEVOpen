<p class="p">These media also differ in terms of osmolarity. The osmolarity of Only-One Medium is 265 mOsm, and that of Early culture and Blastocyst media is 280 mOsm. The osmolarity of culture media is a major factor affecting 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> embryo development [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Moreover, NaCl is the major component of culture media affecting osmolarity. As for other species [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], the development of feline embryos was improved under reduced NaCl concentrations [
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Therefore, in our experiment, the low osmotic pressure of Only-One Medium may have had a positive effect on embryogenesis.
