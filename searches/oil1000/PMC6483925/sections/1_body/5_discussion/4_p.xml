<p class="p">In the present study, using OM + BSA/FBS, the morulae + blastocyst and blastocyst rates in Grade 3 oocytes were reduced in experiments II and III compared to experiment I, whereas those of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes were not. Naoi 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] indicated that the reproduction cycle stage of donor cat ovaries has no apparent effects on the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> development of Grade 1 oocytes after IVF, whereas for poor grade oocytes the rate of blastocyst formation was different in the estrous cycle. Since the estrous stage of the queens was not considered in this study, the differences in the results for Grade 3 oocytes among the experiments may have been due to the use of oocytes at different stages of the estrous cycle. Moreover, another group [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] has suggested that the size of the follicles/oocytes, as well as their qualities, may affect the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> maturation and subsequent development of cat oocytes. Therefore, future studies should evaluate the effects of the stage of the estrous cycle, as well as oocyte diameter, on the development of Grade 3 oocytes.
