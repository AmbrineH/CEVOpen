<p class="p">In conclusion, the commercially available human Only-One Medium supplemented with BSA for the first 2 days of culture and with FBS for the subsequent 5 days of culture is suitable for feline embryo development until the blastocyst stage. Moreover, as the IVC condition was effective for IVF of poor-quality oocytes, it can be a promising tool for use in the conservation of endangered feline species. However, in the present study, we used media provided by only one company, and did not compare them to media provided by other companies and developed for other species. In the future, the effect of other commercially available media on feline IVC should be investigated.</p>
