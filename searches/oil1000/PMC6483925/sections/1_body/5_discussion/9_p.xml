<p class="p">Because blastocyst quality is evaluated in terms of blastocyst cell number [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], it is important to investigate cell numbers when evaluating an IVC medium. Although we cultured embryos in OM + BSA/FBS for 7 days, the average blastocyst cell number in the present study (235.4 ± 87.7) is at least similar to that reported by Herrick
