<p class="p">The OM + BSA/FBS group exhibited relatively, but not significantly, increased blastocyst formation compared to the EB + BSA/FBS group. As Biggers and Racowsky [
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] reported that fertilized oocytes were sensitive to changes in environmental conditions in the early period of IVC, sensitivity may have affected embryo development. Moreover, Only-One Medium and Blastocyst Medium contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. In contrast, Early Culture Medium contains only alanyl-L-glutamine and taurine. Bavister and Arlotto [
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] reported that addition of the 20 amino acids to hamster culture media overcame the one-cell block. The morula block normally observed in 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> cat embryo development [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] may be due to the culture conditions of the oocytes and embryos [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Whereas Early Culture and Blastocyst media provide amino acids only after day 2, Only-One Medium provides amino acids throughout the 7 days of culture. Therefore, Only-One Medium may be superior to Early Culture and Blastocyst media in terms of supporting cat embryo development during IVC.
