<p class="p">To find a suitable condition to improve the development of feline embryos using a commercially available human IVC medium, we examined the effects of the period of FBS supplementation using alternative human IVC media. As reported by Pope

 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], the addition of FBS in the late period of IVC led to the formation of more blastocysts. Culture in OM + BSA/FBS, in particular, resulted in a significantly higher number of blastocysts than culture in OM + BSA, whereas no difference in the number of morulae + blastocysts was observed between these cultures. These results indicate that FBS contains components that can overcome the morula block in the late IVC period. Mun 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] reported that the addition of FBS in the late IVC period of porcine embryos significantly increased blastocyst formation. They also found that FBS significantly reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reduction of ROS prevents parthenogenetic activation and increases developmental competence parameters, such as blastocyst formation. In addition, Singh and Armstrong [
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] reported that FBS contains insulin-like growth factor (IGF) which is essential for embryo growth. Indeed, supplementing IVC with IGF inhibited apoptosis and increased the blastocyst formation rate in rabbits [

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] reported the extent to which unidentified components of FBS can promote optimal blastocyst development.
