<p class="p">It is well known that feline oocytes frequently show parthenogenesis [
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In this study, the proportion of parthenotes was 3.3 in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and 7.9% in Grade 3 oocytes. Moreover, only one oocyte in each of the Grades developed to the 8-cell stage using OM + BSA/FBS, and no oocyte developed to the morula or blastocyst stage. We also evaluated the fertilization rate of Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and Grade 3 oocytes, and observed 2PN formation in both groups. The results indicate that Grade 3 oocytes develop to the blastocyst stage due to normal fertilization and not parthenogenesis.
