<p class="p">From the findings of experiment I, we considered that the addition of FBS instead of BSA in the late IVC period elicited better results in terms of blastocyst formation. Therefore, it was essential to examine morula and blastocyst formation in the IVC supplemented with FBS for the entire period. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, there was no difference in morula + blastocyst formation between the OM + BSA/FBS and the OM + FBS groups among any of the oocyte Grades. However, a significant reduction in blastocyst formation was observed in the OM + FBS group compared to the OM + BSA/FBS group in the IVC with oocytes of all Grades (
