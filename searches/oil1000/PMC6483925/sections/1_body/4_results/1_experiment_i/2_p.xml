<p class="p">Compared to Grade 1 and 2, Grade 3 oocytes formed a smaller proportion of morula + blastocyst after IVC but the difference among the groups was not statistically significant (
 <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, Grade 3 oocytes in all the groups could develop to the blastocyst stage. Notably, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the OM + BSA/FBS group showed the highest proportion of blastocyst formation and the proportion was significantly higher than for the OM + BSA group (
