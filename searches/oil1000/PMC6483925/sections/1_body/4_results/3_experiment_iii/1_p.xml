<p class="p">We evaluated the parthenogenesis rates of Grade 1 and 2 and Grade 3 oocytes in OM + BSA/FBS. The proportions of parthenotes in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and in Grade 3 oocytes were 3.3 and 7.9%, respectively. Only one oocyte in both Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and Grade 3 oocytes developed to the 8-cell stage; no oocyte developed to the morula or blastocyst stage.</p>
