<p class="p">We also investigated morula + blastocyst and blastocyst formation rates as well as blastocyst cell number using Grade 1 and 2 oocytes and Grade 3 oocytes cultured in the OM + BSA/FBS. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, we found that the morula + blastocyst formation rate was significantly higher in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes than in Grade 3 oocytes (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=0.069) toward blastocyst formation in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes compared to Grade 3 oocytes. The blastocyst cell number was also significantly higher in Grade 1 and 2 oocytes than in Grade 3 oocytes (
