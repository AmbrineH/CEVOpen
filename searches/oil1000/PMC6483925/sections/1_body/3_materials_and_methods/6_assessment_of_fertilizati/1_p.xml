<p class="p">After 18 hr of IVF, oocytes were fixed and stained for assessment of the fertilization status. Briefly, the oocytes without cumulous cells were washed twice in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and then permeabilized and fixed in DPBS supplemented with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Merck) at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then placed in DPBS containing 0.3% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed oocytes were transferred in small drops consisting of DPBS supplemented with 90% (v/v) glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) and 10
