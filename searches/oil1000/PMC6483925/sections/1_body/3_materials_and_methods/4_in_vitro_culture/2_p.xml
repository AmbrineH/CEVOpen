<p class="p">Five types of IVCs were set as described in 
 <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The composition of the media used in this study is provided in Supplementary Table S1. In the OM + BSA group, for both the early (for 2 days) and late (for 5 days) cultures, the oocytes were incubated using Only-One Medium (Nippon Medical &amp; Chemical Instruments Co., Ltd.) supplemented with BSA (0.3%). During the OM + BSA culture, half of the medium was replaced with identical fresh medium on days 2, 4, and 6 of IVC. In the OM + BSA/FBS group, the oocytes were incubated in the Only-One Medium with BSA during the early culture, and subsequently in the Only-One Medium with FBS (5%) during the late culture. For the EB + BSA culture, the oocytes were incubated using Early Culture Medium (Nippon Medical &amp; Chemical Instruments) with BSA in the early culture, followed by Blastocyst Medium (Nippon Medical &amp; Chemical Instruments) with BSA in the late culture. Similarly, in the EB + BSA/FBS group, Early Culture Medium with BSA and Blastocyst Medium with FBS were used in the early and late cultures, respectively. In the late culture, half of the medium was renewed on days 4 and 6.
