<p class="p">Cat ovaries and testes with epididymis were collected from a local veterinary clinic following routine ovariohysterectomy and castration. The cats were anesthetized using a combination of xylazine and ketamine before the surgical procedures. The animals were neither operated on nor killed for this study. The use of tissues was approved by the committee of the local veterinary clinic. All the cats were privately owned and the ownersâ€™ consent was obtained before sample collection.</p>
