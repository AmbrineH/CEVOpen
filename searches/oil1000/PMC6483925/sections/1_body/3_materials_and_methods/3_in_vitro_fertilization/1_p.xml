 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) was performed using cryopreserved epididymal cat sperm. Testes with epididymis were collected from adult male cats following castration at a local veterinary clinic. The tissues were immediately transported to the laboratory in physiological saline (0.85% [w/v] NaCl) at 37°C. Approximately 2 hr after excision, the epididymis was separated from the testes and sliced repeatedly with a scalpel. The spermatozoa were released into a 35-mm Petri dish containing 1 m
