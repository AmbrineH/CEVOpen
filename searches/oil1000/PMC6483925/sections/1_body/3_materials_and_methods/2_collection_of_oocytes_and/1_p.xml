<p class="p">Cat ovaries were collected throughout the year from 117 pubertal queens at a veterinary clinic; the estrous stage of the queen was not considered. The samples were randomly selected several times in each experiment, and the replicate numbers are shown in

 <xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. The ovaries were immediately transported to the laboratory in physiological saline (0.85% [w/v] NaCl) at 37°C. The ovaries were cut into small pieces with scissors and stored in TCM 199 (Earle’s salts) buffered with 25 mM Hepes buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were separated from the ovarian follicle with a 30-gauge needle. The collected COCs were washed twice in
