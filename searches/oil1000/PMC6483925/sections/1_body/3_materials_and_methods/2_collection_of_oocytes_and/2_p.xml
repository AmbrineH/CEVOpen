<p class="p">The oocytes were classified into Grades 1, 2, and 3 according to the method of Wood and Wildt [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Grade 1 oocytes had homogenous dark cytoplasm surrounded by several layers of compacted cumulus. Grade 2 oocytes also had homogenous dark cytoplasm, but fewer than five layers of supporting cumulus oophorus cells. Grade 3 oocytes lacked uniformity and had an almost full complement of the corona radiata and 1–2 layers of cumulus oophorus cells that were less tightly compacted than in the higher grades. In addition, the oocyte diameter of Grade 1, 2, and 3 oocytes was also recorded according to the procedures described by Otoi
