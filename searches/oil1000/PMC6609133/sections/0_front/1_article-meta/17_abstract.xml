 <p class="p">Leishmaniasis is a disease that affects millions of people and it is an important public health problem. The drugs currently used for the treatment of leishmaniasis present undesirable side effects and low efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Melampodium divaricatum</italic> (MD-EO) and 
  <italic class="italic">Casearia sylvestris</italic> (CS-EO) essential oils (EO) against promastigote and amastigote forms of 
  <italic class="italic">Leishmania amazonensis</italic>. Sesquiterpenes 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene (56.0%), germacrene D (12.7%) and bicyclogermacrene (9.2%) were identified as the main components of MD-EO
  <italic class="italic">,</italic> whereas 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene (22.2%), germacrene D (19.6%) and bicyclogermacrene (12.2%) were the main constituents of CS-EO. CS-EO and 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene were active against promastigote forms of 
  <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 24.2, 29.8 and 49.9 µg/mL, respectively). However, MD-EO, CS-EO and 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene were more active against amastigote forms, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 10.7, 14.0, and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene presented lower cytotoxicity against macrophages J774-A1 (CC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 62.1 µg/mL) than the EO. The EOs and 
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene should be further studied for the development of new antileishmanial drugs.
