 </sup>. Many species of these families, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Melampodium divaricatum</italic> (Rich. ex Rich.) DC. (Asteraceae) and 
 <italic class="italic">Casearia sylvestris</italic> Swartz (Salicaceae) are aromatic and their essential oils have a large chemical complexity. 
 <italic class="italic">M. divaricatum,</italic> popularly known as ‘falsa-calêndula’, ‘flor-amarela’ or ‘flor-de-ouro’, occurs in Northeastern Brazil and is used in folk medicine as wound healing, diaphoretic and diuretic. The essential oil from the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. divaricatum</italic> showed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>
