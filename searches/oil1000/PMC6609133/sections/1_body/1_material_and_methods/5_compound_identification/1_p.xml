<p class="p">Compounds were identified on the basis of their retention indices relative to a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>â€“C
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>). To this end, an Rtx-5MS capillary column was employed under the same operating conditions as in the case of GC-FID. The retention index (RI) of each constituent was determined as described previously

  <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. The chemical structures were computer-matched with the Wiley7, NIST08, and FFNSC1.2 spectral libraries of the GC-MS data system; their fragmentation patterns were compared with the literature data
