 </sup> cells/mL) were cultured on a 24-well plate in Warren’s medium supplemented with 10% of inactivated FBS in the presence or absence of different essential oils concentrations (1-100 µg/mL). Amphotericin B was used as positive control (0.01-10 µg/mL). After 72 h at 28 °C, cell growth was estimated using the colorimetric cell viability XTT assay (2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the results expressed as log number cells/mL and as the percentage of growth inhibition concentration that inhibited cell growth in 50% (IC
