Afterwards, non-interiorized parasites were removed and the infected culture was treated with different concentrations of essential oils (1 to 20 μg/mL) at 34 °C. Amphotericin B was used as a positive control (0.1-10 μg/mL). After 48 h, the coverslips were washed, fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. By counting 200 cells under a light microscope (Olympus CX 31) the percentage of infected cells and number of intracellular amastigotes were estimated. The survival index (percentage of infected cells x number of amastigotes per cell) was calculated and IC
