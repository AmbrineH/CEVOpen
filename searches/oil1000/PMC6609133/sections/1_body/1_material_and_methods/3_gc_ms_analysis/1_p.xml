<p class="p">GC-MS analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu QP2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) system equipped with an AOC-20i auto sampler. The column consisted of Rtx5MS (Restek Co., Bellefonte, PA, USA) fused-silica capillary (length = 30 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm, and film thickness = 0.25 µm). The electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) mode at 70 eV was employed. Helium (99.99%) at a constant flow of 1.0 mL/min was the carrier gas. The injection volume was 0.1 µL (split ratio of 1:10). The injector and the ion source temperatures were set at 240 and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature program was the same as the one used for GC-FID. The mass spectra were registered with a scan interval of 0.5 s in the mass range of 40 to 600 Da. Essential oil was solubilized in hexane (chromatographic grade; Merck
