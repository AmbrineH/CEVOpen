<p class="p">The cytotoxicity and the antileishmanial activity were compared by using the selectivity index (SI) ratio (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for J774-A1 cells/IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> on intracellular amastigotes). Values greater than 1 are considered more selective for activity against parasites, and a value less than 1 is considered more selective for activity against cells. The SI ratio obtained for the CS-EO and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene was 2.9 and 5.8, in other words they are considered more selective to intracellular amastigotes than to mammalian host cells.
