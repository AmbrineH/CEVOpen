<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antileishmanial activity of the MD-EO, CS-EO and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The essential oils and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene were able to inhibit promastigote and amastigote growth. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of 24.2, 29.8 and 49.9 µg/mL against promastigote forms of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> were obtained for MD-EO
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> CS-EO and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene, respectively. Furthermore, MD-EO, CS-EO and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene were more active against the amastigote forms than the promastigote ones, displaying IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the 10.7, 14.0 and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. Amphotericin B had an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.06 µg/mL and 0.42 µg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigote and amastigote forms
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> respectively, after 72h of treatment. These are promising results, given that the essential oils and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-caryophyllene proved to be more active against amastigote forms, the proliferative form found inside mammalian host cells.
