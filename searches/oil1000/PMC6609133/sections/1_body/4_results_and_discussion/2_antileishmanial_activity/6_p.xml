<p class="p">Sesquiterpenes are considered potent skin permeation enhancers, and those with leishmanicidal activity would be very promising candidates for integration in nanocarriers to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis. A mechanism of action based on the 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> plasma membrane disrupture is consistent with the reported broad spectrum of sesquiterpene activity against protozoa. It has been shown that the lipophilic components of essential oils may affect layers of polysaccharides, fatty acids, and phospholipids in plasma membranes of Leishmania spp. promastigotes. This then leads to cell lysis and release of macromolecules
