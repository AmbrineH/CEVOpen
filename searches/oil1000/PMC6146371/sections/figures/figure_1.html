 <p> Flowchart of the study. Carbohydrates from beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysates were used to produce fatty acids in a yeast bioprocess, to form the solvent system and as substrate for the enzymatic reaction to produce fatty acid sugar esters (a.k.a glycolipids). Analytical methods are indicated at each work package. </p>
