  <p class="p">Thin layer chromatography of synthesis products from the enzymatic reaction of microbial fatty acid methyl esters and beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate sugars catalyzed by iCalB in a DES reaction system. The crude synthesis extract, the purified and unified sample 1 and 2 were applied; sample 3, as middle fraction of sample 2, was not spotted and direct analyzed by NMR. After the run, the plate was dyed with anise aldehyde solution. Spots with RF 0 represents glucose (dark gray) and xylose (yellow) as leftovers from the DES. The light gray-yellowish spots between RF 0.05 and 0.42 indicate the formation of various fatty acid glucose- and xylose-esters. The high of the spots depends on the sugar, fatty acid chain length and saturation state. The two dark purple spots (RF 0.75 and 0.92) represents fatty acid methyl esters which were not consumed during the synthesis reaction.</p>
