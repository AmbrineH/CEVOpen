 <p> Lipase catalyzed transesterification reaction in the DES with sugar (e.g., glucose) and a methylated fatty acid ester produced from SCO (methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate and methyl linoleate). The reaction leads to a sugar ester and methanol as side product. Methanol can enter the gas phase and push the reaction forwards or inhibit the enzyme. </p>
