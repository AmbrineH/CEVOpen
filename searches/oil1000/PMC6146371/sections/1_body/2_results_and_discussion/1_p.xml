<p class="p">For the sustainable production of fatty acid sugar ester biosurfactants monosaccharides originated from enzymatically hydrolyzed cellulose fiber fraction and fatty acid methyl esters derived from microbially produced triacylglycerols (single cell oil) are esterified. In a first step, the production of single cell oil based on cellulose fiber fraction and their transesterification to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) is reported (3.1). For the enzymatic esterification the DES reaction system consisting of cellulose fiber monosaccharides and choline chloride was prepared and characterized (3.2). Besides as part of the solvent, these monosaccharides act also as substrate for the enzymatic biosurfactant production and are linked to the added FAMEs by iCalB lipase. The successful formation of sugar esters were qualitatively proven by TLC (3.3), mass analysis (3.4) and NMR (3.5). The flowchart of this study is given in Figure
