<p class="p">The viscosity of sugar-based DES is very high and depends on the sugar used, the molar ratio, the water content and the temperature. A similar DES to the one used here, CC:Glu in a molar ratio of 1:1, had a viscosity of 34,400 mPa
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>s at 50°C (Maugeri and Domínguez de María, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The DES is this study consisting of one part CC and one part sugar (glucose and xylose) is less viscous with 2.540 mPa
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>s. A reason could be the water content of 5.4%, which will reduce the viscosity of a DES (Shah and Mjalli, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Further, a nearly 10 times higher viscosity of 23.340 mPa
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>s was determined at 25°C, which also indicates the highly temperature depending viscosity of DES (Maugeri and Domínguez de María, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Stefanovic et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The relative low viscosity of the DES may help to increase the mass transfer, which can lead to higher enzymatic reaction yields.
