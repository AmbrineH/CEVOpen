<p class="p">To perform a successful biotransformation and for a later optimization of the process, parameters of the DES were identified. In a previous work using the same DES, a pH of 7.5 and water content of 5.4% were already determined (Siebenhaller et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In addition to these data, a water activity of 0.101 was measured. The water molecules did not occur in a free form; they are part of the hydrogen bond network of the DES system. Therefore, the water should not be available to perform the hydrolysis of formed sugar ester. To a certain degree, the presence of water molecules may help to maintain the enzymesâ€˜ essential hydrate shell or have other effects on the system like lowering the viscosity. This positive effect to enzymatic reactions was already reported by other groups(Durand et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Guajardo et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
