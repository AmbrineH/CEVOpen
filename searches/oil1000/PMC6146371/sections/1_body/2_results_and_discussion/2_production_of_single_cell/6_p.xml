<p class="p">Furthermore, yield coefficients for biomass (Y
 <sub class="sub">x/s</sub>) and lipid production (Y
 <sub class="sub">p/s</sub>) were calculated in the presented study to 0.21 g dry biomass per g carbon source and 0.10 g lipid per g carbon source. In comparison, Dillschneider et al. (

 <sub class="sub">X/S</sub> of 0.30 and a slightly higher Y
 <sub class="sub">P/S</sub> of 0.13 using glucose as sole carbon source, i.e., pure glucose can be converted more efficiently to biomass and lipids as the carbohydrates from fiber hydrolysate which also supports our hypothesis that some energy is needed for detoxification of the fiber hydrolysate Although the lipid content is comparable of pure glucose and fiber hydrolysate cultivation, the much higher biomass concentration in the pure glucose cultivation results in much higher total lipid amount (34.5 g produced lipid with pure glucose vs. 21.5 g produced lipid with fiber hydrolysate). All relevant data of the presented cultivation with cellulose fiber hydrolysate are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and compared to the study of Dillschneider et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In summary, it was shown that cellulose fiber hydrolysate from organosolv process can be used as a suitable glucose alternative for the lipid production with
