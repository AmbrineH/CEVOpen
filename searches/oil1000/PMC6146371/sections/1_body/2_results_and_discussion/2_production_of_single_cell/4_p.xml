<p class="p">The successful production of single cell oil with 
 <italic class="italic">C. curvatus</italic> based on beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate is one of the major outcomes of this study and was shown for the first time. The used fiber hydrolysate consists of a carbohydrate mixture with glucose (608.3 g/L), xylose (89.7 g/L) and cellobiose (30.8 g/L) as the major components. Glucose is likely the most preferred carbon source of 
 <italic class="italic">C. curvatus</italic>, however, xylose and cellobiose did not accumulate in culture medium and were completely consumed before the next feeding. The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. curvatus</italic> to consume xylose and cellobiose as well as a mixture of these two carbon sources with glucose has already been demonstrated by Yu et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). They demonstrated that cellobiose and xylose can be consumed simultaneously with similar rates, but their consumption is inhibited in the presence of glucose. In a mixture of all three sugars (in pure form) the composition of the mixture had only little impact on the total sugar consumption rate. However, the consumption rate of glucose was considerably higher than the consumption rates of both other sugars. In the presence of a low glucose concentration, i.e., 10 g/L and lower, consumption of xylose and cellobiose seemed to be not affected (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Due to the sampling interval in our study, the exact threshold concentration of glucose cannot be confirmed. However, in preliminary studies in shake flasks it was observed, that xylose accumulated in the medium because glucose was not exhausted before feeding (results not shown). In the study of Yu et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) the composition of the carbon source did not significantly affect lipid content and composition. Lipid content ranged in all approaches from 38.7 to 40.3% lipid per dry biomass with oleic acid being the main fatty acid (41.3â€“44.8%) which resembles our results very closely.
