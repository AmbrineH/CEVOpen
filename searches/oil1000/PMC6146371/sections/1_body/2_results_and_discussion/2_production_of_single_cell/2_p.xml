<p class="p">Cellulose fiber hydrolysate proved to be a very suitable carbon source for both biomass and lipid production. Biomass content increased from 0.4 g/L dry biomass to ~45 g/L dry biomass after 72 h of cultivation. After each addition of carbohydrates, a steep increase of biomass was observed. During carbon source consumption, dissolved oxygen concentration dropped quickly (data not shown) until the carbon source was depleted. Since carbon source was limited between feeding cycles, biomass concentration stagnated or was slightly reduced due to sampling and the dilution of culture broth because of feeding. After feeding at 79 h, biomass dropped considerably and did not increase again. Probably due to the high lipid content of the cells at that time, the cell pellet was very soft and cells started to float. Therefore, solid-liquid separation by centrifugation was not efficient and dry biomass concentration might be higher than given in Figure
