<p class="p">Accumulation of single cell oil started after nitrogen depletion at ~24 h of cultivation time. Lipid content increased from ~12% (w/w) to ~48% (w/w) of dry biomass after 96 h showing the steepest increase between 30 and 60 h of cultivation time. The final fatty acid profile analyzed via GC revealed a composition of 44.6% oleic acid (C18:1), 35.1% palmitic acid (C16:0), 12.6% stearic acid (C18:0) and 6.2% linoleic acid (C18:2). Myristic acid (C14:0) has been detected only in trace amounts (0.77%); all other fatty acids add up to 0.74%. In total, 256.5 g of carbohydrates have been consumed during the cultivation.</p>
