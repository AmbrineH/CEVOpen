<p class="p">Although production of single cell oil is generally possible with all kinds of sugars and various other carbon sources, yields and productivity are usually best when using pure glucose. Therefore, the cultivation with glucose is also used as benchmark for this study. Compared to cultivations with pure glucose as described by Dillschneider et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), the results of the present study concerning lipid content (~48% in this study vs. 45.3% (w/w)) is very similar. However, concerning the lipid composition (oleic acid: 44.6% in this study vs. 48.8%; linoleic acid: 6.2 in this study vs. 8.6%; palmitic acid: 35.1% in this study vs. 18.5% and stearic acid 12.6% in this study vs. 17.7%), a higher content of palmitic acid was produced at the expense of oleic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid and lignoceric acid, which was not detected in the presented study. The prominent shift in the fatty acid profile toward C16:0 compounds might be explained due to the use of carbohydrate mixtures in our study compared to pure glucose in the study of Dillschneider et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, this is not supported by the study of Yu et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) as they also used different carbohydrate mixtures and did only observe a very slight shift in fatty acid profile. Another possible reason might be the presence of by-products in the cellulose fiber fraction due to the organosolv pretreatment, e.g., furfural or HMF. These compounds can be detoxified by the cells, but the mechanisms require the coenzymes NADH or NADPH (JÃ¶nsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). For SCO production, high amounts of NADPH are needed, for each addition of a C2 unit 2 NADPH molecules have to be spent (Ratledge, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Therefore, it might be possible, that detoxification of by-products might influence the fatty acid composition of SCO toward shorter fatty acid chain lengths.
