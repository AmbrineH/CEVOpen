<p class="p">In both purified fractions, only trace amounts of FAMEs are visible at the running front. Sample 2 contains the main product, a clear gray colored spot portending to a glucose-ester with a slight yellow aura, indicating for a xylose-ester. The comparison of the height of these spots to known sugar esters led to the assumption that they are sugar-monoesters (Siebenhaller et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The analysis of sample 1 showed a gray-yellow striped pattern between RF 0.17 and 0.25. The there-in contained products have either a much longer hydrophobic carbonyl chain, which is unlikely with the FAME-composition applied in our study, or two or more fatty acids are bound to the polar sugar.
