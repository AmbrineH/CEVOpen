<p class="p">For the production of sugar ester, a DES consisting of choline chloride and purified cellulose hydrolysate fraction was prepared and produced FAMEs from SCO and iCalB were added for the synthesis of sugar esters. As a fast analysis of the crude fatty acid sugar ester extract, TLC was performed to detect expected sugar esters (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Synthesis products in this extract showed various spots (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). The spot with the retention factor (RF) 0 is a mixture of glucose (dark gray) and xylose (yellow) of the DES, verified by a standard of the pure sugars (data not shown). The light gray-yellowish spots between RF 0.05 and 0.42 indicate the formation of different glucose- and xylose-esters. The height of each spot depends on the chain length and saturation state of the sugar esters carbonyl chain. In this area, a clear spot with a RF 0.08 seems to be the main product of the enzymatic reaction. Above, two dark purple spots with RF 0.75 and 0.92 are visible. These spots are fatty acid methyl esters which were not consumed during the synthesis reaction.
