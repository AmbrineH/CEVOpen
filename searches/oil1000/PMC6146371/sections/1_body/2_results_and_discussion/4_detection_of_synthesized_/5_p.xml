<p class="p">To overcome that, the reaction efficiency might be improved by increasing the temperature to &gt;65Â°C, taking care that the enzyme remains still active. By using other fatty acids like vinyl esters, acetaldehyde will be formed as side product, which evaporates much easier at lower temperatures (Bornscheuer and Yamane, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). However, the vinylation reaction is much more complicated than the methylation of fatty acids. Another method of optimization would be to carry out the process at reduced pressure to remove side products immediately and shift the reaction equilibrium (Ducret et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>).
