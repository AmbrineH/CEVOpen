<p class="p">The purified and fractionated sample 3 of an iCalB catalyzed synthesis reaction in a DES, based on lignocellulosic sugars, with FAMEs, was investigated with one and two-dimensional 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectra. Glucose was identified through one clear major carbohydrate system, starting from the anomeric protons of the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H COZY and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C HMBC spectra. Cross peaks between the two protons attached at the glucosesâ€˜ C6 at 4.23 and 4.35 ppm with the lipid carbonyl at 174.03 ppm in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C HMBC indicates, that glucose was acylated (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Due to some impurities and the used mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, it was not possible to clearly identify which FAME is connected to the glucose molecule.
