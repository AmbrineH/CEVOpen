<p class="p">The successful enzymatic synthesis of sugar esters were affirmed by three different mass analysis procedures. All these methods were necessary to identify clearly the sugar esters, as they have different strengths and weaknesses. First, with the TLC-MALDI-ToF technique it was possible to assign product spots of sample 1 and 2 to a detected 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> value. In the lane of sample 1, masses were detected in three areas. Surprisingly, in area 1 (A1: RF 0.59–0.67) and area 2 (A2: RF 0.72-.082) the same 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> values were determined (Supplement 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">2</xref>). Several 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> values of sodium adducts of glucose-di-esters with the following fatty acid pairs were identified: 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 680.04 (myristic acid/stearic acid or more likely palmitic acid/palmitic acid), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 706.47 (palmitic acid/oleic acid), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 708.09 (palmitic acid/stearic acid), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 727.66 (linoleic acid/linoleic acid) and 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 734.10 (stearic acid/oleic acid). Throughout the entire area 3 (A3: RF 0.86–0.88), only 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 686.0 was detected, which corresponds to a protonated glucose, acylated with palmitic acid and stearic acid. Due to the high number of potentially formed sugar-di-esters, more possible combinations are feasible. So it is possible, that 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 680.04 corresponds to a protonated xylose, which is linked to 2 oleic acids, or to stearic acid/linoleic acid.
