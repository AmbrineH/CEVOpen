<p class="p">In addition, a MALDI-ToF MS of sample 1 was accomplished to verify the occurrence of sugar-di- or poly-ester with higher masses, which couldn't be detected via ESI-Q-ToF MS and to overcome possible problems of the TLC-silica. There, masses corresponding to synthesized sugar-di-esters were detected, too. Sodium adducts with
