<p class="p">By applying sample 2 onto the silica plate and subsequent analysis, two mass areas (a1; RF 0.33–0.45 and a2: RF 0.84–0.89) were found. In a1, sodium adducts of the more polar reaction products glucose palmitate (

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 441.66) glucose oleate (

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 467.71) and glucose stearate (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 469.74) were detected. a2 indicates the presence of more hydrophobic glucose-di-esters, which was expected due to the TLC separation. One of these di-ester corresponds to a protonated glucose with palmitic acid and stearic acid (m/z 686.04), the other di-ester matched to the sodium adduct of a glucose, linked to 2 linoleic acids (
