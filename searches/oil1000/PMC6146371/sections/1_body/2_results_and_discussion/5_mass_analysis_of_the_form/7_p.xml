<p class="p">Beside the mentioned products, other sugar-mono- and di-esters might be formed. Since it is shown in literature, it cannot be excluded that sugar-poly-ester were also synthesized in this reaction system, even if none were detected (Siebenhaller et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Since many products or their adducts have the same mass, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between them. It can only be stated that, based on the FAME-mixture used and the amount of fatty acids contained therein, some sugar esters will be probably less common than others. Sugar esters with the four main fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) were detected; therefore, the used FAME-Mix is a suitable substrate for this reaction.
