<p class="p">MALDI-ToF MS experiments were carried out on a 4800 MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Foster City, CA) in reflector positive ion mode (focus mass 500 Da). Each mass spectrum was an average of 1.000 laser shots over the entire spot. Mass calibration was performed using a calibration solution (Sigma-Aldrich) spotted nearby the samples.</p>
