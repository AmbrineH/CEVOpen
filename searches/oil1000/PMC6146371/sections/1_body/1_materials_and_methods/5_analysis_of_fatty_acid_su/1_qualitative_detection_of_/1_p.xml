<p class="p">As a fast qualitative detection method of the formed sugar esters, 10 μL extracts were spotted onto a 60 Å silica gel TLC plate (Alugram Xtra SIL G, Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Düren, Germany). Compounds were separated using a mobile phase consisting of chloroform: methanol (70: 5, by vol.). Visualization was accomplished by dipping the TLC plate into an anise aldehyde solution (anise aldehyde: sulfuric acid: acetic acid 0.5: 1: 100, by vol.) with subsequent heating under a 200°C air flow for 5 min.</p>
