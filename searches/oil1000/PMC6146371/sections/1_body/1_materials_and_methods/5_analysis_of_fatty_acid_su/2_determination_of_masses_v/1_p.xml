<p class="p">With the TLC-MALDI-ToF technique it is possible to determine the mass of the product spots on a TLC plate. Two identical replicates of a HPTLC plate (5 × 7.5 cm HPTLC plate, silica gel 60, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) were thus prepared. Ten to fifteen microliter of the purified and concentrated sample 1 and sample 2 from flash chromatography were sprayed as 6 mm horizontal bands on the TLC plate using an automatic sample application device (ATS4, CAMAG, Switzerland) and were separated with the solvent system chloroform: methanol (70: 10, by vol.). One plate was dyed with an anise aldehyde solution. On the second plate, a drop of an external polymer standard (Polypropylenglycol M
 <sub class="sub">N</sub> 725 (Sigma-Aldrich); 1:100 with methanol) was placed in a corner, afterwards the plate was dipped for 2 s in a matrix solution (200 g/L dihydroxybenzoic acid in 90% acetonitrile, 1.15 g/L diammonium phosphate, 0.2 g/L octyl β-D-glucopyranoside, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Subsequently, the plate was fixed onto the MTP TLC Adapter for a Bruker Ultraflex II ToF/ToF (Bruker AG, Rheinstetten, Germany). The dyed plate served as a template providing a coordinate system for the laser pulses (25 kV ion source, offset 63%, range 15%, positive mode). Every 0.6 mm of the vertical coordinate system, measurements were made at seven juxtaposed positions. The measured dataset was analyzed by the instrument software flexControl 3.0.
