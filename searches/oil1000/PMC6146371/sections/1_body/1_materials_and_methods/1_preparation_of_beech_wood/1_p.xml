<p class="p">Chopped beech wood was incubated at temperatures &gt;140°C in aqueous ethanol solution with a small amount of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> as catalyst to obtain different fractions (acid-catalyzed organosolv process). After washing, the fiber fraction, mainly containing the cellulose and a part of hemicellulose, was directly subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the fiber was performed for 24 h at a temperature of 50°C with a 10% (w/v) suspension. For stirrer description see Ludwig et al. (Ludwig et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). pH of the suspension was adjusted to pH 4.8 during hydrolysis using a concentrated NaOH solution. The hydrolysis reaction started by adding 60 mg Cellic® CTec3 and 2.5 mg Cellic® HTec3 per g cellulose. Solid material was removed afterwards applying an extruder press. The successive concentration of the filtrate resulted in the following mono- and disaccharide concentrations: 30.8 g/L cellobiose, 89.7 g/L xylose and 608.3 g/L glucose quantified via chromatographic analysis (see Sluiter et al.,
