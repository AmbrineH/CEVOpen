<p class="p">The obtained cellulose hydrolysate was directly used as carbon source for SCO production. For the preparation of DES, however, it had to be further purified and dried: The cellulose hydrolysate was diluted in ddH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1:2 w/v) and 1 g activated carbon per 5 mL solution was added. After rigorous shaking for 1 min, the activated carbon mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Succeeding purification, activated carbon was separated by a two-step filtration process (pore size 4–7 and 0.22 μm). Afterwards, the solution was spray dried in a werco® SD-20 spray dryer (input temperature 182°C, output temperature 74–81°C; Hans G. Werner Industrietechnik, Reutlingen, Germany) resulting in a final water content of 8%, determined by Karl Fischer titration (TitroLine® 7500 KF trace, SI Analytics, Mainz, Germany). Mono- and disaccharide concentrations were analyzed by HPLC (see section Analysis of Bioreactor Samples).
