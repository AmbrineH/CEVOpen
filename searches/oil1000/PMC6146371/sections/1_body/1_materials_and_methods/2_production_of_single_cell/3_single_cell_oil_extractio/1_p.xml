<p class="p">The yeast biomass of each 20 mL sample and the complete biomass in the bioreactor at the end of the cultivation was collected by centrifugation (5 min, 4,600 × g), washed once in sterile saline and pelleted again by a second centrifugation. Supernatants were discarded and the resulting cell pellet was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Biomass was freeze-dried for at least 24 h, at −30°C and 0.37 mbar.</p>
