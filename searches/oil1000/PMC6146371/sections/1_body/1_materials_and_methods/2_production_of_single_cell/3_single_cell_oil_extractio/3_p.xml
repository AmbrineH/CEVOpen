<p class="p">For the production of sugar esters, 1 g of freeze-dried biomass was transesterified in the presence of 25 mL n-hexane and 25 mL 15% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in methanol for 5 h at 90°C in an oil-bath under constant stirring (350 rpm). After cooling on ice, 5 mL demineralized water was added. The upper organic phase was collected and solvent in this phase was evaporated at 40°C and 2,000 rpm in a speed vac. The produced fatty acid methyl esters were used as substrate for sugar ester synthesis.
