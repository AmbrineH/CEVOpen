<p class="p">For analytical purposes and fatty acid sugar esters synthesis, fatty acid methyl esters were formed by transesterification from single cell oil as described below. For lipid analysis, 20 mg of freeze-dried biomass was incubated for 2 h at 100°C in a thermoshaker at 1,400 rpm in the presence of 1.5 mL n-hexane, 2 mL 15% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in methanol and 0.5 mL of an internal standard (2 mg/mL methyl benzoate). After cooling on ice, 1 mL demineralized water was added. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2,500 rpm. 1 μL of the upper phase, containing the fatty acid methyl esters extract, was analyzed via gas chromatography.
