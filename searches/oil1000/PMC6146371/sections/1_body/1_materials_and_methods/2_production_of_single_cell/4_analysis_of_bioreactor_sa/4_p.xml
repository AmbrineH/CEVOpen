<p class="p">Lipid content and composition were determined by analyzing the fatty acid methyl esters, obtained by transesterification, via GC (Agilent Technologies, 6890 N Network GC-System). The instrument was equipped with a DB Wax column (l: 30 m; d: 0.25 mm, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Böblingen, Germany), and a flame ionization detector. The working pressure was 1.083 bar and initial temperature 40°C. The column temperature was increased from 40° to 250°C with a rate of 8°C/min. The temperature was maintained at 250°C for 20 min before cooling down to 40°C. Fatty acids were identified and the total fatty acid content was determined with the standard FAME Mix RM-3 (Supelco).</p>
