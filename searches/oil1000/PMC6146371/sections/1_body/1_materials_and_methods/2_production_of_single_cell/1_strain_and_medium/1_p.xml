Unpurified cellulose fiber hydrolysate was used as carbon source. The hydrolysate was diluted with distilled water to obtain a stock solution with a concentration of 500 g/L carbohydrates. The initial sugar concentration in the culture medium was 50 g/L. Stock solution was fed daily to keep sugar concentration constant between 50 and 90 g/L during the whole cultivation.
