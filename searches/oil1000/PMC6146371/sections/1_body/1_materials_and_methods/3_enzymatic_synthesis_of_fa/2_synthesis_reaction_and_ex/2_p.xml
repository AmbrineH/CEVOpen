<p class="p">To stop the reaction, 2 mL of warm water was added and the mixture was shaken until full dissolution of the DES. Organic phase extraction with the same volume of ethyl acetate resulted in the accumulation of sugar esters after 45 s of mixing. The sugar ester containing organic phase was removed for further experiments. To enhance extraction efficiency, the addition of ethyl acetate with subsequent mixing can be repeated up to five times.</p>
