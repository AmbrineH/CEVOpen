<p class="p">Sugar esters were synthesized in 5 mL Eppendorf cups by adding 100 mg of iCalB (Lipase acrylic resin from 
 <italic class="italic">C. antarctica</italic>, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) to 2.5 mL of DES. To start the reaction, 175 μL of the prepared fatty acid methyl esters were added and the reaction was performed at 50°C for 70 h in a rotator with vortex mixer (neoLab, Heidelberg, Germany) in program U2 at 50 rpm. As controls, reactions without enzyme or without fatty acids were performed.
