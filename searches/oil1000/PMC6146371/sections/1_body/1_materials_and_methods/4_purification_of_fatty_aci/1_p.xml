<p class="p">Before further analysis via mass spectrometry and NMR, eight extracts from identical synthesis reactions were unified and purified via flash chromatography (Reveleris Prep, Büchi Labortechnik GmbH, Germany). The extract was mixed with 2 g of silica (40 μm pore size) and liquid was subsequently evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The silica including the bound components (products and excess of sugar and FAMEs) were packed in an empty column. For separation, a Reveleris HP Silica 4 g column and a flow rate of 15 mL/min was used. As method, the dry sample function was selected and a gradient of chloroform and methanol was used as follows: 0–7% methanol in 1 min, holding the gradient for 7 min, followed by an increase to 15% methanol in 2 min and holding it for 1 min with subsequent increase to 20% in 1 min. To eluate sugars and other polar components, the gradient was set to 100% methanol in 1 min holding it for 4 min. Peaks were observed by an evaporative light scattering detector (Threshold: 30 mV, Sensitivity: low) and fractions collected. Unprocessed fractions were analyzed via TLC and divided into three samples (1 = fraction 6–9, 2 = fraction 14+15+17, 3 = fraction 16). For ESI-Q-ToF MS, MALDI-ToF MS and NMR analysis the samples were evaporated.</p>
