<p class="p">The aim of the presented concept was to produce fatty acid sugar esters from completely renewable resources using eco-friendly enzymatic catalysis. The choice of DES as a reaction medium offers a green alternative and therefore characteristics of the solvent were determined. In this system, the synthesis of sugar esters can be carried out using the immobilized 
 <italic class="italic">Candida antarctica</italic> lipase B (iCalB). The successful formation was proven by NMR and MALDI-ToF analysis. This set-up, together with sugars and fatty acids based on beech wood cellulose fiber hydrolysate, enables the production of surfactants of 100% renewable origin.
