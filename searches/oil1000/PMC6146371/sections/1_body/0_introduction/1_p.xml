<p class="p">With an estimated production of 120–140 billion tons per year, lignocellulose constitutes the most abundant organic material in the world. Lignocellulose is the main component of woody and grass-like biomass and consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, containing up to 75% of carbohydrates and therefore, it is excellently suited as a substrate for a biorefinery (Herrera,

They are a valuable substrate for both biotechnological and (bio-)chemical processes but require previous fractionation. By applying the physico-chemical organosolv process the three main components from lignocellulose can be separated using an aqueous-organic solvent system under high pressure and temperature. The cellulose fiber fraction can be subsequently saccharified enzymatically yielding a glucose-rich hydrolysate, which is highly suitable as a microbial carbon source, as a building block or as a pre-cursor for other (fine-)chemicals (Nigam,
