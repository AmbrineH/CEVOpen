<p class="p">The presented study demonstrates the possibility to use sustainable lignocellulosic biomass as sole substrate for the production of high valuable fatty acid sugar esters. It was shown, that cellulose fiber hydrolysate from organosolv process is a suitable substrate for SCO production with 
 <italic class="italic">C. curvatus</italic> being completely comparable to pure sugars regarding biomass and lipid content. Subsequently, a DES reaction system based on sugars of the hydrolysate was established, acting simultaneously as reaction media and together with the produced fatty acids as substrate for the enzymatic sugar ester synthesis. The successful formation of sugar esters were proven by NMR analysis. Further, several sugar (di-)esters like glucose palmitate or oleate and glucose di- linoleic acid were detected by various MS experiments. For a better understanding of the reaction media characteristics of the used DES were determined.
