<p id="p0190" class="p">Secondly, the 2nd film obtained in the printing process accounts for 30% of the impact in each category. This high percentage is due to the use of materials such as alcohol, inks and ethyl. Furthermore, in this process engines work to the lowest possible efficiency, resulting in higher energy consumption. As depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 2</xref>, the cutting and sealing process contributes the least, with a value close to 4%, since raw materials are not required in this stage, only the product in process. This machine is also the most efficient. Finally, the black pelletized represents 2,5%, higher than the general pelletized (2%), because the latter does not contain added substances such as inks.
