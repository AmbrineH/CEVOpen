<p id="p0010" class="p">The ozone layer is a band of natural gas called “ozone”. It is found between 9.3 and 18.6 miles (15–30 kilometers) above the Earth in what is known as the stratosphere, and it functions as a shield against harmful ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation emitted by the sun. At present there is a general concern that the ozone layer is being depleted by the release of pollutants contained in chemical products. The release of these contaminants upsets the delicate balance in the natural production and decomposition of ozone molecules by eliminating the molecules faster than they can be replenished
