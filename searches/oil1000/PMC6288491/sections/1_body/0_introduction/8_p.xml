<p id="p0040" class="p">The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the manufacture of plastic shopping bags for mass consumption in a supermarket chain and locate them in the category of ozone layer depletion. Depletion is evaluated in the “environmental impact” category “ozone layer depletion”. This evaluation is based on life cycle analysis methodology (LCA), which starts by defining the inputs and outputs of each stage of the process, using each of the production records of the company for the years 2014 and 2015. Mass and energy levels were determined to establish the production flows. Based on this information, the scope and objectives of this study were defined including the inventory analysis and the environmental impact assessment for the manufacturing process of plastic bags. The inventory analysis allowed for identifying, selecting and characterizing the environmental loads of production processes. Based on the aforementioned steps, it was determined which stages of the manufacturing process generate the greatest environmental impact.</p>
