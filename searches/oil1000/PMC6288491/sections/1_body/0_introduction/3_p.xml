<p id="p0015" class="p">The most detrimental compounds to the ozone layer are chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, halons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFC) and methyl bromide 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. The degree of damage caused by any one of these substances to the ozone layer depends on the chemical properties of the compound. Other factors that affect the ozone layer include climate change and greenhouse gasses such as methane and nitrous oxide.
