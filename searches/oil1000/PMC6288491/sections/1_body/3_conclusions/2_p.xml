<p id="p0200" class="p">Using Life Cycle Analysis methodology and Sima Pro 7.1, the potential environmental impact of the ozone layer depletion has been assessed and thus it has been determined which stages of the process contribute to the environmental impact of the categories selected in this study. Based on the interpretation of these results, it was possible to conclude that:
 <list list-type="simple" id="olist0010" class="list">
  <list-item id="o0010" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">1.</label>
   <p id="p0205" class="p">The extrusion process used to produce the 1
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> film depletes the ozone layer to the greatest degree since fossil fuels such as gas, oil, and oil-derived raw materials are commonly used in the production of LDPE and linear polyethylene.
   </p>

  <list-item id="o0015" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">2.</label>
   <p id="p0210" class="p">Printing is the second process that has a significant environmental impact on the ozone layer, because large quantities of some chemicals such as alcohol, acetate and inks are used. Furthermore, engines work to the lowest efficiency of the whole process resulting in higher energy consumption.</p>
