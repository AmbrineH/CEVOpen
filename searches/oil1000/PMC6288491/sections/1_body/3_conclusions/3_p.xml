<p id="p0215" class="p">During the literature review, it was found that most studies have looked at the environmental performance of plastic bags made with paper, biodegradable plastic, cotton and other plastics that are not of the same composition as those studied in this research. As such, comparison between those studies and this one is impossible. It is also difficult because the functional unit, the scale of the scope of the system, the production materials used etc. are all different. In addition, most of the other studies only set out to determine the GHG emissions.</p>
