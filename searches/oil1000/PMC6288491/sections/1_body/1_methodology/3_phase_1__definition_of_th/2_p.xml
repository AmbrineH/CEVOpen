<p id="p0050" class="p">As mentioned above, this research describes the comparative analysis of the ozone layer depletion due to a massive consumption of plastics bags in a chain of stores serving an area of one and a half million inhabitants. The unit of analysis is the production process of 14-inch plastic bags. Each of the production logs kept by the manufacturer during 2014 and 2015 were examined. The system boundaries covered printing, extrusion, sealing and recovery, and these were used to define door-to-door life cycle analysis encompassing the entry of raw materials up until arriving at a final product.</p>
