<p class="p">The data on volatile profile of
 <italic class="italic"> Artemisia annua </italic>growing wild, presented in this study, confirm the already observed for the essential oil, the relative percentages, however being different due to the different extractions and analytical protocols. Significant differences were found for GC pattern of headspace samples from that prepared by distillation. Application of nondestructive headspace method for extraction of the volatiles is considered to prevent a damage of the thermal-sensitive molecules, thus providing a better approach of the compounds primarily responsible for the characteristic odour of dry herb. Apparently, the content and composition of volatiles are greatly influenced by technique of isolation. The use of headspace proves to be crucial in order to provide reliable insight into
