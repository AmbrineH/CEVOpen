<p class="p">The essential oil composition of this medicinal plant, which exhibits a chemical variability, has been studied thoroughly and hundreds of components have been identified up to date [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The great diversity was found in the essential oil components of
 <italic class="italic"> A. annua</italic> with monoterpenes being principal constituents [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] that contribute to the characteristic fragrance of this medicinal species. The monoterpene fraction of the essential oil from
 <italic class="italic"> A. annua </italic>is composed of a diverse array of structures from the prosaic, regular monoterpenes such as 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, to the rearranged, such as fenchol and camphene hydrate, and to the irregular, such as artemisia alcohol, artemisia ketone, and santolina triene which give the plant a sweet scent. Depending on the variety, dominant compounds were artemisia ketone and camphor [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], camphor and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene and pinocarvone [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and artemisia ketone and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The exception is a chemotype with phenolic compounds thymol and carvacrol as the principal constituents [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and varieties with no artemisia ketone detected [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and with oxygenated sesquiterpenes as the major constituents [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>].
