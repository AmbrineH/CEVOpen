<p class="p">Hydrodistillation (HD) was applied as one of the simplest conventional ways to separate the essential oil from different parts of the plants. Steam distillation (SD) used in this study is similar and standard method for essential oils isolation. However, the main restrictions of HD as well as of SD are as long extraction times, the possibility of the decomposition, and/or loss of heat-sensitive compounds during the extraction. In contrast, headspace method is a very facile, sensitive, and solvent-free sampling and concentration technique for the determination of volatile compounds without destroying plant material. In addition, petroleum ether was chosen for isolation of various compounds from plant material soluble in nonpolar solvent which is easy to remove after extraction in Soxhlet apparatus.</p>
