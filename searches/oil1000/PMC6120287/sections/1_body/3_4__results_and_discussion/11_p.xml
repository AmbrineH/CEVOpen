Comparing our results on the plant volatile profile with previously published data, there are great differences in both qualitative and quantitative composition. The variability of chemical composition could be effected by many factors, such as genotype, geographic location, cultural practices, used parts of the plant, and mode of extraction of volatiles used, so the types of major volatile compounds in shoots differ from those detected in roots of cultivated
