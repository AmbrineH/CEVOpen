<p class="p">All heat-involving isolation procedures have been shown to differentiate the volatile fraction profile as analyzed by GC-MS. Although essential oils obtained by steam distillation and hydrodistillation showed prominent similarity in chemical composition, they still differ in quantitative composition, especially in their relative contents of the main constituents like camphor: 24.0% in sample B and 16.9% in sample C, respectively. Data on the essential oil composition of sample E, obtained by extraction with organic solvent followed by steam distillation, indicated the percentage concentration drop in terms of characteristic markers: artemisia ketone (16.5%) and camphor (20.0%) or absence of some compounds in the petroleum ether extract. The observed fact may be attributed to the effect of the heat applied; i.e., some of the compounds were degraded during distillation process or the concentration of compounds in the volatile fraction of the petroleum ether extract may be below the detection limit due to their loss during evaporation of the solvent.</p>
