<p class="p">The highest number of total identified constituents was 47 in the sample B, representing 96.1% of the essential oil. The lowest number of identified components (11) was in headspace sample D comprising 97.8% of the total components detected. When grouping the components into different terpenoid types, there were found eight monoterpenes hydrocarbons (MH), 17 oxygenated monoterpenes (MO), 11 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (SH), five oxygenated sesquiterpenes (SO), and one oxygenated diterpenes (DO). Most abundant compounds for all samples were MO, ranged from 42.6% (sample E) to 70.6% (sample A).</p>
