<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis on the polar column was carried out using Hewlett Packard GC-MS system (GC 5890 series II; MSD 5971A, Hewlett Packard, Vienna, Austria). The fused-silica HP-20 M polyethylene glycol column (50 m x 0.2 mm, 0.2

The program used was 4 min isothermal at 70°C, then was 4°C/min to 180°C, and was held 10 min isothermal. The injection port temperature was 250°C, and the detector temperature was 280°C. Ionization of the sample components was performed in the EI mode (70 eV). The linear retention indices for all compounds were determined by injection of the sample with a solution containing the homologous series of C
