<p class="p">The analysis of volatile compounds was performed using two GC-MS instruments and two columns of different polarity. First GC-MS analysis was carried out on the Perkin Elmer Mass, fitted with a fused-silica PE-5 (5% phenyl methyl siloxane) capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness), and coupled to a Turbo Mass Auto System XL. Column temperature was programmed from 55°C at 10°C/min to 140°C held 1 min isothermal and then 10°C/min to 245°C. Helium was used as carrier gas (1.1 mL/min). Other operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 240°C; detector temperature, 280°C; injection volume, 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L. Ionization of the sample components was performed in the EI mode, (70 eV), with scan range 20-555 amu, and scan time 1.60 s.
