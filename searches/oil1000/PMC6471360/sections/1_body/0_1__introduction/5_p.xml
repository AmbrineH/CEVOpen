<p class="p">In this study, a physical oil blend (PHY) and an interesterified oil (IO) were prepared from soybean oil (SBO) and PGO. Thus, PHY and IO would have similar total fatty acid compositions while having different TAG species. Emulsifications of four different oils (SBO, PGO, PHY, and IO) with bile salts were prepared, and the particle sizes and physical stabilities of lipid droplets were compared. Further, the effect of lipolysis on TAG molecules with different compositions was studied using a pH-stat digestion model. Meanwhile, a model that simulated small intestinal digestion was used along with HPLC analysis to evaluate quantitative changes in individual TAG species after lipolysis of oils in digestion fluids with bile extracts. </p>
