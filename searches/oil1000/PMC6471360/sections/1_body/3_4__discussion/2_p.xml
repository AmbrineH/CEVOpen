Nevertheless, we considered that a droplet size difference of only 0.04–0.05 μm would have a less significant effect on lipolysis than the aforementioned CLn-CLn-CLn content. In a previous study, the lipolysis rate with a difference in droplet size was reported. Although lipolysis of the fine emulsion was higher than that of the coarse emulsion, the droplet sizes were 0.7 μm for fine and 10 μm for coarse emulsion, resulting in a very large difference in the droplet size than our experiment [
