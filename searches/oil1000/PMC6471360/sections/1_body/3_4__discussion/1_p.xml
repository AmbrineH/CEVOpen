<p class="p">It is expected that the lipolysis rate of TAG molecules varies depending on the fatty acid (saturation and unsaturation, carbon number, double bond number, distribution of fatty acids, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. As seen in the pH model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a), the initial rate (mM/s) of IO was 0.124 mM/s, which is slightly faster than PHY (0.118 mM/s). Although the FFA release rate of IO at 10 min did not show a statistically significant difference compared with that of PHY, it was high with significant difference until the 5 min lipolysis. This may be attributable to the fat that CLn-CLn-CLn of PGO, which is not well lipolyzed, exists in IO as restructured TAG molecules, such as CLn-CLn-L after the interesterification reaction (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00678-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). PGO used in this study consisted of 67.8% CLn-CLn-CLn. Although fatty acid compositions of PHY and IO were similar to each other, PHY was mainly composed of CLn-CLn-CLn (24.8%), along with L-L-L and L-L-O, which originated in SBO. On the other hand, IO was consisted of at most 3.4% TAG molecules, possibly corresponding to CLn-CLn-CLn after enzymatic interesterification; this suggests that the restructured TAG molecules are synthesized due to this reaction [

 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. From the results, we suggested that the amount and the location of CLn on the TAG molecules affect the lipolysis rate. In particular, the TAG consisting of three molecules of CLn (i.e., CLn-CLn-CLn) is considered to be the most important factor for low lipolysis in this study. Indeed, the length of carbon chain and the position of double bonds of fatty acid (i.e., the degree to which double bond is close to carboxyl group, and conjugated/non-conjugated form), in addition to their positional distribution on the TAG molecules, affect the lipolysis rate. The following previous studies supported this suggestion: the emulsified lipid consisting of short chain fatty acids showed higher lipolysis than that of long chain fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; fatty acids with a double bond located close to the carboxyl group tended to show low lipolysis rates, partly due to a steric hindrance during the substrateâ€“enzyme complex formation [

 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]; conjugated linolenic acid showed a lower lipolysis rate than linoleic acid, and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> form of double bond would have a certain effect on lipolysis rate [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]; and, when the positional distribution of fatty acid on the TAG molecules was changed, different lipolysis rates were observed, in which the lipolysis rates of S-O-O and O-S-O (i.e., TAG molecules with different stearic acid position) were 0.63 and 0.56 mM/h, respectively [
