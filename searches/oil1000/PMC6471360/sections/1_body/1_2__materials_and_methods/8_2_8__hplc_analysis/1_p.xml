<p class="p">For HPLC analysis, lipolysis products in diethyl ether were transferred to a glass tube, and diethyl ether was evaporated by nitrogen. The dried lipolysis products were then re-dissolved in acetone containing triundecanoin as an internal standard (IS) to adjust the mixture to a final concentration of 1 mg lipolysis product/mL and 0.05 mg triundecanoin/mL. The sample was analyzed by HPLC according to methods outlined previously [

The analysis of TAG species was performed by a Yonglin SP930D HPLC (Yonglin, Anyang, Korea) connected to a Sedex 75 evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD, Sedere, Alfortville, France). The nebulizing temperature and nitrogen gas were kept at 40 °C and at pressure of 2.2 bars, respectively. A Nova-Pak

TAG species were designated by comparing retention times and partition numbers (PN) with those of various TAG standards obtained from Nu-Chek-Prep (Waterville, ME, USA), where the latter was calculated using the following equation: PN = total carbon number (CN) − 2 × total number of double bonds (ND). Based on fatty acid composition, PN, and previous reports [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], plausible TAG species were also designated. For quantification of TAG molecules to calculate the lipolysis rate, the concentrations of SBO at 0.3–1.2 mg/mL, PGO at 0.2–1.0 mg/mL, physical blend at 0.2–1.0 mg/mL, and IO at 0.2–1.0 mg/mL were injected into HPLC system. All analyses were carried out in duplicate. To determine the lipolysis rate of each oil sample, the total areas of TAG peaks at 0 and 30 min were obtained from the HPLC chromatogram, and the areas of the IS peak at 0 and 30 min were obtained simultaneously. Calibration curves assessing the total peak area ratio of TAG/IS versus the concentration ratio of oil/IS were then obtained by applying the following the power models: y = 0.4568x
