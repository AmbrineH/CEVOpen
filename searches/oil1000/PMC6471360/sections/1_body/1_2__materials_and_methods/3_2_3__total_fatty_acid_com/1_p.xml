 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Analysis was performed in duplicate, and the results are expressed as the average value and standard deviation. An Agilent 6890 Gas Chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an auto-injector and a flame-ionization detector was used for fatty acid composition analysis. The column (SP
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>-2560, 100 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.2 µm film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was maintained at 150 °C for 5 min, increased to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, and then held at 220 °C for 30 min. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 mL/min in constant flow mode. The spilt ratio was 50:1. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 260 °C, respectively. The retention time of each fatty acid was compared with that of the Supelco 37 component FAME mixture (10 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich/Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
