<p class="p">The physical stability of an oil droplet in digestion fluid was analyzed using a Turbiscan Lab Expert (Toulouse, France). The prepared emulsion was transferred into a cylindrical glass cell and scanned by the detection head of the Turbiscan, which consisted of one pulsed near-infrared light source (λ = 880 nm) and two synchronous detectors: a transmission (T) and a back scattering (BS) detector. The detection head scanned the total height of the sample (23–24 mm) every 5 min for 3 h at 25 °C. The region from the liquid level to 3 mm below was set as the creaming layer zone, and that from the bottom to 5 mm above was set as the clarification layer zone. The data were collected and analyzed by Turbiscan Lab Expert software.</p>
