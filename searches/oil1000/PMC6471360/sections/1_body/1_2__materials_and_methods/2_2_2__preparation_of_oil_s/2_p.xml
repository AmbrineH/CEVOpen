<p class="p">Subsequently, SBO, PGO, IO, and PHY were passed through a column to separate TAG from free fatty acids (FFAs), diacylglycerol (DAG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG). Briefly, each oil (20 g) was dissolved in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (10 mL) and was applied to the column (3.5 cm diameter, 20 cm length) packed with silicic acid (20 g), and then eluted with 250 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. If necessary, this step was performed repeatedly until isolation of TAG was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, where the absence of DAG, MAG, and FFA bands was confirmed [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. A vacuum rotary evaporator was used to remove the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane at 40 °C, and traces of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane were removed by flushing with nitrogen. Each obtained sample was stored at −30 °C until further analysis.
