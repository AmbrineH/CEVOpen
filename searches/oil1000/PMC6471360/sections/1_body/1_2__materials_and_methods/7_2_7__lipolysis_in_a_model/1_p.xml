<p class="p">In this study, bile salts were replaced by bile extract to prepare the digestion fluid. The bile extract was filtered to remove insoluble compounds. Each oil sample (approximately 150 mg) was mixed with digestion fluid (17 mL) in a conical flask (250 mL) with a screw cap. The flask was placed in a water bath shaker for 2 min at a speed of 60 rpm at 37 °C. Lipolysis was started by adding 1 mL of digestion fluid into the conical flask that contained 53 mg of pancreatin and 35.5 mg of type II lipase. At 0 min (i.e., before the enzyme was added) and 30 min after lipolysis, the sample was poured into a 50 mL cylindrical glass tube. Diethyl ether (10 mL) was then added to extract the lipolysis products. After shaking vigorously for 1 min, centrifugal separation (15 min, 2500× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>) was performed to obtain the upper layer, which was subsequently applied to an anhydrous sodium sulfate column to remove residual moistures. Extraction was repeated 3 times. After collecting the upper layer into a new glass tube, diethyl ether was completely removed by nitrogen evaporation. The extracted lipolysis product was then weighed and re-dissolved in 3 mL of diethyl ether. The obtained samples were stored at −20 °C until HPLC analysis.
