<p class="p">SBO is widely-consumed as an edible oil containing C18:2 (L, n-6) and C18:3 (Ln, n-3) known as essential fatty acids, whereas PGO contains a high amount of unusual conjugated linolenic acid (CLn) such as pucinic acid (

Meanwhile, PHY and IO were prepared from SBO and PGO, which have similar compositions of total fatty acids but have different TAG species profiles. These four samples were used to study the effects of lipid composition on lipolysis. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a, lipolysis of all samples was slower after 5â€“6 min because the lipolysis products could compete with lipase at the interface of the lipid droplets, which slowed the lipolysis rate even though bile salts can promote lipase adsorption by removing lipolysis products (FFAs, MAGs, etc.) from the interface of the lipid droplet [

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the reduced content of CLn in PHY and IO increased lipolysis rates, while different TAG species in the PHY and IO profiles did not affect lipolysis rates much in these experimental conditions. Based on these results, the rate of lipolysis might be affected by the fatty acid composition of TAG molecules as well as by emulsion stability and lipid droplet sizes, as previously reported [
