 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, lipolysis rates (%) of the selected individual triacylglycerol (TAG) species after 30 min of digestion in a simulated model of small intestinal digestion were presented. Each individual TAG species in SBO sample was not significantly different in its lipolysis rate, where L-L-L (trilinoleoyl glycerol) and L-L-O (dilinoleoyl-oleoyl glycerol) presented as abundant TAG species that were similarly hydrolyzed to S-L-O (stereoyl-linoleoyl-oleoyl glycerol) that account for approximately 4.2% in SBO (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00678-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Overall, most TAG species in the SBO sample showed lipolysis rates ranging from 77.1% (L-L-L) to 81.0% (L-L-S/P-L-O) while those of CLn-CLn-CLn, CLn-CLn-L, and CLn-CLn-P in the PGO sample showed rates of 65.3%, 71.5%, and 70.3%, respectively. When compared to L-L-L of SBO, the lipolysis rate in CLn-CLn-CLn of the PGO was lowered by 11.8%. However, there was no significant difference in lipolysis rates between them at

This study suggested that a simulated small intestinal digestion system along with HPLC instrumental analysis could evaluate not only the lipolysis rate of oil samples but also evaluate the quantitative changes in individual TAG species.
