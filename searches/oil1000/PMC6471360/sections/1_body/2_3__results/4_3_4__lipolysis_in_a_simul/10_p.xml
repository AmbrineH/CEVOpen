<p class="p">Furthermore, the lipolysis rates of the selected individual TAG species in either SBO or PGO were obtained. For calculating the lipolysis rate (%) of each TAG species, the area of each TAG species was substituted for A
 <sub class="sub">TTGS</sub> in Equations (1)â€“(5). Therefore, based on the assumptions mentioned above, the calibration curves for the concentration ratio of oil/IS versus the peak area ratio of each TAG/IS were obtained by applying the power model. For the selected TAG peaks, the models proposed are as follows: y = 67.518x

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b) using a model that simulates small intestinal digestion. After 30 min of digestion, the smaller peaks in SBO were observed than in PGO while a peak corresponding to CLn-CLn-CLn present in PGO was clearly visible. This result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) can be further explained specifically from the following result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) in which CLn-CLn-CLn showed the lowest lipolysis rate among TAG species in PGO and SBO.
