<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b, the lipolysis rates (%) of SBO, PGO, PHY, and IO in digestion fluids after 30 min of digestion were 80.4%, 66.5%, 74.8%, and 77.0%, respectively. The lipolysis rate of the SBO in digestion fluids was significantly higher than that of the PGO (
 <italic class="italic">p &lt;</italic> 0.05), while no significant difference was observed among lipolysis rates of the SBO, PHY, and IO samples (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, a slightly higher rate of lipolysis rate could be observed in the SBO sample compared to the PHY and IO samples. Such results show a similar trend to those from the pH-stat digestion system, where the lipolysis rate was in the following order: SBO ≥ IO ≥ PHY &gt; PGO.
