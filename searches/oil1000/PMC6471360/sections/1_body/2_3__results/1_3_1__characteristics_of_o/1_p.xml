<p class="p">In SBO, linoleic acid (L, 49.5%) and oleic acid (O, 22.1%) are major compositional fatty acids, while pucinic acid (CLn, 74.7%) is the most abundant fatty acid in PGO, in accordance with the previous report [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. As expected, the analyzed fatty acid composition of PHY was close to the theoretical value of the blend mixture (SBO and PGO at a molar ratio of 1:1,

Total fatty acid composition of IO was not much different from that of PHY, which contained 32.9 area% linoleic acid, 29.2 area% pucinic acid, and 16.7 area% oleic acid, indicating that the interesterification reaction did not markedly affect the fatty acid composition of IO (

For example, the major components of TAG species in PGO were 67.8% TAG with PN = 36 (CLn-CLn-CLn) and 12.1% TAG with PN = 40 (CLn-CLn-O, CLn-CLn-P, etc.). PHY was composed of CLn-CLn-CLn (24.8 area%) along with L-L-L and L-L-O that originated from SBO. After the enzymatic interesterification reaction, however, TAG with PN = 38 increased to 18.0 area% in IO, which was observed as 3.0 area% in PHY. This result suggests that some CLn-CLn-CLn (PN = 36) was converted to TAG that exhibits a PN = 38 (possibly corresponding to CLn-CLn-L and CLn-Ln-L) because TAG with PN = 36 (CLn-CLn-CLn, CLn-CLn-Ln, etc.) decreased to 3.4 area% in IO. Similarly, L-L-L (PN = 42) composed of 12.9 area% in PHY, which decreased to 2.2 area% in IO, indicating that the interesterification reaction induced the formation of newly re-structured TAG molecules in IO (
