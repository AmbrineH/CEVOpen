<p class="p">Droplet size is one of the most important factors affecting the lipid digestion rate since the available surface area of the lipid droplet where the lipases bind increases as the droplet particle size decreases [

 <sub class="sub">32</sub> values of the emulsified SBO, PGO, PHY, and IO in digestion fluid were 0.26, 0.31, 0.30, and 0.30 μm, respectively. The statistical analysis showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">32</sub> of the emulsified SBO was significantly smaller than that of the others (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Smaller droplet size of lipid globules in SBO emulsion may offer a larger available surface area for lipase binding, and thus faster lipolysis was expected in SBO emulsion than with the other samples (PGO, PHY, and IO emulsion). This result may be due to different TAG species and a different fatty acid composition (

In addition to droplet size, the physical stability of the lipid droplets in digestion fluid was monitored using a Turbiscan Lab Expert. Detection was performed to monitor the change in the delta backscattering (ΔBS, %) value that represents the stability of lipid droplets in digestion fluid [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b shows a ΔBS (%) change in the 3 mm region from samples (namely, creaming layer zone). The increase of ΔBS (%) during the measurement time (180 min) suggested that the creaming layer gradually formed, where lipid droplets were progressively concentrated [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00678" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Overall, ΔBS (%) level of the emulsified SBO was the lowest, while that observed in the emulsified PGO was the highest. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b, PGO emulsion exhibited a marked increase in ΔBS (%) during the analysis time, showing the highest ΔBS(t) rate (7.06 %/h) in the creaming layer zone, while SBO emulsion showed the lowest (4.29%/h). In the case of the emulsified PHY and IO samples, the differences in ΔBS (%) were not notable between them, and the ΔBS (%) of PHY and IO emulsions were observed between those in SBO and PGO emulsions during the determination time. The ΔBS (%) of the clarification zone (5 mm region from the bottom to up) is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00678-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c, where the ΔBS(t) rate (%/h) decreased in the order of SBO (−0.90) &gt; PHY (−1.39) &gt; IO (−1.82) &gt; PGO (−2.12%/h), suggesting that the lipid droplets from the emulsified SBO in digestion fluids were the most stable, while the droplets from the emulsified PGO were the least stable. Such results agree with those found during lipid droplet measurement (
