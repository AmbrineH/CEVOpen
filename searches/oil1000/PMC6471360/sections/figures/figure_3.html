 <p> HPLC Chromatograms of soybean oil ( a) and pomegranate seed oil ( b) before digestion and after 30-min digestion. The calibration curves (concentration ratio of soybean oil/internal standard versus the peak area ratio of individual triacylglycerol species/internal standard) of trilinoleoyl glycerol (L-L-L), dilinoleoyl-oleoyl glycerol (L-L-O), triconjugated linoleonyl glycerol (CLn-CLn-CLn), and diconjugated linoleonyl-palmitoyl glycerol (CLn-CLn-P) triacylglycerol (TAG) species are shown. Abbreviation: O, oleic acid; L, linoleic acid. CLn, conjugated linolenic acid; P, palmitic acid. </p>
