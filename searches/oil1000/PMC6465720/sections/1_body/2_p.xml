<p class="p">Advances in screening methods and analytical equipment, increasing number of targets available for testing, and improved possibilities for optimization of natural leads using synthetic modification strategies substantially improved the process of modern drug discovery from natural sources (Atanasov et al.,

 <italic class="italic">Hypericum</italic> is a well-known genus that is used for its medicinal properties. Tocci et al. evaluated five 
 <italic class="italic">Hypericum</italic> species for their polyphenolic content, toxicological safety, and antifungal potential against some sensitive and drug resistant clinical fungal isolates. The authors have identified 52 compounds by LC-MS analysis and showed that 
 <italic class="italic">H. hircinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">majus</italic> infusion exerted broad antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus, Penicillium</italic>, and non
 <italic class="italic">-albicans Candida</italic> strains (
