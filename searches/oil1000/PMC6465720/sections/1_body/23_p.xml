<p class="p">In conclusion, this Research Topic includes a wide range of interdisciplinary research work contributing to the ultimate goals of augmenting the existing knowledge and fostering the scientific field of ethnopharmacology in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as globally. This research topic successfully gathered comprehensive interdisciplinary information in the field of ethnopharmacology from the field surveys to standardization and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of action of natural products. Moreover, with consideration of the existing challenges in the field of drug discovery form medicinal plants, this research topic provides up-to-date snapshot of current knowledge and paves the way for further chemical and biological assessment of diverse natural compounds with potential for future therapeutic development. We hope that this compendium will further inspire scientists from different research fields to make use of the gathered traditional medical knowledge in the search for superior future remedies from nature.</p>
