<p class="p">The ethnopharmacological tradition in Central and Eastern Europe has a great historical significance and large parts of the Western world's knowledge for therapeutic properties of medicinal plants has its roots in the Greek and Roman cultures (e.g., with a reference to the influential works of Dioscorides, Pliny the Elder, and Galen). The German-speaking Central European areas also have played very important roles, with some influential medieval herbal book editions such as the Mainz Herbal (Herbarius Moguntinus, 1484) and The German Herbal (1485). Moreover, at the beginning of the nineteenth century modern drug discovery from plants started to played a key role in Central Europe, most notably the work of the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sert√ºrner, who isolated an analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium that was named morphium (morphine) after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. At the same time, it should be noted that on many occasions the rich ethnopharmacological knowledge of some East European countries and Russia remained localized and did not find its way to integrate with the Western world of herbal therapy traditions. The focus of this Research Topic is to make a special contribution to ethnopharmacology rooted in Central and Eastern Europe, on the context of global research developments in the area of ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, molecular pharmacology of natural products, nutrigenomics, and other related disciplines. This special issue consists of 24 articles covering diverse topics related to the listed research fields.</p>
