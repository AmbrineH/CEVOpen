<p class="p">GbE is the most widely herbal supplement therapy used worldwide (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Its effects have been investigated in a range of chronic diseases including NAFLD (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>), Alzheimer's disease (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>), memory loss (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>), and cancer (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Recent investigations from our research group have identified some of the molecular effects of GbE supplementation in obese rats. We have previously showed that GbE supplementation significantly reduced appetite and significantly stimulated hypothalamic serotonergic activity in obesity-associated ovariectomized rats (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Additionally, diet-induced obese rats showed significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and increased insulin receptor (IR) and AKT phosphorylation after GbE supplementation (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest a potentially beneficial effect of GbE as coadjuvant for the treatment of obesity. In order to further test this hypothesis, in the current investigation we examined other markers of lipid metabolism on epididymal white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese rats supplemented with GbE.
