 <italic class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract is a rich mixture of polyphenolic compounds, including ginkgolides, bilobalides, quercetin, and several others (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). Previous studies showed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with ginkgolide C showed increased ATGL and HSL activity and AMPK phosphorylation, as well as decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for fatty acid synthesis (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). Furthermore, 3T3-L1 cells subjected to hypoxia and incubated with bilobalide showed reduced pro-inflammatory biomarkers and improved insulin sensitivity (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>). Similarly, ginkgetin, a biflavone from 
 <italic class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</italic>, has been described as a STAT5 inhibitor, blocking the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes harvested from high-fat diet-induced obese mice (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>). Moreover, OP9 cells, which differentiate into adipocytes 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, showed reduced adipogenesis, increased HSL and decreased FAS expression upon treatment with quercetin (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). Such results confirm previously published findings that 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with a range of biflavones found in 
 <italic class="italic">Ginkgo biloba</italic> showed increased lipolysis rate (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>), and that biflavones inhibit cAMP-phosphodiesterase in rat adipose tissue (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>).
