<p class="p">In the present study, we observed a lower food intake (g/100 g/24 h) but higher relative energy intake (kcal/100 g/24 h) in HFD-fed rats throughout the 2 months of obesity-induction period, prior to GbE intervention. The HFD was effective in inducing obesity; HFD-fed rats showed significantly increased body weight in comparison to NFD-fed rats, as well as increased masses of retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissue. Such findings have been described previously, and it is well-known that lard-based high-fat diets increase body weight and visceral fat accumulation (
