<p class="p">In the present investigation, lipolysis rate remained statistically similar between HFD and NFD. Furthermore, oleate incorporation was significantly higher in HFD. Taken these results together, it is expected that in the longer term HFD adipocytes would only expand their volumes further, deteriorating the molecular consequences of obesity. However, our results suggest that GbE would be effective in impairing such deterioration, as lipolysis rate and fatty acid incorporation were lower in the rats that received it as compared to the ones that did not. Both biomarkers were also statistically similar between HFD+GbE and NFD. Our hypothesis is further corroborated by the findings of intracellular incorporation of [1-

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6E</xref>. Acetate is a key component in fatty acid synthesis, and we found significantly reduced acetate incorporation into lipids in the HFD+GbE group in relation to HFD.
