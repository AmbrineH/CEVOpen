<p class="p">This is, in our opinion, a remarkable effect of GbE supplementation. Adipocyte hypertrophy is a classical manifestation of obesity and is directly associated with the aetiology of macrophage infiltration, hypoxia, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and reduced production of adiponectin. Such disturbances induce low grade inflammation and insulin resistance (

A reduction of adipocyte volume without concomitant losses in body weight, which we did find in the present study, could well possibly suggest an improvement in body composition. Further studies are however needed to further investigate this hypothesis.
