<p class="p">Perilipin 1 is an intracellular protein that covers the lipid droplet surface in adipocytes, regulating TAG storage and mediating stimulated lipolysis (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Higher perilipin activity (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>) and higher TNF-α levels (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>) are observed in obesity. TNF-α induces lipolysis mediated by the activation of perilipin 1, promoting its displacement from the lipid droplet, making the TAG molecule more accessible to HSL (
