<p class="p">In the present investigation, we found lower perilipin 1 relative mRNA levels in HFD+GbE as compared to HFD, down to levels similar to the NFD group. The lower perilipin levels found in GbE-supplemented rats may suggest that a lower lipolysis rate will occur in the longer term, further corroborating the lipolysis findings described above. Also, it further supports the hypothesis that GbE supplementation may lead to lower fat accumulation in the long term.</p>
