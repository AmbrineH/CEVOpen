<p class="p">The reduced energy intake observed in HFD+GbE did not lead to significantly reduced body weight gain; both HFD and HFD+GbE showed statistically similar body weight at the end of the 2-week supplementation period. However, we have previously demonstrated that GbE induced a significant reduction in the mass of retroperitoneal and epididymal fat pads of obese rats (

Furthermore, epididymal adipocytes harvested from HFD rats were significantly larger than those harvested from NFD rats, but the present data also showed that GbE supplementation induced a reduction in adipocyte volume of obese rats, bringing this index down to a volume similar to the NFD group.
