<p class="p">Further metabolic manifestations have been observed in lard-fed obese Wistar rats. Dornellas et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>) showed that the intake of lard-enriched high fat diet for 8 weeks resulted in significantly decreased linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and the respective elongated desaturated omega 6 and 3 PUFAs in liver, serum, retroperitoneal, epididymal and mesenteric white adipose tissue lipid extracts. Due to the similarities between the experimental model used in our study and the one employed by Dornellas et al., it is reasonable to suggest that the content of essential fatty acids was decreased in our HFD rats, which may help to explain the phenotypic disturbances found in these animals.
