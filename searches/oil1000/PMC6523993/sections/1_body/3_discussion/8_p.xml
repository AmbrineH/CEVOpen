<p class="p">Increased visceral adiposity and perturbations in adipocyte volume are only a few of the manifestations seen in adipose tissue in obesity; lipid uptake and lipolysis rate are also disturbed (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). In the present study, the lipolysis index was quantified by the amount of glycerol released from incubated adipocytes into the incubation medium. Isoproterenol, a sympathomimetic compound, was added to mimic adrenergic activation upon lipolysis. We found no statistically significant differences in either basal or isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis amongst the three groups investigated. It is known however that lipolysis rate is higher in obesity (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). Corroborating this observation, in the current investigation, despite the absence of statistically significant differences in lipolysis rate amongst the three groups, HFD+GbE adipocytes showed basal lipolysis rate ~45% lower, and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis ~15% lower than HFD adipocytes.
