<p class="p">In summary, our study shows that rats fed a high fat diet for 2 months and subsequently supplemented with GbE for 2 weeks showed significant reduction in several biomarkers of lipid metabolism, including reduced epididymal adipocyte volume and [1-
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C]-acetate incorporation into fatty acids, 
 <italic class="italic">Plin 1</italic> mRNA, 
 <italic class="italic">Fasn</italic> mRNA, and protein levels, alongside a tendency for reduced epididymal [
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>H]-oleate incorporation. Furthermore, the energy intake of GbE-supplemented rats was significantly lower than of rats receiving a control diet and of rats received the high fat diet only.
