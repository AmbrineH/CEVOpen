<p class="p">Moreover, FAS may be an important modulator of feeding regulation. C75 is a synthetic inhibitor of FAS found to suppress food intake in obese mice mediated by NPY/AgRP orexigenic neurons, also increasing the expression of Melanin-Concentrating Hormone and its receptor in the hypothalamus. C75 reduced body weight and body fat content, and normalized obesity-associated hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia (
