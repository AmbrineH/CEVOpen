<p class="p">GbE may have a potentially therapeutic use for menopause-associated obesity; supplementation with 500 mg/kg of GbE stimulated hypothalamic serotonergic activity in ovariectomized rats (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>), and to inhibit adipogenesis through activation of the AMPK pathway (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). However, the effects of GbE supplementation on metabolic processes of visceral adipose tissue in DIO rats remain largely unknown. In view of the considerations highlighted above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of GbE supplementation as a potentially anti-obesogenic effector for improvement in lipid metabolism of epididymal adipose tissue of DIO rats.
