<p class="p">In obesity, particularly visceral obesity, enlarged WAT visceral adipocytes show dysregulated lipolysis, inducing high levels of circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). NEFAs in normal circumstances are utilized as energy by tissues such as liver and muscle; however, when in excess they contribute to the development of insulin resistance (

Visceral obesity seems to play a central role in the development of metabolic disorders, being associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which have the potential to trigger insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction (
