<p class="p">The definition of white adipose tissue (WAT) as an inert mass for energy storage is long gone; over the last two decades the adipose tissue has been recognized as a dynamic tissue and key player in the modulation of energy metabolism (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). Adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have a direct effect on energy homeostasis and modulation of low-grade inflammation (

The intake of high fat diets has the potential to not only disturb normal adipokine secretion but also to remodel adipose tissue by increasing adipocyte size and/or number, contributing to the development of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment (
