<p class="p">At the end of the 2 months obesity-induction period (NFD vs. HFD), the HFD group was randomly sorted into two subsets: HFD (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 24) or HFD+GbE (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 27). For the two following weeks, both HFD and HFD+GbE groups showed reduced food intake in comparison to NFD (45.1 and 50.1%, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but the HFD+GbE group showed reduced food intake in comparison to HFD (8.9%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.014). The energy intake was statistically similar between NFD and HFD; however, the HFD+GbE energy intake was significantly lower than NFD (8.7%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and HFD (8.9%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
