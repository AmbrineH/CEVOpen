<p class="p">No statistically significant differences were found in 
 <italic class="italic">FASN</italic> gene expression between HFD and NFD, but GbE supplementation significantly decreased it by 70.7% in relation to NFD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6B</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.03). The 
 <italic class="italic">FASN</italic> gene expression experiment was followed by tissue FAS protein quantification by western blotting. We have confirmed that there were no differences in FAS protein between NFD and HFD, but GbE supplementation did reduce tissue FAS content by 38% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) in relation to NFD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7A</xref>). No statistically significant differences were found in p-HSL and HSL protein amongst the three groups (
