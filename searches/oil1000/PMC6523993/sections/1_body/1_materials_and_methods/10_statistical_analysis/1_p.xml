<p class="p">Data were subjected to quality tests such as Shapiro–Wilk (normality) and/or Levenne (homogeneity). If necessary, data were standardized according to the log transformation. Descriptive analysis was performed using mean ± SEM, and measurements were taken from distinct samples. Comparisons of body mass, food intake, body weight gain, and food efficiency between NFD and HFD were assessed by 
 <italic class="italic">Student's t-test</italic> for independent samples. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey 
 <italic class="italic">post-hoc</italic> test was employed to assess the effects of supplementation among NFD, HFD, and HFD+GbE. Mann-Whitney test was performed to analyse acetate incorporation into lipids, since this was a non-linear parameter compared between HFD and HFD+GbE groups only. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS®software version 20. The number of samples used in each experiment is shown in the respective Results section. The level of significance adopted was set at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05.
