<p class="p">Total RNA from epididymal adipocytes was extracted with Trizol速reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies速) and reversely transcribed into cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems速) following the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time qPCR using a Rotor Gene (Qiagen速) and SYBR Green as fluorescent dye with Beta2M as housekeeping gene.</p>
