<p class="p">Lipolysis was estimated as concentration of glycerol release into the incubation medium. For this, isolated epididymal adipocytes (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL) were incubated in Krebs/Ringer/phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing BSA (20 mM) and glucose (5 mM) for 30 min at 37°C in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> M). The reaction was stopped by cooling the flasks on ice, and the media was carefully collected for measurement of glycerol release employing a free glycerol determination kit (Sigma®). Results are expressed as nmol of glycerol / 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> adipocytes.
