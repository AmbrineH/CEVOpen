<p class="p">Fatty acid uptake, measured by intracellular accumulation of [
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>H]-oleate, was quantified following previously established methods (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). Briefly, isolated epididymal adipocytes (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/ mL) were incubated in Krebs/Ringer/phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing BSA (1%), glucose (2 mM), [
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>H]- oleate (100 μM, 1850 Bq/tube or well) for 2 h at 37°C in a water bath. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture was transferred to 1.5 mL tubes containing 400 μL of silicone oil and centrifuged for 30 s. The cell pellet on top of the oil layer was transferred to polypropylene tubes containing 2.5 mL of Dole's reagent for lipid extraction. After addition of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-heptane (1.5 mL) and distilled water (1.5 mL), tubes were vortexed and the mixture decanted for 5 min. An aliquot of the upper phase was collected into a scintillation vial for the determination of radioactivity incorporated into TAG (1450 LSC, Couter MicroBeta, Trilux; Perkin Elmer, Waltham®, MA, USA). Results are expressed as nmol of oleate/1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/h.
