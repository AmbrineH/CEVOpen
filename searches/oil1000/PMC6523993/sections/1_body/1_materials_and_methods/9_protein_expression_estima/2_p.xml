<p class="p">Fifty micrograms of protein were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with primary antibody anti-Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS - Santa Cruz®– SC20140), anti-phospho-hormone-sensitive lipase (p-HSL Cell Signaling® - #4139) and anti-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL Cell Signaling®- #4107). Membranes were subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling®- #7074) followed by chemiluminescence detection. β-tubulin (Cell Signaling®- #2146) levels were used as internal standard. Quantitative analysis was performed with ImageJ software (ImageJ®, version 2.0, Maryland, USA). In all experiments, at least one sample from each group was analysed simultaneously and the results were expressed as percentage change relative to NFD group levels, as described previously (
