<p class="p">Briefly, the high fat diet was prepared by mixing 40% (w/w) ground standard chow (Nuvilab®, Brazil, 2.7 kcal/g), with 28% (w/w) melted lard, 20% (w/w) casein powder, 10% (w/w) sucrose, 2% (w/w) soybean oil, and 0.02% (w/w) butylated hydroxytoluene (5.0 kcal/g). All the ingredients were thoroughly mixed and lukewarm drinking water added to obtain the consistency necessary to allow perfect homogenization of the mixture and production of pellets, which were subsequently dried in a forced ventilation oven at 60°C for 24 h. This diet provides 19.5% of energy from carbohydrate, 23.2% from protein, and 57.3% from fat, and has been demonstrated in previous studies to induce obesity (
