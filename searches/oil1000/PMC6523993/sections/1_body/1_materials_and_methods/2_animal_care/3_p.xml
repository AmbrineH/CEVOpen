<p class="p">Over the course of 2 months for the development of obesity, normal fat diet-fed rats (NFD, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20) received the standard chow, while the high fat diet-fed rats (HFD, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 54) received the lard enriched diet, as described above. All rats were weighted once weekly, and the food/energy intake was calculated by the difference between the food left from the food offered 24 h before. Food efficiency was calculated by the ratio of body weight gain (g) to food ingestion (g) weekly.
