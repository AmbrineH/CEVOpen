<p class="p">Adipocyte isolation was performed as previously described and optimized (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). Briefly, epididymal fat pads were diced in small fragments in a flask containing 4 mL of DMEM supplemented with HEPES (20 mM), glucose (5 mM), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1%), and collagenase type II (1 mg/mL), pH 7.4 and incubated for ~40 min at 37°C in an orbital shaker. Isolated adipocytes were filtered through a plastic sieve (150 μm) and washed three times in fresh buffer without collagenase. After washing and brief spin, the medium was thoroughly aspirated, and the adipocytes harvested. Adipocytes were photographed under an optic microscope (× 100 magnification) coupled to a microscope camera (AxioCam ERc5s; Zeiss®, Oberkochen, Germany). Mean adipocyte volume (4/3 x π x r
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), expressed in pL, was calculated by averaging the measurement of 50 cells, employing AxioVision LE64 software.
