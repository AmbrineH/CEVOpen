 <p> Gene expression. Effect of GbE supplementation on epididymal adipose tissue gene expression of PLIN1 (A), FASN (B), and HSL (C), normal-fat diet (NFD; n = 6–4), high-fat diet (HFD; n = 5–3), and high-fat diet plus GbE supplementation (HFD+GbE; n = 6–4) groups. * p &lt; 0.05 vs. NFD and # p &lt; 0.05 vs. HFD (One-way ANOVA). Gene expression in epididymal WAT depot was evaluated by Real Time PCR. </p>
