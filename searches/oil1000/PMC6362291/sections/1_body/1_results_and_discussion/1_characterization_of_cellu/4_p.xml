<p id="Par13" class="p">The BC pellicles used in this study for impregnation displayed a swelling ratio of 353 ± 12.32% and a water holding capacity of 68 ± 4.83%. The ability to keep moisture within the proximity of bone surfaces provides an appropriate environment for proper osteoblast growth and multiplication, thus enabling effective repair and regeneration processes. According to the literature, the swelling capacity of unmodified BC is in the range of 200–500%, whereas the water holding capacity is between 50–100%

 </sup>. Therefore, the water-related parameters of BC used in this study fit within the above-given range. Having the suitability of BC as a carrier proven we have subsequently analyzed the properties of EOs in the context of their suitability for bone biofilm eradication.
