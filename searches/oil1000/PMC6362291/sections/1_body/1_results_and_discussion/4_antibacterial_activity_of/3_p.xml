<p id="Par20" class="p">The performance of the A.D.A.M. test allowed to estimate both the efficacy and the penetrability of the EOs released from the dressings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a,b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Varying efficacy of the antimicrobials released from the dressings was observed depending on all analyzed variables, i.e. disc type (C, M, B), species of biofilm-forming pathogens, type of oil applied. Clove oil proved to be the least efficient against
