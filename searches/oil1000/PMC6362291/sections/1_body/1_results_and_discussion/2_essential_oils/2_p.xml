<p id="Par15" class="p">EOs listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> are known for their antimicrobial potential; however, they are composed of a plethora of substances which may or may not be active against microorganisms. Therefore, there is a threat that the interactions between some of them diminish their antimicrobial activity due to antagonistic interaction or some of ingredients may even stimulate microbial growth. Therefore, we have tested which molecules of EOs adhere to hydroxyapatite, because only such molecules may be applied specifically as drugs to combat biofilms adhered to the bones. It occurred that only some of them are able to do so. The majority of compounds found to be bound to HA, e.g. eugenol, eucalyptol, thymol, isoborneol, caryophyllen, cymene, pinene or limonene are also compounds of proven antimicrobial activity

 </sup>. Moreover, an interesting trend was observed – the higher the number of specific types of antimicrobial molecules found adhered to the HA surface (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, molecules distinguished with an asterisk), the higher the biofilm eradication ratio was observed (please refer to 
 <italic class="italic">Anti-biofilm activity analysis of BC dressings against biofilmic forms of pathogens in an environment simulating bone conditions</italic> section). This trend was particularly well-visible in the case of staphylococcal biofilm but not so distinct for pseudomonal biofilm, probably due to generally weaker EO activity against Gram-negative than against Gram-positive pathogens proven by Nazzaro 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.

 </sup>. Therefore, it can be assumed that only their combined activity could lead to the observed antibiofilm effect and the more types of molecules were involved, the stronger it was.
