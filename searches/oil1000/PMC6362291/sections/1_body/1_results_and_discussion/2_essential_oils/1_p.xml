<p id="Par14" class="p">All antimicrobials and antiseptics tested as active substances of BC dressings display some disadvantages which limit their usability in the prevention and treatment of biofilm-based bone infections. Therefore, in the present study we tested the activity of substances presently beyond strict clinical use with regard to bone treatment, namely clove (
 <bold class="bold">C</bold>), eucalyptus (
 <bold class="bold">E</bold>) and thyme (
 <bold class="bold">T</bold>) EOs as active substances of BC dressings. The rationale behind it was to provide an alternative for the already existing antimicrobials used to limit or eradicate bone infections, as their application correlates with the increasing resistance of microbes and subsequent therapeutic failures. In the first stage of our line of investigation, we determined the composition of the above EOs. The major substances detected are presented in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Additionally we evaluated which active substances from individual EOs adhere to hydroxyapatite and therefore may be used as future drugs for the treatment of bone infections.
