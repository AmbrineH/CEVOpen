 </sup> who tested octenidine dihydrochloride and benzalkonium chloride, respectively. The above-mentioned researchers attributed it to the unique fibrillar nanostructure and three-dimensional network of this material. Therefore, we analyzed the release behavior of EOs molecules from the BC pellicle as well as EOs holding capacity. The results of our study revealed that EOs molecules were released gradually from the BC pellicle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,c</xref>). After 72 h of incubation on average 0.39–0.55 µL/ml of EOs was released from BC, which constituted about 47% of the initial amount of adsorbed oil. There were no significant differences between the release ratios of individual EOs absorbed (K-W test, p &lt; 0.05). It should be emphasized that the high porosity of BC does not cause water or drug leakage from an impregnated membrane. Also, the holding capacity of the EO-impregnated BC was high. The main limitation of this experimental section was the fact that the analysis was performed in DMSO-containing environment because of slight water solubility of EOs analyzed. However, a comparative analysis of data from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> indicates that the antimicrobials from EOs were able to get released from the BC disc and able to reach the HA structure. An extrapolation of data obtained from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> into clinical conditions may allow to assume that the unique three-dimensional porous BC nanostructure ensured an effective level of EO absorption and their controlled long-term release
