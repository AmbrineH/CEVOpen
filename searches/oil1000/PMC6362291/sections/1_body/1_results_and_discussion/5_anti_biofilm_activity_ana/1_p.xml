<p id="Par22" class="p">To additionally test the ability of EOs released from BC to reach the biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite, we placed HA discs with pre-formed biofilm on it at the bottom of a 24-well plate. To simulate bone conditions, we incubated biofilm at 37 °C/5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a medium for osteoblast culturing. To confirm biofilm presence on the HA discs we have performed SEM analysis. Both tested strains formed strong, multi-layer biofilm structure on the HA surface (Fig.
