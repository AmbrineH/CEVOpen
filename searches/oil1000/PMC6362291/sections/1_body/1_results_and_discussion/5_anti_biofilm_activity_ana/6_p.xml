<p id="Par27" class="p">A further optimization of antimicrobial-effective, but not cytotoxic concentrations of eucalyptus EO as an active ingredient of BC dressing may lead to its use as an efficient counter-measure against bone biofilm infections. Bone infection is a rare but extremely serious condition. Independently of the route of infection – microbial spread through the blood system, fracture or surgery – it unconditionally requires the application of antimicrobial countermeasures, including a surgical bone cleansing from necrotic and biofilm structures. In this article we provide 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> data on the applicability of EO-containing BC dressings to fight against biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite. The next line of this investigation undoubtedly requires genotoxic tests and animal studies, but in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, if further developed, such approach as herein presented may provide – an efficient clinical alternative for the presently used treatments, and therefore it is worth of continuation.
