<p id="Par24" class="p">Cytotoxicity of EO-soaked BC tested against osteoblast and fibroblast cell cultures is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. It was found that the lowest cytotoxicity (the highest survival rate) was displayed by eucalyptus oil, while high cytotoxicity toward osteoblasts and fibroblasts was displayed by clove and thyme oils. EDX analysis showed that the observed cytotoxic effect is non-related to the presence of bacterial cell wall residues within the BC membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Moreover, no cytotoxic effect was observed when the extract from bacterial cellulose supplemented with glycol (positive control) was applied. It means that clove and thyme EOs but not the BC carrier were responsible for the cytotoxic effects presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The presence of numerous components in the analyzed EOs (please refer to Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) that simultaneously interfere with the cell multiple signaling pathway

 </sup>, might be the key reason to understand the observed differences in the survival rate of osteo- and fibroblast cell lines subjected to thyme, clove and eucalyptus essential oil activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). As eucalyptus oil displayed high anti-biofilm activity as shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, this type of EO should be considered the most suitable for use as bone biofilm eradicator. Moreover, also the measurement of reactive oxygen species [ROS] produced by macrophages in the presence of EOs-impregnated BC dressings revealed that eucalyptus oil displayed the lowest potential related with ROS production by macrophages among other EOs tested. However, this trend was not statistically significant (K-W test, p &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>).
