<p id="Par23" class="p">Interestingly, contrary to our assumptions, biofilm eradication rate was for this experimental setting higher than in the case of results obtained in A.D.A.M. test (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). It suggests that physical obstacles used in A.D.A.M. test were of more impeding nature for EOs than water-soluble components used in the latter analysis. Moreover, the biofilm grown in bone-simulating conditions was formed by a lower number of CFUs (data not shown) than in the A.D.A.M. test which could have an impact on the final outcome of the analysis. Regardless of above, the trend for biofilm eradication was similar in the context of EOs types applied – the clove oil displayed the lowest, while thyme oil the highest ability to eradicate the

 <italic class="italic">aeruginosa</italic>, all tested oils displayed very low efficacy in this setting, reaching ca. 30% of biofilm-forming cell reduction in comparison to a positive control setting. Additionally, it was found that the difference between the ability of thyme oil to reduce staphylococcal vs. pseuodomonal biofilm was statistically significant (K-W test, p &lt; 0.05).
