 <italic class="italic">Komagataeibacter xylinus</italic> (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen - DSM 46602) was used for the production of BC. To obtain BC pellicles of a regular shape and of equal diameter, 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">xylinus</italic> was cultivated in stationary conditions in a 24-well culture plate (Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) for 7 days at 28 °C. The culture was conducted in the Herstin-Schramm (H-S) medium. The obtained BC pellicles were purified by treatment with 0.1 M NaOH at 80 °C for 90 min to remove the bacterial cells and medium components. The purified BC samples were washed until neutral pH value of washing water was reached, dried at 60 °C overnight and sterilized in an autoclave. The average diameter of BC pellicles used for impregnation was 1.5 cm. The average weight of a BC pellicle was approximately 0.90 g and 0.008 g for wet and dry BC, respectively.
