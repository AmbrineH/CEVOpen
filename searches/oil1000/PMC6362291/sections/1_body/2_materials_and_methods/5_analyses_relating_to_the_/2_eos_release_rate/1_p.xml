<p id="Par33" class="p">To assess the release of the tested antimicrobials from the BC discs, the spectrometric method was applied. Pellicles of impregnated BC were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in sealed beakers containing 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) EOs solvent. Each day, 200 μL of the obtained solution was transferred into wells on UV transparent 96-well microtitre plate (Becton Dickinson and Company, USA). During the first 12 h, measurements were performed every 2 h, and after this time, every 12 h. The absorbance was measured spectrometrically at 300 nm using microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO NanoQuant, Tecan, Switzerland). Each time after absorbance reading, the sample taken for the measurements was re-set into the beaker. The experiment was conducted in technical triplicates and repeated three times.</p>
