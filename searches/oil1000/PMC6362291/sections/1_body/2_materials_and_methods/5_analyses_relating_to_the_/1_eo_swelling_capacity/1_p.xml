<p id="Par32" class="p">Following impregnation, the BC samples were weighed using an analytical balance. Taking into account the weight of dry and impregnated BC (swollen BC), the amount of adsorbed EOs based on the standard curve was calculated. The results were presented as: ÂµL of EOs/mg of dry BC. The experiment was conducted in technical triplicates and repeated three times.</p>
