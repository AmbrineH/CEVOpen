 </sup> were routinely cultured in DMEM medium (Biochrom, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest SAS, France), l-Glutamine (4 mM, Biowest SAS), Penicillin-Streptomycin mix (100× dilution, Biowest SAS) and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (CB-160, Binder, Germany). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with CellROX®Green (Thermofisher Scientific, USA), a cell-permeant dye that after penetration into cells in a reduced form exhibits weak fluorescence and when oxidized by intracellular free radicals, binds to DNA, emitting a more intense green fluorescence. For this assay, BMDM cells were plated on a 96-well plate at a final density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator. In the next step, the cells were stained with CellROX®Green (final concentration of 5 µM) for 30 min at 37 °C with slight shaking. Then CellROX®Green was removed and the cells were treated with 10 µL of extracts for 1 h at 37 °C with slight shaking followed by fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde (POCH) in PBS and staining with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) to visualize nuclei (0.5 µg/mL, 20 min, room temperature). The sample referred to as the “CP” which consisted of cellulose and oil PEG but did not possess active substances of EOs was considered a positive control. Another control setting aimed to show macrophage reactivity was lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> O55:B5 (2 ng/mL). Macrophages were examined on a spinning disk confocal microscope (Cell Observer SD, Zeiss, Germany) with a 20× dry objective (NA 0.4) and EMCCD Rolera EM-C2 camera (QImaging, Canada). In each experimental condition four random areas per well were chosen and confocal Z stacks of 14-bit images spaced at 3–5 µm were automatically acquired using Tiles mode of the Zeiss ZEN2 acquisition software. Image analysis was performed using standard operations in the Fiji software. To quantify ROS generation, maximum intensity projections from Z stacks were created and background noise was removed with Subtract Background function (radius 50). Next, DAPI channel was segmented and binarized to visualize nuclei together with cell bodies, which were identified due to the small amount of cytoplasm around the nuclei (fluorescence intensity threshold was typically 750–880). Small artifacts were removed with Median filter (radius 2) and clusters of cells were separated with Watershed function. Cell bodies were detected with Analyze Particles function (size between 44.5–445 µm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and transferred onto the CellROX®Green channel in order to quantify ROS mean fluorescence intensity. Objects touching image edges were excluded from the analysis. The results were normalized with regard to CP sample which was assumed as a threshold of 100% value. The tests were performed in triplicate.
