<p id="Par56" class="p">Calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism version 7 software. Normality distribution was calculated by means of D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test. Because all values were non-normally distributed, the Kruskal-Walis test with post-hoc Dunnet analysis were applied. The results of statistical analyses were considered significant if they produced p-values &lt; 0.05.</p>
