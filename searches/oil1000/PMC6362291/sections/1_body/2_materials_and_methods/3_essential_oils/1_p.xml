<p id="Par30" class="p">For impregnation of BC membrane, three EOs of confirmed or alleged antimicrobial activity obtained from clove, eucalyptus, thyme (PharmaTech, Poland) were used. Undiluted EO volumes were used for BC impregnation purposes. The composition of the EOs used in this study was analyzed using GC/MS coupled with mass spectrometer single quadrupole (Shimadzu, Japan) with split/splitless injector at 280 °C, transfer line 300 °C, ion source 240 °C, capillary polar column ZB-WAX 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 I.D.; Phenomenex, USA). The analyses were performed after previous dilution in dichloromethane (1:50). Injection 1 µL was made in split mode (1:50). The oven program was: 40 °C – 1 min, 10 °C/min to 180 °C, 25 °C/min to 300 °C hold 5 min. The spectrometer was set to scan mode 10 000 scan/sec in the range 33–488 amu. The mobile phase was helium 99.999% (LindeGas, Poland) with linear velocity of 30 cm/sec in constant flow mode. The spectra were analyzed using GCMS Solution ver. 4.1 software (Shimadzu, Japan) with library Nist ver. 14 (NIST, USA).</p>
