<p id="Par48" class="p">2 mL of 2% bacteriological agar were introduced to a well of a 24-well plate and left to consolide. Afterwards, an agar stake of 8 mm in diameter was cut out of agar using a cork-borer device (Conbest, Poland). The following experimental setting was performed to imitate bone environment: a HA disc (hydroxyapatite is the main inorganic component of bone) covered with

 <italic class="italic">aureus</italic> biofilm was placed at the bottom of an agar-surrounded well and the empty space was filed with a medium for osteoblasts culture (F12 medium, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) but without antimicrobials (antibiotics and antimicotics) which are introduced when a routine cell culture is performed. On the top of the agar-filled well, cellulose dressings saturated with EOs or saturated with polyethylene glycol (control samples - CP) were placed. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in micro-aerobic conditions (5% CO
