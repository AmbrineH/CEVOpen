<p id="Par50" class="p">BC discs soaked with EOs were placed in agar holes (prepared as described in 
 <italic class="italic">Antimicrobial activity assessment</italic> section) with a HA disc inside. The entire experimental setting was covered with a plate lid and incubated for 24 h. Next, the HA discs were removed and washed in 1 ml methanol ChromaSolv (Sigma Aldrich, Poland) and dried under anhydrous sodium sulfate. 100 microliters of dry extracts were moved to glass inserts (250 µl) and injected directly on to a GC/MS system in splitless mode. The GC/MS method was described in the
