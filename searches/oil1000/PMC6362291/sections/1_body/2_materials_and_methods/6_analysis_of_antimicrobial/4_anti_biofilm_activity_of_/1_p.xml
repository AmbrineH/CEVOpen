 </sup>. Briefly, the strains from the Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar medium were transferred into 5 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. On the next day, agar-filled wells of a 24-well plate were prepared. Agar discs of 2.5 mm in diameter were cut out from the Muller-Hinton agar plate, transferred to the fresh 24-well plate and immersed in 2 mL of ca. 10

After incubation, the discs were rinsed 3 times with 2 mL of 0.9% NaCl to remove non-adherent bacteria and transferred to the agar-filled wells of the 24-well plate. Next, three discs (B - bottom, M - middle and C - contact) were placed into the holes. The BC membranes saturated with EOs were placed directly on the C-disc. On the next day, the MTT reduction cell viability assay was performed
