 </sup>. The main aim of the physicochemical analysis of carrier properties was to control the parameters relevant to the application of BC as a dressing. The element composition of BC membranes was analyzed by means of Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX) to search for nitrogen and phosphorus remains. The performance of the EDX method is discussed in detail in our other study
