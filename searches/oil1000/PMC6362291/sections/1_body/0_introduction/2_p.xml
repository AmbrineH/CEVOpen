<p id="Par3" class="p">Microbial biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials depends on the type of the extracellular matrix and on biofilm-forming species themselves (including intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms) and, last but not least, on the biofilm location within the patient’s body. Our recent findings and the results of teams dealing with the diagenesis phenomenon indicate that biofilms are able to re-model bone structures and penetrate within this tissue, thus significantly hampering antibiotic penetrability within the infection site

 </sup>. One effective strategy to fight bone biofilm is to provide high local concentration of antimicrobial to the direct proximity of the bone using such antimicrobial carriers as chitosan, hyaluronic acid or collagen

 </sup>. These disadvantages may cause disruption as well as uncontrolled content release from a carrier. Therefore none of the aforementioned carriers meets all the requirements for a so-called “ideal carrier” which constitutes a powerful mixture of such features as low cytotoxicity and allergenicity, high release potential and appropriate mechanical strength
