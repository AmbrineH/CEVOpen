 <p> The effectiveness of impregnation process: ( a) BC swelling capacity of Eos. ( b) EOs release ratio from BC. ( c) EOs holding capacity (EOHC). The data are presented as a mean ± standard error of the mean. Results of swelling capacity represent accumulated release. C - clove oil, E - eucalyptus oil, T - thyme oil. No significant differences between particular EOs were found (K-W test, p &lt; 0.05). </p>
