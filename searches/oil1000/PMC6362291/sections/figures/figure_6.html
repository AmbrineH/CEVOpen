 <p> Biofilm Survival Rate [%] of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm on HA discs incubated in the presence of BC dressings impregnated with C - clove oil, E - eucalyptus oil, T - thyme oil. The results are normalized with regard to CP sample which consists of cellulose and PEG but does not possess active substances of EOs * - statistically significant differences between individual EOs and various bacteria (K-W test, p &lt; 0.05). </p>
