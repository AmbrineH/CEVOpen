<p class="p">In modern society, forest plants and their products have been increasingly viewed as useful resources, which have prompted research on applications of plant-based products and utilization of associated organic compounds with diverse physiological activities [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Given the potential utility of plant-based products, in particular plant-based oils, it is surprising that relatively few studies have been conducted on oil resources of forest trees, which may be an important source of functional chemical substances. In general, vegetable oils are obtained from grains, and their major components are fatty acids, accounting for over 90% of ester forms. Vegetable fats contain more unsaturated fatty acids than animal fats, and unsaturated fatty acids have important nutritional and functional properties. In particular, many seed oils contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Of them, the n-6 series of linoleic acid (C18 : 2) generate conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), through microbial or chemical reactions, which is an isomer known to have useful functions in the human body [

In addition, the n-3 series of alpha-linolenic acid (C18 : 3, n-3), which are particularly representative fatty acids of perilla oil, can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20 : 5, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22 : 6, n-3) by desaturation and chain elongation in human bodies [
