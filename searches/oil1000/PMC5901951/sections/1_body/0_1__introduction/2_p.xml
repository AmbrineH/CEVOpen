<p class="p">Among vegetable oils that are known as sources of fat-soluble components, there have been many studies on seed oils of legumes and nuts [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], but there have been few studies on seed oils derived from tree-borne seeds [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at characterizing chemical characteristics of tree-borne seed oils: mastic-leaf prickly ash (MPA, Zanthoxylum schinifolium Siebold &amp; Zucc), Japanese camphor tree (JCT, 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum yabunikkei</italic> H.Ohba), Korean evodia (KOE, 
 <italic class="italic">Euodia daniellii</italic> (Benn.) Hemsl.), Japanese lacquer tree (JLT, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhus verniciflua</italic> Stokes), Tung tree (TUT, 
 <italic class="italic">Vernicia fordii</italic> (Hemsl.) Airy Shaw), and oriental raisin tree (ORT, 
 <italic class="italic">Hovenia dulcis</italic> Thunb.). Although these are plants commonly found in the wild, there has been little research on fat-soluble components of their seed oils. In fact, most literature on the use of plant-based products tend to report pharmacological effects of beverage or root components using leaves or fruits of trees, whereas reports on oils tended to focus on simple topics, such as fatty acid composition. As a follow-up study of our recent report about physicochemical properties of tree-borne seed oils [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], here we identified physicochemical properties of oils extracted from 6 trees, by which we evaluated their potentials as oil resources, and provided fundamental data for their use as oil resources.
