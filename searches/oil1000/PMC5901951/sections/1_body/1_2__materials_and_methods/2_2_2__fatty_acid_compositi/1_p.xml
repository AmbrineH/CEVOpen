<p class="p">To identify fatty acid composition of the extracted tree-borne seed oils, the seed oils were derivatized to methyl ester using boron trifluoride- (BF3-) methanol before analysis [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Approximately 0.1 g of tree-borne seed oils were collected in test tubes, to which 0.5 mL heptadecanoic acid (C17 : 0) (1 mg/mL hexane) was added as an internal reference. After adding 2 mL of 0.5 M NaOH methanol to the test tubes, the tube was heated at 110°C for 10 min using a Reacti-Therm III Heating/Stirring Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Rockford, IL, USA), which was then cooled to room temperature, and heated again at 110°C after adding 4 mL BF3-methanol for 1 h. After cooling, 2 mL hexane was added to the sample mix and vortexed for 1 min, followed by collection of the hexane layer. Solvent was removed from the hexane layer collected through three repetitions of hexane addition and extraction using nitrogen gas, and then the remaining residue was dissolved with 1 mL hexane again, which was used as the sample for fatty acid analysis. Fatty acids of tree-borne seed oils were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using Agilent Technologies 6890N (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). An SP-2560 capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used as the column for analysis, and nitrogen (2.7 mL/min) was used as carrier gas. Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 250°C. The sample ratio to the inlet was set to 10 : 1, and rates of hydrogen and air for flame ionization at the detector were set to 40 mL and 450 mL/min, respectively. The initial oven temperature was 130°C for 5 min and gradually increased to 240°C by 4°C/min, and maintained at 240°C for 15 min. Analyzed results were identified by retention time on the basis of 37 fatty acids reference standards (Supelco 37 FAME, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).
