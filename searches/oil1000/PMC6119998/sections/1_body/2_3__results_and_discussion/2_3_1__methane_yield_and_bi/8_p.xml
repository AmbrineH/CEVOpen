<p class="p">Despite the considerable reduction in methane yield with higher OLRs, the result showed that rMBRs could yield up to 23% more methane than FCs. This could be caused by the role of the membranes in preventing cell washout. The average methane yield of rMBRs at an OLR of 3.6 g COD/(L cycle) in this study (0.42 Nm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/kg COD or equal to 0.59 Nm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/kg VS) was also found to be higher than the previous result (0.33 Nm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/kg VS) reported by Wikandari et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], who applied one-stage operation with a gradient OLR up to 3 kg VS/(m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> day). This proved the advantage of two-stage operation.
