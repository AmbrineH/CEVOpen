<p class="p">Starting from Cycle 4 until the last cycle, rMBRs produced the highest methane yield compared to the other configurations, which marked the final phase. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01341-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows accumulated methane production from the 3 different configurations in their stable phases. Encompassing the cycles altogether, the highest methane production for rMBRs, rMBR–FCs, and FCs were 33, 33, 31 (an OLR of 0.6 g COD/(L cycle)); 43, 38, 36 (an OLR of 1.2 g COD/(L cycle)); and 90, 82, 75 NmL (an OLR of 3.6 g COD/(L cycle)), respectively. The membranes’ protective effect was more pronounced at an OLR of 3.6 g COD/(L cycle) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01341-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,b). This was evident from the bigger volume gap between configurations. It was shown that higher OLRs resulted in higher gas production but lower methane yield (

With higher OLRs, more suspended cells were washed out; a higher amount of D-Limonene might also have entered the system and harmed suspended cells. Fully surrounded by the membranes, rMBR cells were retained inside the reactor. Previous studies using a synthetic medium and addition of different concentrations of D-Limonene showed that PVDF membranes have the ability to protect the cells from D-Limonene up to 5–10 g/L in a semi-continuous reactor [

 <xref rid="B10-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In contrast, suspended FCs in rMBR–FC and FC configurations were might be intoxicated by D-Limonene and flushed out with the effluent, reduced local cell concentration (washed out) and the methane produced.
