<p class="p">PVDF is a semi-crystalline polymer that usually contains 59.4% fluorine and 3% hydrogen [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Fluoride atoms in the PVDF structure are essentially the source of membrane hydrophobicity due to the less densely packed fluorocarbons. The macromolecular linear chain structure of PVDF, which is composed of –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CF
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– has very low surface energy. Moreover, the critical surface tensions (γc) of PVDF, –CF
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– and –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–, which are 25 mN/m, 18mN/m, and 31mN/m, respectively, are also considered quite low. These result in a low van der Waals interaction with water, leading to poor hydrophilicity of the PVDF membrane [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The PVDF membranes used in this experiment were modified to possess a dominant hydrophilic property. However, the inherently hydrophobic nature of PVDF might cause some D-Limonene particles to still permeate through and access the cells, lowering the methane yield.
