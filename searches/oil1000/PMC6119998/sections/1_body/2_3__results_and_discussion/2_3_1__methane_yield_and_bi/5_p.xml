<p class="p">Moreover, another outcome was discovered from this work. As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01341-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, increasing the OLR from 0.6 to 3.6 g COD/(L cycle) lowered the methane yield. This meant that even though higher OLRs positively affected gas production, the same cannot be guaranteed for the yield. Hence, at higher OLRs, efficiency was reduced. More D-Limonene might permeates to the system, causing reduction in methane yield. Furthermore, no VFA accumulation (data not shown) at all OLRs applied was observed. This indicated that all reactors were working properly throughout the incubation period.
