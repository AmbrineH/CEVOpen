<p class="p">As incubation proceeded, D-Limonene might be appeared to accumulate inside the reactors, and cell washout from repeated feeding also started to negatively affect reactors with suspended cells. Accordingly, membrane protection against cell washout began to play an important role in methane production, and the experiment entered a transition phase. In Cycles 2 and 3, the time needed by the cells to utilize all substrate decreased (9 and 7 days were needed, respectively), emphasizing a transition to a more stable phase with shorter digestion time.</p>
