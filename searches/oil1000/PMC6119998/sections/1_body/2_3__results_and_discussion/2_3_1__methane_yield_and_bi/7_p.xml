<p class="p">Another possibility is that some of the D-Limonene particles might have been smaller than the membrane pore size, allowing them to enter into the PVDF membrane. The membrane used in this experiment had a pore size of 0.1 μm. According to Grumezescu [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], D-Limonene might be present in a solution as stable nanoemulsions with particle size below 0.1 μm. This notion is further supported by a study done by Isaxon et al [
