<p class="p">In order to evaluate the effect of cell washout on biogas composition, a content ratio was determined with the assumption that only methane and carbon dioxide were produced during the digestion. From the result, the biogas composition of all samples appeared to be fluctuating with methane percentages varying within the range of 30â€“70%. The composition of biogas produced and the percentage range of the methane content with the different membrane configurations and OLRs are shown in
