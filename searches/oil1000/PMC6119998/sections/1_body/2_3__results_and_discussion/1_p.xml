<p class="p">In order to evaluate the performance of rMBRs in terms of their protection against cell washout in semi-continuous operation, several parameters, such as methane production and yield, biogas composition, VFA profile, and hydrogen production, were investigated. In this work, two substrates were used for the second stage, having slightly different properties as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-materials-11-01341" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref>. The first substrate was fed from day-1 until day-49 (Cycles 1â€“7), and afterwards, it was replaced with the second substrate until day-54 (Cycle 8). The results of the experiments are as follows.
