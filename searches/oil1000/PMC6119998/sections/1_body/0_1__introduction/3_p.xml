<p class="p">In the production of biogas, semi-continuous operation is gaining popularity due to its high degree of flexibility, owing to the ability to manipulate concentration levels and hence to manipulate the rate of reaction by an appropriate feeding strategy [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Higher biogas yield and lower technical complexity lower than batch operation make it even more favourable. The feeding system, however, promotes a high rate of cell washout at high organic loading rates (OLRs) and short holding retention times (HRTs) [
