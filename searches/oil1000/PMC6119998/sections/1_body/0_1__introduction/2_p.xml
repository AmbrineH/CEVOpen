<p class="p">Theoretically, the high organic content in citrus waste would provide a good substrate for anaerobic digestion micro-organisms to produce biogas. However, biogas production from citrus waste poses a challenge caused by a natural inhibitor compound called D-Limonene. This chemical that is also the main essential oil in oranges (90% of the peel oil) has antimicrobial activity that hinders methane production, especially by killing the slow-growing methanogens [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In anaerobic digestion, methanogenesis is more sensitive to the environment than the earlier stages, due to the lack of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of methanogens [

Moreover, the doubling time of bacteria in hydrolysis and acidogenesis is about 1.0–1.5 days, while acetogens and methanogens have doubling times of about 1–4 and 5–15 days, respectively. Consequently, the methane-forming bacteria are more easily affected by the process conditions and require a longer retention time [
