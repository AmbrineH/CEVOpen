<p class="p">In this work, the effect of membrane application in two-stage biogas production from citrus waste with semi-continuous feeding operation was evaluated. To better understand the effectiveness of membrane encasement on cell washout, the experiment was conducted with three different levels of OLRs within eight feeding cycles. Each cycle was terminated at the complete consumption of the previously introduced substrate. In addition to an evaluation of reverse membrane bioreactor performance against cell washout, optimum digestion time, and VFA consumption were also investigated.</p>
