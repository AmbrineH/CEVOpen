<p class="p">Citrus, as one of the most prominent genus of fruit, has reached a global production level of 121 million metric tons per year [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Around 40â€“60% of citrus used for juice production ends up as waste [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This large amount of discarded waste has raised concerns about high transportation costs, lack of dumping sites, and the accumulation of organic matter. Therefore, an efficacious countermeasure is necessary to diminish the problem, and converting citrus waste into value-added products, such as biogas, is deemed attractive. Biogas is a renewable energy source that consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide. The production of biogas involves a series of anaerobic digestion phases, and under optimal conditions, the energy output/input can reach 28 MJ/MJ, resulting in very efficient use of the biomass [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Due to its low cost, abundance, and high organic matter content, there are increasing attempts to utilize citrus waste as a substrate in biogas production.
