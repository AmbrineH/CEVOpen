<p class="p">Semi-continuous operation was carried out by feeding the reactor every time, assuming the previous substrate to be completely depleted (indicated by a cessation of methane production). To prevent extensive gas build-up that might hamper the feeding procedure and lead to vessel leakage, accumulated gas inside the reactor was first released until the pressure had reached equilibrium with the room air pressure (Â±1 bar). Then, the encased cells were reused, and a new substrate was introduced to the system prior to the start of every new cycle. While the reactors were being fed, the equivalent volume of effluent was also removed and kept for VFA analysis. Both feeding and effluent removal were performed using a plastic syringe with the bioreactor being placed upside-down.</p>
