<p class="p">Citrus wastes (with composition similar to that reported by Pourbafrani et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]) were taken from Brämhult juice AB (Borås, Sweden) and acidified at 55 °C. They were anaerobically digested in a two-stage reactor (University of Borås, Borås, Sweden), consisting of an acidification reactor (the first stage) and a methanogenesis reactor (Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden) (the second stage). The liquid effluent from the first stage was retrieved and used as a substrate in the second stage. Prior to feeding, it was first filtered with a rotary drum filter to remove undigested material, and the filtrate was then neutralized with 2M NaOH. During this experiment, 2 collections of the first-stage effluent were used as a substrate in the second stage, having slightly different properties as presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01341-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The first substrate was used for feeding Cycles 1–7, while the second substrate was used for feeding Cycle 8. Both substrates had glucose and fructose concentrations of 7.19 and 6.42 g/L, respectively. The first substrate had a COD (chemical oxygen demand) value of 20.75 g/L. As for the second substrate, it consisted of 2.5% TS (
