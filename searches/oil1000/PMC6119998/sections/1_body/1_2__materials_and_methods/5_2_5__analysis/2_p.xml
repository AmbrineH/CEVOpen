<p class="p">Biogas production, yield, and composition were determined based on a measurement using Gas Chromatography (Varian 450 GC, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A gas sample (100 μL) was withdrawn using a 250-μL gas-tight syringe equipped with a pressure lock (VICI, Baton Rouge, LA, USA). It was then injected and analyzed with Varian 450 Gas Chromatography. The GC was equipped with a Wall Coated Open Tubular (WCOT, J &amp; W Scientific GS-Gas Pro, bonded silica based 30 m × 0.32 mm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary column, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Galaxie Chromatography Data System Single Instrument as the data recording software (v.1.9, Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Nitrogen was chosen as the carrier gas with flow rates of 2.0 mL/min passing the column and of 30 mL/min passing the detector. An injection split ratio was set at 5 with an injector temperature of 75 °C. Meanwhile, the oven, detector heater, and detector filament temperatures were set at 55, 120, and 200 °C, respectively. To ascertain peak retention time and calculate gas production, pure methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and hydrogen (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) were used as the standard. Calculation was later done by comparing the peak area of the sample and the peak area of the standard, followed by conversion to the steady-state condition (273 K). Gas production was presented in accumulated gas volume under normal conditions (NmL) as a function of feeding cycle. Accordingly, gas yield was presented in gas production volume per kilogram of VS of fed substrate (Nm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/ kg VS) as a function of feeding cycle.
