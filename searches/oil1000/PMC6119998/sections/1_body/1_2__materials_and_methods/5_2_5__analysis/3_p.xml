<p class="p">VFA content, including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, and caprionic acids, was analysed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), equipped with an ion-exchange column (Aminex HPX-87H, Biorad, Richmond, CA, USA). Autosampler (Waters) was employed for sampling. Column temperature was set at 50 °C, with a UV-VIS detector (Waters 486, Millipore, Milford, MA, USA) at 210 nm using 5 mM sulfuric acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich) as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Prior to analysis, samples were first centrifuged at 20,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min to exclude the natant from analysis. The supernatant was then filtered using an HPLC certified syringe filter (GHP Acrodisc 13 mm with 0.2 μm GHP membrane) to remove remaining contaminant particles, which might hinder column separation. The D-Limonene content in the substrate was analysed using a gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy detector (GC-MS Trace GC Ultra, Themoscientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The GC equipped with silica capillary column ZB-5MS fused-silica was used to analyse a film with dimensions of 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, using He as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The temperature of the column was set to 50 °C for 2 min; it was followed by an increase of 4 °C/min up to 200 °C. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and the detector temperature was set at 280 °C. Prior to analysis, the liquid samples were diluted with heptane in order to extract the essential oil.
