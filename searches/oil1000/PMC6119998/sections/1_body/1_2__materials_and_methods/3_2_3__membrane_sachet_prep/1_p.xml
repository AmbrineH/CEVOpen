<p class="p">Cell encapsulation was prepared through the same method as described by Youngsukkasem et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-11-01341" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Hydrophilic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes (Durapore
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Gothenburg, Sweden) were shaped into identical sachets with a size of 3 × 6 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Two sides of them were heat sealed (HPL 450 AS, Hawo, Mosbach, Germany), leaving only the upper side open for cells to be loaded. Into each membrane pocket, 3 g of pelleted inoculum was carefully injected using a 5-mL plastic syringe, and the last side was then sealed. The inoculum inside the sachets was evenly spread and the sachets were visually checked for any possible leakage. The encased cells were used immediately for biogas production. The properties of the PVDF membranes used in this work were: hydrophilic with a water flow rate of 2.5 mL/ (min cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), an air flow rate of 0.15 mL/ (min cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>); a pore size of 0.1 µm; a thickness of 125 µm; a porosity of 70%; and a maximum operating temperature of 85 °C.
