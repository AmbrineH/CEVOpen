<p class="p">Anaerobic digesting sludge obtained from a 3000-m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> thermophilic biogas plant operated at 55 °C (Sobacken, Borås, Sweden) was used as inoculum after undergoing several pre-treatment steps. Upon arrival, digesting sludge was incubated at 55 °C for 3 days to acclimatize the cells. The inoculum was then sieved through 1-mm pores and centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 3 min to separate the supernatant and the pelleted inoculum. The latter was then used for the experiment either in the form of free cells or encapsulated with a membrane. The pelleted inoculum used had 16.1% total solids (TS) and 6.3% volatile solids (VS).
