<p class="p">The analysis of chemical composition of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus limonum</italic> essential oil by GC/MS showed as major compounds limonene (50.3%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene (14.4%), and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene (11.7%). This result agrees with that found by others groups in previous studies with species of genus
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus</italic>, where the same chemical compounds can be found, although in different proportions [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The essential oil chemical compositions of
 <italic class="italic"> Piper nigrum</italic> consisted primarily of the sesquiterpene 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene and the monoterpenes hydrocarbons 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>-ocymene and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, at 26.2%, 5.8%, and 5.5%, respectively.
