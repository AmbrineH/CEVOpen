<p class="p">Components such as limonene and pinene have already been reported to possess acaricidal activity against ticks. Limonene, extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> Lippia alba</italic> (Verbenaceae) essential oils of two chemotypes, demonstrated toxic effect on
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In another study, it was shown that limonene inhibited 91% of
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">) microplus</italic> hatching eggs at concentration of 1.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Moreover, this chemical constituent has also exhibited insecticide potential and proved to be highly toxic to mosquito larvae of
 <italic class="italic"> Aedes aegypti</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae),
 <italic class="italic"> Culex pipiens pallens</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae), and
 <italic class="italic"> Ochlerotatus togoi</italic> (Diptera: Culicidae) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], for grain insect pests stored
 <italic class="italic"> Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and
 <italic class="italic"> Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and lice
 <italic class="italic"> Pediculus humanus capitis</italic> (Anoplura: Pediculidae) [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Acaricide activity in
 <italic class="italic"> R. (B.) microplus</italic> larvae has also been demonstrated with essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Cunila incana</italic> (Lamiaceae), rich in 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene (27.5%) and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (26.7%), reaching 100% mortality with concentration of 2.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/mL [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This suggests the major constituents of the essential oil are acting in an additive or added effect manner, thus contributing equally to the observed toxic effects. However, the added effect action of other minor constituents cannot be disregarded. Some studies have shown that essential oils have higher efficiency than their isolated components [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>].
