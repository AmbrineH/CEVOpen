<p class="p">One of the strategies to minimize the economic losses caused by this pest involves reducing tick populations to economically acceptable levels [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. But the inherent problems in controlling this parasite are acaricide resistance, and environmental residues resulted in only partial success of tick control [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The searches for environmentally safe products have accelerated the research on botanical acaricides [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Plants have been used as food, spices, and medicines for thousands of years. These medicines initially took the form of crude drugs such as a variety of plants formulations. Natural products have been the origin of many important molecules in drug discoveries. Different culinary herbs have been screened for their biological activities. The active ingredients from plants are known to possess insecticidal, growth inhibiting, antimoulting, and repellent activities [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thus, there is increasing interest in alternative methods for tick control and growing demand for nonchemical products in livestock that are safer to animals and the environment [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Botanical alternatives, such as essential oils, are currently receiving particular attention [
