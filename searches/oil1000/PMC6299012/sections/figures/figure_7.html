 <p> Effect of ZCO on MAPKs in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells cultured into 6-well plate were pretreated with ZCO (0.01 and 0.005%) or Bay11-7082 (10 μM) for 4 h, and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 30 min. Cell lysates (50 μg) were used for Western blotting of the target proteins. Phosphorylated MAPKs were detected by using anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-ERK or anti-phospho-p38 antibody. The membrane was stripped and reassessed with the antibodies targeting non-phosphorylated MAPKs. </p>
