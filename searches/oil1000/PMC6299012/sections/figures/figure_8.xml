  <p class="p">Effect of 
   <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on Atopic Dermatitis in Mice. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Experimental design for the induction of AD. 5 days after the first boost with 2% DNCB (150 μL/mouse) to the abdomen, 1% DNCB was applied to both sides of the ears on day 6 and 7. Drug were pre-applied to the ear for 30 min. After 3 h, repeated one time. From day 8, drugs were applied only. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Representative photographed example of the effects of 
   <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on DNCB-induced AD in the ear. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Ear thickness was daily measured with a digimatic micrometer. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (
   <sup class="sup">∗∗∗</sup>
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 versus with DNCB group). 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> Histological analysis of AD mice. Representative photomicrographs of ear sections were stained with H&amp;E staining (original magnification: × 100). 
   <bold class="bold">(E)</bold> Histological changes (acanthosis, thickening of the subepidermal layer, cellular infiltration) were evaluated semiquantitatively on a grade of 1–5 (1 = no change from negative control group; 5 = maximum change). 
   <sup class="sup">∗∗</sup>means that
