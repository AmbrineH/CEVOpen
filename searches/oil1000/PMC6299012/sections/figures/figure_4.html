 <p> Effect of ZCO on the production of inflammatory mediators in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells seeded into 48-well plate were pretreated with ZCO (0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01%) or Bay11-7082 (20 μM) for 2 h prior to addition of LPS (500 ng/mL) for 24 h. TNF-α (A) and IL-6 (B) in the supernatants was measured by ELISA and NO production (C) in the supernatants was detected by Griess reagent. Experiments were conducted in quadruplicate and expressed as mean ± SEM ( ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with LPS group). +++means the significance compared with the mock cells (deal with nothing). </p>
