 <p> Effect of ZCO on the expression of COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells cultured into 6-well plate were pretreated with ZCO (0.01 and 0.005%) or celecoxib (10 μM) for 2 h, and then LPS (200 ng/mL) was added to cells for 16 h. The protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 were detected by Western blot analysis. Celecoxib was used as a control for the COX-2 inhibitor, β-actin was used as the control protein. </p>
