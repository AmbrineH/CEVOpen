  <p class="p">Effect of 
   <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on the production of inflammatory mediators in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells seeded into 48-well plate were pretreated with 
   <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01%) or Bay11-7082 (20 μM) for 2 h prior to addition of LPS (500 ng/mL) for 24 h. TNF-α 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> and IL-6 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> in the supernatants was measured by ELISA and NO production 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> in the supernatants was detected by Griess reagent. Experiments were conducted in quadruplicate and expressed as mean ± SEM (

   <sup class="sup">+++</sup>means the significance compared with the mock cells (deal with nothing).
