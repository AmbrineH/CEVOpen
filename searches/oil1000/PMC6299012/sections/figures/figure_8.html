 <p> Effect of ZCO on Atopic Dermatitis in Mice. (A) Experimental design for the induction of AD. 5 days after the first boost with 2% DNCB (150 μL/mouse) to the abdomen, 1% DNCB was applied to both sides of the ears on day 6 and 7. Drug were pre-applied to the ear for 30 min. After 3 h, repeated one time. From day 8, drugs were applied only. (B) Representative photographed example of the effects of ZCO on DNCB-induced AD in the ear. (C) Ear thickness was daily measured with a digimatic micrometer. Data are presented as mean ± SEM ( ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with DNCB group). (D) Histological analysis of AD mice. Representative photomicrographs of ear sections were stained with H&amp;E staining (original magnification: × 100). (E) Histological changes (acanthosis, thickening of the subepidermal layer, cellular infiltration) were evaluated semiquantitatively on a grade of 1–5 (1 = no change from negative control group; 5 = maximum change). ∗∗means that P &lt; 0.01 versus with DNCB group. </p>
