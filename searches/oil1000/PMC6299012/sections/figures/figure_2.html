 <p> Effect of ZCO on β-hexosaminidase secretion in RBL-2H3 cells. (A) RBL-2H3 cells incubated into 48-well plate (2 × 10 5 cells/mL) in MEM with 10% FBS and IgE anti-DNP a 37°C overnight were washed with SB buffer, and then were pretreated with ZCO (0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01%) or quercetin (20 μM) with SBC buffer for 1 h prior to stimulation with DNP-BSA (1 μg/mL) for 30 min. The supernatants were collected for β-hexosaminidase assay. Experiments were conducted in quadruplicate and expressed as mean ± SEM ( ∗ P &lt; 0.05; ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with DNP-BSA group). (B) RBL-2H3 cells incubated into 48-well plate overnight were washed with SB buffer, and then pretreated with ZCO or quercetin with SBC buffer for 1 h prior to stimulation with 30 ng/mL of PMA plus 350 ng/mL of A23187 for 1 h. The supernatants were collected for the detection of β-hexosaminidase ( ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with PMA/A23187 group). +++means the significance compared with the mock cells (deal with nothing). </p>
