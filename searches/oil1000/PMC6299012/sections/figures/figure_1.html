 <p> Effect of ZCO on the cell viability. (A) RBL-2H3 cells, (B) RAW264.7 cells, and (C) 293T cells were seeded into 96-well plate overnight, and then were treated with ZCO (0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01%) for 24 h. The cell viability was tested by MTS assays. The data are representative of three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± SEM ( ∗ P &lt; 0.05; ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with control group). </p>
