 <p> Effect of ZCO on IL-4 production in RBL-2H3 cells. (A) RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with IgE overnight at 37°C, followed by pretreatment with ZCO (0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01%) or quercetin (20 μM) for 2 h before stimulation with 1 μg/mL DNP-BSA for 16 h. The supernatants were analyzed for IL-4 production. Experiments were conducted in quadruplicate and expressed as mean ± SEM ( ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with DNP-BSA group). (B) RBL-2H3 cells incubated into 48-well plate overnight were pretreated with ZCO or quercetin for 2 h prior to stimulation with 30 ng/mL of PMA plus 350 ng/mL of A23187 for 16 h. The supernatants were collected and IL-4 cytokine was tested by using ELISA kit ( ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 versus with PMA/A23187 group). +++means the significance compared with the mock cells (deal with nothing). </p>
