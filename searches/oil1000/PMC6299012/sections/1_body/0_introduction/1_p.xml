<p class="p">Allergic diseases are inflammatory disorders which have become a worldwide clinical health problem. With the allergy patients increasing annually due to various factors, approximately 10 ∼ 20% of the world population is affected by allergies (

Mast cells express a high-affinity IgE receptor on membranes, which is important to the pro-inflammatory allergic response. When an IgE-antigen binds with FcεRI (high-affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin E), the receptor is activated, and occurs complex biological reactions causing allergic reactions, including inflammatory disorder (
