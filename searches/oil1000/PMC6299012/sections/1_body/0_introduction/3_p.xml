<p class="p">Essential oils have been used to treat allergy and inflammation as cosmetic materials. In the present study, we obtained essential oils by hydro-distillation from some tree plants or fruits and screened the anti-allergic or inflammatory activities. The essential oil from fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum coreanum Nakai</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic>) showed the most inhibitory activity on the mast cell degranulation. 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum coreanum Nakai</italic>, Korean lime tree, is a rare shrub which only grows in Korea and China. In Korea, it is called wang-cho-pi tree. Pericarp of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. coreanum</italic> has been used as a crude medicine for the treatment of ozena, rheumatoid, nasal sinusitis, sore throat, etc. in Korea. Previous study has reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Z. coreanum</italic> showed the antiviral activity against picornaviruses (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Choi, 2016</xref>). However, there are few researches about the pharmacologic activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. coreanum.</italic> Here, we studied the anti-allergic inflammatory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on degranulation and IL-4 production in RBL-2H3 cells, inflammatory cytokines production such as NO, TNF-α, and IL-6, and the protein expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. For incremental research, we investigated the mechanism related to the NF-κB and MAPKs signal pathways. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> experiment was designed to investigate the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on DNCB-induced AD-like symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on allergic inflammation.
