<p class="p">Inflammation is a complex mechanism involving the activation and deactivation of immune cells, which could result in cellular and tissue damage causing the chromic disease (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ahmad et al., 2017</xref>). Macrophages are key immune cells in initiating and maintaining the inflammatory response. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a principle component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, could induce the macrophage cells’ inflammation reaction, and stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). When stimulated, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, and regulates the expression of various transcription factors leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which are responsible for the stimulation of inflammatory signaling molecules (
