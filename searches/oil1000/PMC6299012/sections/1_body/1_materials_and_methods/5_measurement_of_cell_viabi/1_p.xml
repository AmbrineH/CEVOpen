<p class="p">RBL-2H3 cells, RAW264.7 cells, and 293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates (SPL life Sciences Co., Pocheon, South Korea) at 1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL overnight under an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a humidified 37°C incubator, then the cells were treated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> at the concentration of 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01% for 24 h. Cell proliferation was assayed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and absorbance was read with a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States) at 490 nm.
