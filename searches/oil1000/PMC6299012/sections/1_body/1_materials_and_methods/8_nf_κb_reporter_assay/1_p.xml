<p class="p">293T cells were seeded into poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma, MO, United States) coated 96 well plate at 1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL, and then transient transfection of a reporter plasmid pNF-κB-SEAP (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, United States) was performed to cells with HilyMax for 4 h. After transfection, the cell medium was replaced with fresh DMEM overnight. Then cells were treated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> at the concentration of 0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01% or the positive control Bay11-7082 (20 μM) for 2 h prior to stimulation with 3 ng/mL of PMA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 24 h. The supernatants (10 μL) were incubated with Quanti-Blue (100 μL) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, MA, United States) for 1 h, and the absorbance was read at 630 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States).
