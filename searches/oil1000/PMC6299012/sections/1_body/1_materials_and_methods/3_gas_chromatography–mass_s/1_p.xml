<p class="p">Coupled GC-MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific Model ISQ LT equipped with both a flame ionization detector (FID) and a mass spectrometer (MS). GC/MS analysis solution was prepared by dissolving 4 μL oil to 1.0 mL dichloromethane solution (containing 100 ppm methyl undecanoate), and 1 μL was injected. A VF-5MS GC column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used. Carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injection temperature was 250°C with a split ration 1:20. The oven temperature was maintained at 50°C for 5 min, then increased at 10°C/min to 65°C held for 30 min, then at 5°C/min to 120°C held for 10 min, then at 5°C/min to 210°C held for 10 min, and finally at 20°C/min to 325°C held for 10 min. For FID detection, temperature was set to 300°C, air flow to 350.0 mL/min, hydrogen flow to 35.0 mL/min, and make-up gas (helium) flow to 40.0 mL/min. Mass interface temperature was 250°C and ion source temperature was 250°C. Mass scan data was acquired in EI mode at 0.2 s scan time rate with a scan range from 35 amu to 550 amu.</p>
