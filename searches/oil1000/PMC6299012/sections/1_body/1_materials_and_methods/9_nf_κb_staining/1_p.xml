<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells were plated into an 8-well glass chamber plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) at 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL overnight. The cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (0.01%) or Bay11-7082 (20 μM) for 2 h prior to stimulation with 1 μg/mL of LPS (Sigma Co., MO, United States) for 2 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, United States) and permeabilized with 0.1% triton for 15 min. The NF-κB p65 protein was detected by immunostaining using a polyclonal-anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, MA, United States) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes Invitrogen, MA, United States). Actin was visualized by staining with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated phalloidin. The cells were mounted by using Prolong gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes). Bay 11-7082 (Sigma, MO, United States) was used as the positive control for the NF-κB inhibitors. Fluorescence images were acquired using Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System (Leica TCS SP5/AOBS/Tandem, Germany) at Korea Basic Science Institute, Gwangju Center).
