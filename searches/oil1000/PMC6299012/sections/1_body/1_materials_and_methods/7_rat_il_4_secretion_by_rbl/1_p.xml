<p class="p">To measure the IL-4 concentrations in the culture media, RBL-2H3 cells were incubated into 48-well plate (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) in MEM with 10% FBS and IgE anti-DNP at 37°C overnight. After washing 2 times with MEM, the cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> at the concentration of 0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01% or quercetin (20 μM) respectively, for 2 h and then treated with DNP-BSA (1 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37°C. The cell-free supernatants were collected and IL-4 concentrations were measured using ELISA kit (R&amp;D, Minneapolis, MN, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
