<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells cultured in a 6-well plates were harvested in an ice-cold cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, United States). The protein of the cell lysates was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad laboratories, CA, United States). Equal amounts of protein extracts (20 μg) for iNOS or COX-2 determination or 50 μg protein for MAPK pathway determination in a lysis buffer were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE analysis and then electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore, Bedford, MA, United States). Following blocking of the non-specific binding sites with 5% skin milk at room temperature for 2 h, the membrane were incubated with primary antibodies directed against polyclonal antibodies specific to COX-2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Tech., Danvers, MA, United States), iNOS (1:1000, Santa Cruz, CA, United States), or β-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, MA, United States), p-p38, p-38 (1:500, Cell signaling Tech, MA, United States), p-ERK, ERK (1:500, Cell signaling Tech, MA, United States), p-JNK, JNK (1:500, Cell signaling Tech, MA, United States), and NF-κB p65 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, MA, United States), IkB-α (1:1000, Cell signaling Tech, MA, United States), LaminB (1:1000, Santa Cruz, MA, United States) overnight at 4°C, and then were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase- conjugated second antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL Western blot detection system (Advansta, Menlo Park, CA, United States).</p>
