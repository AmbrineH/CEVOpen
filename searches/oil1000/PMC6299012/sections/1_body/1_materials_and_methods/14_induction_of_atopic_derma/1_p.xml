<p class="p">All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chonnam National University, and the protocol was approved by the Committee. The induction of AD-like lesions by DNCB was performed according to our previous research (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Female BALB/c white mice (7 weeks) were divided into 5 groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4), and control group was sensitized by the application of 150 μL of the mixture of acetone and olive oil (4:1), and other groups were sensitized by the application of 2 % 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB, Sigma, MO, United States) dissolved in the mixture of acetone and olive oil (4:1) on the shaved abdominal skin. After 4 days’ rest, 20 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (1 and 2%) or dexamethasone (1%, Sigma, MO, United States) was pretreated in both sides of the ears for 30 min, and followed by application of 20 μL of 1% DNCB. After 3 h, repeated one time. On day 6, the same application was repeated as the day 5. From day 7, ears were treated with 20 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> or dexamethasone only. Ear thickness was daily measured with a digimatic micrometer (Ozaki seisakusho, Tokyo, Japan) (Approval Number: CNU IACUC-YB-2018-72).
