<p class="p">To investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic>, their ability to modulate NO synthesis, TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines were measured in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The results demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> exhibited marked activity against TNF-α release in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.0068% (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>). In addition, pre-treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> significantly inhibited IL-6 secretion, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.0023%, which were significantly different from the control group. The suppressive effects of 0.01% of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> approached the effect of the reference compound Bay11-7082 at 20 μM (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). NO production was also significantly decreased by 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic>, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value below 0.0025%, which implied anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C</xref>).
