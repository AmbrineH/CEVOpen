<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (0.01%) or Bay11-7082 (20 μM) for 2 h prior to the stimulation of LPS (1 μg/mL). The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on LPS-induced NF-κB pathway was tested. LPS caused the translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus, which was inhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6B</xref>). We also confirmed NF-κB translocation by Western blot analysis. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated from RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> decreased the level of NF-κB p65 proteins in the nuclear fractions and elevated the level of IkB-α in the cytosolic fractions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6C</xref>). These results indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> exerted an anti-allergic inflammation effect through the inhibition of NF-κB translocation by the induction of LPS.
