<p class="p">Mast cells contain a large amount of cytoplasmic granules, which activation caused the process of degranulation (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Pre-treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> significantly suppressed the degranulation either in IgE-antigen complex or PMA/A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> treatment reduced the degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> at the concentration of 0.01% in the PMA/A23187- stimulated RBL-2H3 cells showed the similar inhibition of β-hexosaminidase release to the positive control quercetin, with an IC
