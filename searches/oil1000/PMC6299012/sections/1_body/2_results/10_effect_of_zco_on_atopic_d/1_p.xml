<p class="p">We determined the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on AD-like skin lesions in mice. DNCB treatment elicited severe ear swelling and AD-like skin lesions such as large ulcers and hyperkeratosis, which were as an index of skin inflammation, and this swelling peaked at day 7 after sensitization. The positive control dexamethasone remarkably decreased the ear thickness, and showed no AD-like skin lesions. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> treatment inhibited DNCB-induced ear swelling and AD-like skin lesions comparable to dexamethasone (Figures
