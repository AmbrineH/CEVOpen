<p class="p">Apart from NF-κB, MAPKs are also upstream modulators of inflammatory mediators and cytokines responses. In particular, JNK, ERK, and P38 play important roles in the activation of NF- κB (

 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> exerted the inhibitory effects on inflammation through regulating MAPK pathway, we examined the MAPK phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> for 4 h, and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 30 min. Phosphorylation levels of JNK, ERK, and p38 were increased in cells treated with LPS alone, which were remarkably inhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> treatment. Non-phosphorylated JNK, ERK, and p38 have no changes in cells treated with LPS or LPS and 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (Figure

 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> exerted an anti-allergic inflammation effect via the inhibition of MAPK pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
