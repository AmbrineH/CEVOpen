<p class="p">Pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as iNOS and COX-2, cause inflammation. Thus, we also examined whether 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> could affect iNOS and COX-2 protein expressions by Western blot analysis. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> (0.01 and 0.005%) or celecoxib (10 Î¼M) for 2 h prior to addition of LPS (200 ng/mL). Stimulation of the RAW264.7 cells with LPS resulted in accumulation of iNOS and COX-2 proteins, as determined by Western blot analysis. 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> significantly reduced the levels of iNOS protein. Also, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> decreased the COX-2 protein expression in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells, especially the 0.01% of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> showed the remarkable effect on the inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS expression (Figure
