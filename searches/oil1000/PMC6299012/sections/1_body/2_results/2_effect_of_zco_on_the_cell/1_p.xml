<p class="p">Effect of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on cell viability was evaluated by MTS, respectively, in RBL-2H3, RAW264.7 and 293T cells to ensure that its anti-allergic inflammatory effects was not due to the cell death in each condition. Treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> for 24 h at the concentrations of 0.0025, 0.005, and 0.01% showed no significant cytotoxic effects. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> at the concentrations of 0.0025 and 0.005% showed the increased cell growth of RBL-2H3 and RAW264.7 cells (Figure
