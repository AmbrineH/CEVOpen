<p class="p">Modulation of inflammatory cytokines from mast cells is one of the key indicators of reduced allergic symptoms, and IL-4 is considered the most important therapeutic step for allergic inflammation diseases (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoesel and Schmid, 2013</xref>). So, we examined whether 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> could regulate a pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in RBL-2H3 cells. The inhibitory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> on IL-4 release were measured in sensitized RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by DNP-BSA or PMA/A23187. 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> inhibited IL-4 secretion from DNP-BSA-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells with an IC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.0059% (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>), suggesting that 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> can modulate mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory responses.
