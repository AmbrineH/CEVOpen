<p class="p">Macrophage cells are the key immune cells in the initial period of inflammation. After macrophages are activated by LPS, a series of inflammatory mediators will be released (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines are key pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, LPS induced macrophages have usually been used for assessing the anti-inflammatory effects of various agents. In this paper, the anti-inflammatory activities of the

 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> showed the significant reduction on the TNF-α and IL-6 production, respectively, with an IC

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A,B</xref>). NO is an endogenous free radical which is low in the human body. Inhibition of NO production is usually used as an important treatment for inflammation-related diseases (
