<p class="p">In the present study, we had screened 15 essential oils from natural plants on anti-allergic inflammatory activities, and the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum coreanum Nakai</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic>) showed the highest inhibitory activity on the mast cell degranulation. We identified 37 constituents from

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and β-Ocimene was predominant component (24.48%) followed by (-)-α-pinene (16.56%), 4-carvomenthenol (11.61%), sabinene (10.81%), linalool (10.09%), o-cymene (3.56%), β-phellandrene (3.15%), limonene (2.63%), and α-terpineol (1.74%). Some studies have demonstrated that glycoproteins from
