 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> inhibits mast cell degranulation using RBL-2H3 cells. First, we found 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> profoundly affected anti-DNP IgE-induced local allergic reaction and PMA plus A23187-induced systemic allergic reaction. Degradation of granules in mast cells leads to the release of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase along with histamine. Therefore, β-hexosaminidase is often used as a marker to measure the efficacy of new drugs in preventing mast cell activation and degranulation (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Using this assay, we confirmed that 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> significantly inhibited anti-DNP IgE-mediated and PMA/A23187-stimulated β-hexosaminidase release (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). Mediators such as cytokines (IL-4, TNF-α, etc.) from the cells are involved in the late phase reaction of allergy. Also, IL-4 could modulate the inflammatory response owing to its ability to affect adhesion molecule expression and cytokine production in endothelial cells (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Do et al., 2017</xref>). Our results exhibited dose-dependent effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> against both anti-DNP IgE-mediated and PMA/A23187-stimulated IL-4 production (Figure

 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> may be a promising new anti-allergic inflammatory agent.
