<p class="p">NF-κB and MAPK pathways are two major mechanisms which regulate LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines production. Activation of NF-κB by the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α causes the translocation of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus. This, in turn, activates the transcription of specific target genes such as TNF-α and IL-6 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6B,C</xref>). This means that NF-κB pathway is involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Song et al., 2018</xref>). RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> for 4 h, and then stimulated with LPS for 30 min. We found that LPS-induced overexpression of phosphorylated JNK, ERK, and p38 levels was reduced by 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> treatment (Figure

 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> exerts anti-allergic inflammatory effects by inhibition of NF-κB activation and MAPK phosphorylation.
