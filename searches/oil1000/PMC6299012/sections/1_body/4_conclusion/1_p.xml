<p class="p">The present study reveals that the 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> inhibits the degranulation and IL-4 production both in IgE/Ag and PMA/A23187-activated mast cell. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> is an effective inhibitor of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators in RAW264.7 macrophages through suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK signal pathways. 
 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> treatment inhibited DNCB-induced ear swelling and AD-like skin lesions. These findings suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic> may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of anti-allergic inflammatory disease by the inhibition of NF-κB activity and MAPKs phosphorylation. Further studies are needed to characterize some pharmacologic activities of the 37 Chemical compositions validated from 
 <italic class="italic">ZCO</italic>.
