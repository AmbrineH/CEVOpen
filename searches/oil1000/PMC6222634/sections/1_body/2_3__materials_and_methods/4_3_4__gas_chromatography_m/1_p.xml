<p class="p">The EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> were analyzed by GC/MS using an Agilent 7890A GC system equipped with a 5975C quadrupole mass spectrometer and a 7693 autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Ten microliters of EOs were dissolved in 1 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane for each oil sample, and 1 µL of the sample solution was injected. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The inlet temperature was set to 250 °C with a split injection mode for a split ratio of 50:1. Separation was performed on two columns with different polarity, non-polar DB-5MS (column 1) and polar DB-WAX (column 2) capillary columns (Agilent J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) with the same dimensions of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness. The oven temperature program was as follows: (1) Column 1: the initial temperature was 45 °C (held for 2 min); it then increased to 130 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min (held for 10 min), to 150 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and finally to 250 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and isothermal for 10 min at 280 °C with a total experiment time of 70 min; (2) Column 2: the initial temperature was 40 °C (held for 4 min); it then increased to 200 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and to 240 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min. Triplicate injections were made for each sample.
