<p class="p">Studies in topical application were performed with adult bugs, which were separated in the Petri dishes and anesthetized with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Using a hand-held repeating dispenser, 1 μL of treatment solution (50 µg/bug) in acetone was delivered onto the dorsal surface of the abdomen. Control bugs received 1 μL of acetone alone. Data for the mortality of the bed bugs was recorded for seven days after treatment. There were three replicates with 10 bugs (mixed sex)/replicate. Deltamethrin was used as the standard (2.4 ng/bug).
