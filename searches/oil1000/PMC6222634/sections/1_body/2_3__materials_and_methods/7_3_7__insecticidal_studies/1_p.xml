<p class="p">The bed bug strains (Bayonne ‘Insecticide resistant’ and Ft. Dix ‘Susceptible’) were provided by Dr. Changlu Wang, Department of Entomology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, and their colony was raised as explained by Montes et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] using blood feeders (CG-1836-75 ChemGlass). The insecticidal activity of EOs against bed bugs was evaluated by fumigation, topical application, and residual studies. For fumigation test, the bed bugs were subjected to vapor toxicity in 125-mL clear glass jars using two microliter aliquots of 125 μg/μL EO stock solution that was injected directly onto inner bottle wall ~4 cm from the bottom. The jars were covered immediately with a screw cap and then sealed with parafilm ‘M’. The jars were then placed in the growth chamber, and data for mortality was recorded 24 h after treatment. Solutions were made in acetone, and the control treatment received acetone only. 2,2-Diclorovinil-dimetilfosfato (DDVP) was used as the standard.
