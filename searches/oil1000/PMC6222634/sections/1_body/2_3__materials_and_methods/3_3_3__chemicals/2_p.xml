 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02620" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>) were isolated from EO of 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> and identified by NMR spectroscopy in the present study. Briefly, 180 mg of EO of 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> was subjected to a Biotage ZIP KP-SIL 45-g cartridge, and the isolation was performed on a Biotage Isolera
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> system (Biotage, Charlotte, NC). Hexanes-ethyl acetate was used for eluting with increasing proportions of ethyl acetate from 0% to 20%. The eluted fractions (12 mL each) were collected and detected by using thin layer chromatography. Kongol (23.8 mg) and spathulenol (25.3 mg) were obtained from the fractions 102–106 and 95–99, respectively. The proton and carbon NMR spectra of the two isolates were recorded using an Agilent DD2-500 NMR spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a One NMR probe operating at 499.79 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 125.67 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C. The spectrum of spathulenol was identical to that of the reference standard. The spectral data of isolated kongol was also in agreement with that reported in the literature [
