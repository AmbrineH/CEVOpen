<p class="p">The screening that was employed to test the antitrypanosomal activity of the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species against 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic> was detailed in a previous paper by Jain et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Briefly, the samples were tested against trypomastigotes cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic>. The cell cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei</italic> were treated with varying concentrations of the samples, and the growth of the parasite cells were monitored with Alamar blue assay. The results were analyzed with ExcelFit
