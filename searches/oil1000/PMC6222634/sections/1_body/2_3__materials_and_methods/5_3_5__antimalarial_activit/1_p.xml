<p class="p">The antimalarial activity of EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species was determined using a colorimetric assay based on plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as described by Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. A suspension of red blood cells infected with D6 or W2 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> was added to the wells of a 96-well plate containing test samples diluted in medium at several concentrations. Parasitic LDH activity was determined according to the method described by Makler and Hinrichs [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Chloroquine and artemisinin were included as the drug controls. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were calculated from the dose-response curves using Excelfit
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>. DMSO (0.25%) was used as the vehicle control. For calculating the selectivity index of the antimalarial activity of EOs, their toxicity to Vero cells (monkey kidney fibroblasts) was also determined. Essential oils at different concentrations were added, and plates were again incubated for 48 h. The number of viable cells was determined using a vital dye (WST-8). Doxorubicin was used as a positive control.
