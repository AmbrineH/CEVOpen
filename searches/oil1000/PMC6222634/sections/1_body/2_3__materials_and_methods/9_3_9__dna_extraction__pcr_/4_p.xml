<p class="p">Successfully amplified PCR products were isolated with NucleoSpin
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Gel and a PCR Clean-up kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, cat no. 740609.50) and eluted with 30 μL of Buffer AE from the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, Spain). PCR products were sequenced in both directions at GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sequences were analyzed with DNASTAR (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) and Clone manager 9 (Scientific and Educational Software, Cary, NC, USA) and visually inspected. Contiguous sequences were screened against previously sequenced authenticated samples.
