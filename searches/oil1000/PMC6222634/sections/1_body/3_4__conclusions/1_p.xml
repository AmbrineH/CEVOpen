<p class="p">In the present work, profiles of EOs from five species of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> were analyzed and compared. The chemical compositions of EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> are reported for the first time. Although the qualitative compositions of the EOs of these species were more or less similar, they showed distinctive differences in the quantity of the components. Some compounds were unique to these species, and hence can be used as chemical markers for species identification and authentication. 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> differed from the other species by having kongol and spathulenol in high concentrations. 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic> showed β-pinene and limonene as major compounds. α-Bisabolol was found only in 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic> showed α-pinene, while 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> presented α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, and spathulenol as major compounds.
