<p class="p">Classical methods for the identification of medicinal plants include organoleptic, macroscopic, and microscopic methods and chemical profiling. Modern techniques, such as DNA barcoding, have emerged recently and are often used in plant identification [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Considering the morphological similarities among 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], all four genomic regions, namely ITS, ETS, psbA-trnH, and trnL-trnF were subjected to amplification and sequencing in order to provide molecular data for the differentiation of the species. Only two samples (ECT0000641, ECT0000642) resulted in an ETS PCR product and consequently sequence data. Only a single sequence per authenticated species was available for sequence comparison. 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02620-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows KP2 distances between five 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> samples and authenticated species. The KP2 value determines the genetic distance between samples and the lowest KP2 value of 0.000 indicates a 100% match. The psbA-trnH sequences of samples 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic> (ECT0000642) and 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> (ECT0000647) matched 100% to three different species, indicating that the genomic region has not much variation in its sequence to be helpful to distinguish between species.
