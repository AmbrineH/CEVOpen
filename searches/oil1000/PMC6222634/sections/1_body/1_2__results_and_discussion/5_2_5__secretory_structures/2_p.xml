<p class="p">In the present study, the leaves and stems of all of the 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species showed glandular trichomes, either isolated or in clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02620-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>aâ€“d), and frequently inserted in small epidermal depressions. There were three types of glandular trichomes, namely biseriate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02620-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,c,d), flagelliform with straight body (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02620-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,b,d), and flagelliform C-shaped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02620-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c). Biseriate glandular trichomes were present in all of the species, except for 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic>. The flagelliform trichomes with straight body were found in all of the species except 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic>, and only this species had flagelliform C-shaped trichomes (
