<p class="p">In the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic>, antimalarial studies were carried out for a few species using their plant extracts or isolated compounds. 
 <italic class="italic">B. dracunculifolia</italic> DC. is the most important plant source of the Brazilian green propolis, and showed antimalarial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> (D6) using crude hydroalcoholic green propolis extract (13 μg/mL) and hautriwaic acid lactone with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 0.8 µg/mL (D6 clone) and 2.2 µg/mL (W2 clone) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The extracts of leaves from 
 <italic class="italic">B. rufescens</italic> Spreng. and 
 <italic class="italic">B. genistelloides</italic> (Lam.) Pers. also showed in vitro antimalarial activity, achieving 100% of inhibition at 100 μg/mL against a 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> chloroquine-resistant strain [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In spite of the antiplasmodial activity of plant EOs widely reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], the present work represents the first study involving the antimalarial effect using the EOs of the 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species.
