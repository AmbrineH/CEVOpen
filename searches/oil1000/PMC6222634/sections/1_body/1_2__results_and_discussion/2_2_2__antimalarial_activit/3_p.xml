<p class="p">Additionally, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated to predict how toxic the samples were to normal cells. The calculated selectivity indices showed that 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic> had better selectivity to 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> clones than for Vero cells. This EO was safer than other examined samples, making it a candidate for further development as an antimalarial agent, mainly via the inhalation route.
