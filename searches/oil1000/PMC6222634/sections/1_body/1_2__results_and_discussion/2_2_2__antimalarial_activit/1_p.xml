<p class="p">In order to explore the antimalarial properties of the five species of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic>, their EOs were investigated against chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and chloroquine-resistant (W2) strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02620-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> were cytotoxic to Vero cells (selectivity control), and because of this result, they were not indicated to be used in cellular media as an antimalarial. These two EOs differed from other studied species due to the presence of the chemical markers spathulenol (22.74%) and kongol (22.22%) for 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> and α-bisabolol for 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> (23.63%). Due to their cytotoxic properties, these EOs can be further explored in other cytotoxicity or anticancer studies, as previously reported by Pereira et al. for 
 <italic class="italic">B. milleflora</italic> DC. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Otherwise, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic> showed moderate antimalarial activity against both 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> clones (lower than 15 μg/mL), while 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> demonstrated discrete antimalarial effects. Significant differences in the quality and quantity of the chemical components of the five EOs can be strongly related to these data. In particular, the variation in the quantities of the main components e.g., monoterpenes β-pinene (18.33%) and limonene (18.77%), might be responsible for the antimalarial effect of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic>.
