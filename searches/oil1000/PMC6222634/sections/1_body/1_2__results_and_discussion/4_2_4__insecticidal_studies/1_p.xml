<p class="p">Most of the plant-based insecticides and repellents are derived from plants containing EOs [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In addition, receptors responding to DEET (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) can also respond to volatile terpenes [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Therefore, this exploratory study was aimed at investigating the insecticidal potential of EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species against bed bugs because of the increasing demands for information about effective control tactics and their public health risks.
