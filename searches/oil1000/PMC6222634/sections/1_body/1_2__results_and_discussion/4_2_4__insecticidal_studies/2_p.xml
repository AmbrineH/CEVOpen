<p class="p">The results of fumigation studies involving bed bugs are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02620-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Out of the five EOs analyzed, only 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> produced 66.67 ± 3.33% mortality in the insecticide-resistant strain ‘Bayonne’, while producing 83.33 ± 3.33% mortality in the susceptible strain ‘Ft.Dix’, 24 h after treatment. All of the other EOs showed less than 15% mortality. In particular, 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> EO exhibited a wide range of volatile compounds with no specific chemical markers. In that sense, its fumigation effect could be attributed to the synergic effects of terpenes, as previously reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Several monoterpenes were isolated and demonstrated fumigation effects on different insects, e.g., α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, myrcene, α-terpinene, and camphene [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Of these compounds described in the literature, only camphene was not present in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic>, which reinforces the hypothesis that its effect was based on a synergism of various volatile compounds present in the EO.
