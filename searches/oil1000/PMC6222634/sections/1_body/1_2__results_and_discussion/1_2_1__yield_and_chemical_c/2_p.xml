<p class="p">The yield of EOs can be influenced by the physiological variations inherent in the plant, environmental conditions, phenological factors, genetic characteristics of the cultivars, drying conditions applied to the plant material prior to extraction, the process employed for grinding, the storage conditions, and the EO extraction methods [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] showed yields between 0.06–0.35%, whereas Lago et al. [
