 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] analyzed five species of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic>, namely 
 <italic class="italic">B. gaudichaudiana</italic> DC., 
 <italic class="italic">B. microcephala</italic> (Less.) DC., 
 <italic class="italic">B. penningtonii</italic> Heering, 
 <italic class="italic">B. phyteumoides</italic> (Less.) DC., and 
 <italic class="italic">B. spicata</italic> (Lam.) Baill., and reported that they were qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar. In the present study, although the five species presented similar qualitative patterns, some compounds were found only in one specific species. Qualitative similarities in these species were expected, as they belonged to the same genus. However, they were classified into two different taxonomic groups: 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> belonged to subgenus 
 <italic class="italic">Molina</italic>, whereas the other four species belonged to the subgenus 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic>.
