<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic>, Lago et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] reported 24% of caryophyllene oxide, whereas Sayuri et al. recorded 31% of elemol, 34% of spathulenol, 19% of β-caryophyllene, and 24% of germacrene D as the major compounds. Both of these studies used samples collected from Campos do Jordão, Brazil. None of the earlier studies have reported kongol from any of the five 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species, whereas this compound was found in high quantity (22.22%) in 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> in the present study. Even though the chemical composition of EOs is frequently associated to environmental and phenological influences, it is necessary to investigate whether these variations in 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> are possibly linked to different chemotypes. Not only the compositions of EOs, but also the quantities of the compounds vary throughout the life of the plant. This is related to the circadian rhythms, seasonal conditions, and environmental influences that impact the development of the species [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. To avoid some of these factors, in the present work, all five species were grown in the same locality and collected on the same day and at the same time. Additionally, the sample preparation, hydrodistillation, and characterization of the EOs by GC/MS analysis of all of the materials were performed under the same experimental conditions.
