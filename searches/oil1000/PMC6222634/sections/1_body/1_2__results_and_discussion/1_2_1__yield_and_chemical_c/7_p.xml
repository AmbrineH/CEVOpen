<p class="p">A recent bibliographic review reported around 60 compounds identified in the EOs of 16 species of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> that showed biological activities. The main components that were found in these species were α-thujene, β-caryophyllene, β-pinene, camphor, caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, limonene, nerolidol, thymol, thymol acetate, thymol methyl ether, sabinene, and spathulenol [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In the present study, α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, trans-pinocarveol, pinocarvone, myrtenal, α-terpineol, cis-carveol, carvone, β-selinene, δ-cadinene, spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide, and δ-cadinol were found in all of the species of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> studied. However, significant differences in their concentrations were observed.
