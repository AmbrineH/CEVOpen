<p class="p">Differences in the EO chemical compositions have been reported for 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> collected from different geographical locations. The EOs of the samples collected from Uruguay have shown β-phellandrene (5.2%), bornyl acetate (5.2%), α-cadinol (4.2%), δ-elemene (3.7%), and the ketone shyobunone (3.5%) as the major compounds [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], whereas the EOs sourced in Guaíba, Brazil have comprised bicyclogermacrene (9.73%), cis-cadin-4-en-7-ol (6.77%), and (Z)-ocimene (6.33%) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Of these compounds, only bornyl acetate (1.32%) and bicyclogermacrene (3.10%) were found in the present study in 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> and in low concentrations. α-Bisabolol was not reported in the previous studies, but it was found in higher concentration (23.63%) in the present work.
