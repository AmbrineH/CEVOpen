<p class="p">Considering that raw percentages of volatile compounds are usually reported by the use of the non-polar GC column, in the present work, only these percentages were discussed. Both monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids were found in the EOs of all of the 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species that were analyzed, although in different concentrations. Higher concentrations of monoterpenoids (60.78%) were found in 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic>, which was formed by 27.45% of monoterpenoids hydrocarbons and 33.33% of oxygenated monoterpenoids. In the case of sesquiterpenoids, 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic> showed the highest concentrations (41.66%), comprising 18.33% of sesquiterpenoids hydrocarbons and 23.33% of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. The sesquiterpenoid cyclic alcohols found in the present study, such as ledol, spathulenol, viridiflorol, and palustrol, are not only important in the perfume industry due to their agreeable aromatic notes, but also have taxonomic value [
