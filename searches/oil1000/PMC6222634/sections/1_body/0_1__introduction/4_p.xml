<p class="p">However, few studies have been carried out on the chemical analysis of the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02620" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Thus, the major aims of this study were to identify the marker compounds and compare the chemical profiles of the EOs of five 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis</italic> species, namely 
 <italic class="italic">B. microdonta</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. pauciflosculosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. punctulata</italic> DC., 
 <italic class="italic">B. reticularioides</italic> Deble and A.S.Oliveira, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. sphenophylla</italic> Dus√©n ex Malme, collected from Brazil. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports exist on the antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, or insecticidal activities of these five species. The study also analyzes the micromorphology of secretory structures, in which the EOs are stored by microscopy and discriminate the species by DNA barcoding.
