 <p> Mean percent mortality (±SE) caused by the essential oils of five species of Baccharis against two strains of bed bugs ( Cimex lectularius) 24 h after treatment in a fumigation bioassay. Essential oil dose: 250 µg/125 mL of air, 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) used as standard (2 µg/125 mL of air). Mean and standard error were calculated in John´s Macintosh Project (JMP) 10.0. </p>
