 <p> Mean percent mortality (±SE) caused by the essential oils (EOs) of five species of Baccharis applied topically on bed bug Cimex lectularius. Essential oil dose: 50 µg/bug, deltamethrin (standard) produced 100% (Ft. Dx.) and 56.67% (Bayonne) mortality at 2.4 ng/bug 24 h after treatment. Mean and standard error were calculated in JMP 10.0. </p>
