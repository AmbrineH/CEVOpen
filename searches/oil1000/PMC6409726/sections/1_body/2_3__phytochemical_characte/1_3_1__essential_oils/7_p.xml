<p class="p">The composition of the essential oil from one population of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> from Serbia [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] was similar to the oil from a population in Turkey [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] by the preponderance of 1-octen-3-ol. In contrast to the oil from one population in Greece [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and to the oil from Turkey, in the oil from Serbia, linalool was present in very low percentage only. An analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> oil from another population in Serbia revealed a different composition compared to other oils; germacrene D and E-caryophyllene were the main constituents of the essential oil, while 1-octen-3-ol was present in very low proportions, and linalool was totally absent [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The reason for these variations in the chemical composition of the essential oil was probably because there are different subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic>, which can differ in their essential oil composition.
