<p class="p">Concerning the prior investigations of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic>, it is noteworthy that germacrene D is present in a large amount in the sample from Italy [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and was also present in high proportions in the essential oil from Serbia [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], while the monoterpene fraction is present in all of the samples in a very low percentage only. 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> essential oil from Croatia was also rich in germacrene D, but in contrast to the oil from Italy and Serbia, monoterpene hydrocarbons were found in a large amount with α-pinene and β-pinene being the most abundant constituents of this fraction. The investigation of the chemical composition of essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> collected from three different wild populations in Kosovo [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] showed that the leaves and flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> were characterised by three main constituents: α-pinene, β-pinene, and germacrene D, which is aligned with the findings on the main constituents that were identified in a study conducted in Croatia. Essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> sample collected in Turkey contained high proportions of germacrene D, α-pinene and β-caryophyllene, but the β-pinene constituent was not identified [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Another study conducted on a 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> sample collected in Turkey also implicated monoterpene hydrocarbons as the major constituents of essential oil, but with difference in a composition, with γ-muurolene, α-cedrene (11.2%), and limonene being the most abundant components [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>].
