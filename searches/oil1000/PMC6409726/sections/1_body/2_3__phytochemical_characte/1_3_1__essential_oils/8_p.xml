 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic> essential oil, but its level is low in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic> oil. 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic> was also characterised by a high percentage of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic> had a very low amount of these compounds. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic> was rich in aldehydes, and had a rather high amount of ketones and fatty acids, which were present in the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic> in a very low percentage only [
