 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], while samples collected in two different habitats in Croatia (Biokovo and Dubrovnik) differed in their essential oil composition. The major constituent found in the essential oil from the sample collected in Dubrovnik was, as in the sample from Greece, diterpenoid abietatriene (11.7%), with significant amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-bisabolene (8.4%) and β-caryophyllene (7.4%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the most abundant volatiles in the sample from Biokovo, followed by diterpene hydrocarbons. The content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was much higher in the sample from Dubrovnik, which also showed no presence of 4’-methoxyacetophenone. The authors attributed the differences in chemical oil composition to the different harvesting dates of the samples [
