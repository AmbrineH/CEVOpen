<p class="p">Bilušić Vundać et al. investigated seven Croatian Stachys taxa (
 <italic class="italic">S. alpina</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. palustris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. salviifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic>) in order to determine the content of the polyphenols, tannins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids, as well as the composition of flavonoids and phenolic acids. All of the taxa that were tested had a high content of total polyphenols, a medium content of total phenolic acids, and a rather low content of tannins and flavonoids. The most present phenolic compound in the investigated samples was found to be the chlorogenic acid (it was not present only in 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic>), and in samples of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic>, the presence of isoquercitrin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and quercitrin were determined. Rutin was determined in samples of 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. salviifolia</italic>. Although 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">recta</italic> didn’t contain chlorogenic acid, it was found to be the richest in flavonoids whose presence was determined [
