 <italic class="italic">S. menthifolia</italic> Vis. is a calciphilic plant, with the distinctive feature of a short, glandulary, and pilose stem, and is mostly present in the fissures of limestone or in the open limy rocky grounds, as in the Croatian localities. In the majority of the Montenegrin localities, the plants grow individually or in small groups, often in the strata of thermophilic woods and the underbrush of pubescent oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercetalia pubescentis</italic>), in stone fissures, or in open surfaces, while the habitats of the new Croatian localities are mainly open limy rocky grounds with denser populations composed of larger individuals [
