<p class="p">The presented studies revealed some differences between 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> taxa, indicating the existence of a chemical polymorphism. The taxonomic relationships within the taxa are complex, and have been the objective of several investigations. Although different types of biologically active substances were determined within the investigated 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species, the main differentiation is based on essential oil and fatty acid composition. Tundis et al. (2014) focused on taxonomy within 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Betonica</italic> subgenera, as well as infrageneric differentiation within 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species focusing on these chemotaxonomical markers. Based on the collected data on essential oil, three groups of 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species were observed: species mainly characterised by monoterpene hydrocarbons (to which 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> was assigned), species mainly characterised by oxygenated monterpenes (to which 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> was assigned), and species that contain similar amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes [
