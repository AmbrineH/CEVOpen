<p class="p">The essential oil approach, including its fatty acid composition, was taken by Bilušić Vundać (2006), who through principal components (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analyses (CA) differentiated seven 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> taxa to two distinct groups, first comprising 
 <italic class="italic">S. alpina</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">Recta</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. palustris</italic>, and second comprising 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. recta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">subcrenata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. salviifolia</italic>. The species within the first group showed a high content of aldehyde components, and in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alpina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. palustris</italic>, a high content of alcohol, while in the species within the second group, germacrene D was identified as the main component.
