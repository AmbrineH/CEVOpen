<p class="p">The differentiation of the presented 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species based on the available data on their chemical composition requests further chemotaxonomical and molecular research in order to present a key for infrageneric classification. Througout history, basic plant species and subspecies identification has relied mostly on morphological traits. For morphological characterisation, taxonomists have formulated a descriptor list, such as leaf shape and colour, flower colour, etc. With the development of scientific methods, chemotaxonomy research increased in order to enable separation within the taxa based on the presence and quantity of a specific chemical compound [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In recent studies, the authors have tried to resolve the classification of 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> taxa based on the prevalent essential oil compositions from the aerial parts [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the results vary, since different geographic localities, seasons, harvest periods, properties of soils, and climatic conditions strongly affect the secondary metabolite composition of plant species, especially their essential oil composition [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-08-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Therefore, traditional evaluation methods and chemotaxonomy should be combined with molecular markers that are not influenced by the environmental factors, for a better distinction among 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> taxa.
