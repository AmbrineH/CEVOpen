<p class="p">The dried berries of PD were first ground (NutriBullet, Magic Bullet, USA) and sieved (number 20 mesh, 850 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m). The EO was extracted using a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method after mixing the ground material with water at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v). The microwave (NEOS System equipment, Milestone, Shelton CT, USA) was operated at 800 W and 600 W for 30 min each. The extracted oil was placed in hermetically sealed amber vials to avoid any volatilization of the component. Stock solution of the two EOs at concentrations of 20 mg/mL DMSO was prepared and stored at 4°C until needed.
