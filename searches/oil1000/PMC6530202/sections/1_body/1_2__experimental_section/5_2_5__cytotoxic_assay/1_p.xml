<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of the EOs was performed using human-derived THP-1 monocytic cells (ATCC TIB-202), following published protocols [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Briefly, 5x10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells were dispensed per well in a 96-well plate with a final volume of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L. EOs were tested at final concentrations of 2000, 1000, 600, 200, 100, 50, and 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. The detergent Tween-20 (10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of a 10% solution) was used as a positive control, whereas untreated cells and DMSO were used as negative controls. The analysis of the EO toxicity was performed with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) following published protocols [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The half-maximal lethal concentration (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated by plotting the EO concentrations against the damaged cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Final concentrations of DMSO per well were always ≤ 1%.
