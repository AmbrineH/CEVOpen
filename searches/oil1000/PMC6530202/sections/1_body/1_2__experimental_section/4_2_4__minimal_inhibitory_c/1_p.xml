<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the minimum concentration at which no growth was observed (no turbidity observed in the well). MICs were determined by a microdilution assay using a 96-well plate, according to previous published protocols [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The EO concentrations of 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, and 200 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL were assayed in a final volume of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/well. Bacterial strains were grown at 37°C overnight and their densities were adjusted to an optical density of 0.05 at 600 nm, while 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of a spore suspension (1x10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> spores/mL) was used as inoculum for fungal strains, which were incubated at 28°C for 48 h. Untreated cells and DMSO were used as negative controls, whereas amikacin and gentamicin (for bacteria), and amphotericin and terbinafine (for fungi) were used as positive controls. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
