 <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 14210), methicillin-resistant

 <italic class="italic"> grubii</italic> (kindly provided by Dr. Karen Bartlett, University of British Columbia, BC, Canada). The filamentous fungi
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (ATCC 1022) and
 <italic class="italic"> Trichophyton rubrum</italic> (ATCC 18758) were also tested in this study. Bacterial stocks were maintained in Mueller-Hinton broth (Becton &amp; Dickinson) supplemented with 1.5% agar (Becton &amp; Dickinson) at 4째C. Bacterial strains were cultured in a shaker at 37째C with the same broth. Fungal strains were maintained in Sabouraud broth (Becton &amp; Dickinson) supplemented with 1.5% agar and incubated at 28째C. In the case of the filamentous fungi, spores were harvested in 1 mL of Sabouraud broth containing 10% glycerol, aliquoted, and maintained at -20째C until further use [
