<p class="p">Following our program of investigation with the purpose of exploring new alternatives for antimicrobial activities based on EOs, we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of the EOs extracted from allspice (PD), and rosemary (RO) against a panel of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The bacterial strains included Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, and the fungal strains included filamentous and yeast species. In addition, the cytotoxic and inflammatory activities of the EOs were assessed with a human macrophage cell line.</p>
