<p class="p">Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity of RO EO, a high concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was measured in our study, but an increase of the proinflammatory cytokines was not observed. Another study has reported a reduction of the IL-6 cytokine measured in the mice's colons [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], but no information was provided related to the amount of IL-10 secreted. Interestingly, another study reported a reduction of carrageenan-induced edema in a rat model, suggesting that the RO EO activates another anti-inflammatory pathway [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. This fact is supported by other studies that showed that eucalyptol (one of the major compounds) in the RO EO reduced the inflammation in a carrageenan paw edema induced in mice and rats [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Similarly, human gingival fibroblasts showed a decrease between 67 and 76% in the expression of IL-6 when exposed to eucalyptol and camphor, another compound identified in the EO [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Finally, a decrease in the level of TNF-

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. These results are not surprising because eucalyptol and camphor are ingredients in over-the-counter medicines to treat coughs, such as VapoRub® and Buckley's®.
