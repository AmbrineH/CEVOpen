<p class="p">The cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities were assayed on the human macrophage cell line THP-1. When the cytotoxicity was assayed, the results showed that the EOs from PD and RO were toxic at concentration of 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, respectively (Figures

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 29.63 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and 14.15 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL were calculated for PD and RO EOs, respectively. A previous study performed in Egypt has reported lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> than seen in our study. Although that study used the EO extracted from the same Mexican berries, the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>s ranged between 3 and 12 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL when a panel of colon, hepatic, pulmonary, and intestinal cancer cell lines were treated [
