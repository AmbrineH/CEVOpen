<p class="p">A previous study using ground extracts of PD reported an increase of 150% and 166% of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The discrepancies with our studies are based on (1) the different source of the material used (plant extract versus EO in our study) and (2) the reported percentages of increase which were normalized to the cytotoxicity values (using MTT), which cannot be compared to our results expressed in pg/mL. Eugenol, the major component of the PD EO, has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response when macrophages and lung tissues were challenged with LPS [

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The inhibition of the inflammatory response was based on the inhibition of the IL-6 and TNF-
