<p class="p">The RO EO cytotoxicity has also been reported in the literature. Interestingly, high IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL was reported when the oil was exposed to a panel of ovarian and hepatic cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], whereas a low IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 8.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, similar to our 14.15 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, was calculated after exposure to pulmonary cancer cell line [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Again, all these discrepancies can be attributed to the composition of the EOs.
