<p class="p">The composition of essential oils is correlated with their antimicrobial activity. Phenolic compounds are known to have a major antibacterial activity compared to other chemical groups. The chemical function of the component could also decrease the EO antimicrobial activity, since phenols are usually more effective than cinnamic aldehydes, followed by alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, and hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. As mentioned in the Materials and Methods section, a previous study from our group reported that the eugenol was the major compound (~90%) of the PD EO [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Eugenol is a phenolic compound with reported antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and was likely responsible for the antimicrobial activity in our study. Previous studies in which phenolic groups were assessed against plaque formations in the oral cavity show that eugenol significantly reduces the number of the plaques, compared to the placebo group [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In addition, eugenol at concentrations of 1000 
 <italic class="italic">Î¼</italic>g/mL inhibited the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> Streptococcus oralis</italic>, a known oral pathogen responsible for cavities and periodontal disease development [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Moreover, eugenol was able to inhibit the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> S. typhi</italic> at a final concentration of 0.0125% after 60 min exposure [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In this report, the mechanism of eugenol was reported to increase the bacterial membrane permeability of the pathogen [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], as reported in
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> L. monocytogenes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Another study reported that the mechanisms of action were due to a leakage of K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> from the cytosol of
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Both mechanisms can be connected to a leakage of K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> from the cytoplasm, which produces a shrinking of the cell as a result of changes in the turgor tension.
