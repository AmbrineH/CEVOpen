<p class="p">The second most abundant compound in the EO is 1,8-cineole, or eucalyptol, which has been reported as an antimicrobial agent. For instance, antimicrobial activities against a panel of bacteria and fungi ranging between 8 and 64 mg/mL were reported [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Microorganisms in this panel included the microorganisms used in our study. It is noteworthy that these MICs are elevated compared to our study, but we used the EO that contains only a fraction of eucalyptol compared to the pure compound used in this study. Similarly, other studies reported MICs ranging between 2 and 23 mg/mL and 8 and 64 mg/mL using panels of microorganisms that also included the strains reported in our study [
