<p class="p">In our study, the RO EO was able to inhibit the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> C</italic>.
 <italic class="italic"> albicans</italic> in a similar concentration as PD (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). A few studies reported the activity of RO EO against this yeast with discrepancies. For example, although in our study a MIC of 0.6 mg/mL was measured, higher MICs ranging between 5 mg/mL and ~10 mg/mL (1%) were measured in other reports [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Also, a very low MIC of 5.6 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/mL was measured in a different study [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], but it is noteworthy that this low MIC was expressed as MIC
 <sub class="sub">80</sub> and not MIC
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> as in our study. Again, different chemotype oils may be the cause of the large difference in the MICs. Another study reported antifungal activity of RO EO against
 <italic class="italic"> F. verticillioides</italic> with a calculated MIC of 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Again, our results are not comparable to this study because the strain used was not in our screening panel of fungi.
