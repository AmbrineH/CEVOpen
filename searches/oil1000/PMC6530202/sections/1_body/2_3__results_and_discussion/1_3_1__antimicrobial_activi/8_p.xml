<p class="p">Eugenol was also reported as an antifungal agent against different pathogenic fungi. For example, in an
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> study, guinea pigs were infected with
 <italic class="italic"> Microsporum gypseum</italic> and thereafter treated with 0.01-0.03% of eugenol mixed in petroleum jelly. This formulation was effective not only to control the infection with concentrations similar to the nystatin used as a positive control, but also to improve the skin lesions [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Other studies using
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> were also reported. For example, an
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> study of candidiasis performed in immunosuppressed rats showed that a daily treatment of eugenol (24 mM) reduced ~96% the number of CFU after 4 days of treatment [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Moreover, a broad study including the exposure of 31 clinical isolates of
 <italic class="italic"> C</italic>.
 <italic class="italic"> albicans</italic> strains to eugenol revealed that an averaged MIC of 625 
 <italic class="italic">Î¼</italic>g/mL inhibited the growth of all the tested strains [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Interestingly, our study reported that the same pathogen was inhibited by similar concentrations of the PD EO, suggesting that eugenol (95%) is responsible for the antifungal activities.
