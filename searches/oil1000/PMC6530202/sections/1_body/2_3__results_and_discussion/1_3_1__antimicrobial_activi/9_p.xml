<p class="p">In the case of RO, the major components of the EO were 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 1,8-cineole or eucalyptol, and camphor [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene has been reported against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>. Although no activity was found against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> as reported in our study,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> was inhibited at concentrations of 13.6 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Moreover, the mechanism of toxicity of this compound against
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> is based on the rupture of the membranes and cell wall, and the impairment of the production of DNA, RNA, ergosterol, and polysaccharides involved in the construction of the cell wall [
