<p class="p">In the case of RO, the EO was able to inhibit the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> A. baumannii </italic>at concentrations of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL but was unable to inhibit the growth of the rest of the bacterial strains tested (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, other studies have reported antibacterial activities against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus,</italic> with variable MICs ranging between 0.3 mg/mL and 1.72 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], which include our MIC of 0.5 mg/mL for
 <italic class="italic"> A. baumannii</italic>. The different chemotypes of the RO EOs used in the different studies may suggest the reason why no activities against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> were observed in our study with concentrations &lt; 2 mg/mL.
