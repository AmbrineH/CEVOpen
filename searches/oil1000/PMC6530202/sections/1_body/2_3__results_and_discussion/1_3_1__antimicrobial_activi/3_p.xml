<p class="p">A previous study from Oussalah et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], related to the antibacterial activity of the EO of PD, reported that the EO extracted from leaves showed antibacterial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Listeria monocytogenes</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium, with MICs ranging between 0.1% and 0.2% [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Although these results indicate that a higher activity was shown in that study, the methodology was based on mixing the EO in molten agar, whereas our experiment was based on dissolving the EO in DMSO with direct supplementation to the bacterial broth. In addition, the PD EO used in Oussalah's study may have different percentages of the major components (data not shown in that study) of the EO, compared to our study (as described in Materials and Methods). This chemotypic difference depends on the geographic location of the plants, the methodology used for the EO extraction, season of the year, and environmental conditions in the region, with profound effect on the bioactivity of the EOs [
