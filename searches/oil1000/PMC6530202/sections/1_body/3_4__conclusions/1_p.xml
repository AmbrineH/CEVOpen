<p class="p">The bioactivities of the EOs extracted from PD and RO were assessed. Results of these experiments showed that both EOs have antimicrobial activity and the RO EA was able to significantly increase the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In summary, the novelty of this study is the antifungal activity of the EOs against the fungal pathogen
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> together with the absence of an inflammatory activity when EOs were exposed to macrophages. In addition, the RO EO showed a potent IL-10-dependent anti-inflammatory activity. Taken together, both oils can be used not only for topical applications as antimicrobials but also as anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, both oils can be used as antiseptics, such as in mouthwashes, topical creams or gels, or disinfectants.
