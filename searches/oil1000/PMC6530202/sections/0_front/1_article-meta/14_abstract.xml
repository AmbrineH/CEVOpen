 <p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are natural products composed of a mixture of volatile and aromatic compounds extracted from different parts of plants that have shown antimicrobial activities against pathogens. In this study, EOs extracted from
  <italic class="italic"> Pimenta dioica </italic>(Myrtaceae) and
  <italic class="italic"> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> (Lamiaceae) were assessed for their antimicrobial activities using a panel of pathogenic Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal strains. The antimicrobial activity was measured by the minimal inhibitory concentration required for the growth inhibition of the microorganisms. The cytotoxicity of the EOs was tested
  <italic class="italic"> ex vivo</italic> using the model of human-derived macrophage THP-1 cells. In addition, an inflammatory response was evaluated using the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>. Results showed that both EOs had antimicrobial activity and different pathogens were exposed to concentrations ranging between 600 and 2000 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. In addition, the EOs showed no inflammatory activity when exposed to human macrophages, but a potent anti-inflammatory activity was measured when the oil from
  <italic class="italic"> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> was exposed to macrophages. This study demonstrates that the use of EOs is an effective alternative for pathogenic bacterial and fungal control, alone or in combination with antibiotic therapy. Moreover, the oil extracted from
  <italic class="italic"> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> could be used as potent anti-inflammatory agent.
