 <p id="Par1" class="p">Oils are very important substances in human nutrition. However, they are sensitive to oxygen, heat, moisture, and light. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the modification technology of oils. Methods that modify oil characteristics and make oils suitable applications have been increasingly studied. Nanotechnology has become one of the most promising studied technologies that could revolutionize conventional food science and the food industry. Oil nanoencapsulation could be a promising alternative to increase the stability and improve the bioavailability of nanoencapsulated compounds. The occurrence of oil nanoencapsulation has been rapidly increasing, especially in the food industry. Conventional nanoencapsulation technologies applied in different oils exert a direct impact on oil nanoparticle synthesis, influencing parameters such as zeta potential, size, and the polydispersity index; these characteristics might limit the use of oils in different industries. This review summarizes oil nanoencapsulation in the food industry and highlights the technologies, advantages, and limitations of different techniques for obtaining stable oil nanocapsules; it also illustrates key opportunities for and the benefits of technological innovations and analyzes the protection of this technology through patent applications. In the last 20Â years, oil nanoencapsulation has grown considerably in the food industry. Although nanoencapsulated oil products are not currently found in the food industry, there are numerous articles in the food science area reporting that oil nanoencapsulation will be a market trend. Nevertheless, different areas can apply nanoencapsulated oils, as demonstrated via patent applications.</p>
