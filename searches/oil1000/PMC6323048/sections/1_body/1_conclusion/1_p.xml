<p id="Par91" class="p">Nanoencapsulation is well-established for oil preservation. It offers a plethora of advantages, including the effective protection of the encapsulated oil against degradation, the possibility of accurate control of the oil release, easy administration, and avoidance of the evaporation of the volatile components. Moreover, nanoencapsulation may be achieved by a variety of techniques. Technique selection will depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the active compounds, the processing conditions, particle size and density necessary to incorporate the oil properly into the final product, the mechanism of release, and the cost constraints. Although there currently are not many oil nanoencapsulation products in the food market, there is no doubt that if boosted by recent remarkable scientific advances, new approaches in oil nanoencapsulation will soon be considered in the application of oils in food additives and nutritional supplements, and patents application will continue to increase.</p>
