<p id="Par76" class="p">Wall material is chosen according to the size of the required nanoparticles, aqueous solubility and stability, and other factors. Among polymers, most of the wall material utilized is poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). PCL is a polymer obtained through the ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic monomer Ɛ-caprolactone utilizing cationic or anionic, coordination, or the radical catalysts mechanism. This polymer is semicrystalline, and its crystallinity is directly associated with its molecular weight. It is soluble in inorganic solvents and has a good blend compatibility that provides a transformation of chemical properties, such as solubility and porosity, and it presents a low melting point (59–64 °C). Furthermore, PCL is a synthetic, biocompatible, and fully biodegradable polymer that has a semi crystalline nature (glass transition temperature of 213 K). It is approved for drug delivery by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Due to its slow degradation, PCL is ideally suited for long-term delivery or when a targeted delivery to the intestinal tract is intended. PCL has a high hydrophobicity, high in vitro stability, and low cost [
