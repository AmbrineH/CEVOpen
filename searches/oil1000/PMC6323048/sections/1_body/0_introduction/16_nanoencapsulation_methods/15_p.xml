<p id="Par83" class="p">For nanoencapsulated oils, the zeta potential is usually variable because of wall material characteristics. Campo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] obtained a zeta potential of − 11.58 ± 1.87 mV for encapsulated chia oil with chia seed mucilage as wall material. Nanoparticles of anionic gums, such as chia seed polysaccharide and cashew gum, can present negative zeta potential due to the presence of carboxylic acids groups in the carboxylate form (-COO-) that generates negative charges [
