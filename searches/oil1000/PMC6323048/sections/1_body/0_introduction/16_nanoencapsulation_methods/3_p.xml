<p id="Par71" class="p">Spontaneous emulsification, or low-energy emulsification or self-emulsification, is a process which depends on different variables: interfacial and bulk viscosity, interfacial tension, phase transition region, and surfactant structure and concentration because the emulsion is formed spontaneously as a result of the low interfacial tension from high surfactant levels. In the homogenization (nonspecific name) technique, the emulsion is composed of an organic phase, which has a surfactant, organic solvent and oil, and of an aqueous phase, which is composed of water and a polymer. The organic phase is added dropwise to an aqueous solution. Then, the solvent is removed by a vacuum process [
