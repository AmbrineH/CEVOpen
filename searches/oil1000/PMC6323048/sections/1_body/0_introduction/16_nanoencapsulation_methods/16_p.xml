<p id="Par84" class="p">Another important analysis for the characterization of nanoparticles is Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of the absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects high spectral resolution data over a wide spectral range. This provides a significant advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over a narrow wavelength range. FTIR is a less intuitive way to obtain the same information. Usually, oil nanoparticles are used in the transmittance mode, operating with wavelengths between 400 and 500 and 4000 cm
