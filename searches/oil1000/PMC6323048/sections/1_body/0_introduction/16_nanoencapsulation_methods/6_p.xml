<p id="Par74" class="p">Oil nanocapsules have been produced with the application of different wall materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c), depending on the usage and kind of oil to be nanoencapsulated. Unlike oil microencapsulation, oil nanoencapsulation does not usually involve wall material mixtures. Usually, the wall material is used alone because the particles formed must have a size of 1000 nm, and, as there is a larger contact surface, the fewer the compounds in the nanocapsule formulation the better the interaction is among the compounds, ultimately favoring the particle size.
