<p id="Par81" class="p">Size dispersion is indicated as the PDI, an index that describes the particles uniformity in suspension; PDI values between 0.1 and 0.25 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>] indicate a small size distribution, and PDI values higher than 0.5 indicate a broad distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. Although some authors, such as Choi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], Campo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], and Jafari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>], did not report PDI, it is a good parameter for characterizing nanoparticles when used with particle size and zeta potential. Campo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] did not perform PDI analysis, but they found a bimodal figure in one of the diameter size results, suggesting the presence of nano and microparticles; if PDI was performed, the values would likely be greater than 0.25.
