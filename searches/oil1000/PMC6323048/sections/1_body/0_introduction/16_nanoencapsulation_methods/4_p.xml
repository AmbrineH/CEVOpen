<p id="Par72" class="p">The spray dryer technique is based on dissolving or dispersing the active ingredient in a biopolymer solution. Then, the dispersion is atomized in a heated air chamber that rapidly removes the solvent and produces a dried particle consisting of the active ingredient embedded in a porous wall material [
