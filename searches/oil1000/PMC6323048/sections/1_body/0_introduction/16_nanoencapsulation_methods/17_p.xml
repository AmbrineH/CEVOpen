<p id="Par85" class="p">Based on FTIR analysis, it is possible to physically perceive the interactions that take place between the nanoparticle components; for example, the FTIR results of nanoencapsulated garlic essential oil showed the characteristic Tween 80 (the emulsifier used) peaks. This phenomenon could be related to coverage in the garlic oil nanoemulsion spectrum due to the stretching vibration of the extracted garlic bands. The band at 1325–1450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showed the presence of S=O, and the band at 1675–1600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showed a -C-C=C symmetric stretch, both of which are present in garlic EO compounds [
