<p id="Par79" class="p">Nanoparticle size, also named the mean diameter or z-average, may be established by several methods, such via laser diffraction (LD) and a Coulter counter; however, the most applied technique is dynamic light scattering (DLS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>], which allows the description of particle size distribution and destabilization phenomena. Nevertheless, it is not very precise when used with large size differences; it is noted that particles larger than 1 μm will be subject to gravitational movement in addition to Brownian motion, which makes this technique suitable for the characterization of particles only &lt; 1 μm.
