<p id="Par70" class="p">In emulsion-diffusion, an emulsion is produced after a dilution causes the deposition of a polymer around the droplets, whereas in emulsification-solvent evaporation, an emulsion is formed with a polymer solution and an aqueous phase. The solvent is evaporated at the end of both techniques. High-shear homogenization, or microfluidization, is a kind of high-energy emulsification which uses microfluidizers to create mechanical shear. This equipment works by dividing a liquid jet into two parts. Every part passes through a narrow opening. Normally, emulsions with a diameter greater than 1 μm are first formed by other methods, after which their sizes are then reduced in a microfluidizer [
