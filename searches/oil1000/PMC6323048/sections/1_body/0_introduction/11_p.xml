<p id="Par34" class="p">In many cases, nanoencapsulation begins with the production of nanoemulsions, which are systems formed by oily and aqueous phases; nanoencapsulations are emulsified through the use of, in most cases, emulsifiers. In addition, nanoemulsions are formed with small drop sizes and high surface areas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Some techniques studied for obtaining oil nanoemulsion and oil nanoencapsulation include nanoprecipitation, spray drying, ionic gelation, interfacial deposition of the preformed polymer, emulsion-diffusion, emulsification-solvent evaporation, the use of liposomes, high-shear homogenization (microfluidization), spontaneous emulsification, and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs).
