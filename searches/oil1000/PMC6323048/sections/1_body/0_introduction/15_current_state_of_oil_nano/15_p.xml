<p id="Par68" class="p">Cashew gum (CG), whose structure resembles Arabic gum, is a heteropolysaccharide extracted from the exudate of 
 <italic class="italic">Anacardium occidentale</italic>, a tree common in the Brazilian northeast region. Cashew gum is able to interact with water and thus act as a stabilizer, emulsifier, and adhesive and could be a good substitute for gum arabic, which is more expensive. CG was used by Herculano et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus staigeriana</italic> essential oil (ESO), and the diameter (nm) and zeta potential (mV) of the capsules from the formulation were, respectively, F1: 153.80 ± 8.20 and − 24.50 ± 0.45; F2: 27.70 ± 3.42; − 14.47 ± 1.42, and F3: 432.67 ± 41.47; − 10.45 ± 0.21. These formulations were composed of F1: CG: ESO = 2:1; ESO: Tween 80 = 2:1; F2: CG: ESO = 4:1; ESO: Tween 80 = 2:1; F3: CG: ESO = 2:1; ESO: Tween 80 = 1:1. The F1 and F2 samples showed a unimodal distribution, whereas F3 had a bimodal distribution (nano- and microparticles).
