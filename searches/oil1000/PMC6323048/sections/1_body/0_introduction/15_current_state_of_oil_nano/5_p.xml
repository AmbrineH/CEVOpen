The microencapsulating process masks the unpleasant taste of fish oil, and this bread is already feasible in the market. The nanoencapsulation and addition of compounds in the food industry is a logical progression of the technology [

Furthermore, oxidation reactions, the main deterioration processes of fats, oils, and lipid-based foods, result in decreased nutritional value and sensory quality, and oil nanoencapsulation promotes the reduction in oxidation through the formation of protective barriers formed during the nanoencapsulation process, as previously stated [
