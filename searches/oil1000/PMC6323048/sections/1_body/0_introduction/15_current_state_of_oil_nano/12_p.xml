<p id="Par65" class="p">EOs are classified as natural bioactive molecules deemed suitable for use in the inhibition of the growth of foodborne pathogens. However, the direct incorporation of EOs into food presents technological challenges due to the high volatility of some EO constituents, the difficulty of EO incorporation into aqueous formulations, and the possibility of drastic changes in the sensory properties of food products. Among the components that exhibit antimicrobial activity, oregano, carvacrol, thymol, and Î³-terpinene have been used in food.</p>
