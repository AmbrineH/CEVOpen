<p id="Par57" class="p">In the food industry, the microencapsulation process can be used for a variety of reasons, which have been summarized by Desai and Park [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] as follows: (a) the core material is protected from degradation by reducing its responses to the external environment; (b) the evaporation or transfer rate of the main material to the external environment is decreased; (c) the physical characteristics of the original material is modified to allow easier handling; (d) the release of the core material is tailored to occur slowly over time or at a particular time; (e) the unwanted flavors or tastes of the core material are masked; (f) equal dispersion in the keeper material is achieved; and (g) the mixture components that would otherwise react with one another are separated. These applications are also suitable for oil nanoencapsulation. Ricaurte et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>] and Campo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] studied high-oleic palm oil (HOPO) and chia seed oil with different aims. The first study aimed to find the most favorable microfluidization, formation, and storage conditions for the nanoemulsions obtained from HOPO and the second study promised alternatives to protect the oil against lipid oxidation and improve solubility and stability (TableÂ
