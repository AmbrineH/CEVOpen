<p id="Par54" class="p">The growth of the food discipline is quantified in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b, c as the aggregate number of publications containing the keywords “food” and “oil” and “nanoencapsulation,” “nanoemulsion,” “nanoparticle,” or “nanotechnology” in their abstract; the information is shown as a function of the publishing year. As indicated by the trends in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, most of the growth in the food nanotechnology field took place after the year 2010 because of the numerous nanotechnology studies of the late nineties and the growth of food-grade additives suitable for the nanoparticle process. Industry oil nanoencapsulation applications are summarized in Table
