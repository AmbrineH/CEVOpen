<p id="Par62" class="p">Bioactive oils are usually applied for their nutritional properties, but one of the main problems in relation to their use is the loss of active components during storage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. This occurs because bioactive oils contain PUFA and other substances (xanthophylls, sterols, carotenoids, monoterpenes, flavonols, etc.) sensitive to oxygen, moisture, heat, and light [

The products formed in oxidized oils include numerous free radical species, primary oxidation products such as lipid hydroperoxides, and secondary oxidation products such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, epoxides, and ketones. Some of these products can negatively affect biological tissues [
