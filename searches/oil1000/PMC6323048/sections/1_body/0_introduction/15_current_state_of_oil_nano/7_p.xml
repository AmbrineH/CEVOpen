 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>] simplified nanotechnology use in the food and food-packing industries. Types of food benefits included protection against oxidation; controlled release of encapsulated ingredients (moisture or pH); test disguising; delivery of nanoencapsulated nutrient substances, vitamins, and flavors; pathogen detection in food systems; food safety; and quality analysis. Some food packaging applications included improved packaging (gas and moisture barriers, tensile strength); shelf-life extension via active packaging, nanoadditives, intelligent packaging, nutraceutical delivery, and controlled release; antibacterial effects of self-cleaning packaging; and product condition monitoring during transportation. Applications in food packaging are considered highly promising because they can enhance the safety and quality of the food products. These applications include intelligent packaging, which is able to interact with the food product. However, for oil nanoencapsulation application in the food industry, fish oil is normally used, and the purpose of the nanoencapsulation is to primarily protect the oil from lipid oxidation for food fortification [
