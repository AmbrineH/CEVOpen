 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] nanoencapsulated thyme essential oil and used it in beef burger. They observed that the encapsulation process improved the shelf-life of the thyme essential oil and minimized the vaporization of active compounds at the beginning of storage. In addition, the slow release of the thyme essential oil during storage could maintain, or even increase, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the oil until the end of refrigerated storage. In addition, there were positive changes in the redness and oxymyoglobin content from burger compared to that of the controls, and free thyme essential oil improved the acceptability and sensory quality of beef burgers.
