Bioactive oil encapsulation, for example, represents an efficient, feasible approach in the modification of oil release, the protection from environmental oxidation reactions, an increase in physical stability, a decrease in volatility, a reduction in toxicity, an enhancement in bioactivity, and an improvement in patient compliance and convenience [

Specifically, in the food industry, this technology enhances processed food qualities such as flavor retention, antioxidation, shelf-life, color, and off-odor; extends food product storage time; and protects ingredients from the environment, reducing flavor loss during preservation, and controlling the release of bioactive substances [
