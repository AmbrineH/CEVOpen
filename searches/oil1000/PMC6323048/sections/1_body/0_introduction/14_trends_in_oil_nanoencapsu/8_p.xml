<p id="Par52" class="p">Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that covers a vast range of materials, processes, and applications and encompasses chemical, physical, biological, electronic, and engineering sciences. It focuses on the fabrication, characterization, and experiment of substances at the nanoscale range, almost between 1 and 100 nm. The minimum particle size, in relation to the growth surface area, exhibits unique and novel properties and creates vast potential for technological uses [
