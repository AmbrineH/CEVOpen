<p id="Par46" class="p">The term nanotechnology was used in many publications as a more general term (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). When using the combination of these terms and “oil” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), an increase in publications involving the term “nanoparticles” is observed. The number of publications involving “nanoemulsion” and “oils” have increased significantly since 2010, either in general areas or those related to food (Fig.
