<p id="Par49" class="p">The term “nanoparticle” is a collective name for both nanospheres and nanocapsules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Nanocapsules possess a polymeric membrane with a liquid nucleus, in which the active compound is confined to a cavity consisting of an inner liquid core surrounded by a polymeric membrane (the core shell structure can be lipophilic or hydrophilic) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. On the other hand, nanospheres can be defined as solid colloidal fragments in which bioactive composts are diffuse, captured, encapsulated, and chemically chained to or adsorbed into the polymer matrix. The polymer matrix forms a porous or solid matrix, and the core can likely turn into a solid material relying on the copolymer structure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Nanoparticles are usually coated with nonionic surfactants to reduce immunological interactions and help reduce molecular interactions of the chemical groups on the particle surface (van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, or hydrophobic interactions). The intracellular uptake of nanoparticles is higher than that of other encapsulated systems. According to the applied methodology, nanocapsules may act as a vehicle to the retained active material to the polymeric inner membrane. The oil released from these systems can be transported from the nanoparticles to the target tissue by desorption, diffusion, or erosion [
