 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>], food currently contains structures at the micro and nanoscale. Fruit juice is composed by plant material that was built from nanoscale ingredients, while Bailey’s Irish Cream contained nanoemulsions with an average droplet size of 190 nm. Margarine had water droplets smaller than 10 μm across, with even smaller fat crystals interspersed in them. The naturally occurring nanomaterials found in food ranged from particles smaller than 100 nm found in drinks such as tea, beer, and coffee to protein structures of approximately 300 nm found in eggs or soy to larger oil particles of approximately 800 nm found in substances such as milk. All fresh and processed food was structured at the nanoscale, and consequently, the body evolved over time to deal with nanoscaled materials.
