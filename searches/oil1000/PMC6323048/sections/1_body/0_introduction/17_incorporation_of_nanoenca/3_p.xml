<p id="Par88" class="p">Concerning nanotechnology regulation, there are a number of ongoing EU research projects aimed at addressing all aspects of nanosafety, including toxicology, ecotoxicology, risk assessment, exposure assessment, mechanisms of interaction, and standardization. Examples of ongoing EU projects include the NanoLyse project, which is dedicated to the development of analytical tools for the detection and characterization of engineered nanoparticles in food, and the NanoReTox project, which seeks to address the human health and environmental implications of exposure to engineered nanoparticles [

However, regulatory institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA or the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started addressing the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling, or labeling.
