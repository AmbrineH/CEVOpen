<p id="Par89" class="p">Although there is no specific nanoparticle regulation, there are some food industry patent documents deposited in different countries. WO2018029626, a patent application from Argentina, focused on chia oil with an edible nanoemulsion. It described a chia oil nanoemulsion comprising between 10 and 20% of chia oil (
 <italic class="italic">Salvia hispanica L.</italic>), between 2 and 5% of polysorbate, between 0.5 and 5% of at least one emulsifier other than the polysorbate, between 0.05 and 0.2% of at least one antioxidant, and water. Formulations of edible chia oil nanoemulsions used in transparent drinks and desserts, such as juices and jellies, were disclosed [

A patent application from the Republic of Korea, KR20160005182, focused on cinnamon oil nanoemulsions to inhibit the development and increase of dangerous food microorganisms. Furthermore, this invention could not only be used for food additives, food packaging materials, preservatives, etc. but also be utilized in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. A mustard oil nanoemulsion application patent from China, CN103315956, was prepared to alleviate the pungent smell of mustard oil to avoid volatilization, and the mustard oil may be used for bacterial resistance in food and drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>]. Wang Weichun Feng Wei submitted an application patent from China, CN103750050, describing a palm oil nanoemulsion that solved the problems of high grease costs, low absorption rates, low oil content in the existing prepared palm oil nanoemulsions, large granularity, poor stability, long production periods, high equipment investments, and high production costs in existing young animal feeds. The palm oil nanoemulsion was prepared by mixing an emulsifier with palm oil, cutting and emulsifying the mixture, and ultrasonically performing cell breaking in the mixture. The process was simple, the entire reaction process was easily controlled, the entire process production period was short, the equipment investment and production costs were low, the oil content of the produced nanoemulsion was high, the distribution granularity was small, the stability was good, and the digestion by livestock increased [
