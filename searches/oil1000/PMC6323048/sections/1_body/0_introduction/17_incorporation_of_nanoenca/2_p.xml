<p id="Par87" class="p">Few studies have been performed on the incorporation of nanotechnology incorporation into trade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Furthermore, no products that contained oil nanoencapsulation were found in the market. However, there are numerous oil microencapsulation products that can be found in trade, and there is an article that highlights this information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. This finding may be attributed to the fact that, in general, nanotechnology is relatively new, and it is a relatively complex technology to employ. However, it is possible to notice some similarities between the methods used for the micro and nanoencapsulation of oils. In addition, the regulation gap in nanotechnology raises some uncertainties about the use of this technology in the market.
