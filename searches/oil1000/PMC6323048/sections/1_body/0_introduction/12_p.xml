<p id="Par35" class="p">The purpose of this study is to survey the potential and current applications of oil encapsulation in the food industry, illustrating the key benefits of and opportunities for innovation and also considering future challenges, including current products in the food market and patent application. New nanoencapsulated oil products and patent applications lend promise for the use of oil in various industry sectors. Furthermore, micro- and nanoencapsulation can promote (a) a reduction in the evaporation or transfer rate of the core material to the outside environment; (b) core material protection from degradation by a reduction in the reactivity to the outside environment; (c) control of the rate of core material release, either slowly over time or at a particular time; (d) modification of the physical characteristics of the original material to allow easier handling; (e) masking of an unwanted flavor or taste of the core material; (f) separation of the mixture components that would otherwise react with one another; and (g) dilution of core materials when only small amounts are required to achieve uniform dispersion in the host material [
