<p id="Par43" class="p">Rice bran oil nanocapsules were synthetized using poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) as wall material to evaluate their protective effect against UVB radiation-induced skin injury in mice, and the authors concluded that rice bran nanocapsules (200 nm, potential zeta of − 9 mV and a low polydispersity index (PDI) of &lt; 0.2) inhibited 60% of the edema induced by UVB irradiation [
