<p id="Par41" class="p">Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have gained increased attention in the pharmaceutical and food industries because of their ability to overcome the deficiencies of both microcapsules and the previously mentioned nanoscale colloidal carrier systems. SLN are the latest generation of nanoscale encapsulation systems, combining the advantages given from the parent liquid nanoemulsions or microemulsions of high dissolution velocities associated with high permeabilities of the active compound through the gut wall with the simultaneous solutions to the existing problems associated with the physical and chemical stability of the encapsulated compound and the ease of handling [
