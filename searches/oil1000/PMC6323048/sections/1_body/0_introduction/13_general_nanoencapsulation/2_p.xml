<p id="Par37" class="p">Nanoparticles are colloidal particles. The two most common types of colloidal delivery systems with sufficiently small particles to achieve optical transparency are microemulsions and nanoemulsions. Both systems contain small particles (

Food-grade nanoemulsions can be formed by high-energy methods (such as high-pressure homogenization or sonication) or low-energy methods (such as phase inversion temperature, spontaneous emulsification, or emulsion phase inversion) [
