<p id="Par42" class="p">Lipid nanoparticles with a solid particle matrix are derived from O/W (oil/water) emulsions by the replacement of the liquid lipid (oil) by a solid lipid. These lipids are usually physiological lipids (biocompatible) with low toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. SLNs are composed of lipids which are solid at room and body temperatures. The main advantages of SLNs are their high encapsulation efficiency, possibility in large-scale production, their flexibility in the controlled release profile due to the solid matrix, and their high ability to reach the target organ. However, SLNs can crystallize, allowing a very small space for oil incorporation and, thus, a low loading capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The lipid nanoparticle diameters can be in the range between 50 nm and 1 μm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. SLNs have a low encapsulation load and a possibility of explosion during storage [
