<p id="Par39" class="p">Colloidal delivery systems, including emulsions, can be designed to incorporate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into aqueous environments to improve the systemâ€™s oxidative stability. Most of these emulsion-based delivery systems contain particles that have dimensions similar to the wavelength of light, and they therefore scatter light strongly, leading to high turbidity or opacity. For certain applications, it is advantageous to use a transparent delivery system so that it can be incorporated into optically clear food or beverage products, such as some fortified waters, soft drinks, and dressings [
