<p class="p">Based on these observations, the endothelial dysfunction was found to be associated with the following features: reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, increased anticoagulant properties, increased platelet aggregation, increased expression of adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cytokines (

In that regard, oxidative stress induced by excessive ROS generation has emerged as a crucial common mechanism in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction, which, in turn, contributes to the early or late stages of atherosclerosis and subsequent CVD (
