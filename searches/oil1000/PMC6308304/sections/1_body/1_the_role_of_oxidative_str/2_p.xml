<p class="p">Furthermore, it was established that abnormalities in nitric oxide production and/or bioavailability accompany or even precede diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). Nitric oxide plays a prominent role in vascular homeostasis, and the reduction of its bioavailability is the major cause of the onset of endothelial dysfunction (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>). The uncontrolled ROS production alters the vascular tone, which is mediated by the reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide, the most potent endogenous vasodilator (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Consequently, the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation is the striking feature of endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, reduced nitric oxide levels are not sufficient to relax SMCs, therefore, impaired vasorelaxation is also closely associated with hypertension, a highly prevalent cardiovascular risk factor for atherosclerosis and CVD (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). The other effects of low nitric oxide bioavailability are atherogenic and thrombogenic and associated with the promotion of platelet aggregation, adhesion of inflammatory cells, fibrinolysis, and SMC proliferation that are seen in the developmental process of atheromatous plaques (
