<p class="p">Accumulated data indicated that olive oil and its phenolic compounds have properties that broadly explain the cardioprotective effects of dietary patterns, where olive oil is the most essentially consumed fat. Since many general reviews on olive and its biophenols have been presented, in this paper we focused on the evidence of the cellular and molecular actions of these compounds that emerged in the last two decades. Thus, numerous epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies suggested that the consistent intake of olive oil can limit oxidative damage and inflammation, thereby restoring endothelial function and slowing atherogenic development as well as aiding in the control of cardiovascular risk factors. However, it should be emphasized that the oxidative stress hypothesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis is still debated following the inconclusive results of antioxidant clinical trials. Some researchers expressed the point of view that oxidative stress may not play the primary role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In terms of olive oil and its biophenols, their true contribution to cardioprotection is yet to be fully elucidated. Further high-quality human studies are required, in order to validate the numerous biological properties of these compounds, i.e., whether their biological effects can be achieved via normal dietary exposure to olive oil. However, the available evidence on olive oil vasculoprotective effects is abundant, which scientifically enables recommending its consumption as the major type of dietary fat. Pharmacological activities at the molecular level of olive oil compounds can be used as potential preventive and/or anti-atherosclerotic therapeutic targets.</p>
