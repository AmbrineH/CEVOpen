<p class="p">The major phenolic compounds of olive showed inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation, which is implicated in the development of endothelial dysfunction. In view of that, phenolic compounds, such as hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein aglycone and luteolin were described as potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation in several experiments

Besides, the cyclooxygenase-independent inhibitory effect of oleocanthal on platelet aggregation was demonstrated proposing that this effect was associated with calcium mobilization or blockade of the physical aggregation process in healthy volunteers (

In addition, the high content mixture (400 mg/kg) of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil was demonstrated to decrease platelet aggregation through the inhibition of pro-coagulant factors, such as CH plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and factor VII in hypercholesterolemic patients (
