<p class="p">VCAM-1plays an important role in CVD development because of its tight implication in the development of atherosclerotic plaque (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>). It was described that VCAM-1 expression can be induced in the endothelial cells during inflammation by a number of mediators, including ROS (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>). VCAM-1 supports leukocyte migration and triggers endothelial signaling via activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase), which catalyzes ROS production in the endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>). NADPH oxidase acts as an important source of O2â€“ that triggers vascular oxidative stress, and the approaches that could lower its activity have reversing effects on the endothelial dysfunction (
