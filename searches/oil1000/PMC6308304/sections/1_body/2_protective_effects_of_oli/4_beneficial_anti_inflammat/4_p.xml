<p class="p">Moreover, it was demonstrated in zebrafish model cells that olive oil polyphenol oleuropein may reduce the inflammatory response through inhibition of the activity of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are intimately involved in the atheroma formation process (

Also, it was described that oleuropein was able to decrease the endothelial inflammatory response through the inhibition of the activity of signaling mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which regulate cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation (
