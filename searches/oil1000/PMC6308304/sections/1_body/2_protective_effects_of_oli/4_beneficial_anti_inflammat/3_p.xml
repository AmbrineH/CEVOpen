 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>), one of the main regulators of the inflammatory process at different stages of atherosclerotic plaque development. Noteworthy, NF-kB is in control of the regulation of genes coding for chemokines, adhesion molecules, cytokines, pro-inflammatory acute-phase proteins, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and, also cellular proliferation and apoptosis (
