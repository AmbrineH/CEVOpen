<p class="p">It is important to take into consideration that olive oil compounds also employ their antioxidant activity through the regulation of ROS induced AA release as well as the enzymatic activity of the AA cascade and subsequent eicosanoid production. Consequently, the presented evidence demonstrated that a diet rich in olive oil significantly reduced ROS induced AA concentration in tissues and this effect was attributed particularly to the oleic acid (

In a macrophage culture (RAW 264.7) stimulated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate esters, tyrosol (≥100 μM) inhibited the release of AA and synthesis of its metabolites (PGE2 and LTB4) induced by exogenous ROS (

Moreover, in healthy subjects, consumption of tomatoes (150 g) with extra virgin olive oil (607 mg/kg phenolic content, 300 mg/kg of hydroxytyrosol derivatives: oleuropein complex and tyrosol) decreased the levels of inflammatory markers, such as thromboxane B2 and LTB4 after 2 and 6 h (
