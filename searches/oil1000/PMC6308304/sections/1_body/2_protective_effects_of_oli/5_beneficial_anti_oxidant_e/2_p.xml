<p class="p">It was demonstrated in rat livers that inhibiting production of the O2â€“ anion, hydroxytyrosol, protects endothelial cells not only from monocyte adhesion but also from lipid peroxidation and LDL oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>). In fact, several reports have described that regular intake of olive oil can attenuate lipid peroxidation providing the important clinical evidence regarding the regenerative effects of olive oil on endothelial function. Olive oil providing MUFAs, especially oleic acid, which are not as easily oxidized as PUFAs favorably influenced a reduced susceptibility of cellular membranes to lipid peroxidation (
