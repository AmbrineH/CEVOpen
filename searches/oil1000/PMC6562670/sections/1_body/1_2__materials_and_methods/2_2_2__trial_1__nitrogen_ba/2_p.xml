<p class="p">The nitrogen balance experiment was carried out in an atmosphere-controlled room, equipped with steel individual metabolic cages. After 7 days of adaptation, two balance periods followed during which fecal matter and urine were quantitatively collected, at 08.00–08.30 h. Samples obtained were stored at 5 °C. After the balance period, feces collected from each animal were pooled, homogenized and 10% of samples were frozen at −18 °C for analyses.</p>
