<p class="p">Pig feces samples of 0.4 g were weighed with an accuracy of ±2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">‒4</sup> g. Each sample was processed as described in [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. A blank digest was carried out in the same way. A semiautomatic Kjeldahl method (Kjeltec Auto 1030 Analyzer, Hillerod, Denmark) was used to determine the nitrogen content in the excretions. The samples were digested using H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in the presence of catalyzers, followed by distillation and titration. Class A glassware was used for transvasation, dilution and storage. All reagents used were supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For calibration stock solutions traceable to standard reference material (SRM) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) were used for calibration. Nitrogen digestibility as well as balanced or retained nitrogen (NR) were determined by measuring nitrogen intake (dry matter (DM) basis) and nitrogen excretion. Nitrogen absorption (NAB), BVFP and NPU were calculated according to [
