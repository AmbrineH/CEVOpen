<p class="p">Based on experimental data, NAB, NR, total nitrogen output (TNO), BVFP, NPU, CTTAD and CAM were calculated according to previously developed equations [

 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Nitrogen digestibility, and balanced or retained nitrogen (NR) were determined by measuring nitrogen intake (DM basis) and nitrogen excretion. TNO was calculated as the difference between nitrogen intake and fecal nitrogen. BVFP was calculated as the ratio of NR to NAB. NPU was calculated as the ratio of NR to NI. CTTAD and CAM were calculated using the following equations: CAM = ((N intake − N fecal output − N urinary output)/N intake); CTTAD = ((N intake – fecal N output)/N intake).
