<p class="p">It is known that blood parameters serve as markers that give some information about animal health status (physiological, nutritional, pathological changes) as well as the quality of feed. Following the catabolism of AA, urea is the principal nitrogen end product used as an index of animal ability to retain dietary nitrogen and an indicator of feed efficiency [

Despite the similar levels of AA in the diet, the PUN concentration increased 5.8% in the LEW group, leading to an increase of urea excretion as result of AA catabolism [

The creatinine concentration was markedly lower in the LEW group compared to the SM group. As expected, when PUN increased creatinine decreased, while the PUN:creatinine ratio increased significantly. Previous studies have shown that an increase in the PUN concentration improves protein accretion [
