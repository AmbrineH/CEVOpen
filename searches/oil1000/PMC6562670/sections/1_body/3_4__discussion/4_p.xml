<p class="p">A marked influence was established on n-3 FA, especially ALA, by the dietary addition of n-3-rich supplements at the tissue level. The most pronounced effect was noticed in the heart (&gt;6.88 times), followed by the cecum (&gt;6.06 times) and liver (&gt;4.89 times). It was specified previously that DPA is an intermediate for DHA synthesis from EPA [

 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], dietary linseed determines a rapid response in animal organisms. However, the response also depends on quantity and time. The diet with n-3 enrichment (by EL:WM addition) in our study had a positive effect on total n-3 FA and on the n-6:n-3 ratio (
