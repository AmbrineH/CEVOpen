As mentioned above, the first limiting AA in swine nutrition is Lys, which is a ketogenic AA. Lys concentration increased in tissue of the LEW group by 10.9%. It is established that Lys decreases the nitrogen excretion in urine in association with TNO and maintains performance [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Although the diets had similar Lys contents, the LEW diet increased the concentration of this AA in various tissues (43% in heart, 9% in spleen and 4% in liver,

The greater proportion was observed in the LD muscle and heart. Met + Cys were negatively correlated with TNO (r = âˆ’0.57,
