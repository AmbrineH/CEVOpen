<p class="p">The results obtained in this work suggest that although nitrogen intake was similar between groups, TNO was significantly reduced (&lt;14.66%) by the dietary addition of EL:WM. Known as a biological marker for protein intake [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], in our study urine nitrogen excretion was found to be positively correlated with nitrogen intake (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the LEW group had a significant effect on TNO. A positive nitrogen balance was noticed, indicating that the nitrogen intake exceeded the nitrogen lost. The NR value was slightly higher in the LEW group, and was positively correlated with BVFT and NPU. The current results are close to those obtained in [
