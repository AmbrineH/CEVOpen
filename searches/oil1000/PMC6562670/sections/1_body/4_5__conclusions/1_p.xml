<p class="p">Nitrogen is vital for life and a very important nutrient. Overall, the results show that n-3 FA enrichment diet had a significant impact on nitrogen metabolism. The addition of LE:WM mixture reduced nitrogen excreted and net protein utilization. More than 40% of nitrogen was retained which led to a higher efficiency of nitrogen utilization. The dietary addition of extruded linseed associated with walnut meal favored deposition in the tissue of n-3 PUFA, especially ALA of which their health effects are well known.</p>
