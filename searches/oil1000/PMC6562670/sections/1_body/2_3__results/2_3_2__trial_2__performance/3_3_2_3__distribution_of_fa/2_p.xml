<p class="p">As expected, diet had a more pronounced effect on the concentration of n-3 FA, particularly on ALA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The higher level of ALA was recorded in cecum (&gt;6.06 times in the LEW group compared to the SM group), followed by heart (&gt;5.44 times in the LEW group compared to the SM group) and liver (&gt;4.89 times in the LEW group compared to the SM group). Although LD and ST muscles are distinguishable by the metabolic activity of their fiber (LD has more oxidative and ST has more glycolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]), the ALA concentrations were similar in both. A greater decrease of the n-6:n-3 ratio was noticed in the LEW group, irrespective of the tissue (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Thus, a lower n-6:n-3 ratio was noticed in the spleen, liver and cecum (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A significant diet × tissue interaction was noticed in LCFA (long chain FA; docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), ⅀n-3 and n:6-n-3 ratio. A tendency regarding the additive effects of diet and tissue were observed for ALA. We found a negative correlation between dietary n-6:n-3 and tissue ALA (r = –0.65, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while dietary ALA was positively and significantly correlated with tissue ALA concentration (r = 0.65, 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00234-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). A correlation tendency was observed between DPA and nitrogen level in tissue (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.10). A negative correlation was found between ALA in tissue and TNO (r = −0.57, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and a positive correlation was found between dietary n-6:n-3 and tissue n-6:n-3 (r = 0.51, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). A positive relationship was also registered between n-6:n-3 ratio in diet or tissue and urinary nitrogen output (r = 0.78, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
