<p class="p">LD muscle had a nitrogen content lower in the LEW group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) compared to the SM group. In contrast, in ST muscle, heart, spleen and liver, we noticed an increase in nitrogen content. No diet Ã— tissue interaction was observed (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00234-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). LD is known to be more oxidative than the ST muscle [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]; thus, we found LD to contain &lt;5.5% fat in the LEW group vs. the SM group. Nonetheless, a higher fat level was found in ST muscle (&gt;11.06% in the LEW group) and spleen (&gt;12.99% in the LEW group).
