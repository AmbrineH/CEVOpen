<p class="p">Extruded linseed and walnut meal are both useful resources if we consider them as dietary additions to enrich the levels of n-3 FA. Moreover, these resources have valuable amino acid (AA) compositions. Extruded linseed has a higher level of methionine + cysteine (Met + Cys), whereas walnut meal is richer in Lysine (Lys). In order to improve n-3 FA level in the diet we used a mixed between these two resources (50:50 
 <italic class="italic">wt/wt</italic> mix). Any increase of production also implies an increase of cereal consumption, which depletes the amount available for human consumption. Usually corn is used in a classical diet, but in our study, we added millet as a cereal with excellent nutritional value. It is known the heart, liver and spleen are key organs in relation to health status and have a nutrient-dense composition, but little is known about their detailed chemical content in FA and AA. In the present paper, the chemical FA and AA composition were assessed in different tissue due to their role in lipoprotein metabolism and their importance as edible organs. Our information regarding lipids structure in edible organs modified by diet, could help consumers meet health recommendations if we take into consideration the n-3 PUFA potential therapeutic roles in intestinal inflammation in pigs, in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, adipose tissue function and inflammation, to help reduce the risk of heart disease and also to promote healthy skin.
