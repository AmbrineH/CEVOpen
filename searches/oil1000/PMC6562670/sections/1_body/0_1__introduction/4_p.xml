<p class="p">This study is part of a nutritional program that aims to increase efficiency in the use of nutrients from n-3-rich compound feed formula and to determine its relation to health markers and product quality. The current research allowed us to evaluate changes in performance, nitrogen metabolism and composition of different tissues (longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, heart, spleen, liver and cecum) by using a mix (50:50 wt/wt) between two sources rich in n-3 FA, especially in Î±-linolenic FA (ALA).</p>
