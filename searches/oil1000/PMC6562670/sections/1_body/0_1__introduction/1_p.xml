<p class="p">The trend of an increasing consumption of animal-origin food products, as well pork per capita, has continued, thus requiring an increase in livestock production. Growing concentrations of animals lead to increased output. However, the consequences of this have been reflected in an increased food safety risk, as well as effects on health and the environment with profound implications in our lives. Thus, safety measures are required, with a focus on the livestock sector. Over time, nutritionists have highlighted that a number of feedstuffs or byproducts from the industry sector can beneficially modulate animal product quality and subsequently have an impact on health status. Previous studies have led to the assumption that, while certain health markers or lipid structures are changed, the digestibility of some nutrients may be altered as well. A major concern is feeding efficiency, as an important indicator of the sustainability of pig production [

For many years, gain:feed has been known as an indicator for profitability, being related to body weight as well as gain and feed composition. We assert that a measure of feeding efficiency consists of decreasing inputs based on a higher quality of feedstuff. This leads to a higher metabolic efficiency in using nutrients. Moreover, the level of nutrients excreted decreases. It is known that nitrogen losses affect the environment and 70% of NH

It gives us an indication of protein synthesis and degradation. About 5% to 30% of nitrogen is converted to food for human diets and the rest is excreted by animals. Furthermore, an excess of nitrogen will affect attempts to meet Sustainable Development Goals.
