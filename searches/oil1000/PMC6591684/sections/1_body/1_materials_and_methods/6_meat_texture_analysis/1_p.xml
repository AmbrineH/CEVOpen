<p class="p">Breast meat shear force (
 <bold class="bold">SF</bold>; g) and texture profile analysis (
 <bold class="bold">TPA</bold>) were carried out with a TA.XT.Plus texturometer (Stable Micro Systems, Serrey, England) in 2 sections on each side of the breast per replicate (n = 24/treatment; 2 breast/pen/treatment) at 4°C. A Warner-Bratzler shear blade with a triangular slot cutting edge and rectangular slices (3.5 cm long x 1.0 cm wide x 1.0 cm high for each breast) were used to evaluate SF; sample cuts were made parallel to the direction of the muscle fibers. Test conditions used in the instrument were a velocity of 2 mm/s pre-test, 2 mm/s during the test, 10 mm/s post-test, and a distance of 15 mm. The SF value was calculated from the maximum point of the curve generated. The TPA was determined using standardized cylinders (1.5 cm high and 2.5 cm in diameter), oriented perpendicular to the direction of the muscle fibers. A cylindrical piston (75 mm in diameter) was used to compress the sample during 2 test cycles, compressing the sample up to 60% from the original height within a time span of 5 s between the cycles. Force–time curves of deformation were obtained from the conditions established in the texturometer. The velocities used were 2.0 mm/s pre-test, 5.0 mm/s during the test, and 5.0 mm/s post-test. The following parameters were recorded according to Bourne (
