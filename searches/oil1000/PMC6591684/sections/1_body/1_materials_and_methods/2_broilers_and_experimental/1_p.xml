<p class="p">A total of one hundred and eighty 1-day-old Ross-308 mixed-sex broilers (46.92 ± 0.96 g) were purchased from a commercial hatchery and distributed 10 birds each in 18 floor pens (1.20 × 1.20 × 0.80 m) and on fresh wood shaving (6 pens per treatment). Broilers were randomly assigned to 3 treatments (diets), in which 2 MOO derived from PLG and LBS were added to the DWt: 
 <bold class="bold">CON</bold> = control DWt (without MOO), PLG = DWt + 400 mg/L of PLG, and LBS = DWt + 400 mg/L of LBS. Mexican oregano oil was prepared by steam distillation (Natural Solutions Company SMI, Jimenez, Chihuahua, Mexico), and was emulsified (w/w %) in Tween 20 (Millikan, S.A. de C.V., Tlalnepantla, Estado de Mexico, Mexico) for incorporation into the DWt: 40:60 (MOO: emulsifier) for PLG and 50:50 for LBS. Mixing was done manually for 8 min and treatment DWt was prepared weekly according to the MOO; emulsifier ratios were then adjusted for the addition of 400 mg/L of PLG and LBS treatments. The treatments were supplied in a broiler DWt container per pen and were monitored daily. Preliminary tests were carried out to evaluate the blend stability and to establish the blend ratios. Emulsion blend storage stability was evaluated over several months at 26°C for the development of a creamy layer or droplets over time. The mixture was considered unstable at the moment layers or droplets appeared in the emulsion. Components of MOO were determined by gas chromatography (Clarus 600 and MS SQ8 PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA) according to Silva-Vázquez et al. (
