<p class="p">The initial broiler weights (
 <bold class="bold">IW</bold>; g) were determined at the beginning of the experiment. Broiler body weight (
 <bold class="bold">BW</bold>), feed intake (
 <bold class="bold">FI</bold>; g intake per week/number of broilers per pen), and water intake (
 <bold class="bold">WI</bold>; g intake per week/number of broilers per pen) were evaluated at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 40 D. These variables were used to estimate the weekly body weight gain (
 <bold class="bold">WBWG</bold>; g (BW
 <sub class="sub">current</sub>-BW
 <sub class="sub">previous</sub>)/days per period) and feed efficiency (
 <bold class="bold">FE</bold>; FI/WBWG) and were determined at the same periods. Weights of offered and rejected feed were recorded to estimate these variables.
