<p class="p">An affective sensory test of breast meat attributes was conducted to measure the satisfaction level of 30 panelists. The breasts (1 breast/pen/treatment) were vacuum-packed and cooked by immersion in water at 75.0 ± 0.1°C for 1 h. Each panelist evaluated four 1.5-cm cut cubes chosen at random per treatment. Samples for evaluation were maintained at 30°C and were presented in small plastic cups codified with 3 random numbers. The attributes evaluated were odor, taste, juiciness, softness, and overall acceptability. A 7-point hedonic scale was used, where 7 = liked very much and 1 = disliked very much (Anzaldúa-Morales,
