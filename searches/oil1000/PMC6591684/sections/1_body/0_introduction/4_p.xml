<p class="p">Oregano oil was applied to DWt by Gámez-Piñón et al. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), who demonstrated improved broiler performance and meat quality. Additionally, Adaszyńska-Skwirzyńska and Szczerbińska (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) evaluated lavender essential oil extract (0.4 mL/L) in DWt and found that the addition of this oil extract had positive effects on broiler production performance and ileal microbiota. In contrast, Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) used 
 <italic class="italic">P. longiflora</italic> Gray and 
 <italic class="italic">L. berlandieri</italic> Schauer MOO in broiler diets and concluded that these 2 MOO exhibit positive effects on broiler performance, blood profiles, carcass traits, and meat composition. These findings could indicate that MOO can be used in DWt as an enhancer of the broiler performance and meat quality.
