<p class="p">The OEO extracts have been incorporated into broiler diets to evaluate effects on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality. An alternative to dietary presentation is the addition of OEO to the drinking water (
 <bold class="bold">DWt</bold>) for the examination of effects on broiler production. Drinking water as a carrier of additives has been studied for probiotic administration (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Timmerman et al., 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Karimi Torshizi et al., 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Amiranashvili et al., 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). These studies indicated that supplementation in DWt may contribute to broiler performance and can be a more practical method than the conventional in-feed supplementation method. Pelicano et al. (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) concluded that the combination of presenting probiotics in DWt and feed increased meat quality (e.g., color, pH, and tenderness). In addition, OEO has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that when added could improve water quality. Amaral (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) indicated that the use of water with adequate physical, chemical, and microbiological quality could aid disease prevention in chicks, influencing cost and yield at grow-out.
