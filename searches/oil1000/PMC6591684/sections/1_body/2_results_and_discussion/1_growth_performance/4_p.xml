 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and LBS lowest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, WBWG was not different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) between groups over the growth period of 1 to 40 D. Feed efficiency was not different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) at each time between treatment groups, as well as between groups over the full growth period (1 to 40 D). In contrast to these findings, Ghazanfari et al. (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found effects for weight gain and feed conversion ratio at 1 to 10, 25 to 42, and 1 to 42 D when evaluating feed containing 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg of coriander essential oil. Those authors indicated that the essential oil improved digestive enzyme activities and nutrient digestibility, enhancing the feed conversion ratio and greater growth rate. In addition, Basmacıoğlu et al. (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) obtained differences for body weight gain but not for feed conversion ratio when testing 150 and 300 mg/kg of oregano oil in feed. The results in the current study were similar to those of Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), who indicated that MOO as a diet supplement improved broiler production and depended on the MOO levels tested. In the current study, MOO added to DWt did not affect the FE, and this observation contrasts with Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), who used MOO in diets, which suggests a different mechanism of action when the oregano oil intake is in feed or water.
