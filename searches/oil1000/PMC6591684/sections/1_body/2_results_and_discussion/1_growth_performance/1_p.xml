<p class="p">Some studies with MOO in feed at 400 and 600 mg/kg (Silva-Vázquez et al.,

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), and 400 mg/kg (Méndez-Zamora et al., 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Silva-Vázquez et al., 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) showed effects on broiler growth performance. Those authors indicated that MOO could serve as a substitute for growth promoters and antibiotics due to similar effects on improved broiler production. Comparisons of growth performance variables of broilers, given MOO supplemented in DWt, are given in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Broiler BW was not different (

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar BW results were obtained by Mohiti-Asli and Ghanaatparast-Rashti (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) at 29 to 35 D for 300 and 500 mg/kg of OEO in feed. Peng et al. (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found effects for OEO at 300 and 600 mg/kg of feed in the grower and finisher phases. Basmacıoğlu et al. (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) obtained differences over time and in the grower and finisher phases with OEO at 150 and 300 mg/kg of feed. Results from those studies presented high BW yields for high levels of OEO, and in contrast with BW gains with LBS and PLG MOO levels used in the current study at 400 mg/L. Differences in effects obtained with different levels of essential oils may be due to OEO in most studies being incorporated in diets, whereas in the current study MOO was made available in DWt.
