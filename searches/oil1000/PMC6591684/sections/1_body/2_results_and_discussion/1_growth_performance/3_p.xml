<p class="p">Regarding WI, treatments were different (

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The CON group gave the highest (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) between treatments; however, PLG and LBS did present slightly lower (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) WI values over the full growth period. Few studies have reported on WI with MOO; however, Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found slight increases in WI on days 14, 21, 35, and 39 with LBS in diets, and these authors suggested that these results could be due to the thymol and carvacrol levels of MOO used in diets, which could affect the sensory properties. Additionally, results from the current study with MOO in DWt suggest changes in the sensory traits of the water as indicated by decreases in WI for PLG and LBS, and those sensory changes may influence FI. In contrast, Adaszyńska-Skwirzyńska and Szczerbińska (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) detected no differences in WI in broiler chickens when evaluating the addition of lavender essential oil (
 <bold class="bold">LEO</bold>; 0.4 mL/L). These contrasts could be due to the chemical composition differences of MOO and LEO, where MOO has carvacrol (60.00%) and thymol (28.40%) as major components, whereas LEO presents linalool (35.17%) and linalool acetate (46.25%) (Adaszyńska-Skwirzyńska and Szczerbińska,
