<p class="p">Feed intake was different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 7 and 28 D, with highest FI at 7 D for LBS and lowest for PLG, but, on day 28, CON was highest (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast to results in the current study, Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) obtained FI differences at 7, 14, 21, 35 and 39 D with 400 to 1600 mg/kg of MOO in feed, and Peng et al. (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found effect at 22 to 42 D and 1 to 42 D, with FI being highest with 600 mg/kg. These contrasts could be due to intake type, diet vs. DWt. Particularly, Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) indicated that the difference in broiler performance may be correlated with the levels of feed additives used in the diets in relation to their chemical composition. In the current study, results obtained with 400 mg/L in DWt indicated a slight decrease in FI with the LBS treatment, although FI with LBS was not different from the CON group. Accordingly, Reyer et al. (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) suggested that increases in apparent ileal digestibility could be due to feed additives and their effects on intestine epithelial function, and increases in membrane recruitment of sodium-glucose transport protein 1 and peptide transporter 1.
