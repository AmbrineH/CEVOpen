<p class="p">The color parameter assessments of breast meat are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. Redness (a*), chroma, and BI were different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between treatments with the CON group presenting the lowest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) values and PLG and LBS the highest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The other variables were not different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05), however, PLG or LBS generally presented high values and CON presented low values. Hong et al. (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Gámez-Piñon et al. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) did not find an effect on breast meat color parameters. Contrasting effects on breast meat color variables were presented by Méndez-Zamora et al. (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015b</xref>) for L* and b*; however, Kirkpinar et al. (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) found statistical effects on b* similar to those from the current study but not on a*. Those authors noted the changes in color attributes as minor and that the high carotenoid content of oregano could affect the color parameters. The differences between treatments found in the current study on BI (calculated using L*, a*, and b* values) suggest that pigments present in MOO could be deposited in the breast meat, principally for the LBS group. For example, Young et al. (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) reported that the main carotenoids in pure oregano were lutein (21.3 ± 0.2 μg/g) and β-carotene (3.9 ± 0.4 μg/g). Some studies indicated that the more yellow color (b*) in the pectoralis major could be attributed to the high carotenoid content of oregano (Young et al.,
