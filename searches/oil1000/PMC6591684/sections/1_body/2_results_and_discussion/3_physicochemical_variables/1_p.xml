<p class="p">Breast meat pH and WHC, and cooking loss of breast, thigh, and leg are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Breast meat values for pH, WHC, and CLB were not different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) between treatments, but those for CLT and CLL were different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), showing improvements for CON and PLG treatments (low values). Méndez-Zamora et al. (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015b</xref>) and Gámez-Piñon et al. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) evaluated 0.40 g/kg of OEO in the diet and DWt (0.4 g/L), respectively, finding similar values for pH and WHC to those from the current study. Additionally, Kirpinar et al. (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) obtained similar pH values using 0.15 and 0.30 g/kg of OEO in diets, as well as Gámez-Piñón et al. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found similar results with 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 g/L of OEO in DWt. Few studies with oil extracts have reported WHC and CL for breast, thigh, and leg meat; however, Park et al. (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) did not find effects on CLB when testing 0.2% (w/v) of 3 plant extracts (
 <italic class="italic">Saposhnikovia divaricata, Lonicera japonica</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Chelidonium majus</italic>). The CLT and CLL were improved by PLG treatment, but not by LBS, which indicated that the essential oil type in DWt can influence muscle metabolism, increasing pH at the cellular level and the post-mortem metabolism in muscles.
