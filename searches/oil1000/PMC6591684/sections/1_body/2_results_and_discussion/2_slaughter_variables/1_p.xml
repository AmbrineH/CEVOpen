<p class="p">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, SW and TY presented differences (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between treatments, but other slaughter variables were not different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Slaughter weight was highest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the CON group and lowest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for LBS, but TY was highest (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the LBS and PLG groups. Slaughter weight and yield values in the current study were lower than those obtained by Méndez-Zamora et al. (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) and Silva-Vázquez et al. (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) evaluating 0.40 g/kg of MOO in diets, respectively. Additionally, Gámez-Piñón et al. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) obtained higher values for SW and yields when examining 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 g/L of OEO in DWt and for broilers at the end of a 42-D growth period in respect to 40 D in the current study. These differences could be due to the total growth period difference of 2 D, where the OEO action could have a major effect on broiler performance, as well as on slaughter variables SW and TY. Comparing results from other studies where essential oils were supplemented in diets (Peng et al., 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Chowdhury et al., 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>; Silva-Vázquez et al., 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), slaughter values were higher than those from the current study, which could be due to 3 factors, supplementation type (feed or water), type and level of essential oil, and growth period.
