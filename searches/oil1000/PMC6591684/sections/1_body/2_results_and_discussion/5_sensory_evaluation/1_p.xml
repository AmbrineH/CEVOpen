<p class="p">Meat sensory evaluation is a method to examine preference attributes perceived by consumers. Sensory evaluations of breast meat from broilers supplemented with oregano oils in DWt are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>. Odor, taste, and overall acceptability presented significant effects (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) by treatment. These attributes were more preferred for PLG breast meat than meat from the LBS-treated group. Few studies have evaluated sensorial traits with OEO in broilers at grow-out, and results have generated some controversies. Symeon et al. (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) did not find significant differences in the acceptance test regarding tenderness, juiciness, taste, and overall acceptance when evaluating 100 and 250 mg/kg of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oils; however, those authors indicated that any effect found must depend on the herb selected or the dose administered. In the current study, MOO from the 2 plant sources used in DWt elicited differences in breast meat odor, taste, and overall acceptability. Similarly, significant statistical effects were obtained by Hong et al. (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Kirkpinar et al. (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) for appearance, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability. Hong et al. (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) indicated that improvement in overall consumer acceptance was related to the antioxidant properties of the polyphenols and flavonoids that would limit the level of protein and lipid oxidation. Therefore, consumer acceptability may be influenced by the high levels of the characteristics of the potent antioxidants carvacrol and thymol of oregano oils (Silva-Vázquez et al., 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), which improved the oxidative stability of chicken meat and hence the sensory values (Kirkpinar et al., 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
