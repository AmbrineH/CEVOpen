<p class="p">The texture analysis evaluates meat softness and structure performance. Values of SF, Cohes, and Resil were different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between experimental groups (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). Shear force was higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for broilers receiving PLG than those receiving LBS oil; however, PLG was lower (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and LBS higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for Cohes and Resil. Although differences were not obtained for other breast meat texture variables, the CON treatment generally presented high values for Hard, Adhes, Gum, and Chew. These results indicated that MOO supplemented in DWt could have effects on the breast meat texture, principally on SF as a function of the muscle fiber and water content. Studies have reported effects of OEO on carcass characteristics, meat physicochemical variables (pH, WHC, color), breast meat chemical, and fatty acid composition, but SF and texture profiles had minimal to no effects when OEO was added to diets. Particularly, Park et al. (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) found effects on SF and Adhes and indicated the reasons for these results as unknown. Being that there is a lack of information regarding texture effects of plant extracts, those authors indicated that more study is needed to determine the effects of natural extracts on broiler breast meat texture traits. The current study presents more results on broiler breast meat texture profile and when MOO was supplemented in DWt, finding effects on SF, Cohes, and Resil, which could indicate that MOO has effects on the meat texture. Similarly, Cázares-Gallegos et al. (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2019</xref>) obtained differences for Hard, Cohes, and Resil using 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/kg of LBS incorporated in the diet. Those authors indicated that those results, and results obtained by Park et al. (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), demonstrated that essential oil extracts in diets could influence texture properties of broiler meat. Additionally, Sandercock et al. (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) indicated that ante-mortem physiological phenomena would appear to be associated with changes in post-mortem breast muscle and meat characteristics, and a decline in pH may be the consequence of a greater degree of post-mortem glycolytic metabolism in more mature muscles. Furthermore, those authors indicated that heat stress-induced ante-mortem alterations in muscle membrane permeability and concomitant changes in muscle metabolism in broilers may influence post-mortem meat quality. Additionally, changes in muscle membrane integrity may be involved in mechanisms of post-mortem intracellular water loss, and elevations in plasma creatine kinase, reflecting membrane muscle damage, and an association with higher rates of pH decline. In the current study, results obtained for breast meat pH when MOO was added to DWt may indicate that MOO could alter ante-mortem physiological processes due to stress or natural physiology reactions. As a consequence, these alterations may slow down the rapid pH decline when the muscle is still warm. The rapid decrease in pH causes denaturation (loss of functionality and water-binding ability) of many proteins (Huff-Lonergan and Lonergan, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). These possible restrictive effects of MOO on ante-mortem metabolism may have prevented major damage in myofibrillar proteins and breast-meat structure, and resulted in improvements in thermal analysis results, SF, Cohes, and Resil for the PLG group.
