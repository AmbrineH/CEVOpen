<p class="p">Essential oils derived from the Mexican oregano PLG and LBS at 400Â mg/L in the DWt presented broiler BW that were not different from the CON group. The LBS treatment presented broiler low feed and WI, and, along with the PLG treatment, resulted in the best thigh yield, whereas slaughter weight was higher for the CON group. Thigh and leg cooking loss for the CON and PLG treatments gave better results over LBS. For broiler breast meat quality traits, redness, saturation and BI, SF, Cohes, and Resil benefited from PLG and LBS supplementation. The sensory results indicated that breast meat from the PLG group was most acceptable by the panel. Mexican oregano essential oil can serve as an alternative and natural additive in DWt to improve broiler production; however, other studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism of action of MOO in the DWt on growth performance and the effects on broiler-meat quality.</p>
