 <p> Caloric intake (means) for each week are plotted for all cats (n=28) at all time points for which data were available. A similar number of calories was offered to cats fed test food (black bars; 261.6 kcal/day) and control food (grey bars; 263.2 kcal/day) during the 6-month feeding period (P=0.93). Cats voluntarily consumed 23 per cent more calories when offered test food (mean, 207.1 kcal/day) compared with cats offered control food (mean, 168.0 kcal/day) during the 6-month feeding period (P=0.05). </p>
