 <p> Body weights (means±SEM) at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months are plotted for all cats (n=28) at all time points for which data were available. Cats consuming control food (grey bars) had significant loss of body weight (mean, −13.0 per cent; P&lt;0.0001) during the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food (black bars) had significant increase in body weight (mean, 5.8 per cent; P=0.003) based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis. The difference between groups was significant at P&lt;0.0001 (diet×time interaction). </p>
