  <p class="p">Lean body mass (means±SEM) at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months are plotted for all cats (n=28) at all time points for which data were available. Cats consuming control food (grey bars) had significant loss of lean body mass (mean: −11.1 per cent; P&lt;0.0001) over the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food (black bars) had no change in lean body mass (P=0.42). The difference between groups was significant at P&lt;0.0001 (diet×time interaction).</p>
