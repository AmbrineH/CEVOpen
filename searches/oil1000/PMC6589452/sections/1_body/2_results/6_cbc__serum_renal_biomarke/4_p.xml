<p class="p">Changes in mean concentrations across time for albumin, globulin, total protein and phosphorus are also shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 4</xref>. There were significant diet√ótime interactions for serum globulins (P=0.01) and total protein (P=0.001). Concentrations across time remained within reference intervals. Mean concentrations for globulins at 6 months were increased from baseline concentrations in cats fed test food (P=0.03), whereas mean concentrations for total proteins at 6 months were decreased from baseline concentrations in cats fed control food (P=0.03).
