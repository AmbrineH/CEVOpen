<p class="p">There were significant diet√ótime interactions for four additional serum chemistry analytes (alkaline phosphatase, potassium, chloride and cholesterol). However, mean values for these analytes were within the reference interval for all time points in cats fed both control and test foods; therefore, changes over time were not considered to be biologically relevant (data not shown). Mean concentrations for alkaline phosphatase at 6 months were decreased from baseline concentrations in cats fed control food (P&lt;0.0001), for chloride were decreased from baseline in cats fed both control and test foods (P&lt;0.0001) and for cholesterol were increased from baseline in cats fed test food (P&lt;0.0001). Similar serum chemistry results were observed in both intent-to-treat cats and cats that completed the study according to protocol.</p>
