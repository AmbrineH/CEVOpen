<p class="p">Mean values for serum renal biomarkers (creatinine, BUN and SDMA concentrations) are shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 4</xref>. There was a significant diet×time interaction only for serum creatinine (P=0.0004). Although mean creatinine concentrations for both groups of cats were within the reference interval at baseline, mean creatinine was &gt;1.6 mg/dl for cats consuming control food at 1, 3 and 6 months. Serum creatinine concentrations increased over time in cats consuming both control (P=0.001) and test (P=0.01) foods, but increased at a faster rate in cats fed control food. Serum SDMA concentrations also increased over time in cats fed both control and test foods (both P&lt;0.0001); however, mean SDMA concentrations were &lt;25 µg/dl at all time points.
