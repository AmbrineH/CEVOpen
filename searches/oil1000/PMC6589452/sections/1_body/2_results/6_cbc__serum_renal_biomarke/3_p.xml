<p class="p">There were significant diet√ótime interactions (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 4</xref>) for serum calcium (P=0.0002), sodium (P=0.007) and phosphorus (P=0.03), although baseline concentrations were within the normal reference intervals. Mean values for sodium and calcium concentrations were outside the reference interval at 6 months in cats fed control food. Mean calcium concentration was above the normal reference interval and mean sodium concentration was below the normal reference interval at 6 months for cats fed control food. Mean concentrations at 6 months were different from baseline concentrations only for calcium (higher for cats fed both control and test foods; P&lt;0.01).
