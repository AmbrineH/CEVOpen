<p class="p">Measured food intake over the 6-month feeding period was used to calculate threonine intake over the 6-month feeding period for each cat (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 3</xref>). Threonine intake was then compared with change in LBM. The estimated threonine intake needed to maintain LBM for cats was calculated using the NRC estimate for energy intake and the AAFCO minimum recommendation for threonine intake. Estimated minimum threonine intake was 97.4 g for cats consuming control food and 102 g for cats consuming test food. Cats that consumed less than the estimated minimum recommendation for threonine intake had significant loss of LBM, whereas cats consuming at or above the estimated minimum maintained LBM. Those cats consuming less than the AAFCO minimum recommended dietary threonine intake experienced a mean loss of 292±46 g in LBM over 6 months (P&lt;0.001), whereas those cats consuming the minimum or more had no significant change in LBM (average loss 4±49 g; P=0.95). None of the cats consuming control food (n=9) met the AAFCO minimum recommended dietary threonine intake, whereas 7 of 11 cats consuming test food met the recommendation.
