<p class="p">Based on analysed chemical composition (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>), both control and test foods met the AAFCO minimum recommendations for essential amino acid content. The most limiting essential amino acid (determined by dividing amino acid concentration in g/100 kcal by the AAFCO value in g/100 kcal for that amino acid) was threonine; control food was 13 per cent higher than AAFCO minimum recommendations, and test food was 50 per cent higher than AAFCO minimum recommendations.
