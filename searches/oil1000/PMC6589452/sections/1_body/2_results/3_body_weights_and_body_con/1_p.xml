<p class="p">Cats consuming control food had significant loss of body weight (mean, −13.0 per cent; P&lt;0.0001) during the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had significant increase in body weight (mean, 5.8 per cent; P=0.003; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>) based on DEXA analysis. The difference between groups was significant at P&lt;0.0001. Weekly body weight measurements indicated that 11 of 14 cats consuming control food lost more than 5 per cent of their body weight during the study, whereas only 1 of 14 cats gained more than 5 per cent of its body weight. None of the cats consuming test food lost more than 5 per cent of its body weight, and 7 of 14 cats consuming test food gained more than 5 per cent of their body weight. Similar results were noted in the intent-to-treat cats and cats that completed the study according to protocol.
