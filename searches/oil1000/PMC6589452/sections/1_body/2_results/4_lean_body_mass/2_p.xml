<p class="p">To further explore factors that may have influenced change in LBM, energy intake, protein intake and threonine intake were evaluated as to their association with change in LBM. Threonine intake was positively associated with change in LBM (P&lt;0.001). Total protein intake (P=0.13) and total energy intake (P=0.04) were negatively associated with change in LBM.</p>
