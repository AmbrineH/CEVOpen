<p class="p">No significant diet×time interactions were noted for cats fed test food compared with cats fed control food for USG or UPC ratio. However, there was a significant diet×time interaction for urine creatinine concentration. This was because urine creatinine concentration in cats consuming control food increased (P&lt;0.0001) across time compared with baseline, whereas urine creatinine concentration of cats fed test food did not change compared with baseline (P=0.22). There was a trend for UPC ratio to be lower in cats fed test food across time compared with baseline (P=0.055). Similar urinalysis results were noted in both intent-to-treat cats and cats that completed the study according to protocol.</p>
