<p class="p">The amount of food offered was determined by MER calculations for each cat. A similar number of calories was offered to the group consuming the control food (mean, 263.2 kcal/day) compared with the group fed test food (mean, 261.6 kcal/day) during the 6-month feeding period (P=0.93). Cats consuming control food voluntarily consumed 64 per cent of calories offered; cats consuming test food voluntarily consumed 79 per cent of calories offered. Thus, cats voluntarily consumed more calories (P=0.05) when offered test food (mean, 207.1 kcal/day) compared with cats offered control food (mean, 168.0 kcal/day) during the 6-month feeding period (
