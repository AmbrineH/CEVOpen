<p class="p">There were eight dismissals during the 6-month trial. Two cats were dismissed during the first 10 days for palatability issues, one control food (IRIS stage 1 CKD) and one test food (IRIS stage 2 CKD). Thus, 93 per cent (13/14) of cats successfully transitioned onto either the control or test food for the clinical trial. One cat was euthanased after 27 days on test food for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IRIS stage 1 CKD). Another cat was dismissed after 41 days on test food for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension (IRIS stage 1 CKD). Four cats on control food were dismissed for body condition deterioration: one for progressive renal disease after 28 days (IRIS stage 2 CKD), and three for weight loss and poor appetite after 50, 68 and 68 days, respectively (all IRIS stage 1 CKD). Thus, 26 cats completed 1 month on the feeding trial (13 cats in each control and test food groups) and 20 cats completed 3 and 6 months (9 control cats and 11 test food cats) according to protocol.</p>
