Of the 28 cats enrolled in the study, 12 cats in the control food group were categorised as IRIS stage 1 CKD and 2 cats as IRIS stage 2 CKD. In the test food group, 11 cats were categorised as IRIS stage 1 CKD and 3 cats as IRIS stage 2 CKD. Seven cats had elevated UPCs at baseline (all UPC ≤0.5). There were 2 cats with UPC=0.4 and 1 cat with UPC=0.5 placed on control food, and 2 cats with UPC=0.4 and 2 cats with UPC=0.5 placed on test food. Baseline demographic data are shown in
