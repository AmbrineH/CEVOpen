<p class="p">Although renal therapeutic foods have been recommended for decades with the expectation that they would alleviate clinical signs of uraemia and slow progression of CKD, their clinical effectiveness and nutritional impact recently have been challenged.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref> Some veterinarians have even suggested that cats with CKD should be fed high-protein foods as a strategy to preserve muscle mass.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> A major concern is that dietary interventions that benefit renal function in non-azotemic cats with reduced GFR, for example, IRIS stage 1 CKD, have not been well studied. In addition, guidelines extrapolated from data derived from dialysis-dependent people consuming less than their protein requirements, as well as studies in other species such as dogs and rodents, may not be relevant to cats.
