<p class="p">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible disease, which results in progressive loss of renal function, and may eventually lead to a uraemic crisis and death.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref> In a recent study of randomly selected cats from a single feline-only practice, the prevalence of CKD in cats 5– 15 years of age was &gt;40 per cent, with a higher prevalence (80 per cent) among cats &gt;15 years.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> Data from IDEXX Laboratories in the USA, from approximately 1.1 million cats with serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations measured since July 2015, indicate that overall prevalence of CKD is 28 per cent, and prevalence increases with age (67 per cent in cats &gt;18 years).
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> In addition, over two times the number of cats can be diagnosed with CKD using serum SDMA concentrations as opposed to serum creatinine concentrations alone.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> This is because serum SDMA detects CKD earlier when serum creatinine is still normal,
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> and because it is not negatively impacted by loss of lean body mass (LBM) with ageing.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref> Serum creatinine declines with age because of muscle wasting, whereas SDMA increases as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines with age.
