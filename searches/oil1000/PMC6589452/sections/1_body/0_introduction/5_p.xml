<p class="p">Nutritional management of CKD is also recommended if persistent proteinuria, for example, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt;0.4, or hyperphosphataemia (&gt;4.6 mg/dl) exists in stage 1 CKD.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> However, in a recent clinical study, client-owned geriatric cats with IRIS stage 1 CKD (without proteinuria or hyperphosphataemia) that were fed a food designed to promote healthy ageing were more likely to demonstrate stable renal function compared with cats fed owner’s-choice foods over a 6-month period.
