<p class="p">The purpose of this study was to provide prospective, clinical trial data on dietary management of cats with CKD using commercially available therapeutic renal support foods. The goal was to determine if a therapeutic renal food with controlled protein and phosphorus, increased caloric density, an enhanced essential amino acid profile, added L-carnitine, fish oil, antioxidants and enhanced palatability
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref> could help cats maintain body weight and muscle mass over a 6-month period compared with cats fed a control food having a similar protein content, but different composition. Test food was a high-quality protein food that contained less protein than maintenance foods but was fortified with essential amino acids, thus exceeding the AAFCO minimum recommendation for protein and amino acids (

The hypothesis of this study was that cats consuming test food would maintain or show improved status of serum renal biomarkers (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and SDMA concentrations) and urinalysis parameters (urine-specific gravity (USG) and UPC ratio) across time compared with cats fed control food. In addition, it was hypothesised that cats fed test food would consume more calories, and maintain body weight and LBM compared with cats fed control food over the 6-month study period.
