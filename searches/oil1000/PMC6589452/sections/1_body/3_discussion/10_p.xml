 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref> Cachexia is a wasting syndrome associated with increased resting energy expenditure, weight loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue and loss of appetite. Although mechanisms are not completely understood, pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to disturb the concentrations and activities of leptin (an anorexigenic peptide) and ghrelin (an orexigenic peptide), which act on hypothalamic neurons to decrease energy intake and increase energy expenditure. Both renal-support foods that were fed in this study contained high concentrations of long-chain (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). At sufficiently high dietary concentrations, these (n-3) PUFA have been shown to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines, ROS and the expression of adhesion molecules.
