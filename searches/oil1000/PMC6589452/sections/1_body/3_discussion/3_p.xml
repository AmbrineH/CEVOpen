<p class="p">Consequently, the authors hypothesised that insufficient consumption of essential amino acids was correlated with change in LBM noted in these CKD cats. The authors found that consumption of the AAFCO recommended concentrations of threonine, or greater, resulted in maintenance of LBM, whereas there was a significant loss of LBM in cats that did not consume the recommended amounts of threonine (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, only threonine intake was positively correlated with change in LBM; both total protein and total energy intake were negatively correlated with change in LBM. These data suggest that it is beneficial to increase amino acid fortification (relative to AAFCO minimums) in foods designed for pets with compromised appetite, for example, in early stages of CKD. Although threonine was the first limiting amino acid in this study, it is likely that inadequate intake of any of the essential amino acids would have resulted in loss of LBM.
