<p class="p">Both control and test food contained similar crude protein (6.65 and 6.69 g/100 kcal, respectively) and phosphorus (1.18 and 1.05 g/100 kcal, respectively) concentrations, but lower concentrations compared with industry averages.

 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref> both control and test foods should have provided adequate intake of essential amino acids. However, control cats did not consume enough food to maintain body weight and, therefore, also had reduced intake of all essential amino acids. Threonine was the most limiting amino acid in the control food (13 per cent overage vs 50 per cent overage in test food compared with AAFCO minimum recommended dietary threonine intake). Both foods had adequate threonine concentration when compared with AAFCO and NRC recommendations on an energy basis (minimums or adequate intakes, respectively). But, because there was reduced food intake in cats with renal disease, which was especially apparent in cats consuming control food, there was a greater need for amino acid fortification of foods. The greater dietary intake of essential amino acids in test food (a combination of increased consumption and higher concentration) resulted in all cats consuming test food having adequate intake of all amino acids, including threonine.
