<p class="p">There are several possible explanations for differences in mean body weights, BCS and LBM results between the two groups of cats. Test food may have had enhanced palatability compared with control food, thus increasing food intake. Test food was shown in a previous study to improve appetite in cats with CKD.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref> Test food also had 12 per cent higher caloric density compared with control food. Test food contained higher concentrations of most essential amino acids (&gt;140 per cent of AAFCO minimum recommendations) compared with control food, which was limited in threonine because of decreased food intake. Lysine in the control food was the second most limiting amino acid (15 per cent overage vs 74 per cent overage in test food compared with the AAFCO minimum recommended dietary lysine). In addition, it is known that total lysine digestibility can be inaccurate when applied to commercially available cat foods.
