<p class="p">Two renal-support foods were compared in a 6-month, prospective clinical trial on dietary management of IRIS stage 1 and 2 CKD in cats. The palatability of both control and test foods were very good; only one cat in each group was dismissed in the first 10 days of the study for poor food consumption. Thus, 93 per cent of cats in each group successfully transitioned onto foods fed in this study. However, cats consuming control food had a significant loss of mean body weight (−13.0 per cent) during the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had a significant increase in mean body weight (5.8 per cent). Cats consuming control food also had a significant reduction in mean BCS (−0.5), whereas cats consuming test food had no change in BCS. In addition, cats consuming control food had a significant loss in LBM (−11.1 per cent) over the 6-month feeding period, whereas cats consuming test food had no change in LBM.</p>
