<p class="p">Threonine and lysine play central hub and top controller roles, respectively, in the inter-relations between plasma amino acid concentrations and metabolism in essential amino acid-deficient rats.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> Test food also contained 100× the concentration of L-carnitine present in control food. L-carnitine is responsible for facilitating transport of FA into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref> In another study, adult cats consuming food supplemented with L-carnitine gained LBM over a 6-month feeding period compared with cats fed identical food without carnitine supplement (unpublished data). It is possible that any one or more of these test food attributes were responsible for differences in body weight changes when comparing control and treatment groups of cats. This study suggests that therapeutic renal foods with excellent palatability, increased caloric density and enhanced concentrations of essential amino acids and L-carnitine may help cats with CKD maintain body weight and LBM, particularly if they are finicky eaters or have fluctuating or poor appetites.
