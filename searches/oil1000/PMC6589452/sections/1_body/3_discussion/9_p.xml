<p class="p">The goals of nutritional management of CKD are to meet the patientâ€™s nutrient and energy requirements, as well as to alleviate clinical signs and slow the progression of CKD. Restriction of dietary protein has been demonstrated to slow the rate of progression of renal damage in rats and people.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24 25</xref> However, the effect of protein restriction on the progression of renal damage in dogs and cats remains controversial and no definitive study exists on this matter.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7 12 13</xref> At constant quality and digestibility, feeding more protein will result in more peptides and amino acids reaching the colon for fermentation by the colonic microbiota. Metabolites originating from bacterial fermentation of proteins in the large intestine appear to play a key role in the progression of CKD. Both serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate concentrations have been shown to negatively correlate with GFR in humans.
