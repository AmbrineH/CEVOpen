<p class="p">Food portions were determined by RER calculations for each cat. A similar number of calories were offered to cats fed control food (263 kcal/day) compared with cats fed test food (262 kcal/day) throughout the 6-month feeding period. However, cats voluntarily consumed 23 per cent more calories when fed test food (mean, 207.1 kcal/day) compared with cats fed control food (mean, 168.0 kcal/day). A majority of cats fed control food did not consume sufficient calories to maintain body weight, as 11 of 14 cats lost &gt;5 per cent of their baseline body weight. Weight loss among cats fed control food impacted their overall health. Four cats fed control food were dismissed for severe weight loss and BCS deterioration. Although cats fed test food also had substantial fluctuations in daily caloric intake, they still consumed sufficient calories to maintain body weight. In fact, 7 of 14 cats fed test food gained more than 5 per cent of their baseline body weight such that mean body weight was significantly increased by the end of the study.</p>
