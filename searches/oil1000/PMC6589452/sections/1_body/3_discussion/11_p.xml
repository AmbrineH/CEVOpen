<p class="p">In conclusion, cats with CKD readily transition to renal food. The data suggest that renal foods with high concentrations of carnitine and essential amino acids, and of higher energy density, are critical for cats with IRIS stage 1 and 2 CKD to maintain body weight, BCS and LBM as these cats may have decreased appetite and fluctuations in daily food intake. Attributes of renal therapeutic foods considered important for managing major metabolic disorders associated with cachexia (increased resting energy requirements, decreased appetite and muscle atrophy) and for maintaining LBM are enhanced palatability, high caloric density, high concentrations of all essential amino acids, L-carnitine supplementation and added fish oil as a source of (n-3) highly PUFA. As in dogs,
