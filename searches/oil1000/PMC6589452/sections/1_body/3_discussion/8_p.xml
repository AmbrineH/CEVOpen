<p class="p">Regarding renal biomarkers, serum creatinine increased at a significantly faster rate in cats consuming control food compared with cats consuming test food. Simultaneously, urine creatinine concentrations increased in cats fed control food over the 6-month feeding period. Serum SDMA increased from baseline at a similar rate for both groups of cats; however, mean SDMA was below 25 µg/dl at all time points. There was a trend for UPC to be lower in cats fed test food at 6 months compared with baseline (P=0.055), whereas USG remained stable in both groups of cats over the 6-month feeding period. Higher monthly serum and urine creatinine concentrations in cats fed control food compared with cats fed test food, may reflect catabolism of body tissues to meet energy requirements.
