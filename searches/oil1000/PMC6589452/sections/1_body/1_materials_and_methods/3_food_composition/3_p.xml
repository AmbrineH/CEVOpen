<p class="p">The threonine recommended intake was calculated using AAFCO minimum recommendations in g/100 kcal and expected caloric intake for each cat based on the National Research Council (NRC) estimates of caloric need.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref> Actual threonine intake was calculated for each cat based on the threonine concentration in the food the cat was eating and food intake. This enabled cats to be divided into those that met or exceeded the threonine intake based on AAFCO minimum recommendations and those that did not. Then, LBM data were compared between these two groups based on whether or not cats consumed the recommended amounts of threonine.
