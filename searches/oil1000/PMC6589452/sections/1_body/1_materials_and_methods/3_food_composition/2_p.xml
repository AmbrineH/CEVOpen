<p class="p">Each cat was offered an equivalent amount of calories based on the presumed resting energy requirement (RER) calculated by the formula: RER=70×(body weight in kg)
 <sup class="sup">0.75</sup>. An activity factor was assigned as a multiplier of the RER, which was determined from the metabolic rate established for each individual cat before this study. Thus, the RER was multiplied by an activity factor (mean=1.1±0.3) to meet maintenance energy requirements, with additional instructions to increase or decrease food offering as needed to maintain body weight.
