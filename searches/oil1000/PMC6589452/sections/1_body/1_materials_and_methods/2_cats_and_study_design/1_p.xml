<p class="p">This was a prospective, randomised, blocked and controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration involving adult cats in the Hill’s Pet Nutrition colony with IRIS stage 1 or 2 CKD. Cats were eligible if they were between 2 and 16 years of age. Both males and females were included (all gonadectomised); all breeds were eligible and there were no initial body weight restrictions. Fifty-seven cats were screened for CKD (physical examination, blood work and urinalysis) of which 28 cats were enrolled in the study. Cats had to be in good general health based on physical examination and laboratory analyses, with a body condition score (BCS) of 2/5 or greater, and could only consume dry food during the trial. Cats had to have increased SDMA concentration (&gt;13.5 µg/dl), and could have one or more of the following: increased serum creatinine concentration (&gt;1.6 mg/dl), abnormal kidney on palpation, dilute urine with USG&lt;1.035 or UPC ratio &gt;0.4. Cats were not eligible for the study if diagnosed with a systemic illness other than CKD, were having planned surgery, were pregnant or likely to become pregnant during the study period or had fractious behaviour. After screening, cats were blocked into groups based on serum SDMA and creatinine concentrations, LBM, age, body weight, sex, USG and UPC. Each block of cats was randomly assigned to receive either control or test food. Cats were maintained in either group or individual housing at Hill’s Pet Nutrition Center.</p>
