<p class="p">The IRIS stage of CKD was determined according to IRIS guidelines,
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref> where IRIS stage is assigned based on serum creatinine and SDMA concentrations and whether an abnormal kidney on palpation, dilute urine or elevated UPC ratio are present and persistent over a period of at least 3 months. Cats were considered to have early stage 1 CKD (non-azotemic) based on one or more of the following: serum creatinine increasing within the reference range (&lt;1.6 mg/dl), persistently increased serum SDMA (&gt;13.5 µg/dl) or persistent renal proteinuria (UPC &gt;0.4). Cats were considered to have stage 2 CKD if both SDMA (&gt;13.5 µg/dl) and serum creatinine (1.6–2.8 mg/dl) were elevated, and USG was &lt;1.035.
