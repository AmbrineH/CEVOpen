<p class="p">Daily caloric intake data were averaged for weekly intervals and analysed using a linear mixed-model for repeated measures with diet, week and diet×week as fixed effects. The Kenwood-Roger adjustment was used to calculate the denominator degrees-of-freedom for the fixed effects. To model the correlation between the average weekly caloric intake, compound symmetry and first-order autoregressive covariance structures were modelled and the best fit was selected using AICC and BIC-fit statistics. The two foods were compared at weekly intervals using the SLICEDIFF option in PROC GLIMMIX. This option produces F-tests that test the simultaneous equality of week means for each diet.
