<p class="p">Body weight, BCS, body mass and composition and blood and urinalysis data were analysed using a linear mixed-model for repeated measures with diet, month and diet×month as fixed effects. The Kenwood-Roger adjustment was used to calculate the denominator degrees-of-freedom for the fixed effects. To model the correlation between the repeated measures (months), compound symmetry, unstructured, first-order autoregressive and antedependence covariance structures were modelled and the best fit was selected using AICC and BIC-fit statistics. The diet×month interactions are reported using orthogonal polynomials for unequally spaced intervals.</p>
