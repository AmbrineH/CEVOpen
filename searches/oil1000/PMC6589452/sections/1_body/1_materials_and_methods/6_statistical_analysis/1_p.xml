<p class="p">The number of cats targeted for this study was 14 cats in each group. This number of cats was estimated to be sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference in body weight, LBM and serum SDMA and creatinine concentrations between the treatment groups at an 80 per cent power. This estimate was based on a previous feline CKD study that collected similar biological data.
