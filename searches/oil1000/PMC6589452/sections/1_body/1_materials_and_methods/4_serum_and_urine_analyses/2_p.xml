<p class="p">Urine was collected by cystocentesis at each time point for routine urinalysis and UPC. USG was determined using a Vet360 Temperature Compensated Hand Held refractometer (Reichert, Depew, New York, USA). Urine creatinine concentration was used as an internal reference and measured with the same assay as serum creatinine. Urine protein concentrations were determined using the urine supernatant (benzethonium chloride turbidometric method). The UPC ratio calculations are reported as mg/dl protein:mg/dl creatinine.</p>
