<p class="p">Essential oils of higher plants are volatile in nature and a complex mixture of monoterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>) and sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">15</sub>); although diterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>) may also be present, and a variety of low molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, aldehydes, acyclic esters or lactones and exceptionally N- and S-containing compounds, coumarins and homologs of phenyl-propanoids (

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sharifi-Rad J. et al., 2017</xref>). The whole 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> plant possesses essential oils; however, the amount of oil varied depending upon the species and method of isolation. Essential oils from different 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species have been isolated by different methods such as hydrodistillation using Clevenger apparatus or pharmacopeia distillation apparatus (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Menthol and pulegone present in the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species are the substances that give the mints their characteristic aromas and flavors (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lubbe and Verpoorte, 2011</xref>). Some investigators reported that aroma and flavor of spearmint is due to presence of carvone (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hussain et al., 2010a</xref>). Instead of menthol, pulegone and carvone, chemically essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species is composed of other different major and minor components. Several investigations have been carried out on the chemical composition of different samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species from different geographical regions. The 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species which are described here in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold> for their essential oil chemistry have been collected from the different geographical regions. Most of the species were collected from Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon, Egypt, Europe, Guinea, India, Iran, Italy, Tunisia, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, Um Ruaba, and Yaounde. The studies revealed that chemical composition and their respective percentage of different 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species varied depending upon the origins of the plant and species (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Table shows that the species investigated for the chemical composition of the oil from different countries were 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita, M. pulegium, M. longifolia, M. arvensis, M. suaveolens, M. rotundifolia, M. officinalis, M. spicata, M. mozaffarianii, M. x villoso-nervata, M. viridis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. rotundifolia.</italic>
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold> also shows that there is a significant variation in chemical composition of the same species. This may be due to the time of oil extraction or their occurrence in different geographical location. The compositional variation in the essential oil is also may be due to harvesting time at different stage, drying as well as extraction methods (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rohloff et al., 2005</xref>). Some factor like physiological and environmental conditions, genetic and evolution also determine the chemical variability of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> essential oils (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Figueiredo et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, most of the species chemically characterized were rich in pulegone, menthon, menthol, carvone, 1, 8-cineole, limonene, and Î²-caryophyllene. The chemical structures of major compounds are depicted in
