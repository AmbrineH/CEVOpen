<p class="p">Chemical constituents from essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species has also been reported as potential antifungal agent against plant pathogenic fungi. Monoterpenoid, i.e., spearmint gave 100% mycelial inhibition of postharvest fungi 
 <italic class="italic">A. terreus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic>, and 91% of 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> at 1 μl/l dose and also at the same dose this terpenoid inhibited 100% conidial production of all these tested fungi (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kadoglidou et al., 2011</xref>). Menthol extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> showed MICs of 0.25–1.5 μl/ml in ethanol and 0.05–1.0 μl/ml in Tween by microdilution method (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soković et al., 2009</xref>), while carvone of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> possessed higher antifungal activity with MICs value 0.25–1.0 μl/ml in ethanol and 0.05–0.5 μl/ml in Tween by the same method. Limonene showed moderate fungistatic activity against aforesaid pathogens with MICs by microdilution method were 6.0–11.0 μl/ml in ethanol and 5.0–9.0 μl/ml in Tween (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soković et al., 2009</xref>). This variation in MICs of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> may be due to the variation in chemical ingredients among the plant species, methodology used and also different fungal strains used during the bioassays. The greater efficacy of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> reported were due to the presence of menthol and carvone. This antifungal activity of essential oil may be due to presence of oxygenated terpenes or phenolic structure. This is speculated that the hydroxyl group of phenol and alcohol might be an important factor of their antifungal activity (
