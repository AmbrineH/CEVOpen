<p class="p">Researchers reported that several monoterpenes acts on cell membrane by affecting lipid fraction of plasma membrane, causing leakage of intracellular membrane (

This could be a reason why some essential oils rich in monoterpenic components were found to be effective against the plant pathogenic fungi. These all results on the use of essential oils and their chemical constituents of
