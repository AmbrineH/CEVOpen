<p class="p">Bacteria associated with plants causes serious diseases in agricultural crops as well as in postharvest commodities throughout the world (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vidhyasekaran, 2002</xref>). The yield loss reported due to bacterial diseases in pre and postharvest is about 30–40% of crop produce per year. Basically, 
 <italic class="italic">Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Erwinia</italic> are the main genera of bacteria, play major role in causing plant diseases (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Agrios, 2005</xref>). There are several commercial bactericides available in the markets against these bacterial pathogens, however, their indiscriminate use caused several health hazards to human beings as well side effect to the host plants (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Louws et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, there are several strains of bacterial pathogens which have developed resistance against commercial bactericides due to the change in climate. Plant bacteriologists reported that plant pathogenic bacteria readily acquire resistance to copper bactericides and streptomycin (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stall and Thayer, 1962</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marco and Stall, 1983</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cuppels and Elmhirst, 1999</xref>). Therefore, researchers looked for the alternatives that would resolve the resistance problems, be less harmful and would be effective to control the bacterial pathogens. Potentiality of many essential oils and their constituents have been tested against several plant pathogenic bacteria using different methods like agar dilution, disk diffusion, agar well and broth dilution assays (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Perricone et al., 2015</xref>), however, regarding the 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> essential oils there are few literature available from past to recent. Essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> collected from different provinces like Turkey, Yakima, Mari-Linn Farms, and A Erdogmus Perfume Industry imported from India exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">syringae, Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">tomato, P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseolicola, Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">campestris</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseoli</italic> at 0.07–1.25 mg/ml range of MIC values (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iscan et al., 2002</xref>) by broth dilution bioassay. They also reported that some chemical constituents such as menthol and menthone derived from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil showed potent MIC value against the plant pathogenic bacteria. Menthol (Polarome, Jersey City, NJ, United States) showed 0.625 mg/ml MIC value against 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseoli</italic>, 1.25 against 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseolicola</italic>, 0.07 against 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">tomato</italic> and 0.156 against 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">syringae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">campestris</italic>. Similarly, (-)-menthone (Fluka, Germany) inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseoli, P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseolicola, P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">syringae</italic> at 2.5 mg/ml MIC value, while of 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">campestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">tomato</italic> at 1.25 mg/ml. Similar investigation was carried out by 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soltani and Aliabadi (2012)</xref>, they reported that essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> showed same level of toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">X. campestris</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">juglandis</italic>. 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vasinauskienë et al. (2006)</xref> evaluated seven essential oils including 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and found that this oil is effective against phytopathogenic bacteria with zone of inhibition (ZOI) 2–6 cm against 
 <italic class="italic">P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">syringae, P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">tomato, Erwinia carotovora</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">carotovora</italic> and 6–12 cm against 
 <italic class="italic">X. vesicatoria</italic> in disk diffusion bioassay. Minimum bactericidal concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oils varied from 6 to 40 mg/ml in micro agar broth dilution method against 
 <italic class="italic">Acidovorax avenae</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">citrulli</italic> (Aac) causing seed borne bacterial disease in different commercially important crops. In another investigation, 1 μl dose of 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> essential oil was more effective than streptomycin and showed a variable range of ZOI against 
 <italic class="italic">Pantoea agglomerans</italic> (11.10 cm), 
 <italic class="italic">Erwinia amylovora</italic> (10.9 cm), 
 <italic class="italic">Pantoea dispersa</italic> (8.8 cm), 
 <italic class="italic">P. fluorescens</italic> (5.2 cm), and 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">syringae</italic> (5.0 cm) (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kokoskova et al., 2011</xref>). From the above investigations we can speculate that a variable range of efficacy was reported for different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil against the same bacterial species. This may be due to the use of different methodology during the screening, variability in bacterial strains and also variation in the chemical constituents of the essential oils of different 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species. The significant antibacterial activity observed for the different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil is due to the presence of phenolic compounds like menthol and carvacrol (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sivropoulou et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dorman and Deans, 2000</xref>). These phenolic compounds form complexes with bacterial enzymes and protein and inhibited the growth of bacterial pathogens (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rhouma et al., 2009</xref>). In the bacterial membrane phenolic compounds dissolved through penetration and where they interact with the cell metabolism cause the disruption of plasma membrane which increase the permeability and depolarize its potential finally led to death of bacteria (
