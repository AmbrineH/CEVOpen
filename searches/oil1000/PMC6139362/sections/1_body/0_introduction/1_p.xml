<p class="p">In the plant kingdom, family Lamiaceae (syn. Labiatae) is endowed with several medicinal and aromatic plants. The family comprises of more than 232 genera and approximately 7200 species (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harley et al., 2004</xref>). Most of the Lamiaceae plants are found to accumulate secondary metabolites such as terpenes/essential oils and other components, mainly in the epidermal glands of leaves, stems and reproductive structures. These terpenes/essential oils have several applications in cosmetics, food industry, medication and perfumery. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> is a very important taxon in the family Lamiaceae and includes 25–30 species that grow worldwide especially in the South Africa, Australia and temperate regions of Eurasia (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dorman et al., 2003</xref>). The taxon has a significant importance both commercial as well as medicinal. Indeed, different plant parts such as leaves, flowers and stems of this genus are frequently used in herbal medicine, teas or as additives in spice mixtures for various foods to offer aroma and flavor (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McKay and Blumberg, 2006</xref>). Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> spp. has been used as a folk remedy for aliment ulcerative, anorexia, nausea, flatulence, bronchitis, liver complaints, and colitis due to its stimulant, antiemetic, diaphoretic, carminative, antiinflammatory, analgesic, emmenagogue, antispasmodic, and anticatarrhal activities (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno et al., 2002</xref>). Commercially, the most important mint species are spearmint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic>), peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">M. x piperita</italic>), and corn mint (
 <italic class="italic">M. canadensis</italic>). Among these species, corn mint is only cultivated for oil production (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oudhia, 2003</xref>). Peppermint oil is also used for its essential oils and mostly because of its major components menthol and menthone (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mimica-Dukic et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand spearmint is rich in carvone and is widely used as spices and cultivated in several countries (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kokkini et al., 1995</xref>). Peppermint oil is applied to flavor the pharmaceuticals and most of the oral preparations (toothpastes, dental creams, and mouth washes). The plant is also used as flavoring agent in confectionery, cough drops, chewing gums, and some of the alcoholic liqueurs. For internal uses it is used in medicines and its pleasant taste makes it an excellent gastric stimulant (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dorman et al., 2003</xref>). Due to increasing interest in tribal and traditional phyto-therapeutics methods, many recent investigations have been carried out to examine the medicinal properties of these herbs for human welfare. 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McKay and Blumberg (2006)</xref> published review on the bioactivity and potential health activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>. Their studies were only focused on medicinal properties and they took only one plant species during the compilation. 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al. (2010)</xref> reviewed insecticidal properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil and extract, but they only covered the insecticidal properties against storage insects. Still, nobody has compiled a review on antibacterial, antifungal activities and insecticidal activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil against plant pathogens/storage insect pests. Henceforth, in this review, we discuss latest advances in the chemistry, antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of essential oils from different 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species of different regions. The keywords used to survey the literature are Mentha essential oil, chemical composition, antifungal, antibacterial and insecticidal. For a comprehensive literature overview, we analyzed the published phytochemical and biological data available through several search engines, such as 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>SciFinder, ISI 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>Web of Science, 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>Scopus, and 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>Google Scholar, as well as several libraries viz., National Science Library, New Delhi; National Medical Library, New Delhi; IARI Library, New Delhi; CIMAP, Lucknow, and FRI Library, Dehradun of India.
