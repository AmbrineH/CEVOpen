<p class="p">The compiled review evidenced that different species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> possessed essential oils which have a wide range of differences in their chemical constituents in samples collected from the different countries. The major components reported in the essential oils of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> were pulegone, menthon, menthol, carvone, 1, 8-cineole, limonene, Î²-caryophyllene. Menthol is the major derivative product of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species and is widely used in pharmaceuticals, tobacco products, perfumery, aromatherapy, toothpastes, soaps, cosmetics, oral preparations, confectionaries and even in cigarettes. 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil and its derivatives is currently used industrially for various purposes in form of menthol crystals, dementholized oil (DMO), L-menthol, menthone, natural crude 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> 3 hexenol, menthyl acetate, piperitone, limonene, menthofuran, and spearmint terpene. Most commercialized species of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> are 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis, M. piperita</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata.</italic> Review also showed that essential oils and chemical constituents from the different species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> are very effective in controlling the fungal and bacterial plant pathogens as well as stored product insects like 
 <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Tribolium</italic> species.
