 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil and its derivatives as faced by other popular essential oils. High volatility decreases time of protection, thus it needs to be used as impregnated material with some other products. Effects on non-target microorganisms including pollinators, bees, and natural predators needs to be evaluated. There are bottle necks for its wide use, as not all natural products are always safer and learning from our past, rampant use of chemical without assessing its long term effects would be a mistake. Thus, natural products must be scientifically validated for their long term use and release. Issues regarding its formulation like proper identification, pressure on natural resources, phytotoxicity, mammalian toxicity, standardization of product, registration and regulation have to be taken care of for its overall commercialization.
