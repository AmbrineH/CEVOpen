<p class="p">Many essential oils have proven their effectiveness as a repellent agent against many storage pests as well as other arthropods including mosquitoes. But directly using essential oils for pest control has some shortcomings viz., volatility, short shelf life and regulatory issues for disbursing it freely in environment. Thus, more insight is needed to overcome the barriers of oil use as a pest control agent like, exploring fixative materials for sustained release, application methods and protocols, managing environmental issues, residual phytoxicity, overcoming toxicological and regulatory barriers. One of the promising aspects of use of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil as grain/food crop protectant is that its favorable mammalian toxicity because its constituents are already used in several products for human consumption. Thus, ecofriendly, biodegradable plant based pesticides which are already in conventional use need less time for their commercial launch in market.
