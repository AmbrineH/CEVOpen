<p id="p0080" class="p">In molecular electronics a single molecule or a group of molecules arranged in a desired manner act as the basic building blocks of electronic devices. Thin films of desired material are very crucial in this regard. Out of various existing thin film preparation techniques Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique is one of the best suitable technique to organize molecules onto thin films in a desired fashion with molecular level control. Specific advantages of LB technique have been listed in table – 3 of Section 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref> in this manuscript. Uniqueness of the LB technique is that it enables us to construct functional two dimensional (2D) material with controllable and scalable growth. Here the organization can be manipulated by controlling various LB parameters viz – speed, composition of mixing, ph and temperature of subphase, changing deposition scheme etc. Thus LB technique provide a way to connect the macroscopic action to control/manipulation at molecular scale. Therefore, it can be said that LB technique may play a vital role to realize the dream of molecular electronics in reality. Till to date LB films have been used in many practical applications including microelectronic and opto-electronic devices, biosensing as well as chemical sensing, lithography etc [
