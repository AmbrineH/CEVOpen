<p id="p0110" class="p">In case of urinary stones calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) biomineral is a major component. In order to prevention or treatment of urinary stone disease it is essential to understand the processes which lead to COM precipitation in the urinary tract. For the studies of COM precipitation and adhesion, LB technique has been used to prepare phospholipid model domains in biological membranes. The effect of chemical and organizational properties of the model membrane towards the formation of COM crystals at the membrane interface can be explored from this study [
