<p id="p0100" class="p">One example from Kuhn's work is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 2</xref>. A block of fluorescent LB films that absorbs blue light and emitting in the yellow is separated from another block of different fluorescent LB films that absorbs in the UV range and emitting in the blue, by a block of fatty acids (spacer layer). He demonstrated that assuming a UV-light incident on the structure, it's possible to have either blue emission or yellow emission from the structure. The overall emission of the structure has thus changed from blue to yellow when the block of spacer layers is thin enough. Here energy transfer between the layers occurred due to the quantum mechanical tunneling, where the spacer layers can control the energy transfer process.
