It requires a very thin resist for enhancement of resolution due to the pronounced scattering in a resist of normal thickness. LB films have been used as photoresist viz, LB films of fatty acid salts as a positive resist and of the 22-tricosenoic acid as a negative resist have been used with good results [

 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Langmuir-Blodgett films have been used as lubricating layers for enhancing the useful life of high density hard disks

 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[91]</xref>. The friction coefficient and wear of the tape has been shown to dramatically reduced by coating the tape with seven layers of barium stearate.
