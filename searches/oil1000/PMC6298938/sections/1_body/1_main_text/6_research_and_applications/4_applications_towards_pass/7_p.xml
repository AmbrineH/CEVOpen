<p id="p0140" class="p">It has been observed that phthalocyanine derivatives show very good thermal and chemical stability when assembled onto LB films. Accordingly different phthalocyanine derivatives have been extensively investigated to realize LB film based field effect transistor (FET). Recently an interesting work about a physico-chemical investigation of carboxylic ionophores and phospholipids for application as ion selective field effect transistor (ISFET) has been reported
