<p id="p0175" class="p">Nowadays, molecular electronics is an important emerging technology. It deals with the design, processing and device application of organic molecules at the molecular level/nanoscale level. LB technique is probably one of the best methods among various film forming techniques to realize organized molecular assemblies at nanoscale and may play a vital role towards molecular electronics. Resistive switching behaviour (bipolar and threshold) of organic molecules assembled onto LB films have been demonstrated successfully [
