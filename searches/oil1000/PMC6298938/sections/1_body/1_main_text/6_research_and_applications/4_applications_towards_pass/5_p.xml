<p id="p0130" class="p">Rectifying junctions are the oldest practical semiconductor device and are used as the basic elements of many electronic devices. The rectifying metal-semiconductor junction forms a schottky barier. LB film based polymer p-n junction as well as schottky junction have been investigated extensively

 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[104]</xref>. LB films of ZnO has been used to fabricate metal-insulator-metal tunnel diode 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[105]</xref>. This types of diodes have great potential for use in infrared detection and energy harvesting applications. Polypyrrole and polythiophene derivatives assembled onto LB films have been investigated for realization of electrical rectifying devices
