<p id="p0170" class="p">Many conducting polymers such as polyacetylene, polythiophene, polyindole, polypyrrole, polyaniline etc have been reported as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries 
 <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[140]</xref>. Photoconductivity involves enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the material by the absorption of a suitable photon. It finds wide range of applications in electronics and opto-electronic devices. Polypyrrole LB films (band gap 3.2 eV) bassed devices is found to exhibit good photoconductivity

 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[142]</xref> fabricated a polymer based capacitor, using polypyrrole and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) poly(styrenesulfonate) as a semiconductor and gate layer. Dielectric polymer, polyvenylphenol, was applied as the insulator to the device. Composite electrodes for supercapacitors were prepared via chemical polymerization
