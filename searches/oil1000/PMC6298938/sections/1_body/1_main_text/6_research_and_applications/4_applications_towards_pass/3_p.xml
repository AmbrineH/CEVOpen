<p id="p0120" class="p">The most significant passive application of LB films could however be for the alignment of liquid crystals. The dipole energy of the underlying substrate mainly governs the alignment of liquid crystals. By tailoring the structure of LB films it is possible to control the dipole energy and hence the orientation of liquid crystal. It has been shown that some liquid crystal molecules align spontaneously when sandwiched between two glass plates covered with a single layer of a polymer LB film [

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) oscillators have very high sensitivity and are widely used. LB technique has been employed to prepare gas absorbent layers on the surface acoustic wave oscillators [
