<p id="p0155" class="p">Disiloxane based LB films showed high potential for OFETs applications for large-area organic electronics 
 <xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[126]</xref>. Large – area heterostructures consisting of silica and quantum dots deposited by LB technique, sandwiched between two grapheme sheets has been used for FET applications 
 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[127]</xref>. This type of heterostructures paves the way for developing novel hybrid opto-electronic devices through integration of 0D and 2D materials using LB method. Langmuir-Schäfer (LS) and cast films of poly (2,5-dioctyloxy-1,4- phenylene-alt-2,5-thienylene) have been used as the active layers to design LB film based transistor devices 
 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[128]</xref>. Interestingly LS thin film based device showed a field-effect mobility of the order of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/V.s Although cast film based device did not show any such transistor behavior. This suggested that LB technique provided a favorable condition with respect to molecular organization in thin film making the system suitable for electron transport. A schematic diagram of LB film based TFT device is shown in
