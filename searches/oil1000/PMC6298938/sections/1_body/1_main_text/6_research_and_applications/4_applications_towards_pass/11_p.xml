Conducting polymers have found potential application as luminescent materials which can replace the conventional inorganic light emitting materials for use in large area, light weight, flexible displays. These materials has attracted much attention due to their distinctive advantages over conventional luminescent materials such as,- low operating voltage, tuning of wavelength emitted by chemical modification, flexibility, low cost, easy processing, possibility of making large device and output colours in whole visible spectrum. Several p-doped conducting polymers have been tested in LB films [
