<p id="p0195" class="p">A novel optical nanosensor using a support bilayer lipid membrane (SBLM) has been recently proposed 
 <xref rid="bib171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[171]</xref>. In this work LB and Layer-By-Layer (LBL) techniques have been combined to obtain highly ordered nanostructure. This work is particularly significant due to the importance of sensors for biological agents in vivo and/or in vitro. A heptamer linear RGD (acridine-glysine-asparate) containing peptide was covalently attached to a BODIPY (2-(4,4-difluoro-5, 7-diphenyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-dodecanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-glycero-3-phospho ethanolamine, donor) lipid dye and utilized as an optical biosensor. A second BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodec-anoic acid, acceptor) lipid dye was integrated into the SBLM, enabling the signal amplification via a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. The result indicates the possibility to detect HUVEC at a concentration of 1000 cells ml
