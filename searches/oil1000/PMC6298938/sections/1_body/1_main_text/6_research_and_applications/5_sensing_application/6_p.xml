<p id="p0200" class="p">LB film based glucose sensor consisting of a conductive polypyrrole membrane has also been investigated 
 <xref rid="bib174" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[174]</xref>. Glucose sensing performance of glucose oxidase/Au nanoparticle composite assembled onto LB film has also been demonstrated 
 <xref rid="bib175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[175]</xref>. Professor M. Rikukawa [
 <xref rid="bib176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>], fabricated a similar biosensor comprised of a lipid-modified glucose oxidase and conducting PPy LB film for detecting glucose. T. N. Misra, et al. demonstrated preparation of stable LB film of dehydrogenase (ADH) - stearic acid mixed system 
 <xref rid="bib178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[178]</xref>. This mixed LB film has been deposited onto polypyrrole coated glass substrate. This LB-immobilized polypyrrole-mediated enzyme electrode can be used as an ethanol sensor. Novel enzymes based micrelectrochemical devices, based on changes in the conductivity of polypyrrole layers, were developed for biosensing of NADH and penicillin 
 <xref rid="bib179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[179]</xref>. Enzyme catalytic properties have been enhanced by incorporating carbon nanotubes in penicillinase phospholipid Langmuir and Langmuir – Blodgett films 
 <xref rid="bib180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[180]</xref>. Surface mediated drug delivery systems consisting of dendrons in presence and absence of a therapeutic compound in LB film has also been demonstrated
