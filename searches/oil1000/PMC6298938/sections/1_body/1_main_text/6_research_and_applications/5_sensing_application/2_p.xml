 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[145]</xref>. In general a typical sensor device consists of a transducer and an active sensing layer. The active layer is suitably chosen in such a way that the interaction between the active layer and the sensing material (material to be sensed) will lead to a reasonable change in some physical properties. By observing the change in physical properties of interaction it will be possible to have idea about the target material. The combination of synthetic chemistry with the molecular engineering capability of the LB technique makes organic multilayered system interesting candidates for sensors. There are numerous physical properties based on which LB film based sensing system can be designed. Examples include resistivity changes, electro chemical phenomena, optical effects etc. Electrochemical pesticide sensor based on LB film of cobalt phthalocyanine-anthraquinone hybrid system has been demonstrated 
 <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[146]</xref>. M. Ferreira et al. designed a sensor array by using nanostructured LB films for electronic tongue application. Such sensor was efficient to recognize sucrose, quinine, NaCl, and HCl at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level, being in some cases 3 orders of magnitude below the human threshold

LB monolayers of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-capped cadmium selenide quantum dots (QCdSe) onto indium−tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate was used to design an electrochemical DNA biosensor for detection of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by covalently immobilizing the thiolterminated oligonucleotide probe sequence via a displacement reaction

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas sensor has been demonstrated by using nanostructured PdO LB film which have high sensitivity over a wide range of concentration (30–4000 ppm) and fast recovery either on exposure to ambient light or by carrier gas flow. On exposure to ambient visible light the increase in photocurrent for such PdO films suggesting its plausible applications in solar energy conversion
