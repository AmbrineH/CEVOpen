 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>b). These changes in the monolayer phases during compression are monitored by measuring the surface pressure – area per molecule (π –A) isotherm. During the self organization process floating monolayer at the interface under goes several phase changes very similar to the three dimensional gaseous, liquid and solid states (
