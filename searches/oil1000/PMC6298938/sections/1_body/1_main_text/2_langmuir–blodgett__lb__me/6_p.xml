<p id="p0045" class="p">Idea about the surface behaviour as well as stability of the floating monolayer has been estimated by recording surface tension. Surface tension is affected to a large extent due to the presence of molecules at air-water interface. Initially the effect of spread molecules on the surface tension is relatively low. When the computer controlled barrier is minutely compressed, the available surface area of the floating Langmuir film is reduced. As a result inter molecular distance between the adjacent molecules decreases and the surface tension decrease further. Amphiphilic molecules in the floating Langmuir film start to interact with each other. The force exerted by the floating film per unit length can be considered as the two dimensional analogue of pressure, known as the surface pressure (Ï€).</p>
