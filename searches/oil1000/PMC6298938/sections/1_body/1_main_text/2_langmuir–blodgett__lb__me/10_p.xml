<p id="p0065" class="p">Langmuir monolayer floating at air-water interface can be transferred onto solid substrate to have mono or multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Typical example of substrate commonly used for LB film deposition are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. During deposition the surface pressure is kept fixed at a desired constant value. Deposition of Langmuir monolayer onto solid substrate can be done in a number of ways – X-type, Y- type, Z-type deposition [

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Depending on the nature of the substrate is whether hydrophilic or hydrophobic the first layer (Langmuir film) will be transferred onto the substrate either when raised or lowered through the interfacial film. Subsequently, successive depositions of single layers occurred during each traversal of the substrate through the monolayer film at air – water interface. Such a deposition mode is called vertical deposition or Y-type deposition. Multilayer film can be deposited through repeated lowering and raising of substrate through the floating layer. In Y-type deposition film possess head-to-head and tail-to-tail configuration 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[34]</xref>. Y type deposition is very often used in LB technique. However, in certain cases the floating monolayer is transferred only during the immersion (X-Type deposition) or the emersion (Z-type deposition) of the substrate. LB film deposition typically depends on the pH &amp; temperature of the subphase, humidity, deposition speed, deposition pressure, layer number and contact angle between the substrate and floating layer during deposition [
