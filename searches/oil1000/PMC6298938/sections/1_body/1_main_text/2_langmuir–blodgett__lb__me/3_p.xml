<p id="p0020" class="p">Typically LB compatible materials are amphiphilic molecules having two distinct regions, which are a hydrophilic head group (water loving) and a hydrophobic tail group (water hating) as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 1</xref>a. They must be soluble in organic non polar and water immiscible solvents. Water insoluble amphiphilic molecules form floating monolayer at air-water interface. Long chain fatty acid, lipid molecules etc are the example of LB compatible materials.
