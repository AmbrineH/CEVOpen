<p id="p0040" class="p">Initially selected amphiphilic materials is dissolved in a volatile and water in soluble solvent (chloroform, benzene etc)to prepare dilute solution. After that minute amount of the solution is spread onto air-water interface at the LB trough using a micro syringe. Spreading should be done from very close to the water surface so that the solution and hence the molecule remain at air-water interface and do not dip into the water. Soon after the spreading the molecules spread through out the interface (available area) on the trough. After the evaporation of solvent almost one molecule thick layer of the amphiphile remained at the interface, with the head groups immersed in the water and the tail group lying outside (

Normally the amount of molecules (concentration) is kept as low as possible so that initially the molecules remains far from each other and exert very little force on each other. Under these circumstances, the interaction between the molecules is very low (lateral adhesion is almost zero) and the resulting floating monolayer can be considered as a two – dimensional gas due to the large inter molecular distances (
