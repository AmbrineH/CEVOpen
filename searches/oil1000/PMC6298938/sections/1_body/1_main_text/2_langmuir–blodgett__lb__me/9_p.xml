<p id="p0060" class="p">It may be noted in this regard that the shape, nature of the isotherm curve as well as the monolayer phases are largely depend on the condition of subphase-pH, temperature and also on the hydrocarbon chain length and head group of the spread molecule 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[35]</xref>. Factor governing the monolayer phase behaviour have been listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. As a whole π-A isotherm provides information about thermodynamic behaviour and stability of the floating film, the reorientation of the molecules and existence of the phase transition as well as conformational transformation of air-water interface
