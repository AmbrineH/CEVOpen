Generally, the basic requirement for such applications are,- a perfectly organized molecular thin films having specific properties, careful alignment of the molecules and a substrate which have very good stability with respect to thermal and chemical changes. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique is a powerful tool in creating carefully controlled supramolecular structures of organized molecular assemblies [

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which have their potential applications in above mentioned areas. By changing different film forming parameters during LB film formation, it is possible to control the bulk properties of the materials that were incorporated into the LB films. Due to the tremendous advancement of preparation and characterization tools it is possible to synthesize organic molecules having any desired structure and functionality without any limitation. In addition to that flexibility and over all control on the film structure prepared using LB technique enables the production at electrically, optically and biologically active components on a nanometre scale. Perhaps the LB technique is the most suitable method for the realization of nano to micro order thin films of organized system with wide range of application potential
