  <p class="p">Multivariate Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots showing the distance between 
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> gut samples (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>). Each color point represents individuals from each treatment group. The cladogram represents the clustering of the different samples based on the composition of their microbiotas (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>). The analysis was created by using an average linkage from the weighted UniFrac distance matrices. Each node supported by a 
   <italic class="italic">Jackknife</italic> analysis with greater than 100% accuracy. This analysis was based on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla and proteobacterial classes. Figures before treatment groups represents the various biological replicates and sample ID (for example, Control1-1 means first biological replicate and the first individual from the control group).
