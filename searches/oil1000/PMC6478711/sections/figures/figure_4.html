 <p> Multiple samples rarefaction curves based on 16S rRNA genes pyrosequencing. This was used to evaluate the completeness of the sequencing effort in describing the diversity of guts associated bacteria of C. maculatus. The OTUs were defined by 3% distances. Percentage values represent coverage indices which are given from a Chao1 analysis. </p>
