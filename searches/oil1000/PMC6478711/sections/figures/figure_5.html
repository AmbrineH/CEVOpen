 <p> Relative abundance of the dominant bacterial phyla in all samples revealed by 454-pyrosequencing. The relative number of OTUs was defined as the percentage of the species sequences in total successfully classifiable sequences in the samples using SILVA databank. Data was obtained at an average threshold of 97%. Phylogenetic groups accounting for less than 1% of all classified sequences are summarized as “Others”. </p>
