 <p> Multivariate Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots showing the distance between C. maculatus gut samples ( A). Each color point represents individuals from each treatment group. The cladogram represents the clustering of the different samples based on the composition of their microbiotas ( B). The analysis was created by using an average linkage from the weighted UniFrac distance matrices. Each node supported by a Jackknife analysis with greater than 100% accuracy. This analysis was based on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla and proteobacterial classes. Figures before treatment groups represents the various biological replicates and sample ID (for example, Control1-1 means first biological replicate and the first individual from the control group). </p>
