<p id="Par22" class="p">The 454-pyrosequencing analysis of gut microbiome provided empirical evidence on bacterial phyla potentially involved in the interaction with DDVP and EO. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were abundantly detected in the Control and DDVP treated samples at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> generations (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, their proportions in EO treated beetles were significantly reduced across generations and these correlated with the increase in adult mortality. Possibly, these bacterial phyla could be associated to DDVP-biodegradation in
