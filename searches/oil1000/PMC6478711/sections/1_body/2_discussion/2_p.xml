 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). These findings suggest that symbiotic beetles have developed the ability to tolerate DDVP molecules, presumably sustained by their gut bacteria, as their population crash in aposymbiotic beetles resulted in significant increase of their susceptibility compared to the symbiotic ones and remained consistent across generations.
