<p id="Par24" class="p">The use of antibiotics to suppress the gut microbial communities did not affect the survival of aposymbiotic beetles as the very little mortality recorded was similar to that of the symbiotic ones. This suggests that the mortality recorded was not caused by the use of antibiotics (in aposymbiotic beetles), but by the pesticide treatments (EO and DDVP). However, the suppression of gut bacteria by antibiotics resulted in higher adult mortality rates compared to the symbiotic ones. This suggests that, without its intestinal bacterial,

 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> could not successfully survive exposure to DDVP. The high number of chemical constituents detected from

 </sup> may come into play toward maintaining the consistent susceptibility of the beetles across generations by targeting the most abundant bacterial communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Many previous works demonstrated the interactions between gut bacteria and phytochemicals

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>
 </sup>, but the specific conserved functions of gut bacteria in the cowpea beetles need further investigations of the whole transcriptomes of the insect. At the very least, our results give evidence that gut bacterial communities in 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> might mediate DDVP degradation making them resistant to it. These bacteria might also be the target of plant toxins from EO making 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> more susceptible to phytochemicals. We therefore believe that plant allelochemicals may have evolved antibiotic functions to disrupt gut bacterial communities in
