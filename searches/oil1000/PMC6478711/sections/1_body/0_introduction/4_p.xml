<p id="Par5" class="p">The cowpea beetle, 
 <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is the most destructive pest of stored cowpea worldwide
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. This pest infests cowpea from the field before harvest and causes substantial damages to the stored seeds, owing to its short biological cycle (25–28 days) and higher fecundity rates

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
