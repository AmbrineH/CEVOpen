 <italic class="italic">adoensis</italic> EO could target gut bacterial communities (including those that are resistant to DDVP) by disrupting their activities in order to enhance the susceptibility of the beetle to the toxin. We produced aposymbiotic beetles from the larval stage (as adult does not feed) by inoculating two antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Gentamycin) in artificial cowpea seeds on which normal eggs were allowed to develop. Likewise, the experimental seeds were produced by applying DDVP or EO on artificial cowpea seeds, to which, symbiotic and aposymbiotic beetles were exposed across multiple generations. The effects of this long term exposure to both pesticides on adult mortality and on the structure, composition and diversity of gut microbiota were assessed at first and fifth generation.
