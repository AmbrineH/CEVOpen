 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> shares similar core bacteria, dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. These bacterial phyla may allow the adults

 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> to survive on DDVP treated grains, thereby making it inappropriate to control the beetle populations in the field. The results also revealed that

 <italic class="italic">adoensis</italic> EO could represent an alternative pesticideÂ to DDVP through its capacity to uphold the vulnerability of the beetles across generations, hence maintaining their populations below economic thresholds. From an ecological perspective, the findings herein broaden our understanding of the implications of gut bacteria in the adaptation mechanisms of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> to pesticides. This could help to develop new tools to aid the implementation of eco-friendly control strategies and reduce the environmental impact of synthetic chemicals.
