<p id="Par35" class="p">Symbiotic and aposymbiotc beetles were assayed separately. The test was carried out in Petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm), each containing 10 g of artificial cowpea seeds divided into three treatment groups (EO, DDVP &amp; Control) of 15 replicates each. Each treatment group comprised three biological replicates and each biological replicate contained 5 individual beetles. The EO groups (seeds treated with 10 µL of EO per gram of overall seed weight), the DDVP groups (seeds treated with 15 µL of DDVP per gram of overall seed weight), and finally the control groups (seeds treated with DMSO only). The working concentrations of EO and DDVP represent their effective concentration (EC
