The resistance levels of experimental beetles were based on adult mortality rates at each generation and insects were considered dead if they were unable to turn over after gentle prod on their abdomen

 </sup>. All treatments were maintained at 27 ± 3 °C temperature, 55 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) and 14:10 (Light: Dark) photoperiod. Only females were chosen for microbial analyses due to their high capacity to tolerate pesticides, shown by lower mortality rates recorded across generations compared to males (Fig.
