 </sup> and the recovered DNA samples were checked for quality by spectrophotometry and purified. Five nanograms of purified DNA was used per qPCR reaction targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using universal primers 27 F/533R. Each sample was prepared by pooling 10 individual guts representing 10 replicates from symbiotic and aposymbiotic beetles each, using SYBRGreen in 384-well plates on an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA). The 18 S rRNA was used as internal control gene for the determination of gut bacterial content from each sample. The gut microbial communities from the symbiotic beetles gave 10.01 × 10
