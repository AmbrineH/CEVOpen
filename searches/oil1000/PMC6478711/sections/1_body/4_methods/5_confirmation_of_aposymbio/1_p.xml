<p id="Par33" class="p">The aposymbiotic status of the newly emerged beetles was checked using the culture dependent technique and the qPCR analyses targeting the 16S rRNA genes, respectively. Ten normal and ten antibiotics treated beetles, were randomly selected and individually dissected. Individual guts were removed and homogenized and the homogenate was serially diluted, spread on standard Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl in 950 mL deionized water at pH 7.0) and incubated at 30 °C overnight. The Colony Forming Units (CFU) resulting from the bacterial colonies were calculated in each group. The estimation of cultivable bacteria in symbiotic beetles (normal) gave 6.514 × 10
