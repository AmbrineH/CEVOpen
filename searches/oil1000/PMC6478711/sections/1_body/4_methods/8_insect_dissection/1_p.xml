<p id="Par38" class="p">Five insects from each of the three biological replicates (making 15 individuals per treatment group) were collected, anesthetized by placing them at −20 °C for 30 minutes. Soon after, they were washed in 70% ethanol for 2 min and rinsed 3 times in sterile distilled water before dissection. To prevent contamination of the samples, the dissection was carried out aseptically with two pairs of sterilized forceps on a sterilized glass slide spread with 50 µL of sterile distilled water under a stereomicroscope

 </sup>. The whole process was done in a laminar flow hood to avoid aerial contaminations. The intact guts were individually and separately transferred into Eppendorf tubes containing 750 μL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8), disaggregated and manually homogenized with an Eppendorf adapted pestle and directly inoculated onto LB agar plates
