 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> couples were introduced in two separate glass jars (500 mL size), respectively, each containing 50 g of normal artificial seeds and antibiotic treated seeds, respectively. The females were allowed to lay eggs on the seeds in which the larvae were allowed to develop till adult emergence. The beetles emerging from the normal seeds are symbiotic (containing intact gut microbiome) and those emerging from antibiotics treated seeds are experimentally deprived of gut bacteria but their aposymbiotic state was confirmed by culture dependent and molecular techniques as described below.
