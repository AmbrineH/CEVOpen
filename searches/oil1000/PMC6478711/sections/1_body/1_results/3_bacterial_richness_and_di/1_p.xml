<p id="Par13" class="p">The non-parametric richness indexes (Shannon and Simpson) evaluated at 97% similarity, showed similar comparative trends in the prediction of the number of OTUs from DDVP and Control samples. The Shannon diversity index provides not only species richness (i.e. the number of species present) but how the abundance of each species is distributed (the evenness of the species) among all the species in the community. Here, the bacterial diversity were similarly higher in the Control and DDVP samples at both tested generations (Control: Shannon = 4.78 ± 0.13 and Shannon = 4.98 ± 0.1; DDVP: Shannon = 4.61 ± 0.14 and Shannon = 4.56 ± 0.15, at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, respectively), but significantly lower in EO samples (Shannon = 3.58 ± 0.3 and Shannon = 2.47 ± 0.11, at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, respectively) (F = 1699.178; df = 1; P = 0.032) (Table
