<p id="Par14" class="p">The Multi Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances revealed no significant difference between the gut microbiotas of Control and DDVP treated beetles (A = 0.09208; P = 0.558). However, the microbiome of EO treated beetles was found to be significantly different from the gut microbiomes of the Control and DDVP treated beetles (Bray-Curtis distance statistics, A = 0.009871; P = 0.0089 &amp; A = 0.0002764; P &lt; 0.0201). Similar trends were observed after the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) performed on the various treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the structure, composition and abundance of the Control and DDVP treated beetles (R = 0.7518, P = 0.201), which were both different from the EO treated beetles (EO- Control: R = 0.798; P = 0.0014 &amp; EO-DDVP: R = 0.9602; P &lt; 0.001).</p>
