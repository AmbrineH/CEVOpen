<p id="Par11" class="p">A total of 63,709 raw reads were generated from all treatments (Control, DDVP and EO) at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> generations (35,069 and 28,640 reads, respectively). After quality trimming, filtering and downstream analyses, 55,620 high quality sequences were obtained (31,328 and 24,292 from F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, respectively) and generated on average 194 ± 69 OTUs (205 ± 37 and 183 ± 100 OTUs from F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F5, respectively). Experimental generations did not significantly affect the OTUs composition of the Control and DDVP treated samples (Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model, F = 0.137; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.86; t = 0.688; df = 1; P = 0.73 and F = 54.16; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.86; t = 0.688; df = 1; P = 0.26, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, the number of OTUs from EO treated samples varied significantly across generations (Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model, F = 27.021; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.939; t = 1.73; df = 1; P = 0.007), and was significantly reduced compared to the Control and DDVP treatments (ANOVA, F = 7.078; df = 2; P &lt; 0.001 and F = 7.078; df = 2; P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). There was a non-significant increase of OTUs number at F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> in DDVP treatments compared to their amount at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (ANOVA, F = 7.82; df = 1; P = 0.056) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
