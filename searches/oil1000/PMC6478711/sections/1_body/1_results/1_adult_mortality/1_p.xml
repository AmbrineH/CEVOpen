<p id="Par9" class="p">The susceptibility of experimental beetles was significantly affected by symbiotic status (Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model, F = 95.952; df = 1 r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.988; t = 3.936; P &lt; 0.0001), pesticides used (F = 191.036; df = 2; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.969; t = 4.598; P &lt; 0.0001) and by experimental generations (F = 8.531; df = 4; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.895; t = 2.751; P &lt; 0.0001). However, the susceptibility of aposymbiotic beetles treated with DDVP did not vary significantly across generations (F = 94.95; df = 2; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.673; t = 3.481; P = 0.148) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The symbiotic status and experimental generations did not affect the susceptibility of beetles treated with DMSO only (control) (F = 28.894; df = 1, 4; r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.776; t = 2.027; P = 0.282) as very low and similar mortality was recorded between the symbiotic and aposymbiotic beetles across generations (Fig.
