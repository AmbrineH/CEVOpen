<p id="Par15" class="p">The rarefaction is a computational analysis of species accumulation based on the repeated re-sampling of all clusters. The curve is therefore the representation of statistical expectation for the observed accumulation curves, enabling the comparison of the statistically expected species richness of each community at the same sampling effort or abundance. The flattening of the rarefaction curves recorded here indicates that the sampling was of adequate depth and that additional sampling would produce few additional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Fig.
