<p id="Par17" class="p">The OTUs assigned to Proteobacteria matched to the classes alpha, beta, delta and gammaproteobacteria and to eleven bacterial families (Comamonadaceae, Enterococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Morganellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Polyangiaceae); four families from Firmicutes (Staphylococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Streptococcaceae); four families from Bacteroidetes (Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae) and finally three families from Actinobacteria (Micrococcaceae, Brevibacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Other bacterial families were represented by only a few bacterial sequences. The percentage of unclassified sequences was not taken into consideration during the calculation of their abundance. Overall, 51.69% of bacterial genera were identified from the different samples, representing a total of 42 genera. Most of the dominant genera were from Proteobacteria: these are 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic> (4.73%), 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> (2.03%), 
 <italic class="italic">Citrobacter</italic> (2.03%), 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella</italic> (1.69%), 
 <italic class="italic">Orbus</italic> (1.69%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Comamonas</italic> (1.03%). The Firmicutes were predominantly represented by

 <italic class="italic">Lactococcus</italic> (3.04%), 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> (2.03%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Exiguobacterim</italic> (1.35%). 
 <italic class="italic">Dysgonomonas</italic> (9.80%) is the most dominant genus from Bacteroidetes phyla. Burkholderiales represent 10.93% of the total bacterial order detected although no genus was identified.
