<p id="Par18" class="p">Bacterial community structure did not vary significantly across generations in Control and DDVP treated samples (F = 581.677; df = 1; P = 0.158 and F = 581.677; df = 1; P = 0.058, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7A</xref>), but vary significantly in EO treated samples at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> (F = 1699.178; df = 4; P &lt; 0.001 and F = 1699.178; df = 4; P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7A</xref>). A cladogram representing the clustering of the different samples based on the composition of their microbiotas show that the Control and DDVP groups are closely related but both are distantly related with the EO treated beetles (Fig.
