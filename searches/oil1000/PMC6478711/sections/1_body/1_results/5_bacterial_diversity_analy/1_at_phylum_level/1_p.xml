<p id="Par16" class="p">Proteobacteria (gamma: 35.60% and beta: 13.26%), Bacteroidetes (7.89%) and Firmicutes (6.09%) were the most dominant bacterial phyla equally represented at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> generations in DDVP and Control samples, although their proportions were slightly different (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The proportions of gammaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were significantly reduced at F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> in EO samples in comparison with the Control and DDVP. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria present at F1 in EO samples were completely missing at F

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and F
