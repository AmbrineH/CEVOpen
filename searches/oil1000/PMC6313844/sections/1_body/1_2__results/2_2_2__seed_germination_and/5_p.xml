<p class="p">The previous selective inhibitory effect at the concentrations applied displayed by peppermint essential oil against the three assayed weeds with a total

 <xref rid="plants-07-00079-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Tomato was the most sensible crop, with an almost complete seed germination inhibition (96.84%) at the highest dose assayed (1 µL/mL), followed by maize (79.31%) and rice (36.96%). Peppermint essential oil significantly affected the growth of both the hypocotyl and radicle of rice and tomato (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00079-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The maize radicle was also significantly disturbed by these treatments in comparison to the control, whereas the volatile oil did not affect the hypocotyl growth of maize. It is interesting to note the results of peppermint essential oil against rice and 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic>, which show a lower phytotoxic effect in rice, with a seed germination inhibition percentage between 18.48% to 16.30% at the doses of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 µL/mL (
