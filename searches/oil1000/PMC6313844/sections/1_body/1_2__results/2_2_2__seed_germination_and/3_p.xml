<p class="p">In addition, a stronger phytotoxic effect was found with peppermint essential oil against the seedling growth (hypocotyl and radicle) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, so it could be employed as a potential post-harvest treatment. According to 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic> seedling growth, significant differences were found between the control and the higher doses (0.50 and 1 µL/mL) tested (

 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic> seeds (37.25%), whereas a moderate (50.98%) inhibitory effect was observed when the highest dose (1 µL/mL) was applied. A similar result was found in radicle elongation, with a percentage inhibition of 43.48% at the two higher concentrations (

 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> seedling growth was more sensible to peppermint essential oil, experiencing a significant reduction in both hypocotyl and radicle development with respect to the control (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00079-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b). There was no major difference in either hypocotyl or radicle enlargement when comparing concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1 µL/mL), achieving between 75.40–86.64% and 71.13–82.10% inhibition of hypocotyl and radicle expansion, respectively.
