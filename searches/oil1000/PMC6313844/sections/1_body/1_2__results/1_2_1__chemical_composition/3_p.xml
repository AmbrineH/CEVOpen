<p class="p">Regarding peppermint essential oil, oxygenated monoterpenes (94.77%) with 12 compounds identified were the main qualitative and quantitative phytochemical group found. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons at a far lower percentage (2.49%) constituted the next phytochemical group. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes and others were found at percentages lower than 1% (0.26 and 0.15%, respectively). Finally, neither monoterpene hydrocarbons nor aromatic compounds were detected in the commercial peppermint essential oil analysed here. Between the 24 identified compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>, the oxygenated monoterpene menthol (48.23 ± 0.36%), followed by menthone (23.33 ± 0.59%) and its diasteromer 
 <italic class="italic">iso</italic>-menthone (16.33 ± 0.03%), were the main compounds. Among the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, only β-caryophyllene (1.26 ± 0.04%) reached a percentage higher than 1%. E-nerolidol, spathulenol, and caryophyllene oxide were the only oxygenated sesquiterpenes identified, with each one reaching 0.09%.
