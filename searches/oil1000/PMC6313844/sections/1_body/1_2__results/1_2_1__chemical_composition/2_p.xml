<p class="p">In winter savory essential oil, the monoterpene compounds (95.06%), both oxygenated (71.90 ± 0.08%), with 16 compounds identified and hydrocarbons (23.16 ± 0.33%) including 13 components, were the main qualitative and quantitative fractions found. The phenolic compounds carvacrol (43.34 ± 0.09%) and thymol (23.20 ± 0.06%), followed by their biogenetic precursors 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (11.41 ± 0.01%) and γ-terpinene (5.78 ± 0.01%), were the main compounds of winter savory essential oil. Together, the oxygenated monoterpenes, linalool, became the next major constituent of this fraction, although at a far lower percentage (2.34 ± 0.01%). Other compounds were detected in lower quantities, such as terpinen-4-ol (1.04 ± 0.01%) and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate (0.20 ± 0.01%). Among the sesquiterpene fraction (3.46%), only relatively large amounts of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon β-caryophyllene (2.81 ± 0.01%) were found, while the rest ranged from 0.03% for γ-cadinene to 0.31% for the oxygenated sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide. Abietatriene (0.06%) and eugenol (0.05%) were the only diterpene hydrocarbon and phenylpropanoid detected in winter savory essential oil, respectively.
