 <xref rid="B35-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] against gram-positive (
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and

 <xref rid="B38-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Related to their phytotoxicity, both carvacrol and thymol have shown total suppression of the seed germination and seedling growth of

 <xref rid="B40-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] studies, in which oregano essential oil with 60.42% of carvacrol exhibited a total inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> at the same in vitro doses assayed. These results indicate that winter savory is an effective broad-spectrum herbicide as it occurs with glyphosate that also exerts inhibitory effects on the seed germination of crops, such as wheat (

 <italic class="italic">Pisum sativum</italic> L.), lettuce (
 <italic class="italic">Latuca sativa</italic> L.) [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], and even trees, for instance

 <xref rid="B42-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. So, this formulate could be an alternative to glyphosate with less environmental and human health problems.
