<p class="p">Sets of 20 seeds (10 for maize), each with five replicates (ten replicate in maize) per treatment, were homogenously distributed in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) between two layers of filter paper (Whatman No.1) moistened with 4 mL of distilled water and with 0 (control), 0.125, 0.250, 0.5, and 1 µL/mL of winter savory, peppermint, and anise essential oils. Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated in a germination chamber Equitec EGCS 301 3SHR model, according to previous assays [

To evaluate the herbicidal activity of the essential oils, the number of germinated seeds was counted and compared with those of untreated seedlings. Emergence of the radicle (≥1 mm) was used as an index of germination and seedling length (hypocotyl and/or radicle) data were recorded after 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days in each replicate.
