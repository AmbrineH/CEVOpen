<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was carried out with a 5973N Agilent apparatus, equipped with a capillary column (95 dimethylpolysiloxane- 5% diphenyl), Agilent HP-5MS UI (30 m long and 0.25 mm i.d. with 0.25 µm film thickness). The column temperature program was 60 °C for 5 min, with 3 °C/min increases to 180 °C, and then 20 °C/min increases to 280 °C, which was maintained for 10 min. The carrier gas was Helium at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. Split mode injection (ratio 1:30) was employed. Mass spectra were taken over the
