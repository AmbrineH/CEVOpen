<p class="p">On the other hand, it is also interesting to expand the research with anise (
 <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> L.) essential oil since it is an annual medicinal plant belonging to the Apiaceae family and popularly known for its widespread use in the food and drink industry [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Its essential oil has shown higher antioxidant activity in in vitro models than the synthetic antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), being possibly used for protecting fat-containing foods [

 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which was effectively inhibited by anethole, the main component of aniseed, with an MFC value of 200 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition, it has been able to exert an insecticidal effect against young larvae of the Colorado potato beetle [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. According to its phytotoxic activity, it has been described as one of the least active Mediterranean essential oils: it has shown a lower in vitro inhibitory effect in the seed germination of garden cress (
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic>), even promoting its germination and/or radicle elongation, as well as in food crops, such as lettuce (
 <italic class="italic">Latuca sativa</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Despite its low phytotoxic potential, it has exhibited an effective competitive ability on common purslane, common lambsquarters, black nightshade, and barnyardgrass, being more suitable in low-input agricultural systems [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, due to the harmful capacity of herbicides to remain inactivated for months in the soil and food products later consumed, anise essential oil has been recently included as one of the volatiles able to decompose and/or inhibit the function of the herbicide, together with ginger, peppermint, juniper, and lemongrass essential oils, through the dissolution and alteration of its chemical structure. In this case, the primary degradation product after the application of these essential oils is aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), which is detected in much lower amounts in soil than glyphosate [
