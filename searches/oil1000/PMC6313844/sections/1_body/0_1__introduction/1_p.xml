<p class="p">The potential hazard to the environment and human health, as well as the emergence of resistant weeds, are still the main problems of the overuse of synthetic herbicides used to improve global crop productivity. The continuous use of glyphosate, marketed in 1974 as a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Recently, glyphosate resistance has been described in many world-wide species, like common ragweed (

 <xref rid="B6-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] can even induce acute poisoning in humans, as well as chronic and sub-chronic toxicity, which has been reported in mammals after the consumption of contaminated food [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. As these problems have appeared, some other weed killers have been synthesised as alternative solutions. However, the latest generation of the synthetic triketone herbicide family (sulcotrione, mesotrione, and tembotrione) also has negative impacts in microbial edaphic communities or plants, and even their degradation products can be more toxic than those of the parent, leading to similar environmental problems to glyphosate [
