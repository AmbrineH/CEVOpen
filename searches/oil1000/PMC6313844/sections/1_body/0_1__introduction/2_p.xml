<p class="p">Resistance to other agrochemicals has also been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium</italic> spp., exhibiting resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides that hinder acetolactate synthase (ALS), the enzyme common to the biosynthesis of the branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and ACCase (acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Similarly, common purslane (
 <italic class="italic">Portulaca oleracea</italic> L.) has developed resistance against linuron, a selective pre- and early post-emergent herbicide, in carrot (
 <italic class="italic">Daucus carota</italic>) fields [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In summary, weeds have evolved resistance in most of the known herbicide sites of action, being reported in 75 crops of 69 countries [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. So, it is necessary to find more eco-friendly and less hazardous natural alternatives than synthetic herbicides, without promoting the emergence of resistance. In terms of natural compounds, essential oils are well-known for their multiple biological properties: anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, repellent, antibacterial, antifungal, or antioxidant, and have been widely used in the perfumery, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food industry, also being investigated to control crop pests [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In this sense, 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja montana</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) was the highest effective larvicide of the essential oils tested against 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and was particularly active against several of the most damaging phytopathogenic fungi (
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizoctonia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis</italic> spp.) that are able to destruct plant tissues, mainly cereals [
