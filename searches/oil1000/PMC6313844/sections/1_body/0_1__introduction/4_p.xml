<p class="p">Another interesting bioresource is peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> L.) essential oil, because it is able to exert a higher antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, as well as upper antioxidant activity in DPPH free radical scavenging and β-carotene/linoleic acid systems, compared to other plant species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Myrtus communis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These characteristics make peppermint essential oil a possible suitable bio-preservative to prevent post-harvest food decay. In this sense, it could be used to delay mold formation and reduce the incidence of infections when included as part of a coating as a previous experiment with only low amounts of the volatile that were enough to control fungal rot affecting

 <xref rid="B17-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Regarding our topic, it is one of the most phytotoxic essential oils of 12 aromatic species, including 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">Convolvulus arvensis</italic> L.), purslane, and jungle rice (
 <italic class="italic">E. colonum</italic> L.) has been observed at different concentrations (0, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, and 1800 µL/L) of peppermint essential oil, whereas horticultural crops such as tomato (
 <italic class="italic">Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> Mill.) and radish (
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> L.) were even more susceptible [
