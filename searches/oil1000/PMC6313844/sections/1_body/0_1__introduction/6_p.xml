<p class="p">So, the aims of this work are firstly to test the in vitro phytotoxic activity (of previously analysed commercial essential oils, winter savory, peppermint, and anise, in order to assure their main compounds by GC/MS) against seed germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic>, a cosmopolitan annual weed of tropical and subtropical climates; 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic>, because 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium</italic> spp. has been ranked as one of the specimens most frequently exhibiting herbicide resistance in many countries [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-plants-07-00079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]; and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic>, a serious weed of irrigation crops, especially rice. Secondly, we aim to corroborate in vivo the previous in vitro phytotoxic effect using a commercial emulsifiable concentrate with the more phytotoxic essential oils and finally, we will study their potential hazard against maize (
 <italic class="italic">Zea mays</italic> L.), rice (
 <italic class="italic">Oryza sativa</italic> L.), and tomato (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) seeds in order to obtain selective bioherbicides for food crops.
