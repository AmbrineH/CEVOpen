<p class="p">Our combined attempts on purposeful genomics offer a partial chemical and a genetic leads to illustrate the biochemical depiction of a bioactive compound (BS) produced by 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic>. In this report, 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> was confirmed as BS producing strain in a fermentation medium supplemented with glucose as carbon source. Based on the physical properties like SFT, IFT, CMC, CA and EI, we suggest that SAMP as one of the ingenious BS producers. From genome analysis, we traced out the biosynthetic pathway for terpene. However, the later stages of terpene biosynthesis might be diverted toward BS secretion; detailed investigation on this aspect would be helpful to prove this possibility. Terpene containing BS significantly reduced the SFT of PBS from 72 to 30 mN/m with a CMC value of 1.3 mg/mL. Systematic investigation on 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> BS through TLC, FT-IR, NMR and LC-MS disclosed the presence of sugar and lipid moieties. Perhaps this is the first report documenting the detailed investigation on physico-chemical properties on BS of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> origin. Based on genomic and functional analysis, the term terpene containing BS is denoted for the surfactant produced by 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic>. We believe that the production of BS from 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> would be recognized in the literature in the parallel line of previous popular BS (Surfactin-
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> sp.; Surlactin-
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> sp.; Rhamnolipid-
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> sp.). The foremost intention on evaluation of functional properties would definitely enrich the literature on BS producing 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp.
