<p class="p">Seawater sample was collected in sterile polythene bag from the sea shore of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, India (17.24째 N, 73.37째 E) and brought into the laboratory and maintained at 4째C for further use. The isolation of halophilic bacteria was carried out by using enrichment culture technique. Briefly, 1 mL of water sample was inoculated into 100 mL production medium with composition (per liter distilled water) 5 g yeast extract, 1 g (NH

The resulting medium was further incubated at 30째C on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) for 7 days. Following enrichment procedures, 1 mL of the culture sample was diluted and streaked on production medium agar plates containing glucose as a sole carbon source. The obtained bacterial colonies were further purified by streaking on nutrient agar plates (supplemented with 3% NaCl).
