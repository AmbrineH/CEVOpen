<p class="p">Ion electrospray mass spectra (ESI–MS) of BS were recorded on a Finnigan QTOF2 mass spectrometer (Thermo Quest LC and LC/MS Division, San Jose, CA, United States). Stock solution of the surface-active compound was prepared by dissolving of 2 mg substance in 1 mL chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Aliquots of 0.1 mL were diluted in 1.9 mL acetonitrile/water (7:3, v/v) and infused at a flow rate of 10 μL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> with a syringe pump (Hamilton syringe, 500 μL) directly connected to the electrospray ionization (ESI). ESI mode was as follows: sheath gas-nitrogen (6l min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>); negative mode [M–H]– at -4 kV of ionization; the temperature and the voltage of the heated capillary were 300°C and 25 V, respectively; tube lens offset 5 V. Helium was used as a collision gas at the collision-induced dissociation (
