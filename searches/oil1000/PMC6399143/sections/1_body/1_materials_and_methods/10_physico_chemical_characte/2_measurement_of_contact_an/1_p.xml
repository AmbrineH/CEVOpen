<p class="p">The contact angle (CA) of purified BS was determined at CMC solution on Teflon (highly hydrophobic), glass (highly hydrophilic) and parafilm (intermediate) as per the procedure described by 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hamza et al. (2017)</xref>. Emulsification properties of BS against various hydrophobic substrates like hexadecane, kerosene, toluene, coconut oil and castor oil were carried out as per the emulsification assay explained by 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Satpute et al. (2010b)</xref>. Water and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (CMC solution 8 mM) were considered as negative and positive control, respectively.
