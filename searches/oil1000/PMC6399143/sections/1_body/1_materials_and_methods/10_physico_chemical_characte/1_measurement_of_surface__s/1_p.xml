<p class="p">In order to determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of BS, different concentrations (100–1,500 μg/mL) of purified product were prepared in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Ability of BS to reduce the SFT of PBS was determined by the pendant drop technique using Optical Contact Angle Goniometer (OCA 15 Plus, DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, Germany). The equilibrium shape of the pendant drop was captured using charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and analyzed in real time by using SCA 20 software. SFT values of each dilution were determined on the above instrument, and the CMC was determined by plotting values of SFT versus concentration of BS on semi-log scale. During the measurement, the instrument itself takes around 500 readings and the mean values of those 500 readings were displayed by the software which was taken for further analysis. The IFT of purified BS was measured at CMC value against the kerosene (purchased from local market) and 2T engine oil (HP racer, India). Detailed procedure is discussed in the recent publications of our group (
