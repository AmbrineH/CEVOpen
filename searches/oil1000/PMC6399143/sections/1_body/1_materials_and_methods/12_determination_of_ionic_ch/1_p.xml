<p class="p">The ionic character of BS was determined by agar well diffusion method. Anionic surfactant such as SDS (20 mM), cationic surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (20 mM) and non-ionic surfactants Triton X-100 (0.9 mM) and Tween 80 (0.012 mM) were used for this study. Assay was performed as described by
