<p class="p">The production of BS was performed in production medium supplemented with glucose (1.5% w/v) as sole carbon source. A seed culture (20 mL) was prepared by transferring a single colony of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> from nutrient agar medium (supplemented with 3% NaCl). After 48 h of incubation, around 3% (v/v) of seed culture of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> was transferred as inoculum in a fresh fermentation media (150 mL) in 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. The complete production of BS was carried out at 30°C, 120 rpm for 7 days (

Dried cell weight was measured in parallel to determine the biomass during the BS fermentation. Procedure carried out is as follows: Around 10 mL of culture broth was filtered through sterile filter paper (0.22 μm Millipore, Bengaluru, India), further dried at 105°C for 24 h and weighed. The dried biomass was weighed repeatedly till the constant weight was noted. BS fermentation process was carried out up to 7 days and the product was then extracted from cells free supernatant (CFS). All experiments were done in triplicate and the mean values were plotted along with the standard deviation (SD) using the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, United States). The CFB obtained by centrifugation, was subjected to acid precipitation (5 N HCl). The solvent system of ethyl acetate: methanol (4:1, v/v) was used for the extraction of BS at room temperature. The organic phase was subjected to rotary evaporation to obtain BS product (

The mobile phase of chloroform: methanol (100:0, 95:05, 90:10, 85:15 and 80:20) was used for elution. After elution different fractions were collected and analyzed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) (
