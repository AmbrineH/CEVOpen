<p class="p">The stability of purified BS was checked at different pH, temperatures and NaCl concentrations. Buffer solutions of different pH (2, 4, 6…14) were prepared and BS (1.3 mg/mL: CMC concentration) was added, incubated at room temperature for 12–24 h and subsequently SFT measurements were taken. Similarly, the SFT of BS was measured in a PBS (pH 7.0) and incubated at different temperatures (20, 40…and 121°C). SFT values were checked for saline solutions prepared with different NaCl concentrations (0, 5, 10…25%). SFT values of all three parameters (pH, temperature and NaCl concentrations) were measured before and after incubation time so as to determine stability of BS.</p>
