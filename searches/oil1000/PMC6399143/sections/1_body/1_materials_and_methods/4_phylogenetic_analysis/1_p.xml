<p class="p">The 16S rRNA gene from SAMP strain was directly fetched out from sequenced genome data. The obtained sequence was compared using the EZBioCloud Server and closely related sequences were retrieved. Further alignment was performed using ClustalW v2.0. Phylogenetic trees and bootstrap analysis were inferred following the procedures described by 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zucchi et al. (2013)</xref>. The tree was constructed with 1,370 bases of the 16S rRNA gene by using a neighbor-joining tree method with the Kimura 2-parameter and a 1,000 bootstrap for the confidence level (
