<p class="p">Initial screening of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> for BS production was carried out by SFT measurement, drop collapse (DC) and oil displacement (OD) techniques. All screening tests were performed as per the methods described by 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Satpute et al. (2008)</xref>. SFT measurements were carried out using Optical Contact Angle Goniometer (For detail explanation see Physico-chemical characterization of BS in SFT measurement section). In DC test, the drop of culture supernatant (30 μL) was placed on a parafilm coated solid surface and observed for 1 min for drop collapsing. If the liquid contains surfactants, the drop spreads or collapses over a solid surface. The IFT between the liquid drop and the hydrophobic surface is reduced. In OD technique, 20 mL of distilled water was placed into empty petri dish followed by uniform layering of 20 μL of crude oil over the surface of the water. About 10 μL of cell free culture supernatant (CFS) was then added to the surface of oil. If BS is present in the CFS, the oil gets displaced showing the clear zone indicating the positive test.
