<p class="p">The marine bacterium isolated (from sea shore of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, India) by us was identified as 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> through genome sequencing. This analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP revealed complete genes in the pathway for the synthesis of terpenoid, which could be the backbone molecule for production of BS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>). The genes in the pathway were not located in the genomic islands thus suggesting the inherent potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. to synthesize the terpenoid molecule. We would like to suggest that the later stages of terpene biosynthesis might be diverted to BS synthesis. Detailed outlook on synthesis of BS warrants further investigation. The comparative genome analysis has helped us to identify the genomics potential of all the three strains and confirmed 2,840 core genes. The presence of terpene synthesis cluster was observed in all three genomes, but insertion sequence elements (IS) were associated with DSM 17275 before the start of the cluster. Further studies are mandatory to verify the production capacity of BS from other two strains. Moreover, these genes were present in the core genome, suggesting its inherent potential for terpene biosynthesis.
