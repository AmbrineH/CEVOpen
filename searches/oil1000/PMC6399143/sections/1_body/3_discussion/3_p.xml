<p class="p">The morphological feature including the short cocci of Gram-positive bacterium was described successfully for SAMP with the help of SEM. The phylogenic analysis of ribosomal RNA gene sequence indicated the member belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> (99%). Confirmation of signature nucleotides of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> was well supported by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">See-Too et al., 2017</xref>). Our investigation on genomic insight of BS biosynthetic pathway suggests the involvement of terpenoid type products. Terpenoids are popularly known as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and chemotherapeutic agents having pharmaceutical significance (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thoppil and Bishayee, 2011</xref>). The mevalonate pathway and the non-mevalonate (non-MVA) pathways are involved in the production of terpenoid precursors (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hunter, 2007</xref>). Based on our observation we propose that the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> produces terpene containing BS through non-mevalonate pathway. It has been suggested that the terpene synthases are mainly responsible in contributing the diversity as well as complexity of the metabolites produced by the microbial system (
