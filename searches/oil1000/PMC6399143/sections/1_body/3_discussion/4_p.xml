<p class="p">We used screening method to detect BS production by the strain MCC 3013 and culture was found to be positive in DC, OD assay and in EI. From the literature, it appears that all three techniques have been preferred usually to identify BS producers. Our results were supportive to our previous published literature (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Satpute et al., 2008</xref>). Media composition plays a vital role in determining the nature and chemical composition of the BS produced by microorganism. It is evident from the literature that production medium supplemented with different carbon sources promotes the production of BS from

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ebrahimipour et al., 2014</xref>). We have successfully demonstrated the BS production from 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP in production medium supplemented with glucose (1.5%). Extraction of the BS product was carried out after 1 week of incubation. Being a marine bacterium, the maintenance of optimal salt concentration is necessary for the growth and production of BS. One of the possible reasons for this could be the switching off some important gene/s involved in the metabolic pathway of BS production. It has been reported that the carbon: nitrogen ratio is a rate- determining factor in BS production (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Satpute et al., 2016</xref>). The production of BS by SAMP strain showed direct relationship with cell growth, i.e., BS accumulated in the production medium (supplemented with 1.5% glucose) as the cells entered into the exponential phase of their growth. The SFT of fermentation medium was reduced significantly from 66 to 32 mN/m within 168 h of incubation indicated the production of BS maximum by the end of growth phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>). The decrease in SFT of the medium was drastic during the same time period, representing the association of BS production along with growth of the organism. The spreading of the drop on the parafilm coated surface supported the previous observation. A parallel relationship between the utilization of medium components, growth and BS production is usually growth-associated. We agree with this opinion previously placed by
