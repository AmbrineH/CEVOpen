<p class="p">Halophiles, an interesting class of ‘extremophilic organisms’ have been acknowledged for production of diverse types of stable, unique bio-molecules like BS (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">DasSarma and Arora, 2002</xref>) having great stability at high temperature, pH and different salt concentrations. The interesting functional properties of BS viz. emulsification, wetting, foaming, cleansing, surface activity and reduction in viscosity of crude oil makes them suitable competitors for industrial applications (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, search for BS producing; indigenous, potent microorganism is an imperative area of research. A variety of marine environments (solar saltern, deep sea, sea floor, salt marshes, estuaries, intertidal zones, mangroves, lagoons, coral reefs) are dominated with 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engelhardt et al., 2001</xref>). This aerobic and heterotrophic bacterium can degrade various hydrocarbons and therefore can contribute significantly to reduce contamination of hydrocarbon in marine environments (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engelhardt et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). The foremost statement documented by 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al. (2007)</xref> reported 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. derived EPS having high emulsifying and tensiometric properties making them useful product for bioremediation and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). Work contributed by 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ebrahimipour et al. (2014)</xref> documented the production of glycolipid type BS from 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. Thus from the literature 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> strains appears to be as one of the promising microbial system which can be exploited for production of surface active agents.
