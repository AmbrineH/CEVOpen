<p class="p">The demand of microbial originated surfactant is steadily increasing and therefore there is need to improve the detection methods, production and purification protocols (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Banat et al., 2014</xref>). Work through such diversified techniques authenticates the presence of commercial important products. The effectiveness of purified BS is determined by its low CMC value and the ability to reduce SFT and IFT. A good surfactant can reduce the SFT of water from 72 to the lower ranges. A well-known chemical surfactant, i.e., SDS reduces SFT of water significantly (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al. (2007)</xref> have reported that the 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. can reduce the SFT of culture broth from 72 to 46.07 mN/m. However, in our study with 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP, the purified BS effectively reduced the SFT of fermentation broth from 65 to 35 mN/M and for PBS from 70 to 30 mN/m with a CMC of 1.3 mg/mL. Nevertheless, this is the first report providing detailed investigation on physical properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> derived BS. The terpene containing BS is also effective at oil water interfaces (evident from the IFT measurements). The stability studies at different pH, temperature and salt concentration resulted appreciable properties of terpene containing BS and therefore proved the properties of ideal surfactant. One of the significant finding of this study is thermo-stability of the BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP. The BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> was stable even after autoclaving. Such extreme temperature stability was reported for BS isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abdel-Mawgoud et al., 2008</xref>). The thermal stability of the BS increased the scope of its application in MEOR where high temperature is prevailed. Due to these extraordinary properties of BS; their commercial demand is enormously increasing (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patowary et al., 2017</xref>). To meet this demand, our search toward potential microbial product becomes imperative.
