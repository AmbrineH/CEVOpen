<p class="p">Several researchers have used different combinations of solvent systems to extract BS from microorganisms. We found chloroform: methanol (2:1, v/v) as suitable solvent system for extraction of BS. We state that column chromatography is an essential methods to obtain the microbial products in purified form. This is in an agreement with our recent published work (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hamza et al., 2017</xref>). Characterization through analytical techniques like, TLC, FTIR, NMR and LC-MS made it feasible to disclose the chemical nature of BS. Complete authentication of functional groups with lipid, carbohydrate moieties and absence of protein fractions is in agreement with 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ebrahimipour et al. (2014)</xref>. Previous literature on RHL illustrates that the presence of fatty acid chains and carbohydrate moieties in BS (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aleksic et al., 2017</xref>). Our NMR studies also proved the presence of terpene moieties in a BS which is in agreement with 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">KÃ¼gler et al. (2015)</xref>. In addition to NMR analysis, the structural composition was identified through LC-MS to illustrate the presence of peaks of molecular masses corresponding to the members of the lipid and polysaccharide. Thus analytical characterization of BS through above mentioned techniques described occurrence of sugar and lipid moieties. Similar kind of interpretation has been proposed for BS (other than

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patowary et al. (2017)</xref>. The term glyco-carotenoids/-terpenoids has been used to indicate BS derived from

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abdel-Mawgoud and Stephanopoulos, 2017</xref>). Basically terpenes are hydrocarbons containing molecules. Our observations are in agreement with the recently published literature by 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abdel-Mawgoud and Stephanopoulos (2017)</xref>. Based on above findings, we propose that the indigenous marine bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> is a powerful source for the production of terpene containing BS which could have noteworthy applications.
