<p class="p">Various screening procedures namely DC, OD, SFT reduction, IFT, CA and EI proved the surfactant activity of the BS obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maritimus</italic> SAMP MCC 3013. Results were comparable with positive (SDS) and negative (water) controls. The CFS and the partially purified BS had significantly displaced the oil layer and spread in the water. The production medium supplemented with 1.5% glucose was found to be suitable medium for production of BS.

 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP was associated with the production of BS, which was assessed by observing the decrease in SFT of the medium over time. Growth of the organism was heavy during the time period of 24 to 72 h. The CFS was capable of reducing the SFT of medium from 66 to 34 mN/m. Slight increase in biomass was observed till 120 h followed by a decrease in biomass. Similarly, a slight reduction in SFT of the medium was observed till 120 h after which the SFT of the production medium remained constant (âˆ¼30 mN/m). A slight change in the pH of the media from 7.4 to 6.0 was observed during the course of the experiment (
