<p class="p">After purification the physical properties of BS were carried out to investigate its efficacy. BS solutions effectively reduced the SFT of PBS with gradual increasing concentration of BS. The BS was capable of reducing the SFT of PBS from 70 to 30 mN/m with a CMC value of 1.3 mg/mL. The size and shape of pendant drop formed by the control (1) and BS (2) solution are shown as insets in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>. The purified BS reduced the IFT of kerosene interphase from 27 to 8 mN/m and for 2T engine oil recorded to be 22 to 7 mN/m.
