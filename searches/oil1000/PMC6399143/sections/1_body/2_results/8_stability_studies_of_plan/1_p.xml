<p class="p">These studies indicated the optimum stability of BS ranging between pH 6 to 8 (30 mN/m); whereas extreme acid or alkaline condition showed altered SFT values (34 mN/m) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Temperature treatment of above 60°C results a slight alteration in SFT values from 30 to 40 mN/m. The treatment of BS at 15% NaCl indicated optimum SFT (30 mN/m) activity. However, with increased salt concentration (&gt;15–25%) the minor increase in SFT values were seen.
