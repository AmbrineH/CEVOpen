 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Langille et al., 2010</xref>). Mostly genomic islands associate with horizontal gene transfer (HGT) which is also known as mobile genetic elements. There are 15 genomic islands in SAMP strain that was predicted by IslandViewer 3 (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dhillon et al., 2015</xref>) and the localization of the predicted genomic islands is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>. The 15 predicted genomic islands consist of 331 genes. The genes producing secondary metabolites were not found within the genomic islands.
