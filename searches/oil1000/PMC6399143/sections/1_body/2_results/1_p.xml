<p class="p">For bio-prospecting of marine bacteria, the surface bio-active compounds such as BS is explored from indigenous halophilic bacteria. Identification of marine bacterium and the detailed investigation on physical properties like SFT, CMC, IFT, EI and stability studies are supportive to prove the surfactant properties of microbial originated surface active compounds.</p>
