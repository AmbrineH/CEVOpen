<p class="p">The pan-genome analysis was done by using available genomes from the NCBI genome database. The general genome features for all the three strains are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The pan-genome analysis suggested the presence of 2,480 core genes and strain specific accessory and unique genes are given in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Strain SAMP had 130 unique genes. Pan-genome analysis revealed 89.15% core genes, 7.23% accessory and 5.34% unique genes. The numbers of shared genes were plotted as a function of number of strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1C</xref>). The analysis of core genome led to the identification of all the COG categories and cell control, cell division and chromosome portioning also found in core genome. The COG analysis for accessory genes mostly attributed in transcription, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and in catabolism category (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1D</xref>). orthoMCL analysis of core genes led to the identification of 1,124 genes present in a single copy and multiple copies for other remaining genes. Functional analysis of core genes showed distribution in a varied range of KEGG categories with most of the genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Further core genome (single gene) phylogeny was constructed to give insights into the phylogenetic relationships between the strains (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Functional analysis was also done for accessory and unique genes. Most of the genes in the accessory category could be assigned to the some or the other KEGG category while, 10% of them could not be assigned to any of the KEGG category and were hypothetical. The most important unique genes associated with strain DSM 17275 was cell wall binding repeat two family proteins, for strain MKU009 was DUF559 domain-containing protein and for strain SAMP was the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase.
