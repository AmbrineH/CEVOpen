<p class="p">Chemical characterization using TLC, FT-IR, NMR and LC-MS found that the indigenous strain 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP produces BS having sugar and lipid moieties. Therefore, the term ‘terpene containing BS’ is denoted to the BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. Therefore, we speculate that terpene BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> have significant contribution in the field of BS produced by diverse marine microbes.
