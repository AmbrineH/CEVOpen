<p class="p">Analysis of BS by using FTIR showed the presence of functional groups of terpenoids. The molecular composition of BS indicated the presence of most prominent absorption peaks were 3,338, 2,943, 1,726, 1,448, 1,375 and 1,024 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The presence of aliphatic hydrocarbon chains was seen in BS derived from 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic>. Due to the presence of hydrogen bonding, a strong and broad band of the hydroxyl group (-OH); a free stretch was observed at 3,338 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The occurrence of C-H stretching vibrations for hydrocarbon chain of alkyl (CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) groups was confirmed by the absorption band at 2,943 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Characteristic carbonyl stretching band denoted presence of ketone compounds and was found at 1,726 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The IR data reveals the presence of C=O, O-H and aliphatic C-H functionality in the BS produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> which are major functionality of terpnoid (
