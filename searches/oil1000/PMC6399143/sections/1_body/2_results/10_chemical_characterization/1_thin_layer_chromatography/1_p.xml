 <sub class="sub">f</sub> value for RHL was found to be 0.7. TLC plate developed with iodine crystals showed five spots of RHL (0.6), linoleic acid (0.3), cholesterol (0.4), dipalmitin (0.6), oleic acid (0.6), and tripalmitate (0.9). The TLC plate developed with 0.2% ninhydrin reagent did not display the presence of any amino acids, confirming the sugar and lipid moieties in a BS formed by
