 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> BS showed the presence of terpenoids. The presence of a terpene described by the peak detected at δ 1.04 and δ 1.40 ppm for terminal methyl group and methylene group, respectively. Additional peaks at δ 1.23–1.4 indicated the methyl (–CH

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR analysis demonstrated a peak of carbonyl carbon at δ 211.67 ppm and the peak at δ 80 ppm indicated the presence of carbon with oxygen bond. The peak observed at δ 15–20 ppm shows methyl carbon peak indicating the presence of –CH
