<p class="p">Like SFT, IFT, a significant reduction in CA was also observed on different surfaces. The shape of the sessile drop formed by BS solution on different surfaces was compared with PBS as negative control. The maximum reduction in CA was observed on Teflon from (θ = 125.3° to θ = 103.0°, followed by Parafilm (θ = 103.9° to 91.2°) and glass (θ = 22.4°to 20.0°) surfaces. The drop formed by BS solution on Teflon surface was found to be flattened in comparison with the drop formed by control PBS. In addition to SFT, IFT, CA measurements; emulsification activities also proved its efficacy as a surfactant. BS emulsified various hydrocarbons and oils that were included in the present work. Maximum E
 <sub class="sub">24</sub> value was observed with diesel (78%) followed by kerosene (68%), n-hexadecane (64%), toluene (56%), coconut oil (54%) and castor oil (53%). The results of all tests indicated that the purified BS had both surfactant and emulsifier properties. The synthesized BS was found to be anionic in nature; evident from the line of precipitin formed with CTAB (cationic detergent).
