<p class="p">The screening for secondary metabolites genes were identified, a total of 33 different genes cluster were seen but only cluster 31 was the best match with highest identity of 88%. The entire cluster was further screened for the presence of secondary metabolite genes having terpene like molecule in the backbone as in lipid synthesis pathway (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, the entire gene sets involved in the synthesis of this terpene was identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>). The identified cluster was also probed in other two genomes, to know their potential for production of terpene. The gene cluster analysis for all the three strains are as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>. The location of the gene cluster in all the three genomes is different, the entire gene cluster was on positive strand for two strains DSM17275 and SAMP while for strain MKU009 on the negative strand.
