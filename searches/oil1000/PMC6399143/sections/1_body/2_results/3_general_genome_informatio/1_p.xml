<p class="p">The whole genome of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. A total of 3,251,644 Illumina reads were assembled using SPAdes genome assembler version SPAdes v. 3.6.1, which resulted in 43 contigs with an N50 value of 2,065,493 bp. The 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> genome assembly of strain SAMP resulted in 43 scaffolds with a genome size of 3,220,000 bp and G+C content of 47.2%. A sum of 3,111 protein-coding sequences (CDSs) was predicted in the genome, out of 93 copies of RNA: 26 rRNA, 63 tRNAs and 4 ncRNA were identified and the circular view is shown in
