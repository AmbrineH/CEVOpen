<p class="p">Genus 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> is a Gram-positive, non-motile halophilic bacterium which was proposed by 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Migula (1894)</xref>. Despite earlier scientific studies on BS, the bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> with respect to BS cognition has remained largely unexplored for several years (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>). In the year of 2001, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engelhardt et al. (2001)</xref>, isolated and characterized a novel hydrocarbon-degrading 
 <italic class="italic">P. alkanoclasticus</italic> sp. nov. strain. Until the year 2007, there was no any detailed investigation on production of BS from 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> sp. The first report contributed by 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al. (2007)</xref> documented the potential of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maitriensis</italic> for BS/bioemulsifier (BE) production (without any structural details). Authors suggested that the production of EPS having composition of carbohydrate (12.06%), uronic acid (11%), protein (24.44%) and sulfate (3.03%). Later, the practical potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> strain was identified for large scale BS production and oil cleansing potential (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ebrahimipour et al., 2014</xref>). These researchers reported the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> derived BS through gas chromatography (GC) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy studies. In 2015, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kavitha et al. (2015)</xref> also identified a new strain 
 <italic class="italic">P. jake</italic> 01 and demonstrated its application for biogas production. Based on above literature, one can propose that the 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> derived BS certainly offers undeniable applications. In 2016, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ganapathy et al. (2016)</xref> stated methyl glucosyl-3,4-dehydro-apo-8-lycopenoate as a novel carotenoid, with antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> origin. It is important to highlight that till today; no single report elucidates the structural and physical properties of BS from 
 <italic class="italic">Planococcus</italic> origin. Indeed the need for genomics to search the metabolic capacity of well characterized bacterium along with functional metabolite would be helpful to develop mass production strategies. Thus, present investigation deals integrated approach of genomic insight of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> strain SAMP and the functional features of ‘terpene containing BS’ produced by the moderate halophile. To the best of our knowledge, possibly this is the first report on the draft genome sequence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. maritimus</italic> SAMP, isolated from Indian Arabian coastline sea water. In addition, production of terpene containing BS with physico-chemical characterization has been included.
