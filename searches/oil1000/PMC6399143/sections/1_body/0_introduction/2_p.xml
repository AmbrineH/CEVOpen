<p class="p">The term ‘Biosurfactant’ (BS) represents surface-active molecules of microbial origin that exhibit mammoth structural and chemical diversity where glycolipids, phospholipids, lipopeptides, polysaccharide-protein complexes, fatty acids and neutral lipids are the popular one (

This ‘Green’ amphiphilic compounds are excreted out or may be cell bound (associated) facilitating microbes to utilize and accumulate between insoluble liquid phases through reducing surface tension (SFT) and interfacial tension (IFT) (
