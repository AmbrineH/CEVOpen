 </sup>. With different geo-material microfluidics, or rock-on-a-chip methods, oil recovery can be measured and pore-scale mechanisms (on the order of micrometres) can be captured. EOR mechanisms such as chemical or low salinity can be tested prior to core scale experiments to study a wide range of the parameter space necessary to understand pore-scale oil recovery mechanisms and/or evaluate screening criteria for particular EOR applications. This can guide the planning and assessment of core floods and/or illustrate if a given EOR mechanism could suppress oil snap-off, enhance dissolution and/or cause fines migration for a given set of flooding conditions.
