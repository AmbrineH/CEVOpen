<p id="Par4" class="p">In water-wet rocks, thin films of water cover the surfaces of grains and extend across adjacent grains. These films influence immiscible displacement. For example, in enhanced oil recovery processes and during imbibition, water is known to flow in the pore space via the wetting films ahead of the advancing meniscus, bridging across the pore space containing oil, which creates the possibility for snap-off events and influences the order in which pores are saturated. Pore network models are often used to demonstrate the importance of corner flow during immiscible displacement
