<p id="Par8" class="p">The aforementioned fabrication methods of geo-material microfluidics devices involve several pre-processing and complex fabrication steps, in addition to the use of expensive machines and/or packed grains that obstruct visualisation. In addition, the previous works have not provided evidence that the essential pore-scale flow mechanism of corner flow leading to snap-off actually occur in the fabricated geo-material chips. We propose a simple process for functionalising the pore space of PDMS microfluidic chips with rock minerals and controlled wetting conditions, which allows for snap-off and corner flow mechanisms to occur. The resulting geo-material microfluidic device allows for direct visualisation and understanding of rock-fluid interactions in oil reservoirs during any type of flooding. We describe the coating of PDMS microfluidic chips with the following materials: (1) quartz and kaolinite to represent sandstone

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup> formations, and (2) calcite to represent carbonate formations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>
 </sup>. We characterise the surface composition, roughness, wettability, and uniformity of the functionalised PDMS models and compare them with reservoir rock samples. Lastly, we conduct water flooding experiments to study the resulting pore-scale flow mechanisms and conclude that many of the well-established mechanisms important for porous media flow are captured by the microfluidic device due to the wettability and connectivity of corners and crevices added by the geo-material coating process.
