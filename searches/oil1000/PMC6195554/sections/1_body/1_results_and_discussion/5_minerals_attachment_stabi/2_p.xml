 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10e and f</xref> to help visualise the differences at higher resolution. As it can be depicted, the carbonate geo-material PDMS is not as stable as the sandstone. In addition, roughness measurements before (i.e. dry sample) and after the three consecutive floods was performed on 5 areas in each sample. An average change of 4.8% and 11.9% in roughness was calculated for the sandstone and carbonate geo-material chips, respectively. Overall, the microscope, SEM and roughness measurements demonstrate flooding of geo-material PDMS does show pore-level changes that result from either detachment of minerals from the PDMS surface and/or dissolution of mineral crystals. Similar mechanisms are observed in carbonate and sandstone rocks subjected to low salinity water flooding, where clay fines detach from rock surface, or dissolution of carbonate rock. Since these chips were tested using DI water (no salinity) it is likely that these mechanisms are being observed in our measurements. Both of these mechanisms are proposed oil recovery mechanisms for an enhanced oil recovery technique called low salinity flooding

 </sup>. Further work is needed to relate the observed results in our geo-material PDMS to that observed in carbonate and sandstone rock under low salinity water flooding.
