<p id="Par19" class="p">It is essential to test the stability of the geo-material PDMS chips. In this section, we studied changes between sequential images after flooding the chip with selected fluids. Images are collected after each treatment and segmented to evaluate the amount of deposited minerals. The difference between images is reported as a percent change, as defined in the Methods section. The deposited dry chip (prior to any injection) and brine, decane, and DI water flooding scenarios in 5 different locations across 3 different chips are evaluated. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> shows the percent change between the initial condition of the geo-material PDMS chip and the subsequent flooding. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>, the sandstone chip shows a low change across the different flooding scenarios, with the highest change being 1.1%. An average of 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.7% change between the dry image and connate, decane and DI injections, respectively. For the carbonate PDMS chips, a maximum of 30.9% change between the dry image and the subsequent flooding scenarios was measured. An average of 6.7%, 11.9% and 21.5% change between the dry image and connate, decane and DI injections where measured, respectively. In terms of particle detachment, the calcite mixture appears to detach easier than the sandstone, which is likely due to the strong siloxane bond present between the sandstone mixture and activated PDMS surfaces. The images in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10c and d</xref> provide examples of the highest change in sandstone and carbonate chips (sample 4 and 2, respectively in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10a and b</xref>) to help illustrate what 1.1% and 30.9% change looks like.
