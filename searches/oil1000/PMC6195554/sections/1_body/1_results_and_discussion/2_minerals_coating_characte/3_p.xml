<p id="Par12" class="p">SEM images of PDMS chips containing mineral depositions (x100) and a higher magnification (x3k) image of the relevant rock slice are present in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Images of the PDMS containing the minerals of interest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a,b,e and f</xref>) can be comparable with the rock image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c and g</xref>), as the particle morphologies are similar. Furthermore, EDS elemental analysis was performed on the rock slices and PDMS microfluidics chips. Normalised EDS results for the two samples provide comparable results with their respective rock types (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d and h</xref>). However, the carbonate rock and calcite-PDMS do not exhibit exact elemental spectra in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4h</xref>, due to the presence of silicon in the PDMS backbone. In the case of the calcite-PDMS and limestone rock, the calcium peaks are similar (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4h</xref>). Carbon is present in both rock and geo-material PDMS chips due to the required carbon coating for SEM imaging. Overall, the surface chemistry appears to be similar for the functionalised chips and their reservoir rock equivalents.
