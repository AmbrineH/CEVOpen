<p id="Par10" class="p">To characterise the functionalised PDMS surface, we used semivariograms to study the spatial arrangements of the deposited minerals and compared SEM-EDS measurements to equivalent measurements taken from reservoir rock samples. The semivariograms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a and b</xref> illustrate the average semivariance of the mineral deposition for both sandstone and carbonate PDMS chips, respectively for a lag distance of up to 50-pixel values (333.34 µm, scale of 0.15 pixels/µm) in both the horizontal (0°) and vertical (90°) directions. The semivariances in both samples show the expected trend of increasing semivariance with increased lag distance. The semi-variances increase with pixel distance (or lag distance) because pixels adjacent to each other are more correlated to each other than pixels far apart. The error bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a and b</xref> indicate the variation in average semivariances for a lag distance of 3, 10, 20, 30 and 50 pixels for the minerals deposited on three independent sandstone and carbonate chips. For sandstone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), the error bars demonstrate that there were measurable differences in the horizontal and vertical directions. This occurred because the measured variance between tested locations on the PDMS sandstone chip are relatively small resulting in narrow error bars. Conversely, the error bars for mineral deposition in the case of carbonate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) are wider, which demonstrates that the variation between independent samples was greater than that for the sandstone PDMS chip. Therefore, for the carbonate PDMS chip, there were no measurable differences in the semivariances in the horizontal (0°) and vertical (90°) directions. Overall, for both sandstone and carbonate depositions, the semivariances in the horizontal (0°), and vertical (90°) directions are similar suggesting that the deposition was nearly isotropic. Isotropic deposition is an important factor for mineral deposition since wetting films are likely to be established in the deposited minerals and a directional bias of wetting films could influence experimental results.
