<p id="Par11" class="p">The surface roughness data of the geo-material chips are calculated and compared to roughness values measured for carbonate and sandstone rocks. The data are obtained from the surface height profiles of multiple locations on each sample. In total, 15 locations of roughness measurements for carbonate PDMS and rock, 21 locations for sandstone PDMS and 19 locations for sandstone rock are collected. The results indicate similar roughness data for the pore surfaces of the fabricated chips and the real rock surfaces. For instance, only 9.9% variation exists between the roughness of the sandstone PDMS chip and sandstone rock. For the carbonate coated chip the variation of roughness from the real rock is 14.7%. The box plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref> confirms similar roughness data for the pore surfaces of the fabricated chips and the rock surfaces. For both sandstone and carbonate rocks and functionalised PDMS models, the median values (middle lines in the box plots) of roughness are similar. In addition, the roughness of a blank PDMS chip was also evaluated and the roughness data are staunchly different than functionalised PDMS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). One limitation from this analysis is that these results are only valid for the rocks examined. Different roughness profiles could occur when comparing the functionalised PDMS surface to other sandstone and carbonate rocks.
