<p id="Par16" class="p">Cassie’s equation (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="" class="xref">7</xref>) was used to explain the shift in the contact angle in the geo-material PDMS microfluidics devices with and without PVA treatment. Cassie’s equation provides an apparent contact angle by considering chemically heterogeneous surfaces with regions that have distinctly different contact angles

 </sup>. For the functionalised PDMS surface, there are regions of exposed PDMS (−PVA or +PVA) and regions of rock minerals. The surface fractions of mineral and exposed PDMS regions are measured from microscope images. The contact angles for these two regions are taken from Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, the contact angle measurements determined from Cassie’s equation (yellow) are in agreement with the experimentally measured contact angles in both geo-material microfluidic chips (red). This indicates that the fraction of PDMS present on the surface influences the wettability, especially in the case of no PVA treatment (−PVA).
