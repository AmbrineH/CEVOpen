 </sup>, applying PVA to a plasma treated PDMS surface creates hydrogen bonds between the PVA molecules and the plasma treated PDMS surfaces. These hydrogen bonds on the PDMS form permanent water-wet surfaces rather than the temporary treatment created by only plasma treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The PDMS surface treatment method developed by Trantidou,

 </sup> was applied to our fabricated geo-material chips. Several tests were conducted to understand how the method influences the wettability of PDMS and the deposited minerals. Sandstone, carbonate and un-deposited PDMS chips were treated with PVA immediately after plasma oxidation, as described in Trantidou,

 </sup> and imaged after 3 days to eliminate the effect of plasma oxidation. PDMS with and without PVA treatment were first subjected to connate water flooding (green), then decane oil (transparent) and left to equilibrate for 10 minutes. The three chips are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. We observe connected thin films of connate water (green) in the geo-material PDMS chips of sandstone and carbonate with PVA treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>), which demonstrates that these chips are water wet. Alternatively, without PVA treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), PDMS is highly oil wet in all three conditions. As explained previously, the reason that PVA can alter the wettability of PDMS is that it irreversibly adsorbs onto the hydrophobic polymer films of PDMS, which alters its chemistry by the formation of hydrogen bonds between PVA and the activated PDMS surface

 </sup>. As observed in the EDS and SEM results, regions of the functionalised PDMS chips are not completely covered with rock minerals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and thus, the exposed PDMS still influences the surface wettability.
