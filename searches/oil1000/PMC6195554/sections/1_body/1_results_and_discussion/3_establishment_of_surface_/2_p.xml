 </sup> performed a longevity study on their PVA treatment, and the contact angle was stable at 30–50° for 9 days, which confirms the validity of this method and long-term effect of PVA with PDMS. It is also important to note that PVA treatment on the un-deposited PDMS chip showed less connected connate water as compared to the carbonate and sandstone models. This can be attributed to the surface roughness of the geo-material chips, which allows for connate water to exist in the corners and crevices of the chip. The connate water appears to be connected since wetting films in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> are seen to extend across grains. This allows for the establishment of connate water films throughout the microfluidic chip. The thin connate water films present for water-wet conditions of the sandstone and carbonate conditions with PVA treatment are essential for visualising pore-scale phenomena in subsurface fluid flow, as demonstrated in the next subsection.
