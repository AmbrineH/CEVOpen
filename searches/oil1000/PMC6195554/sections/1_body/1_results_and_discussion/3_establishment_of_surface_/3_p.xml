<p id="Par15" class="p">To confirm that PVA treatment of the geo-material PDMS chips does not alter the surface wettability of the deposited grains, we compare contact angles of the rock samples to geo-material PDMS chips with and without PVA. The steps for measuring contact angle are provided in the Methods section. Contact angle measurements in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>show that PVA has no effect on the reservoir rock, as the contact angles remain in the same range (75°–80°) with and without PVA treatment. However, the geo-material PDMS chips without PVA show a highly hydrophobic surface (θ &gt; 100°), which demonstrates that the PDMS backbone is influenced by PVA treatment, thereby controlling the contact angle, hence the oil-wet nature of the chips. Conversely, geo-material PDMS chips with PVA treatment show similar contact angle measurements to those present for the reservoir rock samples.
