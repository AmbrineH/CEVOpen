<p id="Par17" class="p">With the functionalisation of PDMS with sandstone and carbonate particles, we have established: (1) a geo-chemical environment and roughness profile that is similar to a real rock, and (2) similar wetting profiles, due to the PVA treatment that alters the wettability of PDMS to water-wet but does not alter the geo-material wettability. These factors create a platform for studying the pore-scale flow. In this section, we demonstrate the swelling of connate water wetting films and snap-off in our functionalised chips. Roof

 </sup> describes oil snap-off as the formation of an oil droplet due to oil being pushed through a water-wet constriction into a water-filled pore. Snap-off is strongly dependent on wettability, pore scale geometry, and roughness of the pore–solid interface

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> illustrates the swelling of connate water films (green) when DI water (red) is injected into a functionalised chip at connate water (green) equilibrium. We can observe that the injected water travels within the pre-existing connate water films, leaving oil behind (Fig.
