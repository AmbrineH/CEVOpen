 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8(b–f)</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> highlights one snap-off event at 0.56 and 0.60 PV, which correspond to before and after snap-off, respectively. Capillary pressures at different locations (throat and pore bodies) are also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>. For the example snap-off event, capillary pressure in the pore throat region is greater than capillary pressures measured in the leading and tailing ends of the oil droplet. Higher capillary pressure in the pore throat region would cause the oil phase to flow away from the throat constriction and thus, leading to the collapse of an interface, i.e. a snap-off event. Capillary pressures are determined by using the Young Laplace equation, as explained in the Methods section. The two principals of curvatures are measured from the oil interface in the throat and pore bodies as visualised in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9c</xref>. The resulting capillary pressures are reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9d</xref> showing that pressure was larger in the throat region than the two pore bodies. This difference in pressure causes snap-off in the throat, as oil flows away from the throat region.
