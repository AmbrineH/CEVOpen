 </sup> as depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. Plasma treatment of PDMS is crucial to functionalise the surface for depositing sandstone and carbonate mineral mixtures. In the quartz and kaolinite suspension, the presence of silicate oxygen groups in the quartz and kaolinite and hydrogen groups along the edge of the kaolinite particles are the main active groups that bond with silanol groups on the PDMS surface. Both oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups in the quartz and kaolinite suspension can hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl groups at the ends of the PDMS chain. As for the calcite mixture, due to its suspension in water, the hydroxyl groups and calcium ions can also bond with silanol groups on the PDMS. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> highlights the bonding of chemical structures for both the sandstone and calcite suspensions with silanol groups present on the PDMS surface. Further details on fabrication are discussed in the Methods section.
