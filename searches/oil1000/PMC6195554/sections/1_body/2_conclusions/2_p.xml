 </sup> studies. Lastly, we verify the stability of our fabricated geo-material PDMS chips (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>) by measuring the similarity of chips before and after flooding with DI water and decane. When compared to the dry image of the deposited PDMS chips, the sandstone chip exhibited the highest change being 1.1%, whereas the change in the carbonate PDMS chips was 30.9%. Average roughness measurements and SEM images before and after flooding also confirm that sandstone PDMS chips are more stable than the carbonate PDMS chips. We also acknowledge that pore-level change in the attached geomaterials occur under low salinity water flooding (DI water). Future studies will include visualisation of subsurface engineering related phenomena; such as oil snap-off, enhanced oil recovery and other processes where surface chemistry is highly important, such as CO

Our geo-material PDMS chips can provide a useful platform to answer questions in subsurface and environmental engineering fields, in particular, when fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interactions are highly important.
