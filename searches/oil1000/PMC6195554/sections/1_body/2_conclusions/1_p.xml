<p id="Par21" class="p">Geo-material microfluidics approaches are essential for the visualisation and understanding of rock-fluid interactions, which are relevant to subsurface engineering applications, such as geologic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> storage, geothermal energy, enhanced oil recovery and hydrology. Thus far, we have demonstrated a simple and rapid fabrication method for a geo-material PDMS microfluidics device. We have evaluated the uniformity of the deposition using semivariograms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a and b</xref>), and surface roughness measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). We then, compared our functionalised PDMS devices to their representative rock via SEM-EDS analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). From these imaging techniques, we can see that the composition and height profile in both rocks and functionalised PDMS devices are similar and that mineral deposition is nearly isotropic. The establishment of thin films with PVA treatment of the sandstone and carbonate chips (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>) have shown to be well-connected, particularly in the two PDMS chips with mineral deposition, which demonstrated that water is wetting the pore space.
