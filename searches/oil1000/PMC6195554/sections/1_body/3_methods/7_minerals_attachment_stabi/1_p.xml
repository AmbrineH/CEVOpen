<p id="Par31" class="p">To test the stability of the mineral deposition, we measured the degree of mineral detachment from the geo-material chip after sequential flow experiments. Five locations were chosen from three samples of sandstone and carbonate PDMS chips, and imaged using a stereo zoom microscope (Zeiss, Axio Zoom V16) after the following conditions: (1) dry (no prior to injection), which is considered as the reference sample, (2) connate water (10% NaCl (w/v)) injection (3) decane injection, and (4) DI water injection. All the images in the different injection conditions were obtained after 4–5 PV of injected fluid at a rate of 5 μl/min. The samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 65 °C for 25 minutes after each injection to obtain a clear image, free of liquid. Images were converted to 8-bit greyscale, which gave a bi-modal histogram of the intensity values that ranged from 0 to 256 An Example histogram is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>, which displays a clear separation of intensity values between deposited minerals and PDMS.
