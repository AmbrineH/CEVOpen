<p id="Par28" class="p">To replicate sandstone and carbonate rock properties for the geo-material microfluidic PDMS chip, the wettability conditions must be controlled. PDMS is naturally oil-wet, and with oxygen plasma exposure it becomes water-wet for a maximum of 2 hours

 </sup> developed a method to modify the wettability of the surface of PDMS to water-wet with the addition of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) immediately after oxygen plasma. Water-wet sandstone, carbonate and blank PDMS chips were treated with oxygen plasma and put in conformal contact to allow bonding between the sandstone and carbonate chips with the blank PDMS cover. These chips were immediately injected with PVA to fill the entire microfluidic chip via a plastic syringe and left for 10 minutes at room temperature. The PVA was then removed with injecting air in the microfluidic chips and heated to 110 C° for 15 minutes. Details on this method is described in Trantidou,

 </sup>. After PVA treatment, the chips were left for 3 days to eliminate the effect of the oxygen plasma treatment. The chips were then injected with brine of 10% NaCl and 2% (w/v) Green food colour (AmeriColor, Placentia, CA, USA) for multiple pore volumes, followed by decane (Sigma Aldrich, USA) injection to achieve 80–90% oil saturation and left 20 minutes to equilibrate. Images of the sandstone, carbonate and blank PDMS chips were taken after three days with and without PVA treatment using a stereo zoom microscope (Zeiss, Axio Zoom V16) to characterise surface wettability with and without PVA treatment. From the collected microscopic images, the PDMS chips were characterised as either water-wet or oil-wet depending on the pre-dominant fluid (oil or water) surrounding the grains of the PDMS chips.
