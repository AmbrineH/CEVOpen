  <p class="p">The workflow for fabrication of the geo-material PDMS microfluidics device. The sandstone and carbonate mixtures are first prepared by mixing quartz and kaolinite in DI water, and calcite in DI water, respectively. When mixing quartz and kaolinite with DI water, it mainly results in soluble silica (SiOH
   <sub class="sub">4</sub>), also referred to as silicic acid, and kaolinite gibbsite (AlOH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>). As for the calcite mixture, the calcium carbonate does not mix well with water, as it rapidly separates when left stagnant, however, some calcium ions separate and can attach with silanol group in subsequent steps. When the two PDMS slides with the porous media are exposed to oxygen plasma, it attaches silanol groups on the PDMS surface, rendering it water-wet temporarily, these silanol groups then bond with the silicic acid and kaolinite gibbsite in the sandstone mixture, creating very strong siloxane bond and Al-O-Si bonds. As for the calcium hydroxide, it also attaches to the silanol groups. Then, both chips are air-dried and cleaned with Ethanol. After ensuring the pillars in the PDMS chips are clean, the PDMS with the deposited materials and PDMS slabs (covers) undergo a second plasma treatment, creating additional SiOH groups on both PDMS slides, and immediately put in conformal contact, which results in a sealed geo-material PDMS chip. Wettability alterations can then be made by adding 1% PVA solution immediately after the second plasma treatment, which makes the geo-material water-wet. Without PVA treatment the geo-material PDMS device is oil-wet.
