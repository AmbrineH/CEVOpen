 <p> ( a) Average semivariance of the sandstone PDMS chip. ( b) Average semivariance of the carbonate PDMS chip. The error bars in a and b indicate the variation in average semivariances for a lag distance of 3, 10, 20, 30 and 50 pixel distance for the mineral deposited on three sandstone images and three carbonate images, respectively. ( c) Box plot with surface height profile measurements for target areas of x = 1418 µm, y = 1000 µm for PDMS coated with carbonate (or limestone) mixture, limestone rock, PDMS coated with the sandstone mixture, sandstone rock and blank PDMS. </p>
