 <p> SEM images and EDS analysis of sandstone rock and PDMS ( a– c), and carbonate rock and PDMS ( e– h). The sandstone and calcite deposited PDMS show similar morphology and compositional analysis compared to their corresponding rocks. The image border colours in ( a– c) and ( e– g) correspond to the lines present in d and h. </p>
