 <p> Mechanism of PDMS wettability alteration by adding PVA. ( a) shows the PDMS surface following plasma treatment with silanol groups on the surface (Si-OH). ( b) shows PVA bonding to the OH groups, and ( c) shows the detailed molecular hydrogen bonding between PVA (red) and the PDMS backbone (black). The dashed lines in ( c) show the locations of these hydrogen bonds. </p>
