 <p> Geo-material stability measurements of ( a) sandstone and ( b) carbonate PDMS chips. The different injection scenarios (connate water, decane and DI) are compared to the dry image, and the percent change is shown in the column graphs. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. ( c) and ( d) show microscopic images of the highest change in both sandstone ( c) and carbonate ( d). The images illustrate the change from the dry image (reference) and after DI water flooding, along with a blank PDMS of the same region. As can be seen, minor change is observed in ( c), however, the 30.9% change can be clearly visible in ( d). Example of SEM images for dry sample (before) and after flooding for ( e) sandstone and ( f) carbonate. </p>
