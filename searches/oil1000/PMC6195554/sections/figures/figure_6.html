 <p> Wetting films during the two cases: ( a) without PVA (âˆ’PVA), and ( b) with PVA (+PVA) treatment. The cartoons on the left illustrate the molecular interactions occurring in each scenario, and the microscope images show the wetting films in each of the three PDMS chips (blank, sandstone and limestone) with and without PVA. Oil is transparent and connate water is green. </p>
