  <p class="p">Geo-material microfluidic chip (centred) and itsÂ applications/features. This figure highlights the ability to re-create the reservoir rock environment, due to the added minerals on the grains and pore space of the microfluidic platform. This type of microfluidics devices can capture several important rock/fluid features, including: corner flow, wetting conditions (oil or water-wet), and snap-off.</p>
