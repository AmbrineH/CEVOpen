 <p> Schematic of the cross-section of ( a) ZnO/geranium plasma polymer composite films (film thickness is ≈500 nm) with a fast release of ZnO nanoparticles. ( b) ZnO/geranium films with a thin upper layer of geranium polymer (thickness is ≈25 and 50 nm) with reduced release rate of the ZnO from the composites. </p>
