 <p> Typical SEM images of Zn/Ge 10 W composites at different magnifications, ( a) is x300; and ( b) is x30K. SEM images of ( c, d) represent Zn/Ge 50 W and Zn/Ge 10 W, respectively; ( e) shows EDS spectrum of the composite fabricated on Nickle substrates. SEM images were acquired at conditions of: Vacc = 3.0 kV, EC = 115 K nA, and WD = 6.1 mm. </p>
