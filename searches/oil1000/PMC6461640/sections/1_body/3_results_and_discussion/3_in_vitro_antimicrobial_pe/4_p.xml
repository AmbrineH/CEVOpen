<p id="Par41" class="p">Although pristine polymers showed weak or moderate antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, composites revealed enhanced bactericidal performance. It is obvious that zinc nanoparticles were directly involved in the inhibition of the pathogens. As shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>, the antibacterial performance of Zn/Ge 10 W was greater compared to Zn/Ge 50 W. This observation can be linked to the influence of RF power on the size of the formed nanoparticles, where lower power created smaller particles. It is known that in many cases, smaller nanoparticles reveal much higher antibacterial action in compare to larger nanoparticles under the same conditions
