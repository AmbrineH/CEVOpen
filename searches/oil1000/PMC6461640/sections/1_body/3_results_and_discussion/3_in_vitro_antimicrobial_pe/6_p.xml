 </sup>. This is linked to the specific thick and negatively charged peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall that can resist ZnO penetration. In contrast, other findings have found that gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to NPs activities

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>
 </sup>. There is an evident lack of consensus around the susceptibility of different bacteria to ZnO, possibly due to differences in experiments. Indeed, ZnO NPs are currently manufactured with different dimensions, morphologies, concentrations, surface modifications, surface defects, surface charges, crystallographic orientation, etc. The antibacterial mechanisms vary based on the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and their microenvironment conditions. For example, in different media, the dissolving profile of Zn may vary according to the medium components, and accordingly, potentially influence the follow-on toxicity mechanism

 </sup>. However, in our experimental conditions, attached bacterial cells on the Zn/Ge composites were not exposed solely to ZnO nanoparticles, rather, they were simultaneously affected by both the released ZnO and geranium polymer surfaces. Geranium polymers contain chemical groups (e.g. hydroxyl and carboxyl), which were proven in a previous study to reveal moderate antibacterial and anti-biofouling activities

 </sup>. The inhibitory effects of Zn/Ge composite films were observed to be very similar on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, we expect that interactions between the geranium oil vapors (contain alcohols) and ZnO NPs occurred during the fabrication of these composites. Here, more desired functional groups are presented on the ZnO surface, which may modify its biological activity. Surface modifications of the ZnO NPs in oxidizing environments had been demonstrated to cause an important change in the antibacterial activity
