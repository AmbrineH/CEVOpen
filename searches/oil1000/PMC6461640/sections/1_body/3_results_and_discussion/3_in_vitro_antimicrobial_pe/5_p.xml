 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> on the surfaces of control, Ge 10 W, Ge 50 W, Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W samples. SEM images show that bacteria incubated on Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W were clearly damaged and had disorganized cell walls, comparted to pristine polymers and control. The morphological changes were confirmed in both microorganisms upon interaction with ZnO NPs. Untreated bacteria displayed membrane structure integrity with a smooth surface. In contrast, the surface of bacteria appeared pimply and disorganized, indicating that ZnO NPs might damage and penetrate the membrane of the bacterial cell. The antimicrobial mechanisms of metallic nanoparticles are principally different from those of pristine polymers, providing further strategies for targeting various microorganisms, as well as to decrease the possible microbial resistance. Physicochemical changes often take place in cell membranes when nanoparticles anchor to the outer surface of the bacterial body, causing large variation in the permeability of cell walls

 </sup>. Nanoparticles are also capable of entering, in a distinct way, the cell, due to the ultra-small size of these particles. The precipitation of NPs gather in the cytoplasm, or in the periplasm space, disrupting cellular activities, causing membranes disturbance and disorder. Brayner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. reported that the interaction between 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and ZnO-NPs led to significant damage to the bacteria (e.g. disordered cell walls) and penetration of NPs into the cell, followed by intracellular content leakage

 </sup>. Furthermore, upon interaction with bacterial cells, ZnO may generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), hydroxyl radicals (OH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>), superoxide radicals (O
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and singlet oxygen (O
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). At a high rate, these chemically-reactive species can be ruthlessly damaging to a bacterial cell owing to deterioration of proteins, peptidoglycan, ribosomes, DNA, as well as inhibition of enzymatic activities and amino acid production, ultimately leading to cell lysis

 </sup>. So, we believe that Zn/Ge 10 W samples have shown higher performance as a result of a combination of different bactericidal mechanisms.
