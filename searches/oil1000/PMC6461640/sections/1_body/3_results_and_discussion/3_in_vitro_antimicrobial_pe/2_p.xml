<p id="Par39" class="p">The bio-activity of essential oils is often linked to the chemical structure of its constituent molecules, mainly to functionalities that govern solubility in water and lipophilicity, as these characteristics allow these molecules to approach, disturb and pass through a bacterial membrane

 </sup>. These disruptions then initiate membrane expansion, increase membrane permeability, induce disorder of membrane embedded proteins, inhibit respiration, and impact ion transport processes in the microbial cell. For example, carvacrol (a monoterpenic phenol) was found to make the cell membrane permeable to K+ and H+, dissipating the proton motive force and reducing ATP production

 </sup>. Despite the fact the relation between chemical structure and bio-activity is not fully understood, it is generally accepted that oil constituents with a â€“OH group are more biologically effective than their similarly-structured OH-lacking counterparts

 </sup>. However, when introducing essential oil molecules into plasma-created oxygen species, light and heat leads to their isomerization, oxidation, polymerization, dehydrogenation and thermal re-arrangements

 </sup>. This results in the formation of a wide variety of biologically-active derivative monomers, dimers and polymers, reactive oxygen species and a wide range of oxidation ions. The degree of molecule dissociation is highly reliant on the processing parameters of the applied plasma. Thus, created oil-fragments then undergo recombination in the gas phase and on the surface of the given substrate, resulting in a highly crosslinked polymer with a structure that is irregular. Perhaps, plasma would weaken/deteriorate the antimicrobial activity of the original oil, as a lot of molecules would be cross-linked and as such, unable to interact with cellular membranes
