<p id="Par44" class="p">The antimicrobial performance of Zn/Ge composites is governed by a wide range of intrinsic factors. Given the close interconnection between fundamental polymer characteristics (e.g. surface chemistry, wettability, degree of cross-linking and topography) and NPs properties (e.g. shape, size, particle charge, concentration and crystallinity), it is possible that the synergistic outcomes of these factors inhibited bacterial viability. For example, Potara
