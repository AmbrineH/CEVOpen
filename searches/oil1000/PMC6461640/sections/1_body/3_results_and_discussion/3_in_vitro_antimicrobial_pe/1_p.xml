<p id="Par38" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows the bacterial viability of gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> on surfaces of control, Ge 10 W, Ge 50 W, Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W. The Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) imaging evidently showed a much higher average number of cells adhered to the control surface compared to all polymers and composites samples. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> indicates that approximately, 80% of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> were alive on the control, while the viability of cells were 53%, 50%, 31% and 42% on Ge 10 W, Ge 50 W, Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> displays the bacterial viability of gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells on the control, pristine and composite films. On the control, 81% of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were viable on the surface, while the viability of cells were approximately 60%, 76%, 33% and 44% on Ge 10 W, Ge 50 W, Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W, respectively, as seen in Fig.
