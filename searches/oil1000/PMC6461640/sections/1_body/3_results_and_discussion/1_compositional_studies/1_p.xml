 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The binding energies were calibrated within an accuracy of 0.1 eV using C 1 s (284.6 eV). The obtained peaks were resolved using the CasaXPS software. The spectrum for pristine polymer shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(a)</xref> displays the presence of strong carbon and oxygen at peaks at 282 and 531 eV, respectively. The C 1 s peaks for geranium polymers were fitted with four peaks, which can be ascribed to major hydrocarbon C–C/C–H (BE = 284.9 eV), and other functional groups, such as ether C–O (BE = 286.2 eV), carbonyl C = O (BE = 287.5 eV), and ester O–C = O (BE = 288.9 eV)
