<p id="Par29" class="p">In contrast, the atomic concentrations for the composites were slightly varied. Carbon was identified to be around 80%, while oxygen was above 13.00%. Zinc was shown to be at 0.79% and 1.57% for samples fabricated at 10 W and 50 W, respectively. It is evident that the carbon percentage in the composites decreased with an increase in the power of deposition, which contrasted to the trend observed in the pristine counterparts. The most rational elucidation for this observation is that the higher input power resulted in a higher fragmentation/dissociation of the zinc acetylacetonate, accompanied by the loss of hydrocarbon groups owing to increased ion bombardment, causing a relative increase in oxygen, nitrogen and zinc quantities.</p>
