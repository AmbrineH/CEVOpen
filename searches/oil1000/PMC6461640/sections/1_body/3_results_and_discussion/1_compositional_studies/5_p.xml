<p id="Par30" class="p">Owing to the nature of deposition in weakly ionized plasmas (where there is high probability of monomers not being ionized), it is possible that geranium will attach to the substrate-surface in its unmodified or minimally modified state, particularly when deposition is performed at low input powers. Those un-fragmented components trapped within the polymer may elute over time, thereby contribute to the ability of the coating to retard microbial attachment on the surface

 </sup>. In addition, un-fragmented geranium (involving aromatic acyclic monoterpene alcohols) may interact with adjacent zinc nanoparticles. For example, formation of zinc oxidants during polymerization can result in oxidation of alcohol moieties to ketones. The presence of long chains of alcohols may marginally increase the size of formed ZnO particles
