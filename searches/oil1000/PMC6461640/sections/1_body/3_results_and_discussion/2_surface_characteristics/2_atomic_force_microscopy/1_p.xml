<p id="Par34" class="p">The surface morphology of the pristine and composite films was inspected by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (due to soft geranium polymer surface), with the results summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. As can be clearly observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(a)</xref>, the surface of the pristine polymer was smooth and uniform, with an average particle roughness of around 0.25 nm. As might be expected, the average roughness parameter significantly increased upon incorporation of zinc material, measuring 33.7 ± 2.1 and 37.2 ± 2.4 nm for 10 W and 50 W, respectively. The rather high surface roughness in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(b)</xref> in comparison with the pristine film indicates that the composite exposes a porous surface with random distribution of ZnO particles. The symmetry of the deviations of a surface profile can be well-defined by using the surface skewness parameter, since it is sensitive to the irregularity of high peaks or deep grooves. A clear increase in the values of the surface skewness can be observed in composite films compared to pristine films. This probably relates to the presence of zinc nanoparticles on the surfaces of the films in the form of protrusions. To describe the distribution of these protrusions with respect to the mean line, a surface kurtosis value can be employed. For an identical protrusion distribution, the kurtosis is zero. The positive values of kurtosis indicates a high peak-type distribution (leptokurtic), while negative kurtosis refers to a flat-topped distribution (platykurtic). All composites showed high positive kurtosis values (coefficient of kurtosis ~2) indicating that the surfaces were dominated by high peaks.
