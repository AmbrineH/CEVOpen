<p id="Par36" class="p">In the case of pristine polymers, plasma fabrication at higher input power conditions produces polymers with highly crosslinked structures due to more fragmentation/dissociation of precursor molecules. This results in the formation of relatively more-rigid polymers as a result of an increase in the bonding interconnection and dense packing of polymer chains within the matrix, minimizing the absorption of water on the surface. This may lead to an increase in the contact angle value, verifying the dependence of contact angle on the degree of crosslinking. Moreover, the increase in the input power affects the surface chemistry of the polymers, specifically a decrease in the oxygen content, resulting in a decrease in the polarity of the polymersâ€™ surfaces. XPS data showed a reduction in oxygen quantity in the films produced at a higher RF power. Studies have reported an increase in the contact angle values when the input power was increased
