<p id="Par37" class="p">In the case of composite Zn/Ge films, samples fabricated at 50 W revealed higher contact angle values, at approximately 73.4°, compared to contact angle values of approximately 66.4° from samples fabricated at 10 W. This is probably related to the difference in the size of formed nanoparticles at a different power of deposition. It had previously been reported that contact angles of ZnO nanoparticles are higher for larger particle sizes and lower as the particle size is reduced

 </sup>. This agreed well with our findings, where composites fabricated at 50 W comprised larger nanoparticles, while composites fabricated at 10 W showed nanoparticles of smaller sizes. Furthermore, an increase in the contact angle can be understood in terms of a difference in the surface roughness parameters. As is known, nanoparticles deposited in a vacuum consist of a number of small crystallites, which contain a number of nano- and micro-scale air pockets. The impact of these air pockets can be cumulative once they interface with the droplet of liquid, efficiently supporting the weight of the droplet and effectively increasing the macroscopic contact angle. According to the Cassie-Baxter theory, the higher the section of the area of air that is under the droplet, the higher the value of the contact angle
