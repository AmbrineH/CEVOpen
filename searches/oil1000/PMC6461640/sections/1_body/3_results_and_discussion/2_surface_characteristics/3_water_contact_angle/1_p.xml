<p id="Par35" class="p">Wettability of the polymeric surface is an essential property that is mainly determined by the chemical composition and morphological structure of the surface. The static water contact angles of pristine and composite geranium films are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. An increase in the main contact angle from 54.0° to 61.2° can be observed for pristine samples fabricated in 10 W and 50 W respectively.
