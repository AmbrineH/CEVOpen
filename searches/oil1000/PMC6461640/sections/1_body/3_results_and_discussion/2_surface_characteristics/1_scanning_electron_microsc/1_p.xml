<p id="Par31" class="p">Typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained to determine the size and morphology of the formed nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. It is known that at relatively high temperatures, typical of solid–vapor deposition methods, the growth conditions play a crucial role in the properties of resultant nanoparticles, where the morphology, shape and size could be significantly varied by altering parameters of the process

 </sup>. The growth conditions of this study created ball-like nanoparticles that were clearly seen in all composites. ZnO particles were evenly distributed in the polymer medium. No significant morphological differences were observed between composites fabricated at 10 W and 50 W. However, the size of ZnO particles slightly increased with an increasing power of deposition. The average particle size increased with the input power, from approximately 60 nm at 10 W to approximately 80 nm at 50 W. The increase in particle size is in agreement with other studies on plasma polymers and metallic nanoparticles

 </sup>. This indicates that a greater quantity of zinc can be incorporated into the polymer films at higher powers of deposition, agreeing well with the XPS data.
