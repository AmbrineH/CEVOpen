<p id="Par32" class="p">The cohesive energy of metals is typically higher (by two orders of magnitude) than the cohesive energy of polymers, which promotes a tendency for physical aggregations of metal atoms present within polymers

 </sup>. These aggregations further increase by the very weak interaction between metals and polymers compared to strong metal–metal binding forces

 </sup>. When active metal atoms are inserted and attach to the polymer, they go through various events, such as diffusion into the bulk, random rolling on the surface, or desorption. In the process of their diffusion across the polymer surface, metal atoms could be captured by surface cracks or encounter other metal atoms or particles, thereby forming aggregations and stable metal clusters. These accumulations are presented in the polymer structure during formation of the nanocomposite film. Here, we observed some of these unavoidable particle aggregations, representing less than 10% of the total number of nanoparticles. The EDS data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(e)</xref> further confirmed the presence of zinc in all composites, at peaks of 1.01, 8.63, and 9.57 keV. Peaks attributed to carbon and oxygen appeared at 0.27 and 0.52 keV, respectively. Nickel peaks were detected at 0.84 and 7.48 keV, representing the underlying substrate.
