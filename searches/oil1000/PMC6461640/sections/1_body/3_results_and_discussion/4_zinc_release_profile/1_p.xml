<p id="Par45" class="p">The release of zinc nanoparticles from Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W were confirmed using ICP measurements, and showed a relatively quick and sharp release profile of ZnO NPs within less than 24 h, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>. A high rate of nanoparticle release could be preferred in various medical applications. For example, a rapid release offers powerful antibacterial activity during the early post-operation period, inhibiting the possible development of microbial resistance

 </sup>. Nevertheless, for other applications, such as implanted synthetic devices, surfaces should preserve their antibacterial performance until integration with the surrounding tissues, with sustained prevention of microbial colonization, and subsequent biofilms formation

 </sup>. Thus, it is vital to adjust the releasing rate to match a specific application. In this regard, a recent approach to control the release of zinc oxide nanoparticles from coatings is to use a bi-layer polymeric system. Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W composites were coated by an extra thin layer (25 ± 5 and 50 ± 5 nm) of geranium film to reduce the releasing rate of zinc, which consequently increased the performance time. The measurements showed that the rate of release decreased, extending the time to 40 and 60 h for Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W composites, respectively. The slowest release rate was observed for composites coated with a 50 nm-think top layer.
