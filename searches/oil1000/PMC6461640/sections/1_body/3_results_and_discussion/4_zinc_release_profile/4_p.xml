<p id="Par48" class="p">In addition to the influence of the cross-linking degree, the size of nanoparticles could also contribute to the release profile of zinc. As shown by our SEM data, when the power of deposition increased, the average size of the ZnO nanoparticle slightly increased (from approximately 60 nm at 10 W to approximately 80 nm at 50 W). It is reasonable to assume that a smaller size particle has higher mobility in the polymer and delivers a further swelling rate, compared to a larger-sized counterpart. Consequently, the particle will be easily released from the polymer matrix in the aqueous solution. Yet, it was reported that the major contributors of a controlled release of ZnO from a film are related to the host properties, mainly the degree of intermolecular interactions rather than NPs’ morphological features such as particle shape and size
