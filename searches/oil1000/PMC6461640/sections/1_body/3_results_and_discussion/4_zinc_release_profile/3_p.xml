<p id="Par47" class="p">ICP results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref> show that composites fabricated at a higher input power (50 W) possess a considerably lower release rate compared to composites fabricated at 10 W. This can be linked to the degree of cross-linking in the material. It has been shown that fabricating geranium plasma polymers at higher power leads to an increase in the degree of cross-linking, and potentially rise resistance against deformation

 </sup>. The resultant polymers become harder and more rigid owing to the increase in the bonding interconnection and dense chain packing

 </sup>. Here, we assumed that the increase in the bonding interconnection degree would curb/restrain the freeing of nanoparticles from the films fabricated at 50 W. ICP data also suggested that a higher concentration of ZnO was released from surfaces of ZnO/Ge 10 W, making it significantly more antibacterially effective than ZnO/Ge 50 W that showed a low degree of release hence, much lower antibacterial activity.
