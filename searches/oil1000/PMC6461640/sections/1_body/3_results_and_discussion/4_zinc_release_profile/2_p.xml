<p id="Par46" class="p">A previous report showed that metallic nanoparticles (size of 15 nm and 70 nm) can pass through a thin upper layer of plasma polymer (thickness of 30 nm) upon immersion in aqueous solvents

 </sup>. Another study demonstrated that increasing the thickness of the upper polymeric layer achieves a reduction in the rate of release of metal ions compared to composites without such an upper plasma film

 </sup>. The same study proved that the upper layer coatings (thicknesses of 6, 12, and 18 nm) did not affect the antibacterial activities of the nanoparticles

 </sup>. In our Zn/Ge composites, we observed a similar trend, as a thicker geranium upper layer would provide more robust polymers, further reducing the release rate of nanoparticles without major variations in the biological performance of the nanocomposites. This indicates that the rate of release can be adjusted via the thickness of the thin barrier plasma polymer. The upper layer polymeric layer may function as both a 3-D matrix for protection of the nanoparticles from the medium, and to delay the release of zinc, potentially yielding a variety of release profiles. Obviously, the thickness of the upper layer should be carefully selected to ensure the maximum release of the nanoparticles, where the bulk of nanoparticles could be trapped inside the upper layer; to be comprehensively investigated in an upcoming study.
