 </sup>. In particular, nanocomposites could be effectively employed as antibacterial coatings, where the metal nanoparticles are incorporated into a thin layer of polymer, providing a high platform for active particles to interact with microorganisms. The main benefit of these composites is the extremely low quantity of selected nanoparticles required to achieve desired outcomes due to powerful antimicrobial properties of metal nanoparticles
