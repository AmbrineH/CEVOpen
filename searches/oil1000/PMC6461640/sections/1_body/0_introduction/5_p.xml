 </sup>. Furthermore, zinc oxide is relatively low cost, available in commercial quantities and can take several morphological forms (e.g. spherical particles, nano-rode, etc). While there are various physical/chemical methods to produce nano-sized zinc oxide, thermal decomposition of zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac)
