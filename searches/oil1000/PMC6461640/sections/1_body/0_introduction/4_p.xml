<p id="Par5" class="p">By introducing inorganic particles into the plasma polymer matrix, it may be possible to further enhance the properties of plasma polymers. Plasma systems can be adapted to introduce inorganic particles in the structure of the polymer matrix as it is formed

 </sup>, where the chemical reaction in the gas-phase and the nucleation/growth of nanoparticles happen simultaneously. Consequently, plasma-formed composite materials comprise inorganic particles and their clusters trapped within a highly cross-linked polymer matrix consisting of short polymeric chains that are randomly branched and terminated. While the properties of polymer-metal composites fabricated using simultaneous plasma polymerization and metal evaporation have been reported, they typically use conventional monomers
