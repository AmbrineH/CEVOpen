<p id="Par25" class="p">To adjust the zinc release, Zn/Ge composite films were coated by an extra thin layer (25 ± 5 or 50 ± 5 nm) of geranium plasma polymer, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The releasing rate was measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS 820, Varian, USA). Films were fabricated on glass cover slips and immersed in water. To stay well below saturation, the volume of water added to all samples was set at 5 ml, and incubation took place at 22 °C in the dark. After the deposition of a top polymer coating, samples were incubated in water for 1, 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 h, and afterwards analyzed by ICP. The calibration was performed using double distilled water as a reference, and zinc concentration &lt; = 5 µg/L.
