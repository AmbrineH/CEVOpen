<p id="Par16" class="p">Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (SU5000, Hitachi, Canada) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were used to study surface properties of the fabricated films. Films were fabricated on nickel foil, a conductive substrate, to avoid the scattering from glass substrates. Data were acquired at Vacc = 3.0 kV, EC = 115 K nA, WD = 6.1 mm, and a high vacuum atmosphere.</p>
