 </sup>. Water drop contact angles were calculated using data collected by means of a goniometer (KSV CAM 101, Helsinki, Finland), where a minimum of five measurements per sample were collected. To reduce inaccuracies in the obtained data, the size of the droplet was carefully selected to be approximately 2.5 µL in volume.
