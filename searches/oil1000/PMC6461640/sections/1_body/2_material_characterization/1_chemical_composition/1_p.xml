<p id="Par15" class="p">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained by Specs SAGE 150 spectroscope supplemented with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (
 <italic class="italic">hυ</italic> = 1486.6 eV). The measurements were collected at a take-off angle of 90° from a circular area with a diameter of ~5 mm. Intending to reduce X-ray-induced polymer degradation, the exposure time was adjusted to the minimum required to achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Surface charging effects of the samples were addressed by a reference value of 285.0 eV, which is the binding energy of C 1 s peak originating from neutral hydrocarbon (CH
