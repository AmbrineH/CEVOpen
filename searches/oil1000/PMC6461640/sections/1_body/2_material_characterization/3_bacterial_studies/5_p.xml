<p id="Par23" class="p">All data were acquired with a minimum of three replicates each. The standard error of the mean was calculated to define variance about the mean. Statistical analysis of numerical data was determined using a paired t-test. Statistical significance (*) was considered at p &lt; 0.05. Furthermore, a confidence interval (95%) was given at each time point, and was used as an additional pathway to ensure statistical differences between experimental and control data.</p>
