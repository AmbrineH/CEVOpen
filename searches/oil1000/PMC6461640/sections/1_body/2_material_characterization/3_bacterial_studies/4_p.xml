<p id="Par22" class="p">After incubation, a staining kit (SYTO™ Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher, USA) was used to study live/dead bacterial cells. The dyes were applied following the protocol outlined in

 </sup>. Prior to imaging, bacterial suspensions were removed from the samples. Then, 90 μl of the stain was placed on top of each sample and kept in the dark. After 20 min, samples were gently washed with 2 ml of distilled water to remove unattached cells. Immediately, fluorescent images were obtained with a confocal scanning laser microscope (LSM 800, ZEISS, Germany), where green and red colors were indicative of live and non-viable cells, respectively. Viability was calculated as the percentage of viable, adhering bacteria relative to the total number of attached bacteria to the surface.
