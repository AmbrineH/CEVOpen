<p id="Par24" class="p">To obtain SEM observations, bacterial cells were incubated on the samples for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, bacterial suspensions were gently removed and a volume of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was used to rinse each sample. Then, samples were passed through a series of ethanol solutions in ascending order (30%, 50%, 70%, 80% and 100% ethanol) for 10 min per step to remove water. The dehydrated samples were coated with a thin layer of palladium (&lt;5 nm) using an ion sputter for 80 sec and observed using a SEM (SU5000, Hitachi, Canada) at different magnifications.</p>
