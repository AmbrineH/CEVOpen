<p id="Par20" class="p">For each experiment, a fresh suspension was prepared by first refreshing the frozen stock culture (1 mL) in Oxoid nutrient broth (10 mL) at 37 °C and shaken at 120 rpm. A spectrometer (The SPECTROstar Nano, BMG labtech, Germany) was employed to calculate cell numbers in a bacterial suspension prior to placement on polymer surfaces. The cell density was adjusted to (OD
