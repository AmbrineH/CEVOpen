<p id="Par14" class="p">The coating thickness of pristine and composites films were estimated to be around 500 nm. As the thickness of composites may vary slightly due to the presence of nanoparticles on the film surface, in order to investigate the release of zinc from the composites, layers of 25 nm and 50 nm were coated onto the surface of Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W. These films were fabricated on glass substrates, and coating thickness was estimated using Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (JA Woollam-M2000 D, Lincoln, NE, USA) following the protocol outlined in our previous work

 </sup>. The thickness was controlled by optimizing the time of deposition, where 60 s and 100 s yielded approximately 25 nm and 50 nm. The flow rate of geranium oil was kept at 16.22 cm
