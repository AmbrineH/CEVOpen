<p id="Par11" class="p">Microscope glass slides (76 mm × 26 mm) and round cover-glass sheets (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 19 mm) were sonicated in a solution of water and commercial decon for 20 min, then washed with distilled water, rinsed in acetone and propan-2-ol, and finally dried using an air gun. Plasma polymerization was carried out in a cylindrical glass tube (
 <italic class="italic">l</italic>: 80 cm, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>: 5 cm) fitted with two external parallel copper rings, which were used as electrodes connected to a generator through a matching network. A radio frequency generator model ACG-3B (MKS Instruments, Andover, MA, USA) was operated in a continuous wave mode (13.56 MHz) to create a glow discharge. The distance between electrodes and the distance between monomer and the electrodes were optimized to achieve the optimum plasma stability. Prior to each fabrication, the reactor tube was evacuated to a pressure of 0.2 mbar utilizing a double stage rotary pump (JVAC–DD150, Victoria, Australia). Furthermore, the monomer flow rate (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>) was estimated using the relation 1, derived from the ideal gas formula

Initially, the tube was evacuated to 0.2 mbar, then the monomer gas was released into the tube until the pressure reached a stable value, at which point the outlet valve was closed, and the pressure was measured every 5 s for 1 min. The geranium flow rate was calculated to be 16.22 cm
