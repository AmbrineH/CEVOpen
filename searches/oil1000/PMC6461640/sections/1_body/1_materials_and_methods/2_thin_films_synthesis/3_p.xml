<p id="Par13" class="p">In the case of composite fabrication, the plasma polymerization tube was supplemented with an external ceramic fiber heater, where Zn(acac)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> powder (0.05 g) was placed in a ceramic boat inside the plasma tube and heated to 200 °C, as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The Zn(acac)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> vapor was carried into the fabrication zone (i.e. where substrates were located) by the flow of geranium vapors in the direction from the flask to the pump outlet. ZnO nanoparticles were formed in the gas phase and imbedded into the polymer matrix during the growth of the latter. The input power used for the deposition of all composites were 10 W and 50 W for 20 min, and the resulting composite structures were abbreviated as Zn/Ge 10 W and Zn/Ge 50 W, respectively.
