<p id="Par49" class="p">We successfully developed a nanocomposite material from geranium essential oil and the thermal decomposition of zinc acetylacetonate in a one step plasma system. XPS survey confirmed the presence of ZnO in the fabricated polymers at 10 W and 50 W. SEM images showed that the average size of the ZnO nanoparticle increased with an increase in the power of deposition, from approximately 60 nm at 10 W to approximately 80 nm at 50 W. AFM data showed a significant increase in surface roughness of the composites compared to pristine samples. The antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs incorporated into geranium films toward both gram-positive (

These coatings were confirmed to be a promising candidate for protecting relevant medical devices and implants’ material surface from bacterial attachment and colonization.
