<p class="p">Transwell migration assay was performed using transwell chambers [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. HepG2 and HCT116 cells were transferred to 3–5 passages, treated with 0.3 μL/mL of GOEO for 24 h, and then collected after treatment with trypsin (without EDTA) at room temperature. After centrifugation at 150× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min, the cells were collected, counted, and adjusted to a concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL. Cell suspension (200 μL) was placed in the top chamber of the transwell migration chambers and 600 μL of medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the bottom of the 24-well plate. After incubating for 24 h, cells were fixed by 800 μL of methanol for 30 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, the upper chamber liquid was removed, and the cells on the surface of the upper chamber membrane were carefully wiped off with a cotton swab. Migrated cells on the lower membrane surface photographed and counted. The experiment was repeated at least three times. The migration inhibition rate was calculated according to the formula 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Migration inhibition rate (%) = (the number of migration in the control group − the number of migration in the treatment group)/the number of migrations in the control group × 100%.
