 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Common process for optimization consisted of varying one parameter and keeping the others at a constant level. This single variable optimization neglected the interactive effects between variables thus the net effect of variables on the response was not exhibited. RSM has been designed to overcome this problem. It allowed simultaneous variation of several factors to find the optimal conditions for the desired response and reduced experimental trials needed to evaluate multiple parameters and their interactions [
