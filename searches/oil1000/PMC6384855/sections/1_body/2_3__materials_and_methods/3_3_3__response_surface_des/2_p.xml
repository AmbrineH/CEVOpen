<p class="p">There were many factors affecting the hydrodistillation extraction yield of EO [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], for example, liquid material ratio, distillation time etc. Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] has proofed the yield of EO can be enhanced by adding an appropriate amount of inorganic salts during the extraction process. Adding salt in the solution could change the composition of the original vapor-liquid equilibrium by association and other interactions in the liquid phase, which causes a ‘salt effect’ [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Based on single effect experiments and literatures, we designed three-factor, three-level experiments involving liquid material ratio (A), NaCl concentration (B), and distillation time (C). The range of independent variables and their levels are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00499-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The test variables were transformed to the range of −1 to 1 for the evaluation of factors. The extraction conditions were optimized by Box-Behnken design via Design-Expert 8.0.6.
