<p class="p">Cell proliferation inhibition rate of GOEO was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. GOEO (50 μL) was added to the medium and mixed well. The mixture was diluted in DMSO to prepare solutions at a concentration of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0 μL/mL, respectively. The cells were placed into 96-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well). After 24 h, 100 μL of GOEO at different concentrations was added, and incubation continued for 48 h at 37 °C in a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator. Then, medium in the 96-well plate was disposed of. A 100 μL of CCK-8 test solution (DojinDo, Japan) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The optical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The cell viability rate at different concentrations of GOEO treatment was calculated according to the formula 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Viability rate (%) = (OD
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub> − OD
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>)/(OD
  <sub class="sub">control</sub> − OD
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>) × 100%.
