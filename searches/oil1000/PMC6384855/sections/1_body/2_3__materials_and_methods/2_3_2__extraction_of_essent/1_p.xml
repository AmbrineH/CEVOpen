<p class="p">Sample (100.0 g) was placed in a 2.0 L round bottom distillation flask, and a certain amount of sodium chloride (NaCl) and distilled water were added. The mixture was slowly heated to boiling, and distilled for a certain period of time. The distillate was collected, extracted three times with petroleum ether. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then the petroleum ether was removed by a rotary evaporator. The extraction yield of essential oil (Y) was calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Y (%) = (essential oil mass/flavedo mass) Ã— 100
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
