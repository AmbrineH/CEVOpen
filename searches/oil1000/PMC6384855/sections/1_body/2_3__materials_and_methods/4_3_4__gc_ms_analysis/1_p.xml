<p class="p">‘Gannanzao’ orange essential oil (GOEO) components were analyzed by an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa, Clara, CA, USA). The GC-MS system was equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30.00 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm). Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV with a spectra range of 50 to 500

The oven temperature was maintained at 80 °C for 4 min, and subsequently raised to 250 °C (5 °C/min) for 10 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, at a split ratio of 50:1. The components were identified by comparing Kovats retention indices and their mass spectra with those of the computer mass libraries of The National Institute of Standards and Technology (version 2010, U.S. Department of Commerce, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
