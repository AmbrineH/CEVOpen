<p class="p">Cancer is a serious disease that threatens human health with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal and proliferating cells that have undergone a plethora of changes in multiple genes [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. As some anticancer drugs have high toxicity and resistance rates and are ineffective in some types of tumors, the research and development of greater resources towards prevention are needed. Natural anticancer agents from plants have drawn much interest and played a significant role in cancer drug discovery due to their multitude effects on diverse molecular signaling pathways, with no or minimal toxicity in normal cells. Newman et al. reported [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] that, from the 1940s to 2014, 75% of the 175 small molecule anticancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are actually either natural products or their derivatives.
