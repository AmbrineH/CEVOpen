<p class="p">In this study, the peel essential oil of ‘Gannanzao’, a new variety from the bud mutation of ‘Newhall’ navel orange, was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the optimum conditions for extraction by response surface design were as follows—liquid material ratio of 8.4:1 (mL/g), NaCl concentration of 5.3%, and distillation time of 3.5 h. Under these conditions, the extraction yield was 2.14%. GC-MS detected thirty-nine chemical components in GOEO. Efficient extraction and identification of EO would be helpful to create new economic value and reduce waste. The in vitro test showed a strong dose-dependent antiproliferative activity of GOEO on HepG2 and HCT116 cancer cells. GOEO at the concentration of 0.3 μL/mL of can inhibit migration of both cancer cells. Further study of the bioactivity of orange EO might be helpful in developing new anticancer agents.</p>
