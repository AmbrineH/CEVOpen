<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00499-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, thirty-nine components were detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with a total content of 99.59%, which included eleven monoterpenes (limonene, β-myrcene, α-pinene, etc.), and twelve oxygenated monoterpenes (linalool, α-terpineol, geraniol, neral, etc.), accounting for 96.00% and 1.96%, respectively; seven sesquiterpenes (β-elemene, β-farnesene, valencene, etc.) and four oxygenated sesquiterpenes (β-sinensal, α-sinensal, nootkatone, etc.), accounting for 0.91% and 0.37%, respectively. In addition, five straight-chain aldehydes were identified, such as octanal, nonanal, decanal, etc., with a total relative content of 0.35%. Compared with ‘Newhall’ orange EO (NOEO) prepared by hydrodistillation, the total amount of monoterpenes in GOEO was 95.94%, higher than NOEO (89.87%). Limonene content of GOEO was about 6.4% higher than NOEO (81.62%). Percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes in GOEO (1.96%) was much lower than NOEO (6.94%). Linalool (0.26%) content in GOEO was much lower than NOEO (2.03%). Sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes presented very low content in both EOs (0.81% and 0.17% for NOEO, 0.91% and 0.37% for GOEO, respectively). Compared with Valencia orange peel EO (VOEO) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], limonene content of GOEO (88.07%) was about 10% higher than VOEO (78.5%), and β-myrcene content of GOEO (4.93%) was lower than VOEO (5.3%). The composition of these two orange EOs varied due to differences in variety, extraction method, and other factors.
