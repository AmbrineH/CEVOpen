<p class="p">The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00499-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The model was highly significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating the equation was adequate for predicting the yield under any combination of values of the variables. A, B, C, A
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and B
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> were highly significant model terms because 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values were less than 0.001. AB, AC, and BC were very significant model terms because 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values were less than 0.01. However, C
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was not significant because the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value was greater than 0.05.
