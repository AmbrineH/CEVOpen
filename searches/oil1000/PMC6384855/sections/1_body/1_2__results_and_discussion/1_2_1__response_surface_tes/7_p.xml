 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00499-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> showed that the interaction term of each factor had a significant effect on the yield of EO. As shown in graph a, when distillation time C was kept constant at 3.0 h, as liquid material ratio and NaCl concentration increased the extraction yield also increased; at a certain point, the yield reached the highest value. However, when the liquid material ratio and NaCl concentration further increased, the yield began to decline. As shown in graph b, when NaCl concentration B was kept constant at 5.0%, with the increase of liquid material ratio, an upward trend of the yield was shown. The yield began to decline with further increase of liquid material ratio. However, the yield always increased with the increase of distillation time. As shown in graph c, when liquid material ratio A remained at 8:1, the yield was increased with the increase of distillation time. With the increase ofNaCl concentration, an upward trend of the yield was shown. The yield began to decrease with further increase of NaCl concentration. Using the response surface design, interaction of factors affecting the experiment could be considered simultaneously.
