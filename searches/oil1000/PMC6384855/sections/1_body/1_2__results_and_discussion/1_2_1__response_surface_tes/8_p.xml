<p class="p">The model was optimized, and the predicted maximum value (2.15%) of the test variables was found under the following conditions—liquid material ratio of 8.38:1 (mL/g), NaCl concentration of 5.29%, and distillation time of 3.50 h. For the feasibility of the operation, liquid material ratio was adjusted to 8.4:1, and NaCl concentration to 5.3%. Experiments were performed under new conditions to validate the adequacy of optimized prediction. A value of 2.14% ± 0.03% (

The different yields may be due to the different variety of oranges and extraction method.
