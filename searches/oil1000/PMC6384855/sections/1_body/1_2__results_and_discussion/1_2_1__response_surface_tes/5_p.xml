<p class="p">The experimental data matched the model well with high correlation coefficients (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9952), indicating that only 0.48% of the total variations could not be explained by the model. The Pred R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of 0.9857 was in reasonable agreement with the value of the adjusted determination coefficient Adj R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of 0.9890. Adeq precision that represented the signal to noise ratio was greater than 4, indicating this model could be used to navigate the design space.
