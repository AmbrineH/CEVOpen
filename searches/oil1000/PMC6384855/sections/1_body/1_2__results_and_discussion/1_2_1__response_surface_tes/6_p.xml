<p class="p">In this model, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values of liquid material ratio (A), NaCl concentration (B), and distillation time (C) were less than 0.001, indicating that the three factors had a highly significant effect on the yield of GOEO. It could be seen from the coefficients of the regression equation that the distillation time had the greatest influence on the response value of the yield, followed by NaCl concentration and the liquid material ratio (C &gt; B &gt; A). The interaction terms of factors 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values AB &lt; 0.01, AC &lt; 0.01, BC &lt; 0.05, indicating that the interaction terms AB and AC had a very significant effect on the extraction yield, and the interaction term BC had a significant effect.
