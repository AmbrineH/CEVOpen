<p class="p">The effects of different concentrations of GOEO on the proliferation of HepG2 liver cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells were tested by CCK-8 method. The results were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00499-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. As the concentration of GOEO increased, the viability rate of both cells decreased. When the concentration of GOEO was higher than 0.3 μL/mL, the viability rate of HepG2 cells was significantly decreased; when the concentration of GOEO was 0.5 μL/mL or higher, the viability rate became lower than 13.2%. GOEO also had a good inhibitory effect on the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. When the concentration was 0.6 μL/mL or higher, the viability rate of HCT116 cells was lower than 13.0%. GraphPad Prism™ (Version 5.00) software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to calculate IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of HepG2 and HCT116 was 0.29 and 0.35 μL/mL, respectively. These results indicated that GOEO has a good inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HepG2 hepatoma cells and colon cancer HCT116 cells in vitro.
