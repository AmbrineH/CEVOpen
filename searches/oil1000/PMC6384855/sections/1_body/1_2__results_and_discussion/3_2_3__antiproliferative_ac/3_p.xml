<p class="p">Studies have reported that plant EOs as well as their components such as limonene, citral, Î²-elemene can effectively inhibit the proliferation of various malignant cells such as melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00499" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] tested antiproliferative activity of EO from mandarin peel and its principal component limonene, and found that both EO and limonene showed a strong dose-dependent antiproliferative activity of lung adenocarcinoma A549 and hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cell lines. Liver cancer and colon cancer are common malignant tumors. The occurrence and development of tumors are not only related to cell proliferation, but also closely related to the migration and invasion ability of cancer cells. Therefore, anticancer drugs not only need to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, but also their metastasis. Our study preliminarily tested the inhibitory effect of GOEO on the proliferation and migration of HepG2 liver cancer cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The discussion about anticancer activity of some EO components has been made by Zengin et al [
