<p class="p">GOEO can inhibit the migration of HepG2 liver cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Pre-experimental results showed that GOEO at a concentration higher than 0.3 μL/mL will kill most cancer cells. When the GOEO concentration was lower than 0.3 μL/mL, there was no obvious inhibition on the migration of cancer cells. Therefore, GOEO at concentration of 0.3 μL/mL was used to treat cancer cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00499-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, GOEO caused less migration of HepG2 hepatoma cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells compared with the control group, and the inhibitory effect was very significant (
