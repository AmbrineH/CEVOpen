<p class="p">In recent years, plant essential oils have received much attention in bacteriostatic compound research owing to their remarkable bacteriostatic activities and unique advantages of reduced side effects and residual toxicity compared with synthetic chemical bacteriostatic agents. In general, Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to plant essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria because the outside of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria contains a lipopolysaccharide layer that prevents hydrophobic compounds from entering the cells, which reduces the bacteriostatic effect [
