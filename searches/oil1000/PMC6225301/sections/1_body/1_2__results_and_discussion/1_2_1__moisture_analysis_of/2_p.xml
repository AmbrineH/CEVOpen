<p class="p">Agarwood can resist external attack of the xylem parts and its moisture content is lower than that of xylem. The main factors influencing the moisture content are ambient humidity and the agarwood formation mechanism. Compared with other regions, the moisture content of Chinese 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> agarwood was the lowest, at 7.99 ± 0.13% (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02168-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> agarwood is mostly grown in areas near the Tropic of Cancer, which has a humid tropical and subtropical monsoon climate with high temperatures and abundant rainfall. 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> agarwood is also commonly grown in mountain rainforest or semi-evergreen rainforest with moist, porous, and humus thick soil. Agarwood from Vietnam had the highest moisture content (14.73 ± 0.08%). This was attributed to Vietnam having a tropical monsoon and tropical rainforest climate, with four distinct seasons in the north, while the four seasons are divided into dry and rainy seasons in the south owing to the effects of the monsoon. Furthermore, the moisture contents of Malaysian and Indonesian agarwood were 9.22 ± 0.16% and 11.27 ± 0.31%, respectively. Malaysia is located near the equator and has a tropical rainforest climate and tropical monsoon climate without obvious seasons, with average temperatures of 26–30 °C and abundant rainfall. The Indonesian climate is similar to that of Malaysia and typical of a tropical rainforest climate with abundant rainfall. These fundamental climate factors account for the different moisture contents of agarwood from different regions. Furthermore, fresh samples recently obtained from agarwood had a relatively high moisture content. As the weight is not the same as the density, it is easy to submerge at the place of production. Once separated from the tree, the water supply is cut off. However, owing to the influence of outside temperature, the moisture stored in the interior is gradually reduced. Agarwood of good provenance is not likely to sink. The moisture content of agarwood has a significant influence on its weight, which results in the weight of agarwood changing during rainy and dry seasons. The original water content of agarwood is relatively abundant, and its weight can be reduced under dry conditions and during storage. This is an important reason for selecting agarwood is the lower moisture content, and the higher quality [

 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> showed that the root had the lowest moisture content (46.48 ± 0.36%). This was attributed to the root comprising the water transport channels of the plant, meaning that it does not retain water. The fruit had the highest moisture content, including the blossom, seed, and peel. Owing to the driving force of transpiration [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the moisture contents of the blossom, seed, and peel were 71.98 ± 0.83%, 79.72 ± 1.27%, and 81.20 ± 0.68%, respectively. The moisture content of the bark was 70.07 ± 0.23%, while those of the leaves and branches were 63.88 ± 0.66% and 63.23 ± 0.24%, respectively. The moisture content of the xylem was lower, at 51.95 ± 0.03%.
