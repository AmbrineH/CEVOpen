<p class="p">The alcohol extracts of different 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02168-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) contained benzoic acid ethyl ester, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, oleic acid, and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid. Among them, benzoic acid was abundant in the root (20.32%) and peel (28.28%). Compared with the literature [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], the RA(%) value of Benzoic acid, ethyl ester was 14%, while the data in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02168-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> is higher than the literature data, whereas the hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester contents in the branch and seed were similar, at 9.32% and 9.65%, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02168-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, oleic acid was concentrated in the bark (14.11%) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid was concentrated in the blossom (15.96%). Because the RA(%) values in other organs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> were not listed in the previous studies, only the chemical structures have been analyzed, so no comparison could be made. Inorganic compounds are transported upward in the xylem of plants, while organic matter is transported through the phloem upward and downward, with preferential transport to the growth centers of the plants [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Owing to plant transpiration, water is transported from the bottom to the top. The organic acid contents are higher in the leaves and blossom because organic acids are water soluble, while the water solubility of ester organic compounds is poor, resulting in higher ester contents in the roots and leaves [
