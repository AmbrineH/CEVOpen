<p class="p">The main volatile components in the different organs were 3-ethyl-5-(2-ethylbutyl)-octadecane, oleic acid 3-(octadecyloxy) propyl ester, and docosanoic acid 1,2,3-propanetriyl ester (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02168-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). These three compounds all have obvious antimicrobial effects and potential bioactivities [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Therefore, vulnerable external parts of the plant body are rich in these compounds. The 3-ethyl-5-(2-ethylbutyl)-octadecane content was highest in the blades (37.26%), while its contents in other organs were in the order: blossom (9.41%) &gt; seed (5.34%) &gt; peel (3.38%). The oleic acid 3-(octadecyloxy) propyl ester content was highest in the blade (18.59%), while its contents in the blossom, peel, and seed were 15.71%, 5.38%, and 4.64%, respectively. Furthermore, the docosanoic acid 1,2,3-propanetriyl ester content was highest in the blade (6.11%).
