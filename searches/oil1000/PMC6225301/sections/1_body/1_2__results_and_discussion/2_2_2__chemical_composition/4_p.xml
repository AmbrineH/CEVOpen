<p class="p">The chemical composition and relative percentages of the contents of

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2dot3-molecules-23-02168" class="xref">Section 3.2.3</xref>, were determined by GC-MS and the results are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02168-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The results show that the volatile components of the blossom (16.59%), seed (21.30%), peel (21.50%), and blade (13.34%) contained a high abundance of fatty acids, such as benzoic acid, and 10-octadecenoic acid methyl ester. Similarly, the alcohol extracts of the blossom (15.96%), seed (36.66%), peel (28.28%), and blade (8.66%) contained
