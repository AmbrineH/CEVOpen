Analyzing the alcohol extracts of agarwood from different regions showed that they contained volatile oils, sesquiterpenoids, 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone, fatty acids, and other components (

Among them, the main volatile oil components in agarwood are sesquiterpenoids and aromatic compounds. 2-(2-Phenylethyl)chromone is a characteristic component that confirms subfamily Agaraceae as an independent subfamily, while its precursor diphenyl pentanone is widely found in plants of the Thymelaeaceae family [
