<p class="p">DPPH is a highly stable nitrogen-centered free radical that can capture other free radicals, with a strong absorption centered at 517 nm. Freshly prepared DPPH solution is a deep purple color that becomes colorless or pale yellow after reacting with an antioxidant [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02168-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a, with increasing essential oil concentration, the scavenging activity (SC%) increased significantly. When the concentration was less than 60 mg/mL, the scavenging activity increased rapidly, but as the concentration was increased further, the scavenging activity increased more slowly. The antioxidant capacity of the essential oil was much weaker than those of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and vitamin E (VE). According to the literature, if a substance has an SC
