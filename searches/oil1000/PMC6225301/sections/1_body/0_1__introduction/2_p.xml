<p class="p">Existing literature on agarwood is mainly focused on studying the types and structures of two pharmacologically active components, namely, 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives and sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, few studies have compared the contents of these two compounds in agarwood from different regions. Furthermore, research on 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> has mainly focused on leaf and seed chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], while the chemical composition and volatile contents of different organs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> have not been systematically studied. Therefore, herein, the chemical composition of volatile components and alcohol extracts of different organs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> and agarwood from different regions were investigated by GC-MS. Furthermore, the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of their essential oils were tested. This study aimed to develop a method for identifying the chemical composition of agarwood, providing a theoretical basis for further experiments, and to compare exotic agarwood species and understand the main chemical components in different samples. The results will provide a basis for selecting the best quality agarwood from different origins and a foundation for the quality evaluation and mechanism study of agarwood.
