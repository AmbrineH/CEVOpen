<p class="p">Agarwood is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, incense, and perfumes. 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> is the only certified source of agarwood products listed in the China Pharmacopoeia. The moisture content of agarwood from different regions, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, was investigated, with Chinese agarwood found to have the lowest moisture content and Vietnamese agarwood the highest. This result was attributed to Vietnam being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, with a tropical monsoon climate and high humidity. Among the parts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic>, the moisture content of the root was the lowest, while that of the fruit was the highest. According to chemical composition analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic>, the seeds had the highest volatile component and alcohol extract contents. Squalene, fatty acids, and highly unsaturated fatty acids were abundant. The chemical constituents of agarwood from different regions were also analyzed. The results showed that all species contained active chemical compounds, such as sesquiterpenoids, aromatic species, and chromone compounds. The proportion of chromone compounds was highest in Chinese agarwood. Chromone compound 2-phenylethyl-benzopyran is a type of elicitor that induced agarwood formation. The antioxidant capacity of essential oils extracted by HD were determined and compared with traditional antioxidants. The DPPH scavenging effect decreased in the order BHT &gt; VE &gt; HD, while the FRAP test results decreased in the order BHT &gt; VE &gt; HD. In the antibacterial ability test of the essential oils, the essential oil concentration increased and inhibition rate decreased from 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">E.</italic>
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic>. The present study identified the chemical compositions of agarwood and provides a basis for selecting the best quality agarwood from different origins. This study also provides a new approach to the identification of agarwood from domestic and exotic species.
