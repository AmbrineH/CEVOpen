<p class="p">GC was performed using the following conditions: manual injection, 1 μL; injector temperature, 270 °C; carrier gas (He) flow rate, 1 mL/min; programmed oven temperature, 60 °C held for 5 min, ramped from 60 to 120 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, held for 5 min, ramped from 120 to 170 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, held for 2 min, and ramped from 170 to 280 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The detector temperature was 280 °C. MS was performed under the following conditions: Scan range, 15–500 amu; scan-TIC mode; injection port temperature, 250 °C; column oven temperature, 60 °C; ion source temperature, 230 °C; carrier gas (N
