<p class="p">DPPH (3.5 mg) was made up to 100 mL with methanol in a brown 100-mL volumetric flask. Essential oil–methanol solution (1.0 mL) was mixed with DPPH–methanol solution (2.0 mL), and the mixture was shaken (100 rpm) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a TU-1900 UV spectrophotometer (Persee, Beijing, China) with methanol as the blank. The DPPH anion radical scavenging activity of the mixture was expressed as the SC%, which was calculated using the following equation:
