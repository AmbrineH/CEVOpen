The mixtures were shaken for 10 min and measured at 593 nm using a TU-1900 UV spectrophotometer (Persee). Before the experiment, the initial absorbance of the reagents (3 mL) and the acetate buffer (3 mL) were measured at 593 nm and used as blanks. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. The corresponding Trolox mass fraction obtained from the standard curve of the absorbance after the reaction is defined as the FRAP value (mg Trolox/g extract) [
