<p class="p">Under the influence of Δ-6-desaturase (D6D), linoleic acid undergoes dehydrogenation to form γ-linolenic acid. The activity of Δ-6-desaturase in human cells depends on various factors and is reduced under the influence of nicotine, alcohol, magnesium deficiency, and a poor diet rich in saturated fatty acids, and under conditions of physiological aging of the body [

The basic component of evening primrose oil is linoleic acid, and the possibility of its metabolism to γ-linolenic acid due to the action of Δ-6-desaturase is an important point. Δ-6-Desaturase (D6D) activity is highest in the liver, the brain, the heart, and lung cells [
 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. D6D activity is several times higher in the fetal human liver than in the adult human liver [

The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene encoding the Δ-6-desaturase enzyme is also expressed in skin cells: within the sebaceous gland, D6D desaturates palmitic acid to sapienic acid, which is the major fatty acid of human sebum [
