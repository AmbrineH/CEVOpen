<p class="p">In recent years, it has been found that γ-linolenic acid is cytotoxic to glioma cells, and it can enhance gamma radiosensitivity [

 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. It has been suggested that this effect is related to the accumulation of the toxic products of lipid peroxidation, which are cytotoxic to glioma cells. In cancer cells responsible for various types of cancer, the over-expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) oncogene has been observed. This oncogene causes rapid and uncontrolled cell growth. However, γ-linolenic acid leads to an increase in the levels of polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (PEA3), a transcriptional repressor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) in cells, and a decrease in Her-2/neu promoter activity, thus reducing the likelihood of developing breast cancer [

Due to the inhibition of Her-2 expression, GLA administered together with transtuzumab, which as a monoclonal antibody binds to the Her-2 receptor, increases the process of the apoptosis of cancer cells and thus increases the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy with transtuzumab [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The formation of these changes is also associated with a reduction in the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which plays a significant role in cancer (e.g., in the process of tumor angiogenesis) [
