<p class="p">Because DGLA can be metabolically converted via three different enzyme pathways, it is important to determine which enzyme has a higher affinity for arachidonic acid and which metabolites will dominate—pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. Note that γ-linolenic acid, which is one of the main acids contained in evening primrose oil, is an important precursor of DGLA, which is a precursor of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids [

 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) level in tissues in relation to PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, but the biological properties of PGE
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> are about 20 times stronger in comparison to PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [

Therefore, it is suggested that the metabolism should be directed to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. An effective solution is an application of selective Δ-5-desaturase inhibitors, which may stop DGLA’s conversion to AA and its further pro-inflammatory metabolites [

Moreover, as a polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid undergoes peroxidation to form electrophilic aldehydes with low molecular weight and high reactivity, which may be a cause of the modification of both nucleophilic small molecules and high-molecular weight compounds, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, which disturbs cellular metabolism [
