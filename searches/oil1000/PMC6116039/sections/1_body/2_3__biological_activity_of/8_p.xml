<p class="p">Regardless of the metabolism of DGLA catalyzed by COXs and 15-LOX, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid under the influence of Δ-5-desaturase (D5D) is converted to arachidonic acid (AA), which is the precursor of many lipid mediators in the body, mainly pro-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, the sources of AA are membrane phospholipids, from which it is released by the hydrolysis of ester bonds, mainly via the action of phospholipase A
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (PLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). There are two main ways that lead to the formation of free arachidonic acid. One pathway leads to the hydrolytic release of AA by the cytosolic isoform of PLA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The second way leads to the release of AA by the indirect action of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase. DAG lipase and PLC result in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and DAG. The latter is then hydrolyzed by DAG lipase to form free arachidonic acid and monoacylglycerol (MAG) [
