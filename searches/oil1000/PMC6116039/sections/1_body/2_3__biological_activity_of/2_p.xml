<p class="p">Linoleic acid belongs to the group of essential fatty acids. These are also called exogenous fatty acids, because the human body does not synthesize them and it is necessary to obtain them from food [
 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Evening primrose oil contains over 70% linoleic acid (LA) and about 9% γ-linolenic acid (GLA) [
 <xref rid="B10-antioxidants-07-00108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid contribute to the proper functioning of many tissues of the human body, because they are precursors of compounds that lead to the generation of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as the series 1 prostaglandins and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE). On the other hand, the enzymatic conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid (AA) may form pro-inflammatory compounds, such as series 2 prostaglandins and series 4 leukotrienes [
