<p class="p">Broth dilution method for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination as described previously was employed [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Serial 2-fold dilutions were made to obtain a concentration range of 0.07–35.9 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of extract inhibiting any visible bacterial growth. All tests were conducted in triplicates.
