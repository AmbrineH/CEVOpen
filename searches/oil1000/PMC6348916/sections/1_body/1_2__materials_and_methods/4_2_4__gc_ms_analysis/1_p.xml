The MS scan conditions were a transfer line temperature of 280°C, an interface temperature of 280°C, and an ion source temperature of 230°C. Identification of the components was conducted by matching the retention times against National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST Mass Spectrometry DATA CENTER) data library, and crosscheck was applied with previously published data [
