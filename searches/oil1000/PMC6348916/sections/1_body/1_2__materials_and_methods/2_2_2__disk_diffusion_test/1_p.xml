<p class="p">Plant samples were dried after collection and ground into small pieces with a grinder. Ground 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> samples were shaken in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) at 125 rpm for 2 days at room temperature. After that, all the mixture was filtrated through Whatman no. 1 filter paper into evaporation flasks. Filtrates were evaporated by a rotary evaporator (Buchi R3) at 45°C [

The activity of the extract was tested against 22 bacteria and 1 yeast, where most of the strains were standard; nostandard strains were isolated from food and the MDR strains were clinical isolates. Nonstandard strains were identified in Ankara University, Department of Biology and Duzce University, Department of medical. All bacterial strains were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours; however,

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Firstly, Mueller–Hinton agar (BD Difco, USA) was poured into 90 mm sterile Petri dish in order to reach a meant depth of 4.0 mm ± 0.5 mm. The extracts were loaded on 6 mm Oxoid Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks. Disks were left to dry overnight at 30°C in sterile conditions in order to prevent any remaining of solvent, which may interfere with the results. After that, prepared microorganisms, which were inoculated into saline solution, were streaked on the surface of Petri dishes. These plates were left to dry for 5 minutes at room temperature in aseptic conditions [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Next, disks were tightly applied to the surface of plates. Finally, these plates were incubated, and inhibition zone diameters were recorded [
