<p class="p">Another previous study was tested the antimicrobial activity of two subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic>. The only common microorganism used in our study and this previous study was 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. They observed a MIC value &gt; 100 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL for both subspecies, which are quite higher than our results [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. But this difference is logical since the plant samples, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain, and collection area were different.
