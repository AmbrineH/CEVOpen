<p class="p">The diameters of inhibition zones, which were measured in millimeters, are given in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> as the mean values of three parallels with standard errors. No activities were observed for the negative controls. Furthermore, statistical analysis proved that there are no significant differences between the activities of three parallels of each extract volumes (
