<p class="p">Acinetobacter species, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, have become significant pathogens especially in the nosocomial setting. 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> has progressively been implicated in serious nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infection (BSI), nosocomial and ventilator-related pneumonia, and meningitis. These infections are particularly common in critically ill patients, with mortalities as high as 40–64% for pneumonia and 17–46% for BSI [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents within hospitals has led to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> strains. Only a few antimicrobial agents are active against MDR 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> infections [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In our study, we observed 11 mm of inhibition zone against 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> (MDR) strain. Moreover, we have found 14 mm of inhibition zones against 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus vulgaris</italic> (MDR) and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (MDR) strains. Our results present that 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> is active against MDR strains too.
