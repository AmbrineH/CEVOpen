 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> has antimicrobial activity against all studied microorganisms except 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. Three of them have high susceptibility (15–25 mm); seven of them have moderate susceptibility (14–10 mm); and eleven of them have low susceptibility (9–7 mm). 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> shows antimicrobial activity against all tested MDR bacteria. These results are important since antimicrobial activity of this species were determined against large range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
