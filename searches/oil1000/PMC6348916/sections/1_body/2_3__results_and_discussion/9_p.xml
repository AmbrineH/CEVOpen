 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] tested the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus mirabilis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. As a result, they observed MIC values between 2.5 and 10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL. Although the strains of these microorganisms were not defined, the difference in the MIC values between this study and our study was mainly due to using different types of extracts, namely, essential oil and ethanol extracts.
