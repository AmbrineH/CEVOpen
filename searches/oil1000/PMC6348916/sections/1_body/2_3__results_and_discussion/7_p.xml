<p class="p">Previous studies tested the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> and found MIC values between 0 and 6500 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. When the result of this study were compared with the results of the previous study, it may be observed that the MIC values obtained in our study were much lower, which is better. The reason of this difference should be related with the strains used in two studies. Although 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were used in both studies, the strains were different. Only 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 7644 were common in these two studies but the MIC values were different. This difference could be related with the composition of extracts which were directly affected by the environment; those plant samples were collected.
