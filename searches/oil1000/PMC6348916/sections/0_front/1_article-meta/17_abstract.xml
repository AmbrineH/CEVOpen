 <p class="p">The aim of this study was to test antimicrobial activity of ethanol extract of 
  <italic class="italic">Lavandula stoechas</italic> against 22 bacteria and 1 yeast. Also, biochemical composition of the extract was investigated. A wide range of Gram-positive, Gram-negative microorganisms, and multidrug resistant bacteria were selected to test the antimicrobial activity. As a result, the extract is observed to contain fenchone 
  <italic class="italic">(bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,3,3-trimethyl-, (1R</italic>)-) and camphor 
  <italic class="italic">(+)-2-bornanone)</italic> as major components and showed antimicrobial activity against all studied microorganisms except 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
  <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The results of the study present that 
  <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic> is active against MDR strains too.
