 </sup> A solution of 0.5 mg β-carotene (type I synthetic; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in 1 mL chloroform was prepared in a flask. Then 25 µL linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 400 mg Tween 40 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added into the flask. The chloroform was removed completely using a rotary evaporator (Model 4003; Heidolph Laborata, Schwabach, Germany) at 40 ˚C and then 100 mL of distilled water was added and shaken vigorously. Aliquots 2.5 mL of this emulsion were transferred into a series of test tubes containing 350 μL of various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg mL

The absorbance of each tube was measured at 470 nm immediately at zero time and also after a two-hour period while the tubes were kept in a water bath at 50˚C. The capacity of the EOs to protect against oxidation of β-carotene was determined as follows:
