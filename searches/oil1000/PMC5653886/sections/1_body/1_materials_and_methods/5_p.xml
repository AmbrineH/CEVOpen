 <bold class="bold">Micro-well dilution assay. </bold>Micro-well dilution assay was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the EOs against the tested bacterial strains (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus </italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic>). Bacterial suspensions were prepared while being in log phase, conformed to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity and serially diluted (1:10) to achieve the desired concentration (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6 </sup>CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The EOs were dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, then the solutions were prepared at the concentration of 40 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> as a stock solution, and then the serial two-fold dilutions were made in a concentration range from 0.62 to 40 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>in nutrient broth. Briefly, 160 μL of the nutrient broth, 20 μL of the inoculums and 20 μL of the EOs were added into each well.

 </sup> Subsequently, the wells without any bacteria and the wells without any EOs were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively. The microplates were mixed gently and incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 hr. The final volume in each well was 200 µL, the final concentrations of EOs were in a range between 0.062 to 4.000 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and the final bacterial suspensions in the wells were approximately 1.5×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth was regarded as MIC values of the EOs. The MBC values were determined by inoculating 10 μL of none-turbid wells on BHI agar, while the lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth on the agar was 
 <italic class="italic">regarded</italic> as MBC values of the EOs.
