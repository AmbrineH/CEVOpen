 </sup> Some of the most considerable aspects of the functions of plant EOs are the pathogen growth inhibition, delaying food spoilage and the improvement of organoleptic quality. Using natural products as antibacterial compounds can reduce health hazards and economic losses that have been produced by foodborne microorganisms.

 </sup> Gram-negative bacteria are shown to be generally more resistant than gram-positive ones to the antagonistic effects of EOs because of the presence of lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane.
