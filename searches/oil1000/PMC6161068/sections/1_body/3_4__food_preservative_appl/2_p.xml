The use of mint is not strictly limited to essential oils, which are widely recognized for their strong aromatic properties. Indeed, essential oils and their derived extracts can be effectively used as natural food preservatives. As a result, they can fulfill several important tasks: prolong shelf-life, eliminate synthetic preservatives and food flavors, as well as forming part of a healthy food trend that influences market sales. Due to the overall popularity and occurrence, mint appear to be relatively well tested in terms of antibacterial activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> pathogenic strains, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and many others (
