<p class="p">On the other hand, Ben Arfa et al. [
 <xref rid="B182-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>] compared the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol with that of carvacrol methyl ether, carvacrol acetate, eugenol, and menthol. Menthol showed very weak antibacterial activity, with it being suggested that the benzene ring is of huge importance to promoting strong effects. Indeed, menthol molecules have a cyclohexane ring, which seems to make this compound less active. Nonetheless, compounds present in essential oils and extracts show multiple actions and even synergistic effects. Consequently, mixtures can be more effective as food preservatives than pure substances. The main mechanisms of antimicrobial synergy include: (1) sequential steps inhibition in specific biochemical pathways; (2) inhibition of enzymes that degrade of excrete antimicrobial agents; and (3) cell wall/membrane interaction leading to increased uptake of other antimicrobials [
