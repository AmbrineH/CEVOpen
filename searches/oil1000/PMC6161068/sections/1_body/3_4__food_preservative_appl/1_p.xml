<p class="p">Food manufacturers, regulatory agencies and, finally, consumers have been increasingly concerned about microbiological food safety and the growing number of foodborne illnesses caused by pathogens [
 <xref rid="B146-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. According to the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) global estimates of foodborne diseases, 600 million people fall ill after consuming contaminated food, of which 420,000 die. In European countries alone, more than 23 million people fall ill every year from unsafe food, and this results in 5,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. Over 90% of all cases of food poisoning are caused by

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium botulinum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium perfringens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> pathogenic strains,

 <italic class="italic">Vibrio cholerae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B148-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. These microorganisms are responsible for foodborne outbreaks in different food branches, such as drinking water, beverages, dairy products, fruits, vegetables and even meat and fish products [
 <xref rid="B149-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. For decades, in the food industry, a wide variety of synthetic compounds has been used for preservative and antimicrobial purposes with the aim of inhibiting microorganism growth and spoiling. Sodium benzoate, sodium and calcium propionate, sorbic acid, ethyl formate, and sulfur dioxide are examples of chemical substances commercially used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in foods [
 <xref rid="B150-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), tertiary butylated hydroquinone (TBHQ), propyl gallate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E) are antioxidants used as food preservatives [
 <xref rid="B150-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. However, it has also been stated that the widespread use of synthetic preservatives has led to huge ecological and medical problems, which, in addition to economic considerations, have triggered the search for new/safer strategies against microbiota spoilage [
 <xref rid="B151-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>,
 <xref rid="B152-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Due to the growing consumer demand for safe, high-quality and healthy food with reduced quantity of synthetic preservatives or antimicrobials, an increasing interest has been stated on natural antimicrobials from plants [
 <xref rid="B153-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. It has long been known that plant phytochemicals protect against viruses, bacteria, fungi and herbivores, but it has only recently been learned that they can be also used for food spoilage microorganism protection.
