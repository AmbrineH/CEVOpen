<p class="p">Mint harvesting must take place at the proper time, since harvesting timings that are too early or too late result in immature or over-mature crops, which ultimately gives poor essential oil quality and quantity [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Another important factor is the number of harvests per year, which also influences forage yield and essential oil composition [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. The crop must be harvested when plants are in full bloom, in the late morning on a dry sunny day, when all dew traces have disappeared. According to climatic conditions, one or two crop flushes are harvested. In addition, mint essential oil quality differs between first and second harvest, as does the oil content between the first and second year of
