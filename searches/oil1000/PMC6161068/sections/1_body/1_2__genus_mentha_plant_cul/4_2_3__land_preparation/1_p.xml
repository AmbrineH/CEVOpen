<p class="p">Land must be cleared with ploughing to release weeds. Mint needs thorough two cross harrowing to bring the soil to fine tilth. About 25â€“30 tons of farm yard manure (compost)/ha has to be applied as a basal dressing during the last ploughing to incorporate manure with soil. Green manure, like sun-hemp (
