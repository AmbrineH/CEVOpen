<p class="p">Despite 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> spp. plant extracts and essential oils having shown great 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antimicrobial effects against bacteria, yeasts and molds, their action can be quite different in complex environments, such as food matrices. Indeed, essential oilsâ€™ biological activity is markedly influenced by food components (e.g., fats, carbohydrates, proteins, water, salt, preservatives), temperature, pH, water activity and packaging methods [
 <xref rid="B193-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">193</xref>]. The negative impact of high protein content on essential oil activity was reported by Tassou et al. [
 <xref rid="B163-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>], who studied the effect of mint essential oils on 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> growth. The authors attributed antimicrobial activity reduction to protein content, suggesting that the phenolic group monoterpenes could bind to proteins, thereby lowering the number of antimicrobial compounds available. Cava et al. [
 <xref rid="B194-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>] tested the antimicrobial activity of mint essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in milk, and found that essential oils bioactivity was reduced by fats. Diverse studies reported that essential oils exhibited highest activity at low pH levels [
 <xref rid="B195-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>,
 <xref rid="B196-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>]. However, other parameters also affect essential oil activity, like temperature and sodium chloride. Combination of carvacrol and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene with sodium chloride (1.3 g/L) showed an antagonistic effect. On the other hand, it is well known that high sodium chloride concentration contributes to cell lysis. Going further, essential oils show better antimicrobial activity in vapor than in liquid phase [
