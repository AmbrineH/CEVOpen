<p class="p">Results obtained by Tassou et al. [
 <xref rid="B210-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>] showed that 
 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> essential oil at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.0% completely reduced 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> number in tzatziki, and markedly decreased its number in taramosalata. In the same study, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> populations showed a declining trend in a one-week storage period. However, this effect was not observed for pâté. The authors speculated that mint essential oils’ antibacterial action depends not only on essential oil concentration, but also on food product (type, pH, storage temperature) and type of spoilage microbiota. Klūga et al. [
 <xref rid="B198-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">198</xref>], reported that 
 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> leaf extract protected fish from spoilage. Also, mint extract treatment suppressed total 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. bacteria growth in mackerel. Moreover, in these food matrices, mint extract inhibited lipid oxidation, and then enhanced stability storage and extended shelf life by 2 to 5 days [

 <xref rid="B199-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>] demonstrated peppermint oil antibacterial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Acidovorax citrulli</italic>, a bacteria responsible for watermelon blotch. These results suggested the possibility of using peppermint oil as an antibacterial agent to treat contaminated seeds. In addition to that, a mint-supplemented cereal biscuit (in different forms) enriched in natural antioxidants, maintained acceptable for consumption over 5 months storage period. Polyphenols’ antioxidant efficiency prevented biscuit rancidity onset during storage; therefore, mint may be conceived of as a key substitute for synthetic antioxidants in baked food product preservation [
