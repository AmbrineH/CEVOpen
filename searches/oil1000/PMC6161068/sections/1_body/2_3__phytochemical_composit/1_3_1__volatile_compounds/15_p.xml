<p class="p">Considering 
 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> essential oil, studies showed a very high variability derived from the existence of numerous chemotypes. Barrosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] studied two different 
 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> varieties (chocolate mint and grapefruit mint varieties) and identified menthofuran, menthone 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>-neoisomenthol and pulegone as the main compounds in a chocolate mint variety, while linalyl acetate with linalool were those prevailing in a grapefruit mint variety. A commercial essential oil purchased in New Delhi (India) presented, in its chemical composition, menthol (19.1%), isomenthone (14.8%) and limonene (10.6%) as major components [

 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> essential oil collected in Serbia presented a similar composition to that collected in Morocco, with menthol, menthyl acetate and menthone as the main constituents [

 <xref rid="B128-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Menthol was also found to be the main compound present in 
 <italic class="italic">M. × piperita</italic> essential oils isolated from plant material collected in Iran, China, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and Brazil [

However, beyond menthol (up to 59.7%), high amounts of menthone, isomenthone, menthyl acetate and menthofuran were also reported. Another chemotype identified from this species is characterized by its high amount of (−)-carvone, accompanied by limonene as the second main constituent [
