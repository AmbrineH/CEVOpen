 <xref rid="B85-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] found that cultivated populations belonging to the same chemotype were characterized by the presence of pulegone as the most abundant constituent. Therefore, the studied essential oils contained in their chemical composition oxygenated monoterpenes, with pulegone being the main compound (52â€“75%), followed by isomenthone, limonene and menthone. These findings allowed authors to classify the obtained oils into two categories: (1) pulegone-rich with low isomenthone content; and (2) pulegone- and isomenthone-rich oils.
