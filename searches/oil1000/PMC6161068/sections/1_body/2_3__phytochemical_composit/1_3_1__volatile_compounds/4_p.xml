<p class="p">Some 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species present numerous chemotypes, and the distinct chemical patterns are a consequence of their specific metabolic pathways, e.g., linalool, menthol or (âˆ’)-carvone pathway [
 <xref rid="B84-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], and of their intraspecific chemical differences, e.g., chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. So far, the highest number of chemical constituents (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 82) was reported to 
 <italic class="italic">M. longifolia</italic> collected in Tajikistan [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. On the other hand, only three compounds have been identified in essential oil isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> leaves grown in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Indeed, such data markedly depend on the sensitivity of the analytical method used, besides handling, harvesting time and growth conditions.
