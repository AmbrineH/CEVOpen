<p class="p">There are a number of studies dealing with the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. longifolia</italic> essential oils from different geographical origins, showing a great degree of chemical variation, which is not surprising, bearing in mind the very high morphological diversity of this species, resulting in a high number (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 276) of subspecies, varieties and forms. The main constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. longifolia</italic> essential oil belong to oxygenated monoterpenes group, which include pulegone [
 <xref rid="B108-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>], piperitenone oxide [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>] and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B105-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Beyond these, carvone, isomenthone, borneol, menthol, menthone, piperitenone, dihydrocarvone, limonene, sabinene, α-pinene, eucalyptol, γ-terpineol, β-caryophyllene, isopulegone, cadinene and β-pinene were also recorded as meaningful compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">M. longifolia</italic> essential oil.
