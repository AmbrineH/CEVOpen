 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species belong to the family Lamiaceae and are widely distributed in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and North America [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Plants from this genus can be found in multiple and diverse environments [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Recent data, based on morphological, cytological and genetic characteristics, have shown that genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> can be classified into 42 species, 15 hybrids and hundreds of subspecies, varieties and cultivars. Indeed, mint taxonomy is highly complex and there is not always a consensus. The 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> genus is often divided into 5 sections: 
 <italic class="italic">Audibertia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eriodontes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Preslia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pulegium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Most 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species are perennial, contain essential oils, and are widely cultivated as industrial crops for essential oil production. A clear definition of an essential oil is mostly based on pharmaceutical standards. Typically, they are odorous products, with a complex composition, obtained from a botanically defined raw plant material by steam or dry distillation, or even by another suitable mechanical process without heating. The term “essential oil” comes from the sense that it contains “the essence of” the plant’s fragrance, not to be confused with its being essential for the functioning of plant cells or plant homeostasis. The main 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> oil producers are USA, India and China [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The most economically important species are 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha aquatica</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha canadensis</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> L. (spearmint) and their hybrids (including 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> L., widely known as peppermint, a sterile and first-generation hybrid between 
 <italic class="italic">M. aquatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Leaves, flowers and stems of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species have traditionally been used as herbal teas and spices in many foods to add aroma and flavor [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Fresh and dried plant material, raw extracts and essential oils of mint plants are used as a part of confectionary, as flavor enhancing agents in toothpastes, chewing gums and beverages, bakery, cosmetics, as oral hygiene products, pharmaceuticals and pesticides [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The two most popular mint flavors are due to (−)-menthol, a terpene alcohol with strong, intense and refreshing peppermint flavor, mostly obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">M. aquatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. canadensis</italic> hybrids, and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>-(-)-carvone, a terpene ketone with a typical flavor of Maghrebi mint tea or mint cocktails, obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic>. Another distinct flavor can be obtained from linalool-rich species, a terpene alcohol, for example 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> L. Also, (−)-menthol, in its pure form (extracted or synthetized), can also be used in the food and cosmetic industries. Indeed, mint species have a long history of use, and are well-known for their medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-07-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Mint species, in particular their essential oils, and even menthol have been described in distinct monographs, such as European, Japanese and Russian pharmacopoeias.
