 <p> Bray-Curtis similarity matrices underwent non-metric multidimensional scaling using the (A) untargeted and (B) targeted chemical datasets in order to visualize them. The shape and color of the points on the plots represent different species, and demonstrate clear clustering in both datasets. Numbers of samples refer to the list of materials (Table 1). </p>
