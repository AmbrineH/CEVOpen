<p class="p">Some species like 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> are common and widespread, whereas others are narrow and potentially threatened endemics (Wood and Harley, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1989</xref>; Viney et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Kahraman et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). A better understanding of the chemical composition of different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species and how their chemical diversity is affected by environmental factors such as altitude can help inform both their local medicinal use as well as conservation policies and efforts of the threatened species.
