<p class="p">We observed a geographical effect on chemical richness in the untargeted but not in the targeted dataset of

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> essential oils to vary depending on environmental factors such as altitude, water availability and soil conditions in Italy. We did not observe an effect of altitude in the present study. However, our sampling covered a wide geographical range and therefore the potential effects of altitude alone may have been confounded by sampling across multiple ranges across such large scales as the Mediterranean. Future studies may disentangle geographical and environmental effects by more intensive sampling across single or multiple altitudinal gradients. However, it should be noted that sampling from herbaria is limited by the number of specimens available in the collection and herbarium specimens are mostly collected as individual specimens rather than representing populations, which limits the prospects of comparative environmental studies.
