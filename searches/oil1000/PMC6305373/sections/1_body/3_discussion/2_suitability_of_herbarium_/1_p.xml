<p class="p">We observed a strong species effect and a weak geographical effect on terpenoid chemical composition of four 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species across the Mediterranean and no overall effect of sampling age, although two individual compounds did change with age of samples. These findings suggests that chemical composition appears to be well preserved in herbarium samples over at least 100–150 years suggesting herbarium samples can be used for chemical screening as well as for preliminary studies of pharmacological activity, which is also supported by previous studies reporting little effect of sampling age on overall chemical profiles (Eloff, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Zangerl and Berenbaum, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Yilmaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Jafari et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Herbarium samples may therefore provide an untapped resource for preliminary studies as well as for large-scale comparative surveys across taxonomical and geographical ranges. Whereas overall chemical composition appears to be well preserved over 100–150 years, the concentrations of individual compounds may be affected and we would therefore suggest herbarium samples may be well-suited for qualitative studies, whereas caution is needed in the use of herbarium samples for quantitative studies depending also on the type of compounds of interest (Rønsted et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). At a larger scale, a wide and thorough phytochemical screening of herbarium samples from all over the world could give us a better understanding also of chemotaxonomic issues, and comparison with climatic data would allow for testing of long-term environmental impact.
