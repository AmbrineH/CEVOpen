<p class="p">In the present study of herbarium specimens, we observed a significant species effect using both a targeted and an untargeted approach. Variation in study design including the number of compounds, geographical origin of samples, samples per species, and plant parts analyzed, makes it difficult to directly compare our findings with the literature. However, in general the number and amount of compounds as well as the main individual chemical compounds found in the present study are also reflected in the literature confirming that the species profiles we observe across 150-years of herbarium specimens are comparable to modern samples.</p>
