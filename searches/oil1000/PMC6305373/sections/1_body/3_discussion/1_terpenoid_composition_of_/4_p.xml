<p class="p">Among 108 volatile compounds across 45 Turkish 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species (Hatipoglu et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), both total yield and percentage of individual compounds were highly variable between species. α-pinene, camphene, β-pinene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, and borneol were the main chemical markers of monoterpene rich species, whereas β-caryophyllene, germacrene-D, β-bisabolene, bicyclogermacrene, caryophyllene oxide, and spathulenol were the main chemical markers in sesquiterpene rich species. In summary, several studies of essential oil components of different 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species have reported presence of a huge range of compounds, many in trace amounts, and other consistently present in higher amounts in specific species.
