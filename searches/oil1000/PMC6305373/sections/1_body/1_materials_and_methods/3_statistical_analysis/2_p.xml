<p class="p">One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test for significant differences in untargeted chemical richness between species. Meanwhile, mixed linear modeling (MLM) was performed using the lmer function from the package lme4 (Bates et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In these, the significance of random effects (altitude and geography (as PCNM1 and PCNM2) were determined using the drop1 function, which performed likelihood ratio tests (chi-square), whilst accounting for variation associated with the random effect (species).
