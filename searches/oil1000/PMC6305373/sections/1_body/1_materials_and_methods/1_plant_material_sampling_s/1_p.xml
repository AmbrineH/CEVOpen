<p class="p">As a case study, we selected three Iranian medicinal 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species, which are all locally rare, and exhibiting a diversity of distributional and altitudinal ranges (Jafari Foutami and Akbarlou, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). For each of the four species we attempted to sample across the geographical distribution of the species. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia sclarea</italic> L. (clary sage; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10) is native to the Northern Mediterranean but has also become a weed outside its native range including North America, where it is called European sage (Ghani et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Dickinson and Royer, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia multicaulis</italic> Vahl (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">S. acetabulosa</italic> L.; 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 8) is native to Turkey and bordering countries (Tepe et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia aethiopis</italic> L. (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 4) is naturally occurring in the Northern Mediterranean but has become a noxious weed in North America, where it is referred to as Mediterranean sage (Chalchat et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Dickinson and Royer, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, we included 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 12) allowing for comparison with extensive literature and verified reference material adhering to the European Pharmacopeia standards (Council of Europe, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
