<p class="p">GC-MS chromatograms were processed using PARADISe, a PARAFAC2 based deconvolution and identification system for direct analysis of complex raw GC-MS data (Johnsen et al.,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S2</xref>). Triplicates were averaged and a number of samples did not have triplicates due to sample failure (sample 1, 2, 28, and 30). Compounds with retention times between Î±-Pinene (8.3 min) and Camphor (28.4 min) were retained for further analysis and compounds with zero or negative values were excluded.
