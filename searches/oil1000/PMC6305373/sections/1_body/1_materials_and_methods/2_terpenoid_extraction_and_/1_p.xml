<p class="p">Twenty-Five Milligram leaf material was ground using a mortar and pestle under liquid N2 and transferred to a vial (Supelco, Pennsylvania, USA). Seven Hundred Microliter analytical grade hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark) was added, the sample was vortexed for 10 s and then incubated on a shaker at 37°C for 2 h. Samples were then vortexed again for 10 s and left for 24 h to allow tissue to settle. Approximately 200 μL of the hexane extract was transferred into a weighed glass GC vial with a limited volume insert and kept at −20°C until GC-MS analysis. The remainder of the sample was left uncapped at 65°C until the solvent was evaporated. Vials were reweighed to obtain the dry mass of leaf material. Samples were analyzed in triplicate.</p>
