 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ≥ 0.886 for individual compounds). The set of standards included monoterpene hydrocarbons (α-Pinene, Camphene, β-Pinene, β-Myrcene, β-Cymene, β-Phellandrene, Limonene, Terpinolene, 3-Carene, α-Ocimene, γ-Terpinene, Aromandendrene), oxygenated monoterpenes (Linalool, Camphor, Borneol, Bornyl acetate, Eucalyptol), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (Aromadendrene, β-Caryophyllene, Humulene, Nerolidol).
