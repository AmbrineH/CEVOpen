<p class="p">Commercially available pure chemical certified reference material standards of common 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> constituents (Russo et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hatipoglu et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Craft et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Purity of the commercial standards was not investigated experimentally and the approach does therefore not guarantee no degradation of the standards could have happened. However, for the targeted approach, all samples were analyzed using the same standards.
