<p class="p">GC–MS analyses were carried out using an Agilent 6890N Gas Chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless injector (200°C), a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm), and coupled with an Agilent 5975 MS Detector (MSD), operating in the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The carrier gas was helium (1.0 mL/min), and the oven temperature was programmed to increase from 60°C to 280°C at a rate of 3°C/min. The injected volume was 2 μL.</p>
