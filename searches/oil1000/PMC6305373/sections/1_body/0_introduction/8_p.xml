<p class="p">In this work, we tested the suitability of using herbarium specimens in plant chemical studies by assessing targeted and untargeted chemical variation of four 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species. Samples ranged from modern collections to 150 year old herbarium collections. We had three main objectives. (1) Our first objective was to investigate whether we could observe significant chemical variation between 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species using herbarium specimens, and compare the results to other studies that have used modern material. (2) Our second objective was to investigate age effects on 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> chemical variation, testing for changes in chemical composition and diversity associated with increasing sample age. (3) Our final objective was to assess whether herbarium specimens could be used in answering ecological questions on 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> chemical composition variation and diversity across altitudes and geographical regions in the four 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> species.
