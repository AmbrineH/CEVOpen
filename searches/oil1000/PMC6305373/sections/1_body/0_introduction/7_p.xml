<p class="p">Plant specialized metabolites are selected through evolution for their biological activities and express some degree of phylogenetic clustering of different compound classes (e.g., Hegnauer, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1962–1973</xref>; Ehrlich and Raven, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1964</xref>; Rønsted et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, natural variation in plant chemical composition is common and attributed to both biotic (e.g., herbivory and microorganisms) and abiotic environmental conditions as well as potentially differential local chemotypes (Wink, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Moore et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The relative importance of different drivers of chemical diversity is an outstanding puzzle, but recent attention has focused on altitude as an explanatory parameter (Russo et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Mahzooni-Kachapi et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Senica et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Pandey et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). In addition to abiotic components, correlation of chemical variation with altitude is hypothesized to be related to variable biotic pressure from herbivory and microbial communities (Abdala-Roberts et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Maldonado et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Pandey et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Herbarium collections along with their associated data can provide specimens of verified geographical and altitudinal origin for further studies.
