<p class="p">As the technical difficulties of extracting high quality DNA from historical materials are being overcome (Bieker and Martin, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), herbarium materials are also increasingly being used in genomic studies at all scales, from populations to phylogenies (Kuzmina et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Bieker and Martin, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>) as well as to study domestication history (da Fonseca et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) or plant pathogens (Yoshida et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
