<p class="p">However, the exploration of herbarium material for plant metabolite data is comparably understudied and the reliability of chemical data from herbarium samples is uncertain due to the expectation that plant specialized metabolites may not be well-preserved over longer time scales. Whereas alkaloids for example are generally considered highly stable (Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Dewick, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Yilmaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), low molecular weight terpenoids tend to be both volatile and thermolabile and may be easily oxidized or hydrolyzed altering the chemical composition of the plant material dependent on the conditions during processing and storage of the plant material (Turek and Stinzing,
