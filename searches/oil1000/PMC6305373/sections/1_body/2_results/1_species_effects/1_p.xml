<p class="p">After quality filtering a total of 285 compounds were within the untargeted dataset (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S2</xref>). Nearly all samples contained detectable levels of the majority of compounds, with untargeted chemical richness varying from 249 to 283 between samples, with no clear effect of species on the richness (ANOVA; df = 3, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value = 1.16, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = 0.338). However, the untargeted chemical composition demonstrated clear clustering in the nMDS plot (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>), which proved highly significant (MGLM-ANOVA; Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
