<p class="p">Within the targeted dataset, samples varied from 14 to 20 in the number of the 20 compounds analyzed, strongly differed between species (ANOVA; df = 3, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value = 29.95, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = &lt;0.001), with 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia multicaulis</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> and
