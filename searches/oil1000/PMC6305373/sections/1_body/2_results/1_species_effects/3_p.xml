<p class="p">Within the targeted dataset, 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. multicaulis</italic> consistently contained significantly higher concentrations when compared to the other two species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). For example, borneol was the most abundant compound, ranging from 172 to 96,234 ng/μL, and were significantly higher in 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> (31,954 μg/g) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. multicaulis</italic> (21,964 μg/g) than averages in 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> (436 μg/g), and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aethiopis</italic> (675 μg/g) (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). p-cymene was the second most abundant compound that was also concentrated in 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> (11,559 μg/g) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. multicaulis</italic> (6,774 μg/g) when compared to 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> (51 ng/μL) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aethiopis</italic> (47 μg/g). Whilst camphor was present in lower abundance than borneol and p-cymene in 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> (8291 μg/g) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. multicaulis</italic> (5,273 μg/g), it was also present in comparable quantitates in 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic> (3,246 μg/g) and in two of the five 
 <italic class="italic">S. aethiopis</italic> samples (average 2,696 μg/g). Terpinolene was also in abundance within 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> (2,387 μg/g) whilst being almost absent from the other species. The other 15 compounds were present in relatively low amounts across all samples.
