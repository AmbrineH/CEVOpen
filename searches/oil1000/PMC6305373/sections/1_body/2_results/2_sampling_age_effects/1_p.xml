<p class="p">Given the confirmation of species effects on plant chemical composition, we next investigated age effects on the chemical composition. PERMANOVAs for both the targeted and untargeted datasets did not demonstrate a significant age effect on chemistry (PERMANOVA; Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). There were no significant effects of age of sample on either targeted or untargeted chemical richness (MLM; Untargeted χ
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 3.79, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = 0.051 and targeted χ
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 0.07, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = 0.787). Two individual compounds significantly declined in concentration over time (MLM; Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), α-phellandrene (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5A</xref>), which was a very minor constituent, and camphor that was present in all four species (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5B</xref>). Total amount of the compounds in the targeted dataset also significantly declined over time (MLM; χ
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 4.11, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = 0.042) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5C</xref>).
