<p class="p">In the present study, freshly collected and herbarium samples of four species of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> were used to explore the effect of sampling age on terpenoid chemical profiles. Our results show that chemical profiles are primarily driven by a species effect and to a lesser extent geography. 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia multicaulis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. officinalis</italic> displayed higher abundance of most compounds than 
 <italic class="italic">S. aethiopis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. sclarea</italic>. Sampling age had no effect on overall chemical composition in the untargeted approach, and only a slight effect in the untargeted dataset. Two of twenty targeted compounds, Î±-phellandrene, and camphor, significantly declined with sampling year.
