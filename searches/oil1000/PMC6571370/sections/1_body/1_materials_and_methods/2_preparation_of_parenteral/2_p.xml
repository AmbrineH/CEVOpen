<p class="p">All new admixtures were prepared, at the Hospital Pharmacy Unit under aseptic conditions using the automated admixing device Baxa EM2400 (Baxa Corporation, Englewood), supported by the PN calculator Abacus version 3.1. The following commercially available sterile and apyrogenic solutions were used: Aminomel Nephro 6% (Baxter, Poland), glucose 50% (Baxter Healthcare Ltd.), ClinOleic 20% (Baxter), water for injection (Baxter), sodium chloride 10% (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany), potassium chloride 15% (Fresenius Kabi AB, Sweden), magnesium sulfate 20% (Polpharma, Poland), calcium chlorate 10% (WZF, Poland), Glycophos (organic phosphate containing solution of sodium glycerophosphate, Fresenius Kabi AB), Nutryelt (trace elements, Baxter), and Cernevit (vitamins, Baxter). All components were mixed as all-in-one admixtures (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) into the final delivery container (Baxa multilayer bag). Admixtures were prepared in 2 different series; in each, 2 bags were collected and transported under a controlled temperature of 2°C to 8°C for subsequent analysis. Diuretics: Furosemide Kabi Injection (10 mg/mL, Fresenius Kabi, Germany) and Trifas 20 Injection (5 mg/mL, Berlin-Chemie, Germany) solutions had been prepared as an infusion just before analysis. Infusion stability was demonstrated for 24 h at room temperature in plastic containers with 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride (B. Braun) in various concentrations (Table
