<p class="p">The physical stability of parenteral admixtures was assessed by visual inspection: a lipid droplet measured in a light biologic microscope with a camera (B1 223A Motic, Wetzlar, Germany) with an upper droplet size of ≥1 μm. Each microscopic sample (10 μL by a manual pipette) was analyzed with 40-fold magnification. Five individual visual fields were inspected per microscopic sample (15 total visual fields/aliquot): 4 in the corner and 1 in the middle of the preparation. The size of the lipid droplets in the visual field was determined using an ocular micrometer (0.01 mm). The diameter of the largest lipid droplet was measured and counted in each of the 15 visual fields tested per aliquot.</p>
