<p class="p">Samples were subjected to an established panel of methods and acceptance criteria to assess physical incompatibility in terms of potential precipitation or emulsion destabilization. Samples were tested within 5 min after mixing and again after 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h. The first test point is referred to as “5 min.” As an additional check, analyses were also performed after 24 h. Samples with drugs were compared with the control—pure PN admixture stored up to 8 days.</p>
