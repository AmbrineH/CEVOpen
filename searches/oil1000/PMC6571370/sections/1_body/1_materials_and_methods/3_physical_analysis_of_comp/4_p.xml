<p class="p">The droplet size of emulsions was determined using photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), which covers a size range of 20 to 5000 nm (Zetasizer Nano ZS, model ZEN 3600, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Each sample was determined in triplicate at 25°C. Data are shown in terms of effective mean diameter (Z-average) and the polydispersity index, which reflects the width of the particle size distribution. The second technique was laser diffractometry (MasterSizer E, Malvern Instruments). All results were calculated according to the Mie theory. The dispersions were characterized by their volume diameters D50, D90, and Dmax which means 50% and 90% or all of the particles are below the given size. The charge on the emulsion droplets was measured at 25°C using the moving boundary electrophoresis technique (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments). Electrophoretic mobility was converted into zeta potential using the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski equation. Twelve readings were recorded for each sample. The pH values of all parenteral admixtures were determined at 25°C (pH meter type 350, Orion-Research, Boston, MA) with a combined electrode (Type ERH-11, Hydromet, Warsaw, Poland). Before each pH measurement, a 2-point calibration of the pH meter was performed, each with a buffer solution of pH 9.00 and pH 4.00, respectively. The pH 7.00 solution was used afterwards as a control. Between the calibration steps, the electrode was rinsed with distilled water and wiped dry. Each sample was measured after 5 min of equilibration.</p>
