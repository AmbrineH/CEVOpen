<p class="p">To simulate the mixing in the Y-site (dynamic method), different infusion rates of PN (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and the drugs (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) were calculated based on the clinical experience and finally, the Y-site administration was realized. In static methods, the mixing ratios of PN and the drugs in the infusion line were calculated and finally 180 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) admixture and 11 mL of drug solution was mixed in 1 container. After 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h samples were taken for testing. All analyses were referred to the parenteral admixture without any drugs.
