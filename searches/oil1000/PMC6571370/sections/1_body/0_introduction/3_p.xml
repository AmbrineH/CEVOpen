<p class="p">The purpose of this work was to obtain compatibility data for 2 loop diuretics—furosemide and torasemide as well as PN admixtures administered to home CKD patients. We created a new stable parenteral formulation with a special composition to reduce renal failure, taking into account metabolic differences in patients. The study used increasing drug concentrations up to the maximum, thus mimicking the range of concentrations and infusion rates that might be relevant for Y-site administration, up to 24 h. This is an approach to extend the experimental area, which is especially important in the clinical practice for HPN therapy in CKD patients. The focus of this study was to assess the physical compatibility of loop diuretics and parenteral admixtures intended for CKD patients.</p>
