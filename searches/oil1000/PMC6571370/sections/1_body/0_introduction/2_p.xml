<p class="p">Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a huge challenge for nutritional support because it is complicated.

 </sup> The requirements for such patients are quite different from the standard composition of multichamber bags (MCB) and customized formulas that are typically indicated for them. In the clinical practice of our hospital, there was a need to create new stable parenteral formulations with a special composition to reduce the progression of renal insufficiency through the reduction of proteinuria and by the correction of metabolic differences.

 </sup> The modalities of nutritional treatment have been focused on protein and calorific intake, electrolyte balance, and demand for fluids. The composition of new admixtures was proposed. The calculated amount of amino acid was 0.6 g per kg of body weight, the daily energy intake was 20 nonprotein kcal per kg, the electrolyte intake could be individually determined in terms of 0 to 3 mmol per kg of sodium and potassium, 0 to 0.3 mmol per kg of magnesium and calcium, and 0 to 0.9 mmol per kg of phosphate. Volume intake was estimated as 60 mL per kg because of diuretic therapy (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). If a patient receives a continuous infusion of parenteral nutrition (PN), it might be beneficial to coadminister loop diuretics and PN. In practice, 2 methods are used to administer drugs with PN admixtures: simultaneous Y-site infusion or inclusion in the PN admixture. The first method consists of an intermittent infusion of drugs with parenteral nutrition admixture in simultaneous Y-site administration. The PN admixture is used as a vehicle for introducing the drugs into the patient. In this method, the contact time between drugs and parenteral admixture can range from 10 min to 12 h. In the second method, the drugs are mixed together with the PN admixture. The period of co-infusion in the second method is the same as the Y-site administration, usually up to 24 h. However, this method requires the physicochemical stability of PN admixtures in the presence of drugs as well as chemical stability data. The second method is not usual in daily clinical practice for these reasons. PN admixtures are complex formulations with limited stability; therefore, stability tests are required in order to ensure the efficacy and safety of HPN with an extended shelf life. Lipid emulsions are the most unstable components of PN admixtures due to the risk of obstructing pulmonary arterioles as well as emboli.

 </sup> Before adding any drug to PN admixtures or even delivering it by simultaneous Y-site infusion, its physicochemical stability must be reviewed in order to maintain the stability of the PN admixture, especially lipid emulsion (avoiding emulsion breaking, creaming, or drug precipitation) and in order to obtain safe therapy. In clinical practice, pharmacists are frequently consulted about the administration of drugs via PN admixtures but there is a lack of information about the compatibility of some drugs due to the high variability in PN admixture composition. There are many articles about the stability of furosemide with PN admixtures but nothing about using torasemide with PN admixtures. However, there are many studies on furosemide in literature. In our hospital, we cannot guarantee identical working conditions, so we need compatibility studies with PN admixtures dedicated to our patients.
