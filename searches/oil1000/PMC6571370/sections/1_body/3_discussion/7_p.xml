<p class="p">The loop diuretics chosen in this study, furosemide and torasemide, are the most commonly used drugs in CKD HPN patients.
 <sup class="sup">[

 </sup> Both drugs have the same mechanism of action. Nevertheless, differences in the chemical structure cause these drugs to have different pharmacokinetic properties. Torasemide, in comparison with furosemide, works faster because it has higher bioavailability, it acts longer, has high protein binding, and dosing is less frequent than furosemide because it has a longer half-life.

  <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>–
  <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]
 </sup> Furosemide is used at a dose of 40 to 200 mg daily, dependent upon the response and extracellular fluid volume as well as the frequency determined by specific clinical needs. The equivalent doses of torasemide are from 20 to 100 mg daily. In HPN the effect of oral drugs may be altered due to inadequate gastrointestinal absorption therefore the parenteral administration of diuretics may be required in CKD patient. Where possible, these should be given separately from the TPN solution (intermittently with sufficient rinsing) or adding the medications via a multilumen catheter or via a Y-site connection only if sufficient proof of stability is reported.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]
 </sup> Intravenous bolus doses of diuretics rapidly increases sodium excretion especially for the first hours and then it progressively declines. Also the peak natriuretic effect with the next doses is less than the first one. Postdiuretic renal sodium and fluid retention are inevitable. This compensatory sodium retention are not related to loop diuretics and to avoid this effects, loop diuretics should be injected at short intervals or infused continuously.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]
 </sup> The multilumen catheter ensures minimal contact time between the drugs and the TPN solution and hence reduces the risk of incompatibility.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]
 </sup> Nevertheless, according to ESPEN Guidelines, multilumen catheters are not recommended in HPN patients in order to minimize the risk of infection. Usually tunneled, monolumen, central catheters are used as permanent access in HPN patients.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]
 </sup> Ideally, the lumen intended for administration of TPN should not be used in addition to further drugs, but this may not be possible in case of HPN patients with CKD. HPN admixture infusion takes usually about 12 h, so simultaneous administration of loop diuretics is required. The Y-site connection has become a necessity, but little information on the compatibility of drugs during Y-site administration with TPN solutions are known.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]
 </sup> Only the compatibility of furosemide has been tested and previously reported with TPN solutions.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]
 </sup> However, the value of these reports is limited because it cannot be extrapolated to different admixtures composition or drug concentrations. The compatibility of torasemide with PN admixtures has never been performed in any previous study. Diuretics may affect the stability of TPN admixtures as well as TPN admixtures also increasing the risk of unionized drug precipitation. The factor indicating stability is the pH. The pH decreases over time in PN admixtures because of the hydrolysis of fat triglycerides. Additional chemical reactions yielding base or acidic products also affect the pH. For the lipid stability and lecithin emulsifier, a pH range of 5 to 8 is necessary. The negatively charged surface (phosphate moiety) prevents the coalescence of lipid globules. A pH below 5.0 favors lipid instabilities. However, furosemide and torasemide injections are a buffered alkaline solution with a pH of about 9. In our study, there was only a slightly increased pH with a contact reaction with drugs because the TPN admixture possesses a large buffer capacity.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]
 </sup> On the other hand, at pH values below 7, precipitation of the unionized drugs upon mixing with the less alkaline TPN may occur.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]
 </sup> The pH of all tested TPN formulations has a value under 7. Therefore, conducting compatibility considerations for newly tailored admixtures for HPN CKD patients and diuretics was essential. The purpose was to generate sufficient data to improve the safety of Y-site administration of loop diuretics with the PN. The major limitation of the present study is that the results are based on physical reactions and the medication concentration was not determined. However, there is a tendency toward a short contact time between solutions administered through a Y-site, so the chemical incompatibility of ingredients is less relevant.
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]
 </sup> Therefore, the present study was designed to simulate Y-site administration in the worst case of administration and check physical incompatibility as an increase in size and/or the number of particles and/or an increase in lipid droplet size, both as compared to the original, nonmixed samples of TPN (Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In addition, the results were confirmed statically inspired by the method used by Trissel et al
 <sup class="sup">[
  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]
 </sup> The worst case means that the contact time is the longest and the drug concentration is highest. The calculated rate and usual concentrations of solutions implemented were selected after consultations with physicians and were presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL was used as drugs diluent. In the presented study, the worst case was connected with Admixture number 1 (the slowest rate of administration—150 mL/h) and furosemide solution in concentration 0.9 mg/mL as well as torasemide in concentration 0.45 mg/mL. The present study confirms some data already published for furosemide

  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,

 </sup> and provides new data for torasemide and PN because torasemide has not been tested before. Although results for furosemide are similar to a previous study using the TPN admixture with nephro amino acid solution is novel. According to this data, we can predict that all solutions of furosemide up to 0.9 mg/mL and torasemide up to 0.45 mg/mL can be compatible with presented PN composition. However, it should be born in mind that extrapolation of results for another PN composition can be difficult and risky.
