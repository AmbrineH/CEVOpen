<p class="p">Another issue determining the efficacy and safety of HPN in CKD patients is the long-term stability of any proposed PN admixture. Both precipitates and large oil droplets can potentially be dangerous upon infusion, with the potential to lead to pulmonary emboli.

 </sup> The simple light microscope method used in the study is highly sensitive and practical, and it is verified by PCS and the Coulter method. Use of a light microscope facilitates the detection of particles approximately 1 μm in size or enlarged particles up to 100 μm in size. A pure (without drugs) investigated PN admixture was stable up to 8 days at 2°C to 8°C and 24 h at 25°C.
