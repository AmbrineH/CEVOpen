<p class="p">A crucial aspect of nutrition during CKD is the amount of energy supply because during protein restriction, a neutral or positive nitrogen balance requires high energy intake to prevent protein degradation, negative nitrogen balance, and loss of lean body mass.

 </sup> Generally, the energy requirement in nondialyzed, CKD patients should not be different from normal energy expenditure.

 </sup> The composition of MCB is far removed from the protein/energy requirements of CKD patients. It is not possible to provide sufficient energy intake and low dosage of amino acids at the same time with MCB bags.
