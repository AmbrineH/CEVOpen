 </sup> 0.6â€Šg of amino acids per kg of body weight was prepared in a new TPN formula. Previous studies showed that low dosages of amino acid are nutritionally safe and provide neutral or slightly positive nitrogen and, concurrently, that patients with advanced stage CKD can fully adapt to low protein regimens.
