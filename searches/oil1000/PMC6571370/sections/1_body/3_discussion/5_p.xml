<p class="p">In this study, 20 nonprotein kcal per kg of body weight was calculated per 0.6â€Šg of amino acids, with 70% of energy derived from glucose and the remaining 30% from lipids. This amount of energy meets the normal energy requirements of HPN patients, but the formulation is unique in comparison with MCB bags which supply significantly higher energy levels. Electrolyte content can be problematic in patients with renal failure, where hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia may occur initially in the course of a disease and can be significantly influenced by diuretic drugs.

 </sup> Electrolyte intake should be determined on an individual basis in patients with renal failure and consequently, the range may be larger. As such, the novel formulations described here were assessed across the full range (Table
