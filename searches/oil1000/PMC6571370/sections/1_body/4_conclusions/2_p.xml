<p class="p">The physical compatibility of 2 loop diuretics, furosemide, as well as torasemide, and a new PN admixture intended for home-treated CKD patients were proved. The increasing concentration of both drugs up to the most extreme mixing ratios estimated between the given drugs and TPN admixtures in the infusion lines were tested. No incompatibilities were found for both diuretics and the proposed composition of the TPN admixture of furosemide and torasemide were compatible with the PN admixture up to 24â€Šh under the applied test conditions. Employing several methods capturing various indicators of incompatibility combined with a range of mixing concentration of tested diuretics ensure efficient and safe therapy. The results are valuable in PN practice for CKD patients. It allows obtaining maximum benefits, minimizing risks, and reducing the progression of renal insufficiency, especially during HPN. It is worth noting that any change of the composition of proposed PN admixture as well as a concentration of the above tested drugs requires new compatibility studies.</p>
