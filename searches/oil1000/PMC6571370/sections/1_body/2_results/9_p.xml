<p class="p">The pH value in complete TPN admixtures formulated without the drugs was pH 6.50. The addition of both drugs led to an increase in pH, specifically, in the range of 6.97 to 7.09. Compared to t = 0, the pH in drug-containing admixtures did not change (±0.05 of units) during the 24 h of contact with both drugs (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). There were no significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; .05) for both drug types and the contact time.
