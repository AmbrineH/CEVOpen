<p class="p">All results obtained on the lipid emulsion stability after mixing drugs with the PN admixture are summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>. None of the PN admixtures showed signs of reduced emulsion stability after mixing with any of the drugs in any of the mixed concentrations. Compared with the unmixed controls (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), all physical parameters remained in the same order of magnitude and all were well below the acceptance criteria to be stable and safe.
