<p class="p">Using laser diffractometry, the median (d
 <sub class="sub">0.5</sub>) size of oily droplets of the complete TPN admixtures with drugs was 310 ± 10 nm and 90% of oily droplets (d
 <sub class="sub">0.9</sub>) were under 560 ± 20 nm. No oily globules larger than 1.23 μm were detected in any of the admixtures using the laser diffractometry method (Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In comparison with the parenteral admixture without the drugs, there were no statistical differences (
