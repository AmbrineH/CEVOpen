<p class="p">Under microscopic observation, despite the presence of furosemide as well as torasemide, the mean of the largest lipid droplet in μm out of 15 visual fields of 5 μm as the upper limit value for the emulsion stability was never reached by any sample over all analyses periods. The mean value of the larger oily globules was about 2 μm. There were no statistically differences (
