<p class="p">Using PCS, the obtained Z-average of the oil droplet size was approximately 250 nm and the index of polydispersity was very narrow (0.160), thereby indicating that all samples were exceptionally monodisperse (Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The size of oily droplets was in the same range (
