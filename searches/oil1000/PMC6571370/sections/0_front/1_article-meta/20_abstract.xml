 <p class="p">In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the design of the parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen becomes more challenging where only individualized PN is appropriate, coupled with the increased risk of unintended interactions with diuretic therapy. In an effort to ensure safe therapy in the home, we assessed the physical stability of bespoke PN formulations intended for use in CKD in the simultaneous presence of Y-site compatibility of furosemide and torasemide. The patient's daily needs were determined based on both metabolic demands as well as the demand for fluids.</p>
 <p class="p">Complete admixtures were subjected to physical stability analysis consisting of visual inspection, a validated light microscope method, pH measurement, zeta potential measurement, and characterization of oily globule size distribution. Y-site compatibility of furosemide and torasemide with the formulated admixtures was also performed.</p>
 <p class="p">The total parenteral admixture was stable over 7 days at +4°C and 24 h at +25°C and compatible via the Y-line together with furosemide and torasemide over 12 h at +25°C.</p>
 <p class="p">The stability assessment guarantees the safety and efficiency of home PN with loop diuretics therapy in CKD patients. This means that these patients do not need long hospitalization and they can be safely treated at home. Furthermore, this study proved that torasemide is the same safety diuretic as furosemide, which has a great impact on clinical practice.</p>
