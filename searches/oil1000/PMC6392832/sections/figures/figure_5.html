 <p> Functional properties of RSP recovered from different EAE treatments. (A) Protein solubility; (B) Emulsifying property; (C) Foaming property. Bars with different letters in the same group indicate statistical difference ( p &lt; 0.05, Duncan's test). EAE, enzyme‐assisted aqueous extraction; EAI, emulsifying activity index; ESI, emulsifying stability index; FC, foaming capacity; FS, foaming stability; RSP, recovered skim protein </p>
