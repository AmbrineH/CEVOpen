<p class="p">Pressure‐driven membrane processes, particularly ultrafiltration (UF), are separation techniques that are currently utilized in biotechnology, food processing, and pharmaceutical industry (Daufin et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Being regarded as an efficient, non‐destructive, and environmental‐friendly technology, UF has been successfully applied to fractionate, purify, or concentrate valuable components from various complex process streams (Rana, Matsuura, &amp; Sourirajan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Recent investigations have shown that UF is effective in recovering proteins (protein hydrolysates) from soy processing effluents (Cassini, Tessaro, Marczak, &amp; Pertile, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), dairy by‐products (Das, Sarkar, Sarkar, Bhattacharjee, &amp; Bhattacharjee, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and marine‐source wastewaters (Benhabiles et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), among others. However, to our knowledge, only two studies have previously utilized UF to recover skim protein from EAE of soybeans (Campbell &amp; Glatz, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; de Moura, Campbell, de Almeida, Glatz, &amp; Johnson, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and only Protex 6L was applied for enzymatic hydrolysis. However, information on the performance of UF to recover skim protein extracted with different proteases is still unknown. Additionally, impact of EAE process on protein quality and functionality needs to be explored, to further identify applications of the protein products. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate the efficiency of UF to recover skim protein from SF under different EAE treatments. Four commonly reported microbial proteases in EAE of soybeans (Flavourzyme, Alcalase 2.4L, Protex 7L, and Protex 6L) were utilized, and a stirring‐assisted dead‐end UF module was applied. Moreover, the impact of different extraction processes on the nutritional value and functional properties of the recovered protein was studied.
