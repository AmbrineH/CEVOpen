<p class="p">Solvent extraction using hexane is the most commonly used method to extract oil from oil‐bearing seeds. However, the use of organic solvent leads to substantial safety and environmental issues, including risks of fire and explosion, health hazards to the human body, and contamination to the environment (Yusoff, Gordon, &amp; Niranjan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The increasing concerns about the use of this volatile organic solvent resulted in hexane oil extraction, an energy‐intensive and operation‐complex process to overcome these problems (Campbell et al.,
