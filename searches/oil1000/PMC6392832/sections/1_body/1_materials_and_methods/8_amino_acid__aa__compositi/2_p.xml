<p class="p">Recovered skim protein from different EAE processes was analyzed for their AA composition. 25 mg sample was hydrolyzed in 10 ml of 6 M HCl under vacuum at 110°C for 24 hr. The acid was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 67 mM trisodium citrate‐HCl buffer (pH 2.2). The mixture was filtered through a 0.22‐μm filter, and 20 μl filtrate was injected into an automatic AA analyzer (Hitachi L‐8800, Tokyo, Japan). Cation‐exchange separation of the AAs was performed according to the method of Mišurcová et al. (
