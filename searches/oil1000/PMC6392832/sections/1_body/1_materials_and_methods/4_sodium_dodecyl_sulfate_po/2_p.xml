<p class="p">Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed to characterize the proteins in SF extracted with different proteases. The samples were diluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by heating in boiling water for 5 min. After that, aliquots of 10 μl of each sample were loaded into a 4%–15% gradient gel (35 μg protein/well) and run at 120 V for 2 hr. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 5% ethanol in DI water. Gel image was captured using a Gel Doc
