<p class="p">Molecular weight distribution of SF and corresponding RSP was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography. An ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare), equipped with a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), was used. The samples were dissolved in DI water (1 mg/ml) and filtered through a 0.45‐μm filter. Five hundred microliter filtrate was then loaded into the column and eluted with 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl (pH 6.8) (de Moura et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, and the detection wavelength was set at 214 nm. Data collection was performed using the Unicorn Software (Version 5.01; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The MW range of each sample was calculated based on the calibration curve of the MW standards.
