<p class="p">Prior to EAE, the moisture content of the soybean flakes was adjusted to 14.5% by mixing the flakes with water in a mixer (model T20, K‐TRON AG, Hillenbrand, France). The moistured soybean flakes were then extruded in a twin‐screw extruder (25 mm screw diameter, Evolum 25, Clextral, Firminy, France) at a consistent screw rotation speed of 300 rpm. The extruder barrel (800 mm length) was composed of six heating modules operated at 30‐50‐70‐80‐80‐80°C. The extrudates were collected and cooled to room temperature for subsequent extraction.</p>
