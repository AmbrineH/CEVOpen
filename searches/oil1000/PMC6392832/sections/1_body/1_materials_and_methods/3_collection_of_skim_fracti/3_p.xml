<p class="p">Enzyme‐assisted aqueous extraction of soybeans was conducted according to the parameters in our previous work (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Briefly, the soybean extrudates were ground, sieved, and blended with deionized (DI) water at a solid‐to‐liquid ratio of 1:6 (w/v). Four commonly used microbial proteases, Flavourzyme, Alcalase 2.4L, Protex 7L, and Protex 6L, were added into the slurries at a dosage of 2.0% (v/w, on dry weight of ground soybean extrudate), respectively. The pH and temperature were maintained within the optimal range of each enzyme throughout the process according to the suppliers. At the end of reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by heating the slurry in boiling water for 15 min. After centrifugation at 8,000
