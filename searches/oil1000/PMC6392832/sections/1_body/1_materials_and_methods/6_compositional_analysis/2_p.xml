The soluble mono‐ and oligosaccharides were analyzed by HPLC (Waters e2695; Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector. 0.3 ml of SF or recovered skim protein (RSP) solution (1 mg/ml, in DI water) was mixed with 0.7 ml of acetonitrile to precipitate the proteins. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000

An isocratic elution system using 75% acetonitrile and 0.2% trimethylamine in DI water was conducted. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, and the column temperature was set at 45°C. The peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with external standards and quantified by external calibration curves.
