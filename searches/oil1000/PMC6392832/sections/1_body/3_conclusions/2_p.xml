<p class="p">Application of UF in this study demonstrated its possibility to recover high‐quality protein from the liquid fraction of EAE of soybeans. Results showed that the membrane with the MWCO of 5 kDa exhibited better filtration performance, as it had higher permeate fluxes and lower impurity rejections. An overall protein rejection of 80.18%–90.61% was obtained using the 5‐kDa membrane, with high purities of 72.60%–82.36% obtained in the retentates. The recovered proteins contained all the necessary AAs, while consisting reduced levels of soybean anti‐nutritional factors. Enzymatic hydrolysis improved protein solubility of the recovered proteins but decreased their emulsifying and foaming properties. These results suggest that UF can be an effective way to recover high value‐added skim protein from EAE of soybeans. However, since undesirable flux reduction was observed during the filtration, more effective anti‐fouling and membrane cleaning methods are still expected.</p>
