Overall, proteins with MW &gt;17 kDa accounted for approximately 90% in all SF, of which the fractions within MW of 17–44 kDa accounted for the largest proportion. Alcalase 2.4L showed the strongest hydrolyzing ability, as indicated by the highest percentage of the proteins within MW of 17–44 kDa (83.27 ± 0.75%). Comparably, Campbell and Glatz (

After filtration, the MW profiles of RSP exhibited various changes. Specifically, the 44–158 kDa fraction was increased in RSP

Non‐significant changes in contents of the 17–44 kDa fraction were observed among the four treatments before and after UF. However, since the membranes we used cannot retain short‐chain peptides, the fraction with MW &lt;1.35 kDa was completely diminished in all resulting retentates.
