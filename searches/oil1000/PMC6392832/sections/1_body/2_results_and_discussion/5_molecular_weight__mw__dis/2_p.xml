<p class="p">In order to evaluate the impact of UF on the composition of SF, MW distribution of each SP and corresponding RSP was determined and the results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Similar to the results of SDS‐PAGE, extraction with Protex 7L and Flavourzyme yielded proteins with larger MW, as reflected by the peaks eluted before the first dashed line (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>A,C). However, those peaks with larger MW were almost diminished in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>B,D, indicating the higher hydrolyzing abilities of Alcalase 2.4L and Protex 6L. Moreover, a minor peak eluted after the second dash line was observed in SF
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>, implying that Alcalase 2.4L was able to further degrade the soybean protein into low MW peptides.
