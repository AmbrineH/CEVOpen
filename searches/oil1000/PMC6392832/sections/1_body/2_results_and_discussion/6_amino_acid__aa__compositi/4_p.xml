<p class="p">Phytate is a phosphorous compound that can impede the absorption of certain minerals in the gut, such as zinc and iron (Lazarte, Carlsson, Almgren, Sandberg, &amp; Granfeldt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). As previously evidenced, there is a strong interaction between phytate and soybean protein, making it a difficult task to remove phytate during protein extraction (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and as a result, SPC contains 12.35 mg/g sample phytate (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, it appears that enzymatic treatment during EAE weakens the protein–phytate interaction through proteolysis, resulting in partial removal of phytate during the filtration. This is confirmed by the significantly lower levels of phytate content in RSP, as compared to that in SPC (

 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported that the phytate content in SF from EAE of peanuts was significantly lower than those in the Soxhlet extracted residue and cold‐pressed residue. Among the four EAE treatments, RSP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> showed the lowest phytate content (3.51 mg/g sample,
