<p class="p">Amino acid composition is an important factor to evaluate the nutritional value of protein and protein hydrolysates. The AA profiles of RSP from different enzyme treatments are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and compared with that of SPC (extracted from the same seeds). As seen, RSP was rich in Glu, Asp, and Ile, but were relatively deficient in Met and Cys. This is in accordance with the results of Zarkadas et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), who analyzed the AA composition of 14 soybean cultivars and found that they were high in glutamic acid but limited in methionine and cysteine. Overall, both of the contents of essential AAs and non‐essential AAs in RSP were similar to those in SPC, indicating the high quality of the recovered protein. Similar to our results, Latif, Pfannstiel, Makkar, and Becker (
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported that the AA composition of SF from EAE of peanuts was close to that of the untreated ground seed. Meanwhile, although some AA differs, on the whole, non‐significant differences were observed among different EAE processes. de Moura et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) also reported comparable AA compositions of the skim protein extracted under different enzyme species and dosages (Protex 6L and Protex 7L). Overall, RSP contained all the necessary AAs, which further indicated the gently operational conditions during EAE and UF process.
