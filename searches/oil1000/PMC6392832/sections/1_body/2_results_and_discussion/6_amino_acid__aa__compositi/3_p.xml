<p class="p">There are a number of anti‐nutritional compounds in soybeans that can negatively impact their nutritional quality (Liener, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). In this study, two anti‐nutritional factors, the trypsin inhibitors and phytate, were determined in RSP from different EAE processes. The trypsin inhibitors belong to the family of serine protease inhibitors, and function through complexing with trypsin and chymotrypsin, resulting in interference of the protein digestive process (Vagadia, Vanga, &amp; Raghavan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, compared with SPC, RSP showed significantly lower levels of TIA, varying from 3.72 to 3.98 mg trypsin inhibited/g sample (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). It is known that trypsin inhibitors are heat‐labile and could be thermally inactivated. Therefore, the reduced levels of TIA in RSP could be probably due to the hydrothermal treatment during extrusion. However, since the extrusion temperature we used was relatively low (80°C), the trypsin inhibitors were not completely denatured, and there still remained partial TIA in the resulting RSP. Additionally, employment of UF may further reduce the TIA levels since the 1.35–17 kDa fractions in RSP were depleted (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), which is near the MW of Bowman–Birk (6–10 kDa) inhibitor, one major trypsin inhibitor in soybeans (Liener,
