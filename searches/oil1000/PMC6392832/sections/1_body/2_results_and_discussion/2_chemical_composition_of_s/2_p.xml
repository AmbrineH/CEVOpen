<p class="p">The chemical composition of SF extracted with different proteases is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>A. As seen, SF contains a small amount of oil, ranging from 6.33% to 11.48% (on dry weight basis). Alcalase 2.4L tends to have a greater ability to “release” oil from soybean cytoplasm into SF, resulting in a significantly higher oil content in SF

The major saccharides in SF were sucrose, followed by stachyose, and raffinose, with the contents of 4.06%–8.69%, 3.05%–4.38%, and 0.65%–0.96% (on dry weight basis), respectively. This is in accordance with previous results (de Moura et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), showing that the main carbohydrates in SF from EAE of soybeans were stachyose and sucrose. Among the four extractions, non‐significant differences in sugar profiles were observed except for a significantly higher content of sucrose and stachyose in SF
