<p class="p">Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed to characterize the protein profiles in SF from different EAE treatments. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>B, compared to the control treatment without enzymes, proteolytic hydrolysis reduced all the subunits of the two main soybean storage proteins (glycinin and β‐conglycinin). On the whole, SF showed smaller bands with MW &lt;48 kDa, of which the proteins with MW &lt;20 kDa accounted for the largest proportion. Similarly, de Moura et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) reported that 71% of the skim protein extracted with Protex 6L were below the MW of 20 kDa. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that there are hydrolyzed products (bands of MW 35–48 kDa) of the β subunit of β‐conglycinin in SF
 <sub class="sub">F</sub> and SF
 <sub class="sub">P6</sub>. As previously noted, β‐conglycinin was more resistant to enzymatic degradation than glycinin and therefore considered as a potential food allergen (Krishnan, Kim, Jang, &amp; Kerley, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, as for SF
 <sub class="sub">P7</sub> and SF
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>, all the subunits of β‐conglycinin were completely absent, indicating the higher hydrolyzing abilities of Protex 7L and Alcalase 2.4L toward β‐conglycinin. This result suggested that different EAE processes generated skim proteins with different compositions and therefore may impact the quality and functionality of the resulting products.
