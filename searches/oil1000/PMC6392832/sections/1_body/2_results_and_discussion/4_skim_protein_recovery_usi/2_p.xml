<p class="p">In order to evaluate the impact of membrane pore size on UF performance and retentate quality, two PES membranes with MWCO of 3 kDa and 5 kDa were utilized. Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>A shows the variation of permeate flux during UF for both membranes. As seen, the permeate flux values were apparently dependent on the MWCO of membranes, where the values for the 5‐kDa membrane were noticeably higher than those for the 3‐kDa membrane. As referred in the introduction, Campbell and Glatz (
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) also applied UF to recover skim protein from EAE of soybeans and the permeate flux was reported to be within 4–10 L/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/hr with a 3‐kDa membrane. It should be noted that the permeate flux values we obtained here (4.73–12.58 and 8.64–14.45 L/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/hr for 3‐kDa membrane and 5‐kDa membrane, respectively) are slightly higher than those reported in the previous study. Explanation can be found in the differences in raw material, SF composition (due to different EAE processes), UF equipment and parameters, among others. Overall, SF
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and SF
 <sub class="sub">P6</sub> exhibited higher permeate flux values than SF
 <sub class="sub">P7</sub> and SF
 <sub class="sub">F</sub>, and the lowest values were expectedly observed in SF
 <sub class="sub">F</sub> with the 3‐kDa membrane. During the filtration process, the permeate flux decreased with increasing filtration time. A rapid initial flux decline, followed by a pseudo‐steady stage, was observed in all samples, albeit at different rates. It was indicated that a steep decrease in the initial flux during UF was associated with membrane fouling (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the beginning of filtration, accumulation of macromolecular solutes may form a concentration polarization layer on the membrane surface, resulting in a steeply reduced flux. Beyond the layer buildup period, the filtration resistance reached a stationary state and the flux remained almost unchanged (Grenier, Meireles, Aimar, &amp; Carvin,
