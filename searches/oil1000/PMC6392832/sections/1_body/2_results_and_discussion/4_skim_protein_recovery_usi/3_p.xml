 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> presents the retention coefficients of protein, sucrose, and stachyose (two main saccharides in SF) for each SF using the studied membranes. A UF membrane with high retention of protein but low rejection of saccharides is desired. As seen, the 3‐kDa membrane expectedly retained more protein than the 5‐kDa membrane, but significant differences were observed only for the UF process of SF

While for sucrose and stachyose, they have much lower MWs (180.16 kDa and 666.59 kDa, respectively) than the MWCO of both membranes, and their transmission through the pores freely was expected. However, as seen in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, filtration with the 3‐kDa membrane exhibited significantly higher

 <sub class="sub">app</sub> values for stachyose when compared to the 5‐kDa membrane (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). This is probably due to the increasing concentration polarization and fouling during UF using the 3‐kDa membrane, which consequently leads to partial sugar retention in the retentates. Therefore, considering the high permeate flux values, slightly reduced retention of protein, and low rejection of saccharides, the membrane with the MWCO of 5 kDa was preferred to recover skim protein from SF and it was then selected for the following studies.
