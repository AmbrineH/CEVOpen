<p class="p">The protein content of RSP was then evaluated, and the results are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. As seen, RSP contained 72.60%–82.36% protein (on dry weight basis), with the highest purity observed in RSP

 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), a 70% protein content of the RSP extracted with Protex 6L was obtained after membrane filtration. The higher protein content in our original SF can be a possible explanation, indicating that different EAE treatments might result in SF with various chemical profiles and thereby impact the quality of the protein retentate. It is also worth noting that the protein content of RSP was slightly higher than that of commercial SPC (~70%), but lower than that of commercial SPI (~90%) (Alibhai et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). This high purity of RSP further implied its potential applications as soybean protein products, such as protein supplements or food ingredients.
