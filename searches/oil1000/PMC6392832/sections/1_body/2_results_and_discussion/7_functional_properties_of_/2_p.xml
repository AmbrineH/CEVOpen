<p class="p">Processing treatments, such as heating, pH adjustment, and enzymatic hydrolysis, may impact the physicochemical properties of protein and thereby alter their functionalities (Foegeding &amp; Davis, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In this study, to further evaluate the effect of EAE treatments on functional properties of RSP, some certain properties, including protein solubility (PS), emulsifying and foaming properties, were determined. The improvement of PS following enzymatic treatment is known to be the most notable impact on protein functionalities (Zhao, Liu, Zhao, Ren, &amp; Yang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>A shows the PS‐pH profiles of RSP extracted with different proteases and compared with that of SPC. As seen, both RSP and SPC exhibited typical U‐shaped curves with the lowest PS at pH 4.5, which is the isoelectric point of soybean protein. Enzymatic treatments improved the PS of RSP in most cases, especially at acidic pH. This PS‐enhancing effect of PS after proteolysis can be attributed to the reduced MW as well as the increase in ionizable and carboxyl groups. Among the four proteases, Alcalase 2.4L and Protex 6L exhibited better PS‐improving abilities, achieving the PS values of 97.61% and 92.52% at pH 7.5, respectively. The solubility of SF from EAE of soybeans using Protex 6L was previously reported by de Almeida, de Moura Bell, and Johnson (
