<p class="p">Emulsifying activity index (EAI) and stability index (ESI) refer to the maximum interfacial area per gram protein required to stabilize the solution, and its capacity to remain unchanged over time under given conditions (Lam &amp; Nickerson, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Soybean proteins are known as effective emulsifiers, and therefore, they are widely used in food formulations (Tang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>B, compared to SPC, EAE treatments significantly (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) reduced the EAI of RSP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and RSP
 <sub class="sub">P6</sub> and ESI of all RSP, respectively. Similar trends were observed in foaming properties (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>C), where the FC and FS of RSP were decreased by 11.70%–34.68% and 11.97%–52.69%, respectively, as compared to the SPC. Limited enzymatic modification was shown to improve the emulsifying and foaming properties of plant proteins (Avramenko, Low, &amp; Nickerson, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Tang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, when the hydrolyzing process was not well controlled, the proteins were cleaved into peptides with reduced ability to form viscoelastic films at the interface, thereby causing coalescence of oil droplets and destabilization of foams (Ghribi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3936-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Hence, the reduction in interfacial properties of RSP in this study could be due to the excessive protein hydrolysis during EAE process. Changing extraction parameters would be beneficial to control the process and obtain skim proteins with preferable properties, for instance, reducing enzyme dosage or hydrolyzing time. However, the oil extraction yield would be altered accordingly, as well as the stability of the oil‐rich emulsion. As such, optimization of the whole process would be necessary to further fulfill simultaneous extraction of the desired products.
