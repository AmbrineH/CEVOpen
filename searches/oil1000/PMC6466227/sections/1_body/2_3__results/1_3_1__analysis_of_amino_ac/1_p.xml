<p class="p">We first analyzed the proximate compositions and amino acid profiles of the two MW meals (DMW-1 and DMW-2). The crude protein and crude lipid levels in DMW-1 and DMW-2 were similar to those of FM owing to the defatting process. MW contained all of the indispensable amino acids found in FM (

 <xref rid="animals-09-00100-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were sufficient to meet the dietary requirement in red seabream [
