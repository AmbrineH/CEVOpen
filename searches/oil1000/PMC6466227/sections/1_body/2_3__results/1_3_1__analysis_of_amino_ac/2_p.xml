<p class="p">The fatty acids in the dried yellow mealworm larvae before defatting to DMW-1 were also analyzed. The oil fraction of the larvae was used for the diets as MO; thus, the fatty acid composition in MO corresponded to that of the larvae. Marked differences were found between the fatty acid compositions of fish oil and yellow mealworm (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00100-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The total ω-3 fatty acid level was 1.7% in yellow mealworm larvae in comparison with 27.3% in fish oil. In addition, the only ω-3 fatty acid present in yellow mealworm larvae was linolenic acid (18:3 n-3). Notably, yellow mealworm larvae entirely lacked n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFAs), which are designated as ω-3 fatty acids with 20 or more carbons and are considered essential nutrients for marine fish.
