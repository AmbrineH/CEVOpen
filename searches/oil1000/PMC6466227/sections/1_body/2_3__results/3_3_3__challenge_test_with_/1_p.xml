<p class="p">We conducted a challenge test with 
 <italic class="italic">Edwardsiella tarda</italic>, which has a high pathogenicity on red seabream. Fish were fed with the control diet or diets containing 5% or 10% DMW-2 for 56 days before the challenge. These diets did not lead to a significant effect on fish growth. After being challenged with
