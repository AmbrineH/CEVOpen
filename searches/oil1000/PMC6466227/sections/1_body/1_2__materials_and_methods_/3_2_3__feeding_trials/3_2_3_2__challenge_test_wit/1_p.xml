<p class="p">Another feeding trial in addition to that mentioned above was conducted for the challenge test with the fish pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">Edwasiella tarda</italic>. Red seabreams provided by Yamasaki Giken co., Ltd. (Kochi, Japan) (mean weight 30. 4 g) which were never fed any MW were also used in the study. Twenty-two fish per tank and duplicate cultures per study group were cultured in 100 L tanks; thus, 6 tanks were used in the trial. Fish were cultivated for 56 days and were fed to satiation once per day, except for Sunday, with the diets listed in

 <italic class="italic">E. tarda</italic> pathogens were obtained from the Fisheries Research Division, Ainan Town Office. 
 <italic class="italic">E. tarda</italic> was isolated from a red seabream infected with 
 <italic class="italic">E. tarda</italic> at an aquaculture site in Ainan, Ehime using Salmonella Shigella Agar. The bacterial cells were adjusted to 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/ml in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). The fish in each group were challenged with an injection of 100 μl bacterial cell suspension into an intraperitoneal cavity. After the infection, deaths were recorded for 14 days and the survival rate was calculated.
