<p class="p">Proteinogenic amino acids in the meal samples were analyzed using an automated amino acid analyzer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after hydrochloric hydrolysis with sodium chloride. For methionine and cystine, the samples were oxidized with performic acid prior to hydrochloric hydrolysis. For tryptophan, samples were prepared with barium hydroxide octahydrate and thiodietylene glycol before hydrolysis with sodium chloride and analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Taurine was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Fatty acids in samples were prepared with saponification and analyzed by gas chromatograph using a method described in food labelling standards by the Consumer Affairs Agency Japan (CAA, 2015). The analysis of proteiogenic amino acids, taurine, and fatty acids was conducted by the Japan Food Research Laboratories (Osaka, Japan).</p>
