<p class="p">The proximate composition, amino acids, and fatty acids were analyzed using the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) methods [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The content of crude protein was analyzed using the Kjeldahl method. “Kjeltab” (containing K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) was added to the ground samples, and the samples were digested in a block heater (Tecator TM Digestion Systems 2520, FOSS). The nitrogen content was automatically analyzed using an Auto analyzer (Kjeltec
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> 8400, FOSS). The nitrogen–protein conversion factor was 6.25 on the calculation of crude protein from the nitrogen content. Crude fat was analyzed using the Soxhlet extraction method. Petroleum ether was used as the solvent for extraction from the ground samples in an Automated extractor (Soxtec
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> 8000, FOSS). The content of ash was analyzed using an electric furnace (MMF-1, AS ONE).
