<p class="p">Two types of dried MW larvae meal, DMW-1 and DMW-2, were used in the growth trial and the challenge test, respectively. For the growth test, microwave-oven-dried yellow mealworm (MW) larvae reared with wheat bran and vegetable waste were obtained from Shintoa Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) for the growth test. To remove the oil fraction, the ground MW larvae were each suspended with a 4-fold volume of a solution containing 9 volumes of normal hexane and 1 volume of ethanol (99%) and then incubated overnight at room temperature with occasional gentle agitation. The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the sediment was heated at 60 °C for 1 day or more until completely air-dried. This defatting process was repeated several times until the content of crude fat reached values below 8% on a dry basis; DMW-1 was thus obtained. The oil fraction from MW (MW oil, MO) was prepared from the aforementioned supernatant containing hexane/ethanol (9:1) by evaporation at room temperature until the volume was decreased by approximately 10-fold, and then the temperature was gradually increased from 40 to 80 °C until the residual organic solvents had evaporated. For the challenge test, DMW-2 produced in Shangdong, China was obtained from Shintoa Corporation. Fish meal from Peruvian anchoveta (
