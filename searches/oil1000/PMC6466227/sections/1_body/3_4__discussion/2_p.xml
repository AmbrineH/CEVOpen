<p class="p">Although replacement of FM with MW has been attempted in many earlier studies, high inclusion levels of insects in aquaculture feed have resulted in growth reductions in many cases, particularly in marine carnivorous fish species [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For example, the growth performance with 50% full-fat MW in diets which was similar to that with FM diets was inferior to that with 25% MW inclusion in gilthead seabream [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and 50% inclusion of full-fat MW negatively affected the growth performance comparing with FM diets in European seabass [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. For black spot seabream, although 25% and 50% full-fat MW in diets did not significantly affect growth [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], the diet containing 50% MW also contained 31% FM; thus, complete replacement of FM was not achieved in their study. In rainbow trout, inclusion of 25%â€“50% full-fat MW (33% to 67% replacement of FM) resulted in an improvement in growth performance [
