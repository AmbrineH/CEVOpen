<p class="p">Body weight gain increased in fish with defatted MW-inclusion diets, and the FCR in all groups was not significantly different. This suggests that defatted MW is remarkably preferred by red seabream. Notably, our current trials indicate that MW without the oil fraction promotes growth and feed intake in red seabreams compared a diet of MW with the oil fraction (MW+MO). Considering that the dietary n-3 HUFA level meets their nutrition requirements in both the 65% MW and 65% MW + MO diets, the oil fraction of MW was speculated to have a negative effect on fish feed intake from the result of the growth test in our study. Further studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism of the dietary intake reduction with the oil fraction of MW. Our results suggest that the defatting process in MW does not only decrease the fat level but also eliminates the negative effect of intact MW larvae inclusion in diets on fish feed intake. Therefore, eliminating the oil fraction is thought to be an important first step in the development of insect-based feeds for marine aquaculture.</p>
