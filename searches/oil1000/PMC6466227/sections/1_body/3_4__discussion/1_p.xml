<p class="p">The present study shows that MW larvae are not only good sources of nutrients, but can also improve growth performance and anti-disease capacity in red seabream. The growth of fish fed with diets containing defatted MW (DMW-1) was significantly higher than that of those with control diets containing FM, and higher inclusion levels of DMW-1 in the diet (up to 65%, complete replacement of FM) resulted in larger growth in fish. On the other hand, anti-bacterial disease capacity of red seabream was obtained with only 10% inclusion of DMW-2 in the diet.</p>
