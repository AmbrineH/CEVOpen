<p class="p">In contrast to the findings of the studies that utilized a partial replacement of FM, the present study showed that complete replacement of FM with MW in the diet of red seabream can have a positive impact on growth performance when the oil fraction is removed using organic solvents from dried MW. Intact MW larvae have excess crude lipids (30%–35%, dry matter); therefore, a defatting process was necessary for an adequate feed composition [
