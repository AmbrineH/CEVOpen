<p class="p">We successfully conducted a feeding trial with red seabream (
 <italic class="italic">Pagrus major</italic>) being fed diets with complete replacement of fish meal with MW defatted with a hexaneâ€“ethanol solution, and the survival rate of red seabreams fed diets with partial replacement of fish meal with mealworm larvae was significantly higher in a challenge test with pathogenic
