<p class="p">The present study demonstrated that yellow mealworm larvae are not merely an alternative animal protein, but have potential as functional feed ingredients for aquaculture production. Although MW is easy to rear with agricultural byproducts, optimization of the mass-rearing system is necessary to decrease the environmental impact for wider implementation [

 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Diets including MW, however, could have functional benefits that no other insect species have. Further investigations on the benefits of dietary intake of MW, especially long-term feeding trials, are still needed to elucidate a method to reduce aquaculture cost.
