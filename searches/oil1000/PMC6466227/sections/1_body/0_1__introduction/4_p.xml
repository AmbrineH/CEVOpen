<p class="p">In this current study, we report that the complete replacement of fish meal with defatted MW promoted growth, and partial replacement enhanced disease resistance in the marine carnivorous fish, red seabream. Our study shows that MW is not only a protein source for aquaculture feed, but likely has functions for health optimization in cultured fish.</p>
