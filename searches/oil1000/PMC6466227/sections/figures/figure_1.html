 <p> Growth performance of red seabream fed diets with a partial or complete replacement of FM with DMW-1 for a period of 4 weeks. Fork length gain ( a) and body weight gain ( b) at 4 weeks in the feeding trial. Values are means with their standard error represented by vertical bars [ n = 29 in 65% FM, 31 in 25% MW, 32 in 40% MW, 32 in 65% MW, and 30 in 65% MW and the oil fraction of mealworm larvae (65% MW + MO)]. Different letters (a, b, c) indicate statistically significant differences according to the Steel–Dwass multiple comparison tests as a post hoc test after a Kruskal–Wallis test ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>
