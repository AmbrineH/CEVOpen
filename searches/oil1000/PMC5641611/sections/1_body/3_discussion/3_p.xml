<p class="p">The results are also in agreement with several other previous reports where the major components of essential oils have shown excellent larvicidal or insecticidal activities, eg 
 <italic class="italic">Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> leaf essential oil (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu 2010</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena anisata</italic> leaf essential oil (Govindrajan 2011), 
 <italic class="italic">Feronia limonia</italic> leaf essential oil (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Intirach et al. (2012)</xref> studied essential oils of six different plant families and demonstrated their larvicidal activity against laboratory colonized 
 <italic class="italic">An. cracens</italic> mosquito. A careful observation of these representative studies indicated that there was no common thread in terms of chemical constituents, in these essential oils. The composition and major and minor components of essential oil are characteristics of particular plant and, at the best may be represented in the other members of same family. The composition and larvicidal activity of essential oil of a plant may vary as a function of age of plant, geographical location and season. The observed variations in the efficacy of essential oils from various plants against different vectors could be due to different chemical compositions and/or synergistic action of major and minor components in them (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Senthilkumar and Venkatesalu 2012</xref>). The natural diversity of essential oils in the indigenous plants thus offer good opportunity of developing a cost effective, ecofriendly, region specific and practical strategy for the control of mosquito vectors either independently or as a part of integrated vector management strategy. Though there are no reports of insecticide/larvicide resistance in the study area, the same is well documented in African countries for 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> species against all the approved four classes (organochlorines, pyrethroids, carbamates and organophosphates) of insecticides (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kristan et al. 2003</xref>). Of the four classes, resistance to pyrethroids and its mechanisms in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic>: the most important malarial vector in Africa has been extensively studied. It was found out that the insect develops resistance to insecticide either by altering its binding site, by point mutations, or by detoxifying it enzymatically before it reaches the target site (
