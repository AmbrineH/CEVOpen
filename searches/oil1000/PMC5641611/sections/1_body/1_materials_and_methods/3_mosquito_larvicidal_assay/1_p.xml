The collected mosquito larvae were brought to laboratory and maintained at 25–30 °C with 80–90% relative humidity and 12 h/d/night cycle in plastic trays containing dechlorinated water. Mosquito larvae were fed with 10% sterile sucrose solution and pet biscuits. The mosquito larvicidal activity was performed according to standard procedure recommended by 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WHO (1981)</xref>. The extracted dried and pre weighed essential oil was dissolved in 1ml of acetone and from this different concentrations were made such as 3.125, 6.25, 12.50, 25, 50 and 100ppm in distilled water. Twenty five early fourth instar stage larvae of each of the three species of mosquito were used for larvicidal assay in 200ml beakers and three replicates were maintained for each concentration used. During the experiment, no food was given to the larvae.
