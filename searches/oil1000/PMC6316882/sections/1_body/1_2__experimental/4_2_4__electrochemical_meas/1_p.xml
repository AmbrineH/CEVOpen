<p class="p">The electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode arrangement using a potentiostat/galvanostat, PGStat302N (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). The sample of low-alloy steel after particular modification was used as a working electrode (WE) with an exposed surface area of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl/3MKCl (REF) and the Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode (CE). The electrochemical cell was filled with 150 mL of aerated 0.5 M KCl solution that was changed for each sample. The linear voltammetry (LV) scans were registered from the cathodic towards anodic potentials at a sweep rate of 1 mVs
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The linear Tafel segments of the cathodic and anodic curves were extrapolated to the corrosion potential to obtain the corrosion current densities. The corrosion rate was calculated on the basis of the equation: CR (mpy) = (0.13·J
 <sub class="sub">corr</sub>·E.W.)/d where mpy is defined as mils per year, J
 <sub class="sub">corr</sub> is the density of the corrosion current (µAcm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), E.W. is the equivalent weight (for low-alloy steel it equals 27.9 g), and d is the density of the sample material (7.87 g cm

 <xref rid="B44-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The error in the corrosion current density equals 0.01 µA cm
