<p class="p">X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the phase composition and crystallite size. Measurements were performed on a Philips/PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with a Cu K
 <sub class="sub">α</sub> source (λ = 1.5404 Å). Data were collected from 2Θ = 5° to 70° with a scan speed of 1.1 deg/min at room temperature. The average crystallite size was estimated on the basis of the Scherrer equation taking into account reflections originating from (200) and (110) crystal phases and located at around 10–11°.
