<p class="p">In this work, thin steel plates made of the low-alloy steel with dimensions of 20 mm Ã— 20 mm and a thickness of 0.8 mm were used. To prevent corrosion of the steel, the samples were stored under a layer of chloroform. The chemical composition of these materials was analyzed with Optical Emission Spectrometer Solaris CCD Plus produced by GNR Analitycal Instruments (Nottingham, UK) and are summarized in
