<p class="p">The manganese phosphating coating was prepared according to the procedure described in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. To determine the effect of nickel and manganese on the quality of a phosphate coating two low-alloy steel samples of the same size were prepared (2 cm × 2 cm). The amount of nickel in the phosphating bath varied from 0 to 1 g Ni(NO
