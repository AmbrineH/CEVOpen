<p class="p">Complex characterization of protective manganese phosphate coatings was carried out by scanning electron microscopy SEM and XRD analysis. Quantitative analysis of the manganese coating was performed with the use of a mapping method. The morphology of fabricated materials was performed by a scanning electron microscope Quanta (FEI) equipped with an EDS accessory, enabling analysis of the elemental composition. Results have shown that the layer covering the metal plate is not consistent. There is an observable crystalline precipitate on the surface. Crystallite size varies (most of them even have a few micrometers in length). Apart from the precipitation, the crystallites are observed in the shape of a cylinder with a diameter of about 0.5â€“1 mm.</p>
