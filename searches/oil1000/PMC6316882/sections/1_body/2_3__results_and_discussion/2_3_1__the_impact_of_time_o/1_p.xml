<p class="p">The duration of the phosphating process plays a significant role. Over time, the formation of manganese phosphate crystals increases. This paper investigates the effect that phosphating time has on the formation of the previously mentioned crystals for 14 samples with a time range from 15 s to 900 s, see the sixth stage from 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. A total of 14 doubled samples were prepared in the same way depending on the time of immersion in the phosphate bath and were subjected to SEM and XRD tests as well as electrochemical tests. On the surface of a sample submerged for a shorter time (15 s), several phases, including Mn

The lower pattern presents XRD data for a sample submerged for a longer time (180 s) and shows that the sample is coated by Mn
