<p class="p">It could be observed that the samples which are labeled as La-S_60sâ€“L-S_180s had the highest (less negative) corrosion potential among the materials. The most negative values were reached for the samples immersed for 15, 30, and 540 s. Following the analysis of the results for the samples immersed in a phosphate bath for a longer time, the dependence of the corrosion rate of two samples, La-S_15s and La-S_30s, in this group is not taken into account because the processing time was too short. It proves that the limited immersion time results in the corrosion process taking place on the metal surface rather than in the forming of the protective coating. The sample, La-S_900s, exhibits the lowest corrosion current value and, therefore, is less susceptible to the corrosion. The sample immersed only for 15 s (

This value may result from the presence of manganese phosphate and iron phosphate crystals on the metal surface. These crystals are likely to catalyze the corrosion rate.
