 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> presents a cross-sectional area of sample B. A highly corrugated sample surface is seen on the top, whereas a relatively homogeneous bulk is seen on the bottom of the figure. The elemental analysis of the cross-section is represented by four solid lines that show the relative concentration of P, Mn, Fe, and Ni. On the surface P, Mn, and Fe are present and detailed analysis reveals that a relative atomic concentration is 50:37:13 (P:Mn:Fe). The concentration of Fe rapidly increases with distance from the surface. There is no clear border between the surface and a bulk material, but 15 μm inside the sample we found twice the amount of Fe compared to the total amount Mn and P together and at a distance of 30 μm from the surface with a relative atomic concentration is 2:1:97 (P:Mn:Fe). Nickel was not found in this sample.
