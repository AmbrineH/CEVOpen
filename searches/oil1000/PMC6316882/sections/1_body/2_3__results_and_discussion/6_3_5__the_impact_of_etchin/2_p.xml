<p class="p">During the phosphating process, samples are exposed to acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acid. The acidity level of the phosphating solution was the same (total acidity was 82 point, free acidity was 14.2 points, and the concentration of iron equaled 0.42 g/L). In order to determine the effect of the acid, various combinations were used with sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and hydrochloric acid. The samples were labeled with the use of Et_H
