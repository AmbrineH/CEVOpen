<p class="p">In galvanic processes, one of the basic elements is the removal of rust deposits. Removal of rust and scale is important when creating a uniform coating. Rust and scale are not removed at the degreasing stage; hence, the use of acids is required. The most commonly used acids are sulfuric acid (VI), phosphoric acid, or hydrochloric acid. Due to the high costs of sulfuric acid (VI) and phosphoric acid, the most preferred is the use of hydrochloric acid. In order to accelerate the process of removing rust and scale deposits, the addition of hydrogen peroxide was used in this study. Two samples for each condition have been prepared, see
