<p class="p">Nickel is a common addition to a phosphate bath in the phosphating process. Nickel catalyzes the formation of manganese phosphate crystals. The addition of nickel in the phosphatizing bath contributes to a tight coating with regular rhombic crystals. The most commonly used type of nickel compound is nickel (II) nitrate (V), nickel (II) phosphate (V), nickel carbonate, and the rarely used nickel (II) chloride.</p>
