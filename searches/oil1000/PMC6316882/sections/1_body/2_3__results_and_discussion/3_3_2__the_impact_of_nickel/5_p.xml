<p class="p">The analysis of the results for samples Ni_0â€“Ni_0.3 listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> proves that the sample Ni_0.3 shows the lowest corrosion rate. The smallest corrosion rate was determined for Ni_0.05 and Ni_0.3 but the Ni_0.05 sample has worse anti-corrosive properties than the Ni_0.3 sample. The sample Ni_0.3 has the best anticorrosion properties. According to the collected data, the corrosion resistance (

 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). As a result, the concentration of nickel could be regarded as a factor which significantly influences the corrosion rate of the obtained material. Taking into account the morphology, it affects the number of micro cathodes on the metal surface, thus increasing the number of active sites of the phosphate crystal.
