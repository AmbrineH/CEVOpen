<p class="p">It could be observed that the La-S_P sample has the highest corrosion potential and a relatively low corrosion current. Therefore, this material is considered as having the best anti-corrosion properties. These studies revealed that the conservation process with the use of the mineral oil together with the passivation treatment accelerates the corrosion progress. However, the use of passivation without mineral oils increases the corrosion resistance of the sample with a manganese phosphate coating, as is observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f016" class="xref">Figure 16</xref>. The sample denoted as La-S_P has the lowest value of corrosion rate and the smallest corrosion current density, see
