<p class="p">In order to determine the effect of the activation process on the quality of a manganese phosphate coating, five samples of the low-alloy steel were prepared. Each sample was phosphated according to 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, and the samples prepared in individual conditions were doubled. The XRD patterns for a reference and selected activated samples are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>. The coating after the activation process in an alkaline dilution and is characterized by good tightness. The size of the crystals varies between 2 and 10 μm. The coating obtained in the phosphating process without activation is formed with large crystals. Their size is within the range of 50–60 μm, see
