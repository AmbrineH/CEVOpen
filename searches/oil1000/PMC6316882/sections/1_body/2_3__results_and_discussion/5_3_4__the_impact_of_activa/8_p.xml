<p class="p">The passivating bath was made in accordance with information given in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f016" class="xref">Figure 16</xref> polarization curves were registered for samples subjected to a passivation process. To determine the effect of an oiliness process on the quality of a phosphate coating, two samples of the same size of low-alloy steel were prepared. Each sample was prepared according to 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Two strong Bragg reflections of iron originating from the substrate were also observed. XRD patterns for the samples which were passivated for different times are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f017" class="xref">Figure 17</xref>.
