 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>, after 15 min of immersing the sample in a phosphate bath, depending on the sample activation, different crystal sizes are obtained. The manganese phosphate coating obtained without the activation process is visible to the naked eye. However, the coating is unstable due to the size of the crystals as it is destroyed more quickly due to the fragility of the coating.
