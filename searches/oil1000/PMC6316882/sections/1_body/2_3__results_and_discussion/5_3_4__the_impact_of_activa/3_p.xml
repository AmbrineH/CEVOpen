<p class="p">As it was shown in the sample groups discussed above, the typical peaks for the iron substrate and manganese hydrogen phosphate hydrate phase are observed. In this case, no clear dependence between passivation time and average crystallites size was observed. The average crystallites sizes are in the range of 23â€“32 nm.</p>
