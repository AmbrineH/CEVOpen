<p class="p">To determine the effect of the passivation process on the quality of a phosphate coating two low-alloy steel samples of the same size were prepared, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref>. One sample was prepared with the passivation and oiliness process and another sample was prepared with the passivation process only. In the oiliness process, a solution of mineral oil, emulsifying with water (ZWEZ E-4999) was used. The passivating process of the samples was performed in a bath containing zirconium and silicon compounds.
