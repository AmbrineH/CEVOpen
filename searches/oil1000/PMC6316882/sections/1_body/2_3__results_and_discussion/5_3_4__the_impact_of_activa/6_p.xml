<p class="p">Comparing the values collected in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 10</xref>, the sample A_2.0 exhibits the best anti-corrosion properties such as the highest corrosion potential and a relatively low corrosion current. The results of electrochemical measurements, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f014" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>, indicate that the activation of the metal surface has a high impact on the corrosion rate of the phosphate coating. It has been shown that the concentration of the activating bath has a significant effect on the corrosion resistance. Better results were obtained at a temperature of 45 Â°C. The best anti-corrosion properties were obtained when samples were treated in a bath containing 2 g of MnHPO
