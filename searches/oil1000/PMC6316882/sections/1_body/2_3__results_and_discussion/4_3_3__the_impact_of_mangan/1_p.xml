<p class="p">Manganese is the basic building block of the phosphate manganese conversion coating. This part of the work examines the effect of changing the concentration of manganese in a phosphate bath on the nature of the obtained coating. Two samples have been prepared in accordance with 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Manganese in a phosphate bath occurs in the form of Mn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> cations. In order to increase the concentration of manganese in phosphate baths in industrial production, compounds such as manganese (V) nitrate, manganese (V) phosphate (II), or manganese carbonate are used. In the manganese phosphatizing process, the use of manganese compounds in which the manganese is in the +7 oxidation state, Mn
 <sup class="sup">7+</sup> (permanganate), is most often used to remove iron phosphate from the bath. Iron (II) ions are then oxidized to iron (III) ions. Based on the photos taken with the scanning microscope, you can see differences in the structure of the crystals. The high concentration of manganese in the phosphatizing bath results in crystals with characteristic features and cracks (
