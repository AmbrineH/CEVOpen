<p class="p">Among all manganese-modified materials, the Mn_2.0 sample shows the highest corrosion potential and a relatively low corrosion current. It demonstrates the best anti-corrosive properties. It could also be noticed that the reference sample is characterized by the worst electrochemical activity towards corrosion protection compared to other materials. With the increase of manganese concentration in the phosphating bath, the anti-corrosion properties of the manganese phosphate coating are improved.</p>
