<p class="p">Samples were prepared using method number 2.1, as indicated in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02585-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> according to the increasing numbering of stages of the process. In total, nine stages of manganese phosphating occur in the coating process. The following factors were taken into account; the effect of surface activation, the concentration of nickel in the phosphate bath, the influence of manganese on the coating quality, the effect of time on the formation of crystals of manganese phosphate, the effect of the addition of carbon manganese into the phosphating bath, and the effect of the passivation with zircon and silicon compounds. All the above processes strongly affect the creation of a uniform coating.
