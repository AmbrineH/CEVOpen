   <p class="p">The addition of manganese in the form of manganese carbonate dramatically improves the phosphate coating. Similarly, the addition of nickel dramatically affects the quality of the phosphate coating achieved.</p>

   <label class="label">(2)</label>
   <p class="p">The activation of the surface of a metal sample just before the phosphating process begins significantly affects the corrosion resistance. Along with an increase in the concentration of manganese hydrogen phosphate and sodium pyrophosphate, smaller crystals are formed, which improves the tightness of the coating.</p>

   <p class="p">It has been shown that the passivation process with the use of hexafluorozirconium acid or zirconyl chloride and hexafluorosilocon acid does not increase the concentration of zirconia and silicon in the manganese phosphate coating. The usage of zirconia chloride leads to good corrosion resistance.</p>

   <p class="p">The addition of manganese and nickel to the phosphating bath reduces the rate of corrosion of the sample. Also, increasing the concentration of the activating bath dramatically reduces the corrosion rate of the sample. It has been discovered that a higher concentration of nickel in the phosphating bath increases the anticorrosion properties of the coating. During the analysis, the optimal dose of the nickel (II) nitrate (V) was determined to be 0.6 g/1 dm
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>. The process without the use of nickel results in a coating which has crystals of different shapes.

   <p class="p">With the increasing concentration of manganese, and without changing the acidity and the free acidity, the corrosion resistance of the phosphate coating increases. During the polarization measurements it can be seen that with an increasing formation time of a phosphate coating, the anticorrosive properties increase.</p>

   <p class="p">XRD analysis indicated the presence of two phases in the phosphate coating; Fe metal phase and phosphate coating phase, Mn
    <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>(HPO
    <sub class="sub">4</sub>)(PO
    <sub class="sub">4</sub>)(H
    <sub class="sub">2</sub>O)
    <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The cross-section analysis showed that the manganese coating had no clear border between the surface and the metal. A relative atomic concentration on the surface is 50:37:13 (P:Mn:Fe) and 30 Î¼m from the surface is 2:1:97 (P:Mn:Fe).

   <p class="p">On the basis of electrochemical tests, it has been proven that with an increased immersion time of the sample in the phosphatizing bath, the corrosion resistance increases. The best effect was obtained for a sample with a time of 900 s in a phosphate bath.</p>

   <label class="label">(8)</label>
   <p class="p">The use of phosphoric acid in the process of sample etching results in a higher corrosion resistance of the coating. Furthermore, the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the etching bath affects the phosphating coating conditions.</p>
