<p class="p">The phosphating process could be applied to metal substrates such as steel, cast iron, or zinc. This type of treatment process is based on the reaction between the metal surface and liquid environment, which, as a result, forms the solution of orthophosphoric acid (H

The phosphating process takes place at the solid–liquid interface and proceeds until the balance is achieved, i.e., until the coating is completely formed. Another important aspect of the phosphating process is related to a very problematic by-product, iron (III) phosphate (FePO
