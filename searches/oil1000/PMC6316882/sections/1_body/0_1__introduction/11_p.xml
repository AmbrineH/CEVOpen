<p class="p">Bearing this in mind, we present an innovative study on the implementation of the manganese phosphate bath with compounds of manganese and nickel and the passivation bath with zirconium and silicon compounds. Another important aspect of this study is to investigate the effect of various process parameters, such as the concentration of nickel, the concentration of iron (II), or addition of accelerators on the size of crystals of manganese phosphate. In this work, a proper selection of compounds, such as guanidine derivatives e.g., 1-methyl-nitroguanidine was used to accelerate the phosphating process (urea was used to reduce the speed of the phosphating process). Moreover, the addition of a solution containing hydrogen peroxide and 1,2,3-benzotriazole to the acid at the stage of etching was proposed and investigated [
