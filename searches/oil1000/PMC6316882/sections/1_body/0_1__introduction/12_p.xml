<p class="p">The effect of each process on the morphology of manganese phosphate crystals was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for crystal structure investigation. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed for the selected samples in order to verify their composition and the uniformity of Fe, Ni, and Mn distribution. On the basis of the results of electrochemical measurements, the corrosion currents and rates were determined and finally, the optimized phosphating conditions were indicated.</p>
