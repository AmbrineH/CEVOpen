<p class="p">However, the utilization of iron (III) phosphate leads to a number of problems, e.g., the deposition of the phosphated metal that may cause discoloration in the coating. The phosphating is also accompanied by hydrogen generation, which should be removed in the degassing process [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In order to avoid the accumulation of problematic hydrogen in the cavities, phosphating of the metal is most often performed in a rotating system. Industrial experience of the author leads to the conclusion that one of the possible solutions is the use of a mobile system which works horizontally. Moreover, a temperature decrease to about 70 Â°C with the simultaneous increase in the concentration of manganese and the accelerator of the phosphating process could also contribute to solving the problem of hydrogen accumulation. On the basis of the available literature, it could be stated that the phosphating process includes three main stages; (i) reaction of phosphoric acid with a metal surface, (ii) rapid growth of crystals of manganese phosphate, and (iii) the formation of coatings [
