<p class="p">The simplified mechanism of the manganese phosphatizing coatings treatment applied to the low-alloy steel plates is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02585-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The obtained coating is affected by manufacturing conditions, such as high temperature (approximately 98 Â°C), the concentration of manganese, iron (II), nickel, or the content of phosphoric acid. The utilized bath contains dissolved compounds which are the source of manganese, nickel, and for the passivation process: zirconium and silicon ions.
