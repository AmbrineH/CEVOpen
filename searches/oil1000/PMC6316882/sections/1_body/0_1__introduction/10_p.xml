<p class="p">The phosphating process needs to be modified in order to remove inappropriate color and to improve several other properties such as corrosion resistance. Therefore, in terms of protecting metals against corrosion, the optimized conditions of the phosphating process should be elaborated taking into account the desire to lower the amount of environmentally hazardous by-products and duration of each stage, which significantly affects anti-corrosion resistance of the sample as well as the cost of the treatment. The reciprocating sliding friction and wear behavior of manganese phosphate coating, deposited on the surface of mild steel substrates, was recently explored by Azhaarudeen et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. It was revealed that the wear mechanism is different in the case of uncoated mild steel and substrate coated by the manganese phosphate layer. The mechanical properties of the manganese phosphate coating were compared to those of zinc phosphate [

 <xref rid="B48-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It was observed that zinc phosphate has a lower shear strength and wear resistance compared to manganese phosphate coating. On the basis of the available literature, it could be stated that there is a lack of data regarding a modified manganese phosphating process and the effect of Ba, Sr, Zn, Ca, Cu, Cd, and Ce addition on the passivation, activation, and phosphating processes has not been investigated yet. Another important challenge in this area is lowering the temperature of the phosphatizing process.
