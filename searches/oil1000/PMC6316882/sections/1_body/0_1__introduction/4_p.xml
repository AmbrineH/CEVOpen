<p class="p">Recently, a few types of phosphating process modifications have been proposed, such as the application of certain additives or parameter changes during selected stages of the process. One of the proposed modifications involves the addition of accelerators, such as nitrates (V) [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], or guanidine compounds [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Another well-known approach requires the introduction of organic compounds, i.e., benzotriazoles [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] or tolytriazoles, leading to the reduction of the crystals’ diameter (ca 4.5 ± 2 µm) until an increased surface is finally obtained [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. A number of other modifications that concern the replacement of the nickel cation [

 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] or molybdenum compounds are considered as an alternative [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Moreover, the addition of a zirconium compound such as zirconium hexafluoride acid (H

 <xref rid="B45-materials-11-02585" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], or silicon compound such as silicon hexafluoride acid (H

Such an approach allows changing of the frictional properties, corrosive behavior, abrasion resistance, tensile strength, or mechanical resistance. In addition to the manganese phosphatization processes, silicon compounds (3-triethoxysililpropylamine) [
