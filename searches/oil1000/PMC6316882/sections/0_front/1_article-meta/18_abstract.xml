 <p class="p">Manganese phosphate coating could be used to protect the surface of steel products. However, it is essential to determine the effects which process parameters, as well as the types of additives used, have on the efficiency of coating deposition. Thus, we present here a process of phosphatization of low-alloy steel (for 15 min at 95 °C) in manganese/nickel baths followed by a passivation process with the use of a silicon and zircon compounds. The microstructure and morphology of the surface were analyzed by SEM EDX and XRD methods. The obtained results showed that the manganese phosphate could be effectively formed at 95 °C in the solution containing nickel and guanidine derivatives. Anodic polarization of manganese coating was investigated in 0.5 M KCl by the analysis of polarization resistance. The effects of the activation process on corrosion properties of the coating have been examined. It was observed that an increased concentration of activating substances in the activation bath results in the enhancement of corrosion resistance.</p>
