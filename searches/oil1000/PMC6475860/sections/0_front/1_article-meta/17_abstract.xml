 <p class="p">The proximate, minerals, vitamins, amino acid, alkaloids, phytosterols, carotenoids, glycosides and saponins profiles of the leaves and stems of 
  <italic class="italic">Pandiaka heudelotii</italic> were determined using standard methods. The leaves and stems had high contents (g/100g) of fibre (10.3–12.9) and carbohydrate (47.2–55.3); and moderate protein (4.4–9.8) and crude fat (6.7–10.2); respectively, equivalent to 41.1–51.6%, 15.7–17.8%, 8.8–19.6%, 10.3–15.7% of the corresponding daily values. They had high contents of iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, vitamins C, E and B2, alkaloids, glycosides, carotenoids, saponins; and moderate phytosterol. Their proteins had high contents of essential amino acids (42.6–48.5%). Triacetonamine (57.20–60.13%), nicotiflorin (53.45–55.35%), carotene (49.95–51.94%), liquiritin (57.54–62.34%), and sitosterol (82.84–85.03%) were respectively, the most abundant alkaloids, glycosides, carotenoids, saponins and phytosterols detected. This result indicates that the leaves and stems are good sources of nutraceuticals and nutrients for human nutrition. It provides an insight into the nature of its bioactive components.
