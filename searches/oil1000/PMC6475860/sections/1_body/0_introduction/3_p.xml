 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ifeanacho etÂ al. (2017)</xref> reported the profile of phenolic compounds in the leaves and stems of 
 <italic class="italic">Pandiaka heudelotii</italic>. They reported that the leaves and stems had high contents of flavonoids and benzoic acid derivatives, and moderate contents of lignans and hydroxycinnamates. Presently, there is no information in the biochemical literature regarding the nutrients, allicins, alkaloids, phytosterols, carotenoids, glycosides and saponins compositions of the leaves and stems of this wild vegetable. Therefore, this study investigated the composition of these compounds in the leaves and stems of 
 <italic class="italic">Pandiaka heudelotii</italic> with a view to providing information on their potential as sources of nutrients and nutraceuticals. The pharmacological significance of these bioactive constituents is also discussed herein.
