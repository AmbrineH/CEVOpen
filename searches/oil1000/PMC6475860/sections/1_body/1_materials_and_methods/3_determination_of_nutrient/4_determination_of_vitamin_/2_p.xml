 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AOAC International, 2006</xref>). Chromatographic analysis was performed with an HP 6890 (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE, USA) Series gas chromatograph equipped with a pulse flame photometric detector and a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. column coated with a 0.25 μm film of DB- 5MS, and powered with HP ChemStation Rev. A09.01[1206] Software. Split injection (split ratio 20:1) was performed, with nitrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 m/s. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C for 2 min after injection, and then ramped at 10 °C/min for 20 min, followed by another ramping at 15 °C/min for 4 min. The injection port and detector temperatures were 250 and 320 °C respectively. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 137.90 and 262.00 kPa. Calculations were based on analysis of standard mixtures and calculation of individual correction coefficients.
