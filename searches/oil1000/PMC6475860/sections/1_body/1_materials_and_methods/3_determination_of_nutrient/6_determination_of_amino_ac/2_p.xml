<p id="p0045" class="p">The extraction of the amino acids was carried out according to AOAC Method 982.30 (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AOAC International, 2006</xref>). The sample was dried to a constant weight, defatted, hydrolysed, and concentrated to 1.0 mL. The concentrated hyrolysate was derivatised before being subjected to gas chromatography analysis on an HP 6890 (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE, USA) Series gas chromatograph equipped with a pulse flame photometric detector and a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. column coated with a 0.25 μm film of HP-5 and powered with HP ChemStation Rev. A09.01[1206] Software. A split injection was adopted at a split ratio of 20:1. The carrier gas used was hydrogen at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The inlet and detector temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The column and compressed air pressures were respectively 137.90 and 241.32 kPa. The oven was programmed initially at 60 °C, ramped at 8 °C/min for 20 min, maintained for 2 min and then ramp again at 12 °C/min for 6 min, before maintaining for 2 min.
