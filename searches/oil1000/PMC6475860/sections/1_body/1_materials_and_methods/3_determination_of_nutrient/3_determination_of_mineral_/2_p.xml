 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Motsara and Roy, 2008</xref>). The samples were ashed and digested with nitric acid, before being analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically by the vanadium molybdate method (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>; and the resultant orthophosphates was made to react with molybdate and vanadate in Vanadomolybdate Reagent, to form a yellow-coloured vanadomolybdophosphoric complex whose intensity (which is directly proportional to the concentration of phosphorus present in the sample) was read at 420 nm in a spectrophotometer.
