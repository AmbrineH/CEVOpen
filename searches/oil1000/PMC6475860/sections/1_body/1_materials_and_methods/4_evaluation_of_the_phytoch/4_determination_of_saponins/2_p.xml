<p id="p0070" class="p">The extraction of the saponins was carried out according 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al. (2009)</xref>. The resultant extract was subjected to gas chromatography on a DB-225MS column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. The inlet and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio) using nitrogen as carrier gas. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 193.05 and 275.79 kPa respectively. The oven temperature was run initially at 60 °C for 5 min, ramped at 12 °C/min for 18 min, and ramped again at 15 °C/min for 5 min.
