<p id="p0060" class="p">Gas chromatography was carried out at Multi Environmental Management Consultants Limited, Igbe Road, Ikorodu, Lagos, with a Hewlett Packard HP 6890, gas chromatograph, fitted with a flame ionization detector (except for allicins analysis, in which pulse flame photometric detector was used), and powered with HP Chemstation Rev. A09.01[1206] software, to identify and quantify compounds. Standards were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and Lynnchem Biological Technology Co. Standard solutions were prepared in methanol for alkaloids and allicins; in acetone for carotenoids; in methylene chloride for phytosterols; and in ethanol for glycosides and saponins. The linearity of the dependence of response on concentration was verified by regression analysis. Identification was based on comparison of retention times and spectral data of the standards. Quantification was performed by creating calibration curves for each compound determined, using the standards.</p>
