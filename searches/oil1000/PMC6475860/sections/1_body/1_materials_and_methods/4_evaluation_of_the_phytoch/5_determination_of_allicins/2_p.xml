 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chehregani et al. (2007)</xref>. The resultant extract was subjected to gas chromatography on an OV-101 column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.30 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. The injection and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio), using helium as carrier gas at a pressure of 206.84 kPa. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 193.05 and 268.90 kPa respectively. The oven temperature was run initially at 80 °C for 5 min. The first ramping was at 10 °C/min for 5 min, maintained for 4 min; and the second ramping at 10 °C/min for 5 min, maintained for 4 min.
