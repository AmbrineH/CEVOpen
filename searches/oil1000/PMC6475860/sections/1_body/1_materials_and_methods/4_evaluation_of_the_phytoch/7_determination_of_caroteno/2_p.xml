 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takagi (1985)</xref>. The resultant extract was subjected to gas chromatography on an AC-5 column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. Inlet and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio), with nitrogen as carrier gas. Hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 206.8 and 275.8 kPa respectively. Oven temperature was run initially at 60 °C, ramped at 10 °C/min for 20 min, maintained for 2 min; ramped again at 15 °C/min for 4 min and maintained for 4 min.
