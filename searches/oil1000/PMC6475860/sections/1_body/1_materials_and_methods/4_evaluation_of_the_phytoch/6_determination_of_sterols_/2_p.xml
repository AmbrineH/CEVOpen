 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AOAC International, 2006</xref>). The resultant extract, after saponification and removal of nonsaponifiables, was subjected to gas chromatography on a HP INNOWax column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. The inlet and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio), using nitrogen as carrier gas. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 151.68 and 241.32 kPa respectively. The oven temperature was run initially at 60 °C. It was then ramped at 10 °C/min for 20 min, maintained for 4 min; ramped again at 15 °C/min for 4 min, and maintained for 10 min.
