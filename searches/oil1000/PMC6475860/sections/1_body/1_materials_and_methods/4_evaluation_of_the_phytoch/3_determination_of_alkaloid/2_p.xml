 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ngounou et al. (2005)</xref>. The resultant extract was subjected to gas chromatography on a DB-5MS column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. The inlet and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio), using nitrogen as carrier gas. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 193.05 and 262.00 kPa respectively. The oven temperature was run initially at 60 °C for 5 min, ramped at 10 °C/min for 20 min, and ramped again at 15 °C/min for 4 min.
