 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oluwaniyi and Ibiyemi (2007)</xref>. The resultant extract was subjected to gas chromatography on an AC-5 column capillary of dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness. The inlet and detection temperatures were 250 and 320 °C. The equipment was run on split injection (20:1 split ratio) using nitrogen as carrier gas. The hydrogen and compressed air pressures were 193.05 and 275.79 kPa respectively. The oven temperature was run initially at 70 °C for 5 min, and ramped at 12 °C/min for 20 min.
