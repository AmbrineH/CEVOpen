 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>b). Seven known saponins were detected, including liquiritin (57.54% in leaves; 62.34% in stems), liquritigenin (37.21% in leaves; 33.72% in stems), isoliquiritigenin (5.25% in leaves; 3.94% in stems); with avenacin-A2, avenacin-B2, avenacin-A1 and avenacin-B1 making up less than 0.01%. Studies have shown that liquiritin, isoliquiritin and isoliquirigenin have anticancer effects, individually and in a combination of the three of them (
