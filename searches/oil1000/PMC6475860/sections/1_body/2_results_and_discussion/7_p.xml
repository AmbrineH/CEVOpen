<p id="p0130" class="p">Amino acid profile, and DIAA reference ratios of the leaf and stem proteins are given in Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. They are rich in essential amino acids, 48.5% for leaves and 42.6% for stems [especially isoleucine (in leaves and stems), aromatic amino acids (leaves), threonine (leaves and stems), leucine (leaves) and histidine (leaves)] and can meet the daily requirements (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2013</xref>) for essential amino acids (except leucine, in the case of the stem protein), for children (≥6 months), adolescents and adults. Compared to WHO reference protein patterns for infant (≤6 months), child (6 months–3 years), older child, adolescent, adult (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2013</xref>), the DIAAS of the leaf protein were 47.6, 57.6 and 68.4 respectively, with lysine as limiting amino acid. Those of the stem protein were 23.9, 34.7 and 37.6, with leucine as limiting amino acid. Every 100 g of these proteins contained 32.0 g (for leaves) and 23.9 g (for stems) of essential amino acids; 1.9 g (for leaves) and 1.5 g (stems) of sulphur-containing amino acids; and 6.5 g (leaves) and 4.0 g (stems) of aromatic amino acids (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The leaf protein can be used for supplementation of isoleucine, aromatic amino acids and threonine in diets of children (≥6 months), adolescents and adults, and histidine and leucine in older children, adolescent and adults; while the stems can be used for isoleucine and threonine in children (≥6 months), adolescents and adults.
