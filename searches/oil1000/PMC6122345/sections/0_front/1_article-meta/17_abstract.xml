 <p class="p">This study focused on characterizing the Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic fractions of 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> in the context of cancer prevention and therapy. The goal was also to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved and to determine its efficacy against cancer by triggering apoptosis and suppressing tumorigenesis in human colon cancer. The data here clearly demonstrated that oily fractions of 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> act as free radical scavengers, antibacterial agent and inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116, U266, SCC4, Panc28, KBM5, and MCF-7 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The results of live/dead and colony formation assays further revealed that 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium</italic> essential oil has the efficacy to suppress the growth of colon carcinoma cells. In addition, essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> induced apoptosis, as indicated by cleavage of caspases-3, -8, and -9 and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase. Moreover, 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> essential oil suppressed gene expression involved in survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in human colon cancer cells. No sign of toxicity was detected 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> after treatment with increasing concentrations of essential oil. Oral administration of T.alopecurus inhibited LPS-induced colon inflammation. This anticancer property of this specie 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> fractions could be due to their phenolic and/or sesquiterpene content (d-limonene, Î±-Bisabolol, Humulene, Thymol, and (+)-epi-Bicyclosesquiphellandrene). Hence our study reveals the anticancer activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> oil mediated through the suppression of cell growth, cell proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis of cancer cells. Thus, it has potential to be developed as an anticancer agent; however more 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies are warranted.
