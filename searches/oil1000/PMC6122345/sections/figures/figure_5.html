 <p> TA-1 suppresses ( Ai, Bi) antiapoptotic, ( Aii, Aiii, Bii, Biii) proliferative, and metastatic gene products and ( Aiv, Biv) inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation in HCT-116 cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. TA-1 had no effect on HUVECs cells (Aiii). TA-2 suppresses ( Ci) antiapoptotic and ( Cii) metastatic gene products. The cells were treated with the concentrations of TA-1or TA-2 indicated for 24 h. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane using the antibodies indicated. These are representative results of three independent experiments. </p>
