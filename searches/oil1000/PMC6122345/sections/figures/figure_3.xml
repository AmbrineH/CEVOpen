  <title class="title">Tumor cells were treated with different concentrations of TA-1 and TA-2</title>
  <p class="p">Cells were stained with the Live/Dead reagent (5 mM ethidium homodimer and 5 mM calcein AM) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Percentages are proportions of apoptotic cancer cells. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Viable cells are green and non-viable cells are red. Magnification = 20×.</p>
