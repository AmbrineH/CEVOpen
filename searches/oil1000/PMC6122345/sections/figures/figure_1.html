 <p> ( A) Chemical structures of the major compounds of Hydrophobic (TA-1) (i) and Hydrophilic (TA-2) (ii) fractions of Teucrium alopecurus; ( B) Phenolic content (i) and antiradical potential of TA-1 and TA-2 using DPPH (ii) and FRAP (iii) assay; ( C) Antibacterial activity of hydrophobic fraction of Teucrium alopecurus. Plant essential oil (1 μl) were applied per disc (Whatman No 5 mm) onto the seeded top layer of the agar plates containing tested bacteria ( E.coli, S.aureus, B.subtilis and K.pneumoniae). Essential oil was tested with a Chloramphenicol, and Ertapenem discs as positive controls. DMSO discs were used as negative controls. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and zone of inhibition was determined. ( D) Effect of TA-1 and TA-2 on RAW cell viability. RAW 264.7 cells, seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates, were pre-treated with the concentrations of TA-1 (0.5, 1, 5, 10 pg/mL) (i) and TA-2 (30, 50, 70, 100 μg/mL) (ii) and incubated for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Cell viability was analyzed with the MTT assay. ( E) Effect of TA-1 and TA-2 on tumor cell proliferation. KBM-5, HCT-116, Panc-28, MCF-7, U266, and SCC4 cells (5 × 10 3 cells/well) were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates, treated with different concentrations of TA-1 (0.5, 1, 5, 10 pg/mL) and TA-2 (30, 50, 70, 100 μg/mL); cell growth was analyzed on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 by tetrazolium salt 3-(4-5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)2-5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results show the mean ± SD values. These are representative results of three independent experiments. </p>
