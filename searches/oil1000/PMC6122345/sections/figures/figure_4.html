 <p> TA-1 and TA-2 induces caspase activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in HCT-116 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner ( A) Whole-cell extracts of HCT-116 and HUVECs cells were treated with different concentrations of TA-1 and then analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated and ( B) HCT-116 Cells were treated with 200 pg/mL TA-1 for the indicated times, and whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed using the indicated antibodies. These are representative results of three independent experiments. </p>
