 <p> ( A) Effects of TA-1 and TA-2 on the clonogenic potential of tumor cells; cells were plated in six-well plates in FBS-containing medium, then exposed to different concentrations of TA-1 and TA-2. At this point, the drug treatments were washed out and replaced with fresh medium. The ability of individual cells to form colonies was assessed 9 days posttreatment. ( B) TA-1 induces ROS production. HCT-116 (1 Ã— 10 6 cells) were labeled with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), treated with the concentrations of TA-1 and TA-2 indicated for 1 h, and then examined for ROS production by flow cytometer. * is the significance of difference compared with vehicle control; p &lt; 0.05. These are representative results of three independent experiments. </p>
