 <p> TA-1 induces PARP cleavage and caspases activation and suppresses the expression of gene products involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis in ( A) Panc28- and MIA PACA-2 cells, ( B) KBM5 and U266 cells, ( C) and HL60 cells. The cells were treated with the concentrations of TA-1 indicated for 24 h. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane using the antibodies indicated. These are representative results of three independent experiments. </p>
