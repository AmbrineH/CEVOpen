   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Effects of TA-1 and TA-2 on the clonogenic potential of tumor cells; cells were plated in six-well plates in FBS-containing medium, then exposed to different concentrations of TA-1 and TA-2. At this point, the drug treatments were washed out and replaced with fresh medium. The ability of individual cells to form colonies was assessed 9 days posttreatment. (
