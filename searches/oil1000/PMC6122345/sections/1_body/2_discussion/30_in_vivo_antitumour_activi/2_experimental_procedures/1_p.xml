<p class="p">The essential oil used in this report was dissolved in 2% Tween 80 and given to mice intragastrically once a day for 7 consecutive days. At the beginning of the experiment, the mice were divided into eight groups (6 mice per group) as follows: Group 1 : mice treated by intragastrically administration of vehicle (2% Tween 80 in distilled water); Group 2: served as positive (tumor) control, mice treated by intragastrically administration of LPS (

The treatments were started daily, one hours before LPS treatment; Group 5: served as comparator control, mice treated by intragastrically administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (20 mg/kg/day). Group 6: TA-1 LD combined with LPS (TA-1 LD + LPS) (10 μg/kg, body weight/day and 10 μg/ml, respectively); Group 7: TA-1 HD combined with LPS (TA-1 HD + LPS) (20 μg/kg, body weight/day and 10 μg/ml, respectively); Group 8: 5-Fu combined with LPS (5-Fu + LPS) (20 mg/kg, body weight/day and 10 μg/ml, respectively). All the treatments were given orally once daily for 7 days. After 7 days, the mice were euthanized; lung, spleen and colonic tissues were collected to be analyzed macroscopically and microscopically by Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining. The experiments were carried out according to Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals approved by the Animal Ethics Committee.
