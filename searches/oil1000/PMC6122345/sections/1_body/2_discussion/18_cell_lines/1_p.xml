<p class="p">The cell lines HCT-116, MiaPaca-2 (Human pancreatic carcinoma), Panc28, KBM-5, SCC4 (human head and neck cancer), MCF7, U266 (human multiple myeloma), HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), RAW 264.7 (mouse monocyte macrophage) and HUVECs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Human colon cancer cells, human pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, human head and neck cancer, and RAW cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HL-60 and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS; KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 15% FBS; and MCF-7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and no antibiotics. HUVECs cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All culture media were supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 Î¼g/mL streptomycin.</p>
