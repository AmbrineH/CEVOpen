<p class="p">In addition, Teucrium ethereal oil was also tested to see whether it was able to express proteins involved in the angiogenic phenotypes of cancer cells on tumor invasion and the metastasis of human colon cancer cells 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> by reducing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) levels and restoring vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as compared with control cells. MMP9 and ICAM-1 participate in the proteolytic degradation of tissue barriers [

 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], which depends on angiogenesis. The potent antiangiogenic effect of TA-1 investigated in HCT-116 was associated with significant inhibition of the protein expression level of antiâ€“vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus suggesting that this drug is a potent suppressor of tumor invasion through its action on VEGF, which induces angiogenesis by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase. Chidambara and co-workers [
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] investigated the antiangiogenic effect of d-limonene with a preventative effect on colon cancer. Jung 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] showed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) attenuated VEGF production through the inhibition of ERK-1 and ERK-2 kinases in human colon cancer cells. c-myc as a cell cycle component is down-regulated by teucrium essential oil, and this inhibition leads to growth arrest.
