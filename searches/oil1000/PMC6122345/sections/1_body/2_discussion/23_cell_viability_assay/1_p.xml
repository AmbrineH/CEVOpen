 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well) were seeded onto 96- well plates and incubated with different concentrations of Teucrium essential oil (0, 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 pg/mL) and water soluble fractions of Teucrium (0, 30, 50, 70, or 100 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO for 24, 48, or 72 h. MTT solution was added and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an MRX Revelation 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA).
