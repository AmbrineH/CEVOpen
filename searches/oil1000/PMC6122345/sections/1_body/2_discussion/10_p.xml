<p class="p">Some EOs and their components inhibit tumor cell survival through caspase activation, the induction of proapoptotic proteins, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Activating caspase-8 is associated with FLICE/caspase-8 inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) decreasing after treatment with teucrium essential oil, which also inhibited the cell survival of HCT-116 cells by downregulating the expression of cyclin D1, myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl-1), X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), IAP-1, IAP-2, and B cell lymphoma extra large (BcL-xL) levels. Bcl-2 protein is downregulated by the action of TA-1 on the HCT-116 cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results obtained here agreed with other reports that hydrophobic fractions extracted from many species are able to change the expression levels of Bcl-2 and
