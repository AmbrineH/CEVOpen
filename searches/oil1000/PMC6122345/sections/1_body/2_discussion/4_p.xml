<p class="p">The cytotoxic effects exhibited by essential oils could be related to an overall action of the compounds present in oils, especially to sesquiterpene compounds [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], phenols, alcohols, and monoterpene aldehydes [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. TA-1, with its bioactive compounds, and hydrosol elicit a cytotoxic effect by inhibiting cell viability. In the study done by El Hadri 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], α-humulene was found to be cytotoxic against MCF-7, HCT-116, and murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell lines. The cytotoxic potential of β-pinene was investigated in MCF-7, A375, and HepG2 cancer cells and in other different tumor and nontumor cell lines [
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In fact, the studies of the cytotoxicity of cancer cell lines towards essential oils demonstrate a great difference between them with respect to their sensitivity to the substances contained in the oily fraction [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] of TA-1.
