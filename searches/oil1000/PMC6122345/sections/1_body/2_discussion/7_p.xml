<p class="p">TA-1 and TA-2 were found here to suppress the proliferation of various types of tumor cells. Based on the data in the literature, it is possible to hypothesize that the antiproliferative effect of oily fractions was correlated with major terpenes constituents, α-Bisabolol as a sesquiterpene alcohol, and (+)-epi-Bicyclosesquiphellandrene. In a further study on highly malignant glioma cells, Edris [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] evaluated that α-Bisabolol is considered a promising inducer of apoptosis. According to the work of Tyagi 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], β-sesquiphellandrene was found to have antiproliferative effects comparable to those of curcumin in human leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer cells. d-limonene, as a constituent of TA-1 in a small amount, is able to inhibit cell proliferation and enhance apoptosis [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Another sesquiterpene present in TA-1, namely λ-Humulene, has been identified for its pro-apoptotic activities, mainly against colorectal carcinoma [
