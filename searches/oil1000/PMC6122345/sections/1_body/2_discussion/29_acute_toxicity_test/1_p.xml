<p class="p">To evaluate the cytoxicity effect of TA-1, four groups of mice (6 mice per group), obtained from the experimental animal house, sfax, Tunisia, were given standard pellets and tap water and treated with increasing doses of the essential oil (0-10-20-30 Î¼g/kg). The essential oil administration was prepared by diluting the stock solution of TA-1 by mixing it with 2% Tween 80. After treatment, the animals were kept under observation daily for any behavioral changes, mortality or consumption of food and water. After 7 days, the mice were euthanized, and the liver and kidney tissues were used for macroscopically and histological overview.</p>
