<p class="p">It is interesting to note that inducing apoptosis depends on an extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is mitochondria dependent, whereas the extrinsic is triggered by death receptors (DRs) [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. PARP-1 cleavage induced by derivative compounds of EOs contributes to the change of the DNA repair process in the cancer cells [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage of PARP activated caspases and can be used to detect apoptosis [
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. TA-1 was found here to trigger an increase in the expression levels of cleaved-PARP, as well as caspases-3, -8 and, -9 dependent increases in apoptosis. Caspases are activated by proteolytic processing at sites that are themselves caspase consensus cleavage sites [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. An intrinsic pathway was activated in Limonene treated LS174T colon cancer cells [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>].
