<p class="p">Apoptosis was measured by Live/Dead assay, which determines the number of live and dead cells. After the treatment of various tumor cells (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>) with 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, or 0.05 pg/mL of TA-1 and 3.75, 5, 10, or 15 μg/mL of TA-2, the treated cells and untreated cells were stained with a a green fluorescent dye, a nonfluorescent polyanionic dye, calcein-AM, which is retained within live cells, and Ethidium homodimer dye, a red fluorescent that can enter cells through damaged membranes, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). After counting the live and dead cells, the percentage of cells in apoptosis in each sample was calculated.
