<p class="p">STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation from serine residues [
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In general, exposure to TA-1 is required to suppress the constitutive activation of STAT-3 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5(Aiv)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7D</xref>) in HCT-116 cells. It can induce a decrease of phosphorylated signal transducers and the levels of activators of transcription protein STAT-3 (at Tyr
 <sup class="sup">705</sup> and Ser
 <sup class="sup">727</sup>) in human colon cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This data is supported by another report showing the ability of STAT-3 to phosphorylate in HCT-116 cell lines [
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. STAT-3 is overexpressed in several tumor cells, including cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas and leukemia, brain tumors, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and pancreatic cancer [
