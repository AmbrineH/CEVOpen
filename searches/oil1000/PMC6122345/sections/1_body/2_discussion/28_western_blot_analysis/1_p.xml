<p class="p">Western blotting is used for the detection and analysis of proteins based on their ability to bend to specific antibodies. Cell extracts (treated and untreated cancer cells, normal cells) were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mM, Tris (pH 7.4), 250 Mm NaCl, 2 Mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (pH 8.0), 0.1% triton X-100, 0.01 μg/mL aprotinin, 0.005 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.4 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 Mm Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). To remove insoluble materials, we centrifuged lysates at 1400 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and kept at −80°C. Thirty μg of lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and the proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes where they were bound, forming the blot. After that, the membranes were probed overnight with relevant primary antibodies at 4°C. After the blotting process, the proteins were exposed to a thin surface layer for primary antibody detection. The dilution factors of antibodies are: c-Myc (1:2000), CXCR4 (1:5000), MMP-9 (1:1000), cIAP-1/2 (1:2000), Mcl-1 (1:3000), ICAM-1 (1:2000), Bcl-xL (1:2000), cyclin D1 (1:3000), caspase-3 (1:2000), -8 (1:2000) and -9 (1:2000), PARP (1:5000), Bcl-2 (1:3000), STAT-3 (1:3000), pSTAT3 (Tyr705 and Ser727) (1:2000), β-actin (1:10,000), XIAP (1:3000), c-FLIP (1:3000), survivin (1:2000), VEGF (1:1000),
