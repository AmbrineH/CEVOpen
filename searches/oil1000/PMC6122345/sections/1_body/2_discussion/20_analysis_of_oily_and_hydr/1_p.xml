 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> leaves were collected from Orbata Mountain, Gafsa, Tunisia. A voucher specimen was deposited in the National Institute of Agronomic of 
 <italic class="italic">Tunisia</italic> (INAT) Herbarium in Tunisia under registration number 1122. Decanted essential oil was separated, and the hydrosol was collected from the Clevenger distiller apparatus. To profile Teucrium essential oil and hydrosol bioactive compounds, GC/MS analysis was used. Different fractions were analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with an autosampler coupled with an Agilent 5973 Mass Selective 
 <italic class="italic">Detector</italic> (MSD) detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with an electron impact ionization of 70 eV. A Phenomenex ZB-5MSi capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.5 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, CA, USA) was used at a temperature programmed to rise from 40 to 280°C at a rate of 5°C/min. Helium (99.999% purity) was used as a gas carrier, with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min, a split ratio of 60:1, and a scan time and mass range of 1s and 50–550 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>, respectively. EOs were identified by matching the mass spectra recorded with those stored in the Wiley 09 NIST 2011 mass spectral library of the GC/MS data system.
