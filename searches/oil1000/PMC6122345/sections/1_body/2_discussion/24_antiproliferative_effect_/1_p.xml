<p class="p">The antiproliferative effect of TA-1 was assessed by MTT assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> cells per well were incubated with different concentrations of Teucrium essential oil (0, 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 pg/mL) and water soluble fractions of Teucrium (0, 30, 50, 70, or 100 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO for one, three, or five days in 96-well plates. Vehicle was considered as control. After treatment, the MTT solution was added to various tumor cells, which were incubated for 2 h at 37°C before adding the extraction buffer. The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an MRX Revelation 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA).
