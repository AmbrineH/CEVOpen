<p class="p">This study provides evidence for the therapeutic potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> essential oil to be used for the treatment of cancer. Thus, it up-regulates proapoptotic proteins and down-regulates cell survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in HCT-116 cells. Hydrolates obtained from this species have low potential as anti-cancer agents, and this may be due to low amounts of terpenes and phenolic compounds contained therein. Further studies in animals and humans will be required to demonstrate the relevance of these results obtained 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> to cancer treatment. Essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium</italic> is a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced colon inflammation.
