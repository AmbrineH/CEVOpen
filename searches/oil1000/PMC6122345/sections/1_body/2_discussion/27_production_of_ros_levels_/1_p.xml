<p class="p">Colon cancer cells (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells) cells were labeled with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (20 μM) and exposed to different concentrations of oily and soluble fractions of Teucrium species for 1 h. The increase in fluorescence resulting from the oxidation of DCF-DA to DCF was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The mean fluorescence intensity at 530 nm was calculated. The results were collected from at least 10,000 cells at a flow rate of 250–300 cells·s
