<p class="p">The treatment of various tumor cell cultures with TA-1 volatile oil and TA-2 hydrolate for 48 h induces a concentration-dependent decreased cell number, but each cell line showed different sensitivity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Exposing different tumor cells to various concentrations of oily (Left panel) and soluble fractions (Right panel) of teucrium induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells from 1% to âˆ¼100% and from 1% to 80%, respectively.
