<p class="p">As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>, mice were treated with TA-1 low dose (LD) and high dose (HD) 1 h before treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> 055:B5) as inflammatory agent (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8A</xref>) used to induce inflammation and cancer in colon cells. After experimental analysis, LPS was shown to induce body weight loss (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8B</xref>), inhibition of colon length (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8C</xref>), inflammation in colon (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8D</xref>) and other parts of digestive system (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), which have an effect on weight and color of feces. In addition, LPS induced damage in spleen and lung tissues (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8E</xref>) compared with control group. Whereas, the therapeutic effect of essential oil was clearly investigated. We have found that TA-1 could effectively decrease the damage of colon, spleen and lung cells compared with comparator control group (5-Fu). The results indicated that 5-Fu could reduce the inflammation of colon cells which increased by LPS.
