<p class="p">Treatment with hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of Teucrium suppresses the clonogenic potential of colon cancer cells. HCT-116 cell lines were very resistant to low and high concentrations of TA-2, showing only âˆ¼5% reduction in clonogenic potential (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2(Ai)</xref>). However, treatment with a high concentration of TA-1 caused nearly 100% inhibition (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2(Aii)</xref>). KBM5 cells were very sensitive to both high concentrations of TA-2 and various concentrations of TA-1.
