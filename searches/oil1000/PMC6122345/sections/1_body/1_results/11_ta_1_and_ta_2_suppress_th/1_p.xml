<p class="p">The down-regulation of multiple gene products obtained from the western blot analysis of the TA-1 effect explains a molecular mechanism of blocking gene expression in response to teucrium essential oil treatment in a concentration-dependent (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5 (Ai–Aiii)</xref>) and time-dependent (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5 (Bi–Biii)</xref>) manner. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5Av</xref>, no expression of gene products in HUVECs cells was detected after treatment with TA-1. Western blotting and relative densitometric analyses of the suppression of antiapoptotic, proliferative, and metastatic gene products and the inhibition of Signal transducer (STAT3) phosphorylation cellular levels by TA-1 essential oil in HCT-116 cell lines at different concentrations and time points are shown in
