 <italic class="italic">Teucrium</italic>. Breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and pancreatic carcinoma (Panc28) cells are the most sensitive to TA-1 at 5 and 10 pg/mL between three and five days and present low cell growth compared to the vehicle control (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1E</xref>, upper panel). Chronic myelogenous leukemia (KBM-5) and human colon cancer cells (HCT116) cells have a moderate sensitivity to this essential oil. In addition, TA-2 suppresses the proliferation of cancer cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1D</xref>, lower panel).
