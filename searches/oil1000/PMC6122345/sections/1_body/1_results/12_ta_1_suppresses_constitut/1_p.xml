<p class="p">Colorectal cancer cells express constitutively active STAT3 [
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Upon exposing tumor cells to various concentrations of essential oils, prepared cell lysates were investigated for the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr
 <sup class="sup">705</sup>) and (Ser
 <sup class="sup">727</sup>) and performed by western blot analysis. Interestingly, these results show the concentration- and time-dependent repression of STAT-3 activation induced by TA-1 in HCT-116 cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5 (Aiv, Biv)</xref>). The maximum inhibitory activity occurred at 100 pg/mL, and the optimum time for the repression of STAT3 phosphorylation was at 24 h.
