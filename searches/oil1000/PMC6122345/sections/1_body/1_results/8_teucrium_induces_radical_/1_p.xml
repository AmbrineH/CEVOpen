<p class="p">The oily fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> was able to induce ROS generation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>). A significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increase in ROS levels at higher doses of 0.1 μg/mL (MFI 125.4) and 0.2 μg/mL (MFI 142.4) TA-1 compared to the control (MFI 114.2) was observed in colon cancer cells (Left panel). However, very low amounts (non-significant) of ROS were produced in HCT-116 treated with hydrophilic fractions of teucrium (Right panel).
