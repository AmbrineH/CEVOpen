<p class="p">The essential oils and hydrolats of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Forty-eight compounds were identified and listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. Essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> showed that sesquiterpenes are the most abundant skeletons. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1Ai</xref> shows that TA-1 is mainly composed of (+)-epi-Bicyclo sesquiphellandrene, α-Bisabolol, T-Muurolol, α-Cadinol, β- Phellandrene, and d-limonene (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1(Ai)</xref>). Of these terpene compounds, the most abundant was α-Bisabolol (16.16%). However, organic compounds were the only components of TA-2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1(Aii)</xref>). It was noted that a small amount of essential oil was dissolved in the hydrosol. Distillation with a Clevenger apparatus completely extracted the essential oils and led to no loss of volatile molecules from
