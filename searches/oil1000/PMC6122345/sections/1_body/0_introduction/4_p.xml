<p class="p">This report describes novel insight into the curative effect of hydrophobic fraction of Teucrium on cancer. 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> (H'chichit ben salem), widely used in traditional medicine, is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. The chemical investigation of the aerial parts has yielded bioactive compounds. Earlier studies showed that some of these compounds inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. Our goal in this report was to investigate the possible use of essential oil (TA-1) and hydrolate (TA-2) of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium alopecurus</italic> as an alternative complementary cancer treatment, and, in order to elucidate its potential activity and the mechanisms underlying these effects, this species was tested on colorectal carcinogenesis 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>.
