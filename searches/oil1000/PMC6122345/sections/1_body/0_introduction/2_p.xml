 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and have been shown to potentially halt cancer progression by targeting one or more steps in the cell cycle [

Natural products such as terpenes, a class of molecules characterized by the presence of multiple terpenic groups in their structural moiety, have emerged as alternatives to treat a broad range of human diseases, including particularly cancer and inflammation [
