<p class="p">Colonic carcinoma, a multistage process that occurs over many years and is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, is the target of numerous anticancer therapies [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. This disease involves many proteins until the first step of the tumor to the ultimate stade. The combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with terpenes could be of great clinical importance in cancer therapy [

 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], evolves through a multistep process in which normal mucosa is first transformed into adenomatous polyps and then eventually into invasive carcinoma [
