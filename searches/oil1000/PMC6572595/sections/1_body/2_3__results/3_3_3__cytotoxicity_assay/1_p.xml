<p class="p">HGFs were treated or not (control) with different concentrations of TC and CLP for 48 h. The cell viability in the presence of the investigated compounds was assayed. Using one-way ANOVA, no significant differences (

In addition, both TC liposome (100 μg/mL) and TC PG-PEVs (100 μg/mL), as well as CLP liposome (100 μg/mL) treated cells exhibited a significant increase in cell viability, as compared to untreated cells (
