<p class="p">Antimicrobial susceptibility tests on discs impregnated with 15 Î¼L of each sample showed that TC had an inhibition capacity towards the tested microorganisms. Also, this preliminary screening demonstrated that TC in the nanovesicles had similar antibacterial effects to the raw essential oil. The raw CLP extract did not display any antimicrobial activity, neither against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> nor 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. Conversely, when CLP extract was delivered by the nanovesicles, the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> increased, while it remained ineffective against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. In
