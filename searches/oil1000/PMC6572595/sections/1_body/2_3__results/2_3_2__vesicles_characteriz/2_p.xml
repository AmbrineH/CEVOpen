 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-11-00234-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. TC essential oil and CLP extract loaded liposomes were around 86 and 137 nm, respectively. The addition of glycerol (glycerosomes) or propylene glycol (PG-PEVs) led to an increase in size, which was more significant when using TC essential oil. Regardless of the composition of the vesicles, the polydispersity index, which is a dimensionless measure of the broadness of the size distribution, was always ≤0.3, thus indicating a homogeneous distribution of the vesicle size in the dispersions. The zeta potential of the vesicles was generally highly negative, predicting a good stability of the vesicle dispersions during storage. Indeed, the long-term stability studies (60 days at 4 °C) showed that the variation in the vesicle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential were never greater than 10%.
