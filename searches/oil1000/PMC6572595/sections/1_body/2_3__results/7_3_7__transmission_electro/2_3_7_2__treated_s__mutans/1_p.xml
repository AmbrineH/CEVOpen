<p class="p">When treated with TC essential oil, the cluster of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> showed a high range of degenerated cells. The cells appeared swollen and deformed with a clearly observed rupture of CW and PM in addition to cytoplasm degeneration up to cell disintegration (

 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> showed morphological aspects of degeneration comparable to those described in the cells treated with TC essential oil (

 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> showed a well-conserved morphology in comparison to the control, whereas after contact with glicerosomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00234-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>E), the cells showed characteristic enlargement of the wideness between the CW and PM, and after PG-PEV contact (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00234-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>F), the cells appeared surrounded by dense globules infiltrating the CW and displayed perforation of the CW and membrane. Occasional aspects of cell degeneration were also reported using PG-PEVs.
