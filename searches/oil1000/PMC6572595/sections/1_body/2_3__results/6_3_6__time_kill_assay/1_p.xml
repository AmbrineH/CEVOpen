<p class="p">A time-kill assay was used to further evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the samples. Despite its subjective character, the MIC assay is used to judge the performance of the other methods of susceptibility testing [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In our case, MICs for raw TC essential oil and loaded in nanovesicles against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> ranged from &lt;0.078 mg/mL to &gt;2.5 mg/mL, while MICs against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ranged from 0.25 mg/mL to &gt;2.5 g/mL. Thus, because of the wide range of MICs, we identified the MICs of raw TC against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> (0.5 mg/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (0.25 mg/mL) as suitable concentrations to conduct a time-course of microbial viability for TC essential oil loaded in vesicles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-11-00234-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, microbial viability for non-incorporated CLP extract and that loaded in vesicles against the target microorganisms was conducted as MICs for the bacteria and the yeast (0.625 mg/mL). The results demonstrated that the inoculum of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> was reduced to 11% within 3 h after the addition of raw TC essential oil; and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>â€™ viability was inhibited to 30% after 3 h of exposure to the raw oil. Raw CLP extract reduced the viability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> to 18%, whereas it was not able to inhibit the yeast significantly within the 3 h of this experimentation. The nanovesicles, regardless of the loaded TC essential oil or CLP extract, at the tested concentrations of MICs could arrest neither the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> nor that of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, except for CLP in PG-PEVs, which showed an inhibition ability towards the yeast (
