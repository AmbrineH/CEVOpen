<p class="p">On the bases of the data obtained in this study, TC essential oil possesses the highest antimicrobial capacity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. CLP extract showed bactericidal properties against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, but it was not effective as a fungicidal compound. Regardless of the extract loaded, glycerosomes and PG-PEVs behaved similarly against both the bacterium and the yeast.
