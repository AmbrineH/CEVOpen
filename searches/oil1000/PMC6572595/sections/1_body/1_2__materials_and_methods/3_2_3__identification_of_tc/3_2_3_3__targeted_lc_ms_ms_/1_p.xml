<p class="p">Liquid chromatography was performed by using a Flexar UHPLC AS system (Perkin-Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) equipped with a degasser, Flexar FX-10 pump, autosampler, and PE 200 column Oven interfaced to an AB Sciex (Foster City, CA, USA) API4000 Q-Trap instrument as in Manconi et al. [

The chromatographic separation was carried out on a XSelect HSS C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) (100 × 2.1 mm i.d., 2.5 μm d). Mobile phase A was water containing 0.1% formic acid, while mobile phase B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. Elution was carried out at 41 °C according to the following flow and solvent gradient: 0–4 min, isocratic 0% solvent B and the flow changes from 300 μL to 350 μL; 4–6 min, linear gradient 0–12% B and the flow achieves 400 μL/min; 6–12 min, linear gradient 12–20% B and flow constant at 400 μL/min; 16–17 min, linear gradient 20–100% B and flow retrieves to 300 μL/min.
