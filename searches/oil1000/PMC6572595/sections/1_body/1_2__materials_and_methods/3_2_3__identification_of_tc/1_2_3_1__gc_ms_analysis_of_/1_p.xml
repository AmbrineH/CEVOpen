<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of a TC essential oil solution in hexane (dilution ratio 1:200 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, injection volume 1 μL) was carried out by using an Agilent 7890 GC (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a Gerstel MPS autosampler, coupled with an Agilent 7000C MSD detector (Palo Alto, CA, USA). The chromatographic separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.17 μm), and the following temperature program was used: 60 °C hold for 3 min, increased to 210 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, held at 210 °C for 15 min, increased to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and finally held at 300 °C for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The data was analyzed using a MassHunter Workstation B.06.00 SP1, with identification of the individual components performed by comparison with the co-injected pure compounds and by matching the MS fragmentation patterns and retention indices with literature data or commercial mass spectral libraries (NIST/EPA/NIH 2008; HP1607 purchased from Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
