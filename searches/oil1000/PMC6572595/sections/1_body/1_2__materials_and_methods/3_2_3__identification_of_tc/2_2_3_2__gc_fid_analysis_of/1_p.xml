<p class="p">The GC-FID analysis of a TC essential oil solution in hexane (dilution ratio 1:200 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, injection volume 1 μL) was carried out by using an Agilent 4890N (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a FID and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.17 μm). The column temperature was held at 60 °C for 3 min, then increased to 210 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and held at 210 °C for 15 min, then increased to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and finally held at 300 °C for 15 min. Injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The compound quantification in the essential oil was carried out by the internal normalization of FID chromatogram. Results were expressed as a relative percentage.
