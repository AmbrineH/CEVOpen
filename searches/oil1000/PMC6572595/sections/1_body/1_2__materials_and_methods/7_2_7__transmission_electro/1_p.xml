<p class="p">The ultramorphology of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> after contact with the raw extracts and the extract loaded vesicles, using MIC values, was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell suspensions of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were aseptically removed from the cultures. Each culture was divided into two groups, one of which was left untreated (control), while the other group (treated) was further subdivided into four subgroups for microorganism species, each of which was treated at the MIC of each bioactive agent as for the time-kill assay. Thereafter, both the subgroups and the controls were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, all the cell material was harvested by centrifugation and prefixed with a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C. As in previous studies under TEM [

 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], the pellets were washed in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and washed twice in cacodylate buffer, dehydrated using ethanol in increasing concentrations (25–100%), embedded in epoxy resin to make the blocks of the cell pellets, cut into ultra-thin sections (80 μm in thickness) using a Diatome diamond knife, and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Samples were placed on 50 mesh copper grids and observed under TEM (Zeiss 109 EM Turbo, Königsallee, Göttingen, Germany).
