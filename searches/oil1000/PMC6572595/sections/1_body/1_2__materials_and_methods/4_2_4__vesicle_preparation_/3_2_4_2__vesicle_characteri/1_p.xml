<p class="p">The average diameter and polydispersity index (PI; a measure of width of the size distribution) of the vesicles were determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy using a Zetasizer nano (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Samples (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) were backscattered by a helium-neon laser (633 nm) at an angle of 173° and a constant temperature of 25 °C. The zeta potential of the vesicles, an indicator of the stability of vesicular dispersions, was estimated by using the Zetasizer nano by means of the M3-PALS (phase analysis light scattering) technique, which measures the particle electrophoretic mobility. Prior to the analysis, the samples (10 μL) were diluted with the appropriate mixture (i.e., water or water/glycerol or water/propylene glycol, 10 mL). A long-term stability study was performed by monitoring the vesicle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential over 60 days at 4 °C.
