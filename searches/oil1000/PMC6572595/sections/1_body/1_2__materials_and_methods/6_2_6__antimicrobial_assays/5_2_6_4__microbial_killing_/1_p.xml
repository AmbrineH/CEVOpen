<p class="p">Time-dependent killing of the raw extracts and the nanovesicles were identified against standardized microbial inocula of

 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Microorganisms in a logarithmic phase of growth were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Dulbecco A; pH 7.3), and resuspended at the density of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> colony-forming units (cfu)/mL in appropriate volumes of PBS containing suitable concentrations of each bioactive agent. An inoculum of microorganisms in PBS without any antimicrobial was used as a control and was included in each assay. After the inoculation, the suspensions were incubated at 37 °C. At time zero and at predetermined intervals (1, 2, and 3 h), 0.5 mL of the mixtures were aseptically removed and subjected to serial 10-fold dilution in PBS; aliquots of 1 mL of the appropriate dilutions were then placed in petri dishes (90 mm diameter) and 19 mL of molten MHA or Sabouraud Dextrose were added for 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, respectively, swirling thoroughly. The plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C; the number of viable microorganisms at each time was evaluated by counting plates with 30 to 300 colonies. These evaluations were done in duplicate.
