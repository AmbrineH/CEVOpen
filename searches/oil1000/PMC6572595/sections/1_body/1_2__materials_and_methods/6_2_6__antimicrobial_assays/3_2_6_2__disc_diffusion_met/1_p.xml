<p class="p">The assessment of the antimicrobial activity of the raw extracts and that of the corresponding extracts incorporated in the nanovesicles was carried out using the disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Sterile Whatman filter paper discs of a 6 mm diameter were impregnated with 15 μL of each sample in a sterile biological safety cabinet. The discs were then aseptically placed in the center of inoculated petri plates (9 cm in diameter) uniformly spread with 0.1 mL of the overnight culture of each microorganism. The plates were refrigerated at 4 °C for 2 h to allow the samples to diffuse into the agar medium and then incubated upside down at 37 °C for 48 h. The tests were conducted in triplicate and the measurement of the inhibition zones was read at 24 and 48 h. A paper disc without antimicrobials was used as a positive control for the growth of the microorganisms. Gentamycin (10 mg/disc; Gibco) and Ketoconazole (10 mg/disc; Janssen Pharmaceutics) were used as negative controls for bacterial and fungal strains, respectively. The scale applied for the measurement of the antimicrobial activity as the zone of inhibition was as follows (disc diameter included): Not sensitive (−) for total zone diameters ≤ 12 mm; sensitive (+) for diameters ranging between 12 and 19 mm; extremely sensitive (+++) for zone diameters ≥ 20 mm. The bioassays were conducted in a biological safety cabinet in accordance with the protocols of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [
