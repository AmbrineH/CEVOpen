<p class="p">The MIC, MBC, and MFC of the raw extracts and that of the nanovesicles against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were determined using a broth microdilution method according to standard guidelines [

 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In 96-well microtiter trays, each sample was subjected to two-fold serial dilutions (2.5–0.078 mg/mL) in MHA or Sabouraud Destrose Liquid Medium for bacteria and yeasts, respectively, and the wells were inoculated with 10

 <sup class="sup">4</sup> bacteria or yeast cells from 24 h broth cultures; the plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of each sample that completely inhibited microorganisms’ growth. MBCs and MFCs were determined by sub-culturing small aliquots (10 μL) of the suspensions from wells not showing microbial onto solid media (MHA and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar for the bacteria and the yeast, respectively). The MBC and MFC values were defined as the lowest concentrations that produced no colonies on the agar plates.
