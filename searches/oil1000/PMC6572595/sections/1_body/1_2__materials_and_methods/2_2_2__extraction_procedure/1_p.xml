<p class="p">The essential oil was extracted from the fresh aerial parts of TC. The collected parts were put into a heated (30 Â°C) ventilated armoire (Memmert 260, Spinea, Venice, Italy) until dry. Then, 150 g of the dried parts were powdered by milling the matrix with a ball-mill (Retsh Emax, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) for 20 min, and steam-distilled for 2 h using a circulatory Clevenger-type apparatus (Merk KGaA, Dormstadt, Germany) according to the European Pharmacopoeia. The distillate was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the obtained essential oil was stored at low temperature until use. The chemical characterization of TC was conducted using a solution of the essential oil in hexane.</p>
