<p class="p">As proposed in the “ecological plaque hypothesis”, a carious lesion develops under changed environmental conditions, producing a corresponding disturbance to the stability of the resident microflora [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Changes occur when the frequency of fermentable dietary carbohydrate intake is increased. In such a situation, the biofilm spends more time at low pH, allowing

 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> contributes to the lowering of the pH and the growth of acidogenic species at the expense of the resident microflora [
