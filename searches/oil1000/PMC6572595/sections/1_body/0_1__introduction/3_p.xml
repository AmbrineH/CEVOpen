<p class="p">Within lipid-based carriers, lamellar vesicles are composed of phospholipids, drugs, and, in some cases, additive components, such as surfactants and co-solvents. The identification of the appropriate combination of vesicle components is a matter of intensive study. Phospholipid nanovesicles having high concentrations of glycerol as co-solvent (glycerosomes), and penetration enhancer-containing vesicles (PEVs) have demonstrated a high efficacy in carrying polyphenols. Indeed, PEVs were able to promote the penetration of the active components of
