<p class="p">Regarding CLP extract, the chromatographic technique coupled with mass spectrometry revealed it was rich in flavanones, flavones, and phenolic acid mainly represented by quinic acid (219.7 μg/mg), followed by neoeriocitrin (46.5 μg/mg), neohesperidin (44.6 μg/mg), naringin (23.8 μg/mg), and sinapic acid (30.1 μg/mg) [

Although the compounds in CLP extract belong to a different class with respect to the components found in TC essential oil, they exerted the antimicrobial activity in a similar way by reducing the growth and viability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, as demonstrated by the MIC and time-kill assays. This result is not in agreement with the disc diffusion assay, which seemed to demonstrate that CLP extract was unable to inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. We could explain the data as a misinterpretation of the therapeutic efficacy of the extract using the agar disc. In fact, it is well known that the inhibition halo is an effect of the capacity of the antimicrobial agent to diffuse into the agar, inhibiting germination and growth of the test microorganism. However, it is also possible that antimicrobial cationic agents could combine with the anionic agar polysaccharide gel [

Despite its bactericidal ability, CLP extract was not effective as fungicidal compound, as was evidenced by the MIC and time-kill assay (

A proteic partner in the phospholipid bilayer of the fungal membrane has been proposed for carvacrol. This interplay is similar to most antifungal therapies, e.g., azoles among others, which lead to a fungistatic effect [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In addition, antifungal therapies have side effects in humans and cause an increase in

Thus, although further studies are necessary, among them an assessment of whether emerging resistance could be developed using multiple exposures to TC essential oil, the fungicidal ability of this natural drug should be considered as a safe alternative to chemicals.
