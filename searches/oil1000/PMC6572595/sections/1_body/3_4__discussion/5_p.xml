<p class="p">Regarding phospholipid vesicles, TC essential oil and CLP extract loaded in liposomes did not display any antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> (MIC &gt; 2.5 mg/mL). Conversely, TC essential oil and CLP extract loaded in glycerosomes and PG-PEVs resulted in MICs that were unquantifiable, meaning that no bacteria growth was detectable under these experimental conditions, even at the lowest concentrations. Thus, it could be possible that glycerosomes and PG-PEVs exerted their antibacterial activities after the 3 h time limit of the kill assay, at which point the raw extracts were effective against the bacteria. It is likely that in some way, the vesicles might slow the release of the loaded bioactive molecules within that time. In addition, we could suppose that the extract transported by the vesicles was not the only factor in determining the toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. Under TEM, the prime target of glycerosomes and PG-PEVs seemed to be the bacterial CW, which was surrounded by dense halos with a tendency to reach the bacterial membrane. Although the vesicles may be too large to penetrate the bacterial envelope, it is likely that the co-surfactant molecules partition the lipid compartments of the bacterial cells. This may occur either directly (from the vesicles to the bacteria) or indirectly (through the aqueous phase). As larger, lipophilic co-solvent molecules, such as glycerol and propylenglycol, have a higher affinity for lipidic compartments than smaller, more hydrophilic compounds, they might have contributed to the activity of the system [
