The extracts were incorporated in different phospholipid nanovesicles with the intent to protect the bioactive molecules from degradation and volatility, while modulating their delivery over time and improving its bioavailability and potency at the target site [

 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-11-00234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], this study had the intention to test the possibility that the same carriers would be useful in delivering antimicrobial TC essential oil and CPL extract. The vesicle systems used in this experiment demonstrated a homogeneous distribution of particle size (PI ≤ 0.3) and a highly negative zeta potential, which, as a result of the index of the magnitude of repulsive interaction between the colloidal particles, ensured the high stability of the nanodispersions [

Regardless of their antimicrobial aggressiveness, none of the samples examined, at the concentrations used, showed cytotoxicity in gingival fibroblasts. This outcome confirms the use of Thyme biomolecules as safe compounds (GRAS) [
