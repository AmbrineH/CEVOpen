<p class="p">The data also suggest that at selected doses, there will be a selective cytotoxicity of the natural extracts towards microbes due to the fundamental differences in composition and structure of the host cells, compared to those of bacteria and yeasts [

In particular, the MIC and MFC, in addition to the killing kinetics, demonstrated that the TC essential oil was the most effective fungicidal, killing up to 70% of the yeasts and not just arresting their growth.
