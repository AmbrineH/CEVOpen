   <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> shows a prominent and amorphous CW surrounding the PM and the dark intracytoplasmatic space. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Characteristic microfibrils of Î² glucans can be observed in the outer layer of the membrane. Microfibrils are intermeshed into thicker bundles, forming a wide-meshed network of fibrils extending into the cell wall. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) After 24 h of contact with TC essential oil, the yeast show features compatible with a fungicidal activity. The photograph shows alteration in the shape and wideness of the CW with rupture of the PM and cytoplasm fragmentation of the yeast. (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) In other cells, the PM appears ruffled and vacuoles of medium density and shape could be detected within the cytoplasm. (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Protoplasms treated with CLP extract show an enlargement of the wideness between the CW and PM. (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) No morphological alterations could be observed neither in the PM nor in the cytoplasm, suggesting a fungistatic rather than a fungicidal effect of CPL extract.
