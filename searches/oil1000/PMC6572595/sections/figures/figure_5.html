 <p> ( A) Untreated C. albicans shows a prominent and amorphous CW surrounding the PM and the dark intracytoplasmatic space. ( B) Characteristic microfibrils of Î² glucans can be observed in the outer layer of the membrane. Microfibrils are intermeshed into thicker bundles, forming a wide-meshed network of fibrils extending into the cell wall. ( C) After 24 h of contact with TC essential oil, the yeast show features compatible with a fungicidal activity. The photograph shows alteration in the shape and wideness of the CW with rupture of the PM and cytoplasm fragmentation of the yeast. ( D) In other cells, the PM appears ruffled and vacuoles of medium density and shape could be detected within the cytoplasm. ( E) Protoplasms treated with CLP extract show an enlargement of the wideness between the CW and PM. ( F) No morphological alterations could be observed neither in the PM nor in the cytoplasm, suggesting a fungistatic rather than a fungicidal effect of CPL extract. </p>
