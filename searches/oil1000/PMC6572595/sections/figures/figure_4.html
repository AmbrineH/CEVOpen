 <p> ( A) Untreated S. mutans shows an intact and well-defined cell wall (CW), plasma membrane (PM), and cytoplasmic space with a nucleoid (N). ( B) When treated with TC essential oil, S. mutans appears swollen and degenerated with clear evidence of rupture of the CW and PM up to cell disintegration. ( C) After contact with CLP extract, S. mutans displays features of degeneration comparable to those described in the cells treated with TC essential oil.( D) Regardless of the extract loaded, after contact with liposomes, S. mutans showed a well-conserved morphology in comparison to the control, whereas ( E) after contact with glycerosomes, the cells appear swollen and show the enlargement of the wideness between CW and PM, and ( F) after contact with PG-PEVs, the cells are surrounded by dense globules infiltrating the CW with perforation of the CW and PM. Other cells appear clearly disintegrated in the cluster. </p>
