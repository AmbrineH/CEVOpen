  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Untreated S. mutans shows an intact and well-defined cell wall (CW), plasma membrane (PM), and cytoplasmic space with a nucleoid (N). (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) When treated with TC essential oil, S. mutans appears swollen and degenerated with clear evidence of rupture of the CW and PM up to cell disintegration. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) After contact with CLP extract, S. mutans displays features of degeneration comparable to those described in the cells treated with TC essential oil.(
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) Regardless of the extract loaded, after contact with liposomes, S. mutans showed a well-conserved morphology in comparison to the control, whereas (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) after contact with glycerosomes, the cells appear swollen and show the enlargement of the wideness between CW and PM, and (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) after contact with PG-PEVs, the cells are surrounded by dense globules infiltrating the CW with perforation of the CW and PM. Other cells appear clearly disintegrated in the cluster.
