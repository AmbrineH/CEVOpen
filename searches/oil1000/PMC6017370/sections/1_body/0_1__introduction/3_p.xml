 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The aim of present study was to determine the aroma components of the volatile oils from the fresh flowers of these three buckwheat species, as well as to evaluate their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities for their potential applications in agriculture or the food industry.
