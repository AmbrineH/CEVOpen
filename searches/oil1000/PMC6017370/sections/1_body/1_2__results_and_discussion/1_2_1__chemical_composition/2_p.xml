<p class="p">The chemical composition of the three buckwheat flower volatile oils (VOs) was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. On the whole, the VOs were abundant in ketones, alcohols, esters, phenols, terpenoids, acids, aldehydes and hydrocarbons (listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00182-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Although, as the different varieties and geographic locations of the three buckwheat flowers used in this study, it could significantly affected the chemical composition and amount of these three VOs. For the flower volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">F. esculentum</italic>, about twenty-eight compounds were identified, which accounted for 92.89% of the total oil. They were mainly composed of acids (24.05%), hydrocarbons (15.05%), aldehydes (14.96%) and esters (10.54%). The major components in the oil were nonanoic acid (7.58%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol (6.52%), benzothiazole (5.08%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.06%), and benzene-acetaldehyde (4.54%). A total of fourteen aroma constituents were determined, accounting for 88.48% of the total oil of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic> flowers. The ketones, phenols and esters constituted the dominant portions which accounted for 25.76%, 20.98% and 16.40%, respectively. Of them, the main components were 2-pentadecanone (18.61%), eugenol (17.18%), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester (13.19%), (

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-farnesylacetone (7.15%), and heneicosane (5.28%). For the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic> flowers, at least twenty compounds were identified, which accounted for 90.23% of the total oil. They were mainly composed of alcohols (24.85%), ketones (13.39%), phenols (12.22%), esters (11.02) and terpenoids (9.90%). Eugenol (12.22%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate (8.03%), linalool oxide (7.47%), 1-hexanol (7.07%), benzothiazole (6.72%), and 1-octanol (6.71%) were the major compounds. Some volatile components such as benzeneacetaldehyde, linalool oxide, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, phenylethyl alcohol and 5-methyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde have also been reported in the extracts of buckwheat seeds or teas [
