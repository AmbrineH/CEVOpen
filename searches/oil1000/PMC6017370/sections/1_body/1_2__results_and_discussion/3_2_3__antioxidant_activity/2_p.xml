<p class="p">The β-carotene bleaching assay is on the basis of the lossing of yellow coloration of β-carotene due to its reaction with radicals formed by linoleic acid oxidation in an emulsion. The rate of β-carotene bleaching is slowed down by the presence of an antioxidant [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00182-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The results indicated that the antioxidant activity of three buckwheat flower VOs increased steadily with concentrations from 50–400 μg/mL. At the concentration of 400 μg/mL, the highest β-carotene linoleic bleaching activity was 97.22% for the flower VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic>, and 92.65% for the VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic>, and that was 86.36% for the 
 <italic class="italic">F. esculentum</italic> VOs. Correspondingly, their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was determined as 184.13 μg/mL, 206.11 μg/mL, and 242.06 μg/mL, respectively (

 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic> exhibited higher antioxidant activity than that of 
 <italic class="italic">F. esculentum</italic>, and it was generally in accordance with the DPPH radical scavenging test. The main reason for the antioxidant capacity difference could be attributed to the varieties and amounts of some active constituents of the flower VOs. For example, the VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic> are abundant in eugenol, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-anethole, linalool oxide and nerolidol et al., which have been proved to have notable antioxidant activity in previous reports [
