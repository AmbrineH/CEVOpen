<p class="p">In general, the three buckwheat flower VOs exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial activity, and the capacity of bacterial growth inhibition was closely related with the VOs species and its treatment dosage, as well as the tested bacterial strain. The MIC values of 
 <italic class="italic">F. esculentum</italic> flower VOs on tested bacteria ranged from 400 μg/mL to 800 μg/mL, and their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values from 226.82 μg/mL to 478.42 μg/mL. For the VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic> flower, it exhibited good antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, and the MIC values were from 200 μg/mL to 800 μg/mL. Correspondingly, their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were from 106.36 μg/mL to 452.32 μg/mL. The flower VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic> showed strong antibacterial activity, and the 
 <italic class="italic">X. vesicatoria</italic> was the most sensitive bacterium. The MIC values were ranging from 100 μg/mL to 400 μg/mL, and their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values from 68.32 μg/mL to 228.62 μg/mL. On the whole, the antibacterial effect of the flower VOs of 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic> was stronger than that of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tataricum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. cymosum</italic>, and it could be mainly attributed to the chemical composition differences of the three VOs. The two Gram-positive bacteria seemed to be more resistant to the VOs than the four Gram-negative bacteria used in this study. Both major and minor compounds (i.e., eugenol, linalool oxide, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-farnesylacetone, benzothiazole, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-anethole, and (-)-α-terpineol, etc.) may contribute to the antibacterial activity of the three buckwheat flower VOs.
