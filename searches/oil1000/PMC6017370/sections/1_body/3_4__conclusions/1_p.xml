<p class="p">In conclusion, this is the first report on the chemical composition, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the volatile oils from the fresh flowers of three buckwheat, 
 <italic class="italic">Fagopyrum esculentum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fagopyrum tataricum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fagopyrum cymosum</italic>. Experimental data indicated that the buckwheat flower VOs were abundant in ketones, alcohols, esters, phenols, terpenoids, acids, aldehydes and hydrocarbons. They were also found to have good antibacterial activity and noteworthy antioxidant property, and that was closely related with the VOs species and its treatment dosage. These results suggested the potential application of the buckwheat flower VOs as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in agriculture or food industry in the future. Although, the underlying antimicrobial and antioxidant mechanisms of the volatile oils as well as their main active constituents need to be further investigated and clarified.
