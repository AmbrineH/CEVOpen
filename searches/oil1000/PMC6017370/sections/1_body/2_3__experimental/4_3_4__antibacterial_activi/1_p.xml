 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 29425, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas lachrymans</italic> ATCC 11921, and

 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 11562 and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538). They were cultivated in liquid Luria-Bertani medium overnight at 28 °C, and the diluted bacterial suspension (10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cfu/mL) was ready for test. A broth dilution-colorimetric assay was employed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the VOs [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In brief, the volatile oil was dissolved in acetone at an initial concentration of 20.0 mg/mL. Then it was diluted with 30% acetone to obtain serials of concentration ranging from 10.0 to 0.5 mg/mL. 10 µL of sample solutions and 90 μL of prepared bacterial suspensions were added into each well of the 96-well microplate. Streptomycin sulfate was selected as the positive control (CK
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). After the plates were agitated to mix the contents of the wells using a plate shaker and incubated in the dark for 24 h at 28 °C, 10 µL of the exogenous reagent 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5.0 mg/mL in 0.2 mol/L, pH 7.2 phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for another 4 h. The MIC value was defined as the lowest sample concentration that inhibited visible growth, as indicated by the MTT staining [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. To confirm the MIC value, 10 µL of suspension was removed from the well and inoculated on LB medium. After incubation at 28 °C overnight, the number of surviving bacteria was calculated and certificated.
