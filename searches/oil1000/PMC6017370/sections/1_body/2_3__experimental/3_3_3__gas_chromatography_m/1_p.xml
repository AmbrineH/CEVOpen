<p class="p">The chemical composition of the three buckwheat flower VOs was analyzed by the analytical GC/MS techniques. An HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness) was employed. The analysis was performed using helium (99.999%) as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with the following temperature program: initial temperature 50 °C for 1.50 min, increase 10 °C/min up to 100 °C, 2 min at 180 °C, and then increase by 6 °C/min up to 190 °C, and increased by 20 °C/min up to 250 °C, 10 min at 250 °C. The injection volume was 1.0 µL (with a split ratio of 1:20). GC/MS analyses were carried out using an 6890N Network GC system (Agilent, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent 5973 Network mass selective detector. Masses were scanned between 20 and 450 amu. The essential components of the VOs were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those stored in the NIST library. The retention indices (RI) of each constituent was determined relative to the retention times (RT) of a series of C
