<p class="p">The β-carotene-linoleic acid bleaching assay of the three volatile oils was determined according to the method of Ebrahimabadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In short, 25 μL of linoleic acid and 200 mg of Tween-40 were added in the β-carotene solution (0.5 mg/mL). Then, the chloroform was removed out by the use of a rotary evaporator at 45 °C. After that, 50 mL of distilled water saturated with oxygen for 30 min at a flow rate of 100 mL/min were added, and the mixture was shaken vigorously. 90 μL of the above β-carotene-linoleic acid-Tween mixture and 10 μL of the VOs sample solutions (0.5 to 4.0 mg/mL) were added into each well. An equal amount of 30% acetone was used for the blank sample. The microplates were then kept in an incubator at 50 °C for 2 h together with BHT as the positive control (CK
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). The absorbance of the solutions was then measured at wavelength of 460 nm. The percentage (%) of β-carotene bleaching inhibition of each sample was calculated as (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">β-carotene after 2 h assay</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">initial β-carotene</sub>) × 100, Where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">β-carotene after 2 h assay</sub> is the absorbance of the sample with β-carotene-linoleic acid mixture after 2 h period of incubation, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">initial β-carotene</sub> is the absorbance of the initial mixture. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value calculation for β-carotene bleaching inhibition was the same as that for DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.
