<p class="p">The DPPH radical scavenging assay of the three buckwheat flower VOs was evaluated by the method of Ono et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In brief, 80 μL of DPPH solution (0.2 mg/mL) and 20 μL of prepared VOs solutions (0.25 to 2.0 mg/mL) were added into each well of the microplate. The mixture was shaken vigorously and kept at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Then, the absorbance of the solution was measured at the wavelength of 517 nm. The inhibition (%) of DPPH free radical in percent was calculated as [(

 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">control</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents without the test sample, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test VOs. All the tests were performed in triplicate. The 2,6-di-
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was used as the positive control (CK
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). The IC
