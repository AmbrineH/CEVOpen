 <p class="p">This review focusses on the use of recycled and virgin polymers in mineral and metallurgical processing, both high and ambient temperature processes, including novel applications. End of life applications of polymers as well as the utilisation of polymers during its life time in various applications are explored. The discussion includes applications in cleaner coal production, iron and steel production, iron ore palletisation, iron alloy manufacturing, manganese processing, E-wastes processing and carbon sequestration. The underlying principles of these applications are also explained. Advantages and disadvantages of using these polymers in terms of energy and emission reductions, reduction in non-renewables and dematerialisation are discussed. Influence of the polymers on controlling the evolution of micro and nanostructures in alloys and advanced materials is also considered. </p>
