<p class="p">Silicon carbide (SiC) and ferrosilicon (FeSi) find application in the clean energy systems such as photovoltaic industries, and economical production of high purity hydrogen. It is estimated that the global demand for silicones will rise 6% per year to 2.4 MMT (million metric tonnes) in 2018. SiC is produced from petroleum coke and a silica or quartz sand at high temperatures (1700–2500 °C). FeSi is produced industrially via the carbo-thermic reduction of silicon dioxide (SiO
