<p class="p">Thermoset polymers like epoxies are low molecular weight viscous polymers. During chemical reactions with curing agents (i.e., hardeners), they undergo further polymerisation and phase transformation from a viscous state to a dry, solid three-dimensional cross-linked molecular network. The iron ore pellets produced under ambient conditions using the thermoset epoxy resin showed a high compression stress of 4 kN without any heat treatment compared to the industry requirement (2.5 kN) of an indurated pellet processed at 1200–1350 °C. The pellets are reported to be non-abrasive, non-sticky and devoid of undesirable fines. The process spells cost, energy and emission reductions for iron and steel industries [

The study shows that the use of commercial epoxy resin, epiglue and silicones eliminates the need to use coke or high pure quartz Previous studies using recycled thermosets mainly involved a solid–gas reaction for coke/char-metal oxide. Virgin thermosets offer a different wetting mechanism, involving a solid–liquid–gas reaction that provides a better intimate contact, reaction efficiency and high carburation. A high carbon uptake of up to 3% is observed even in the absence of coke or other carbonaceous materials.
