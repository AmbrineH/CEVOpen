 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The study demonstrates the production of ferrosilicon/silicon carbide using only the hematite and the polymer resins (virgin polymers) as fuel/reductant and alloying material. The system has the added benefits of greatly reduced emissions, process temperature, non-renewable resources and cost of production is reported [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The process does not require the use of high-purity quartz or metallurgical coke. Formation of SiC and the ferrosilicon in presence of these viscous virgin polymer resins occurs at 1550 °C as opposed to the conventional temperatures of ≈2000 °C that spells energy savings and emission reductions.
