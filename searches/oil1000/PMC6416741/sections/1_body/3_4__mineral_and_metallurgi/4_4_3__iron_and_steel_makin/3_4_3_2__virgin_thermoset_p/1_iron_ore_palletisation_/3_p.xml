<p class="p">Use of recycled thermoset plastics in the ironmaking process may not help carburation unless converted to char at 1450 Â°C (i.e., a high temperature and an energy intensive process) due to their inability to reform to provide the required intimate contact or wetting. Use of virgin thermoset polymers, on the other hand, serves as a binder, reductant, alloying material and fuel, thereby, minimising the need for non-renewable resources such as coke as the reductant and fuel. Iron ore palletisation using epoxy as the binder instead of conventional bentonite or organic binders shows many desirable features [
