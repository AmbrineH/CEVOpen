Silica-free organic binders, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), starch and dextrin are alternative binders to bentonite. However, organic binders fail to impart necessary strength to the pre-heated and fired pellets due to reduced slag-oxide bonding despite producing good quality wet and dry pellets. This is because they are burnt out at relatively low temperatures (&lt;250 °C) [
 <xref rid="B70-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] with little residue to bond with iron oxide grains at higher induration temperatures. For these reasons, improving the strengths of pre-heated and fired pellets produced with organic binders has assumed great significance in recent years.
