<p class="p">Energy consumption during heat induration of magnetite concentrates ranges from 320,000 kJ/t to 740,000 kJ/t pellets, and it is higher for higher non-magnetite ores due to the absence of exothermic and oxidation reactions. Cold-bonded pellets using epoxy binders, being a low temperature alternative to heat-indurated pellets, consume less energy for bonding self-reducing pellets and for refractory ores that are difficult to heat treat. The estimated cold-bonding capital and operating costs is 2/3 that of heat induration. </p>
