<p class="p">Use of virgin epoxy resin promotes dematerialization in terms of carbonaceous materials and the binder. The conventional iron ore reduction/palletization requires at least 1:3 Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to C and a binder. However, in a recent study, the binder acts as the reductant and fuel at â‰ˆ1:0.3 Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to C, i.e., at least 10 times less carbonaceous material [
