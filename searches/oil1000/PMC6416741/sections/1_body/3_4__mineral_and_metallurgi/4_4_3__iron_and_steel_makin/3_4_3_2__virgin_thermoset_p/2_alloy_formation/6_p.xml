<p class="p">The reaction mechanism of alloy formation can be explained as follows: the virgin epoxies and the silicones in the fluid or viscous form prior to curing facilitate solid–liquid–gas system providing intimate contact between the reactants. They thoroughly wet the reactants and form interfacial covalent bond between the reactants upon curing (

Siloxanes, as a coupling agent, provides a stronger covalent interaction between the iron oxide and the Si–O bond and the pyrolytic products retained within matrices and form reduction products rather than leave the system without reacting, e.g., SiO. Where waste silicones and the thermoset resins are used, they open the pathway for feedstock recycling; however, use of bio-renewable epoxy resins [
