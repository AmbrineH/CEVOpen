<p class="p">Palletisation process improves physical properties of low-grade fine ores, imparting high and uniform mechanical strength to withstand thermal stress in reducing atmosphere in blast furnace, and show resistance to disintegration. This makes transportation over long distances feasible without generation of fines. Waste plastics can be used in palletisation, but strength and hardness of plastics can be an issue in blast furnaces. Low strength agglomerated plastics are easily disintegrated during transport, which may lead to blockage problems and combustion, lowering combustion efficiency [
