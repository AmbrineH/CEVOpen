<p class="p">Presence of methane is reported to increase the SiC content, when supplied externally together with hydrogen. However, when C/SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is less than the stoichiometric requirement of 3, Si is lost as SiO. While it is expected the carbon deficit could be compensated by introducing methane gas to increase the SiC content, it was observed [
 <xref rid="B67-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] that the intermediate product, SiO vapor, escaped from the reaction zone as fume during the direct reduction of quartz or amorphous silica powder by methane without conversion to SiC. Carbon formed on the reactant surface during methane cracking (Reaction (4)) hinders the progress of reduction reaction by preventing carbon transfer to the interior reaction sites for further reduction when the methane content supplied externally is &gt;2 vol %. Formation of carbon can be controlled by the increased external supply of hydrogen in the gas mixture.
