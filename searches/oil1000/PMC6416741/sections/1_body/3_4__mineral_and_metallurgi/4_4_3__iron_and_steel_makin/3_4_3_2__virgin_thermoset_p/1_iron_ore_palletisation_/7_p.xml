<p class="p">The mechanism involved in producing pellets of high strength can be explained as follows: Viscous adhesive (epoxy resin) is capable of dissolving and diffusing into iron oxide [
 <xref rid="B71-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The diffusion depends on the affinity of the epoxy to the iron ore and vice versa, resulting in a multilayer interphase (0.5 nm to 10 µm thick) [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] controlled by the cure conditions. At longer liquid–solid contact times, and with a more gradual rise in the cure temperatures, tri-layered rather than bi-layered systems are formed. A tri-layer system shows a gradient and a higher Young’s modulus than the bilayer system because of the formation of fibre-like crystallites within the organic layer [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Mechanical properties of the bi-layer system are like those of the bulk. The addition of fillers to the organic resin increases the modulus and the load needed to propagate a crack [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] as they can act like little springs, making crack propagation difficult. The presence of nanocrystals formed during the curing of the adhesive layer, due to dissolution and recrystallization of the pigments and fillers, result in increased interfacial toughness [
 <xref rid="B77-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. The nanoparticle–polymer interaction is stronger because of increased surface area. Addition of ethylene oxide can increase the toughness by increasing the wettability between the fillers and the polymer interphase [
 <xref rid="B78-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The excess epoxy monomer in the primer and the adhesive can thus increase the toughness of the interphase layer by softening the filler–polymer interface. An increase in the molecular weight due to the cross-linking of the polymer as the cure proceeds can suppress cavitation by increasing the cohesive strength of the amorphous phase. When the crystallites in a polymer, semicrystalline polymer, or crystalline polymer orient themselves in the loading direction, they exhibit not only a high elastic modulus but also a toughness approximately 15 times higher [
 <xref rid="B81-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The process can be made greener using bio-renewable epoxy resin [
