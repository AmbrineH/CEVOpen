<p class="p">Iron ore is reduced with coke in a blast furnace, and liquid steel in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) is produced from the reduced hot metal (pig iron) mixed with 30% steel scrap. In the electric arc furnace (EAF) process, the iron input is typically in the form of scrap, direct reduced iron (DRI) and cast iron. To produce 1 ton of hot metal, approximately 370 kg of coke plus 90 kg of heavy oil are used depending on the quality of the iron ore and the process used. The 90 kg of heavy oil can be partly substituted with up to 70 kg of plastics waste [
