<p class="p">The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission reduction potential in blast furnace feedstock recycling depends on the calorific value and the carbon and hydrogen content of the individual plastic resins. Thus, PE has the largest CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions reduction potential. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions reduction potential of PP is less than those of PE and PS, while PET has negative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions reduction potential. This leads to a difference in the coke substitution effect by each plastic resin [

The measured carbon pick-up after 2 min of reaction in reduced iron ore using metallurgical coke is approximately 0.08 wt. %, whereas 100% thermoplastics, such as PET and HDPE, showed an increase in carbon pick-up by &gt;2 wt. % [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was found to aid the carburization, probably through the removal of adsorbed oxygen from the metal surfaces [
