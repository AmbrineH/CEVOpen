<p class="p">The above study suggests thermoplastics perform better in terms of reduction and carbon dissolution compared to the thermosets. The ability of the thermoplastics to melt or undergo phase transformation from solid to the rubbery state above the glass transition temperatures offers a different mechanism compared to the thermosets, which cannot undergo phase transformation. A solid–liquid–gas system provided by thermoplastics promote intimate contact and wetting between the reactants, which the thermosets are incapable of. However, the volatiles (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) from the Bakelite thermosets contribute to the reduction efficiency. High temperature char formation from Bakelite helps increase the carbon dissolution in the liquid iron phase [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. However, using Bakelite char eliminates the benefits of the volatile reductant gases, namely the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in addition to being a high temperature (energy intensive, ≈1450 °C) process. It is not clear why the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> evolved from the Bakelite does not help carbon dissolution nor why only Bakelite char contributes to the carbon dissolution and not raw Bakelite (Reaction (4)).
