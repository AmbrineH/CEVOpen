<p class="p">Raw Bakelite mixed with the hematite under the reduction reaction conditions should form chars and contribute to the carbon dissolution. A carbothermal reduction process requires intimate contact between a solid oxide and a carbonaceous material [
 <xref rid="B66-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. However, the study has used different particle sizes of the Bakelite: raw Bakelite is 125 Âµm, whereas Bakelite char is further homogenized in a roller crusher to a smaller size. The lack of intimate contact between the raw Bakelite and the hematite as opposed to better contact between the Bakelite char and hematite seem to contribute to the difference in the reaction efficiencies in the two systems.
