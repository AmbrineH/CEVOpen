<p class="p">While extensive use of thermoplastics as a partial substitute for coke in iron and steel industries has been reported, the use of thermoset plastics has not been reported to the same extent. Dhunna et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] studied the use of raw Bakelite, a thermoset, as well as the char of the Bakelite (prepared by heating it to 1450 °C for 20 min) for iron ore reduction. It is found that when raw Bakelite was used, a clear separation of metal and slag phases could not be achieved due to low carbon uptake (0.23%). On the other hand, the use of Bakelite char (char obtained by heat treatment of Bakelite at 1450 °C) for iron ore reduction resulted in a clear separation of metal and slag phases due to higher carbon uptake (2.01%). Also, reduction efficiency was slightly higher (≈6%) for the Bakelite char compared to the raw Bakelite [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Raw Bakelite-based pellets showed an 83.9% reduction of iron oxide, whereas Bakelite-char pellets showed 90.12% metallization after 20 min of reaction. A higher carbon dissolution is observed for the Bakelite chars due to the change in microporosity generated as a result of evolving volatiles and resulting in increased surface area and decreased pore size as well as the graphitic carbon and low ash content. The surface area reduced quickly, from ≈325 to 25 m
