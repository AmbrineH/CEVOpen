<p class="p">The high temperature processability of the thermoplastics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) finds applications in blast furnaces, especially in iron and steel processing [
 <xref rid="B55-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The Japanese steel industry developed commercial waste plastic feedstock recycling processes using its blast furnace iron- and steelmaking (electric arc furnaces) processes. In the blast furnaces, finely pulverized dechlorinated waste plastics and pulverized coal are injected into the blast furnace through tuyeres as a substitute for coke to produce pig iron [

 <xref rid="B58-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The blast furnace feedstock recycling substitution rate is 1.1 (1.1 ton of coke is substituted by 1 ton of waste plastics) [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The substitution rate of plastic resins is directly correlated to their carbon content or calorific value. Plastics have higher calorific value compared to the coke (28,000â€“31,000 kJ/kg) (
 <xref rid="materials-12-00655-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The calorific value of gases (blast furnace gases) increases with all the plastic resins because of the higher calorific values of plastics than that of coke. Pyrolysis of thermoplastics yields low carbon residue and high volatiles at ironmaking temperatures.
