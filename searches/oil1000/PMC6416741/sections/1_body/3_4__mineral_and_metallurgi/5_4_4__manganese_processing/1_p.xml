<p class="p">The reduction of MnO in slag by blends of coke and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) shows improved wettability and reduction efficiency compared to reduction by pure coke. Increasing HDPE content resulted in further improvement in reduction and wettability and allowed for the near complete reduction of MnO and partial reduction of SiO
