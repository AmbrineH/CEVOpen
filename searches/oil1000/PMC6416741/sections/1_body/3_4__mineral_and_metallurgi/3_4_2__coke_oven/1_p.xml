<p class="p">Coke is utilised as an iron ore-reducing agent in blast furnaces, hydrocarbon oil as raw materials for the chemical industry and the gas as a fuel for power plants. Caking coals, e.g., many bituminous coals, when heated, exhibit thermoplastic effects, i.e., they soften and form a plastic mass that swells and resolidifies into a porous solid. Strongly caking coals, which yield a solid product (coke) with properties suitable for use in a blast furnace, are called coking coals. </p>
