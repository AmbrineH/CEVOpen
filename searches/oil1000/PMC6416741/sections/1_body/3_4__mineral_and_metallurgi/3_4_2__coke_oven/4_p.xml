<p class="p">Coke is produced in a coke oven by carbonizing, i.e., heat treating the coal without oxygen at a high temperature. Coke can be produced via the chemical feedstock recycling of waste plastics in the coke oven [
 <xref rid="B50-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. When agglomerated waste plastics blended with coal at the blending ratio of about 1 wt. % are charged into the coke oven they are converted into coke, COG and hydrocarbon oil like coal in the coking chamber. In this process, carbon and hydrogen contained in the waste plastics are converted to 20 wt. % coke, 40 wt. % hydrocarbon oil (tar and light oil) and 40 wt. % coke oven gas (COG). The yield depends upon the type of plastic used (
