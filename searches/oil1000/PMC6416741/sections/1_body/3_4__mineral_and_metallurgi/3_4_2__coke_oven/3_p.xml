 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>). While PE addition increases coke strength, addition of PS and PET inhibits coal expansion and fusion and deteriorates the coke strength. When the free radicals formed during PS or PET thermal decomposition removes hydrogen from the coal, the coal-caking property decreased. Coke strength is determined by the total surface area of the plastic particles added. Increasing the plastic particle size and density of the waste plastic particles decreases the specific surface area and increases coke strength. The optimum size of the plastic agglomerates used by NSSMC is in the range of 20â€“30 mm. A denser plastic agglomerate allows for more waste plastics to be added to coal without affecting the coke strength.
