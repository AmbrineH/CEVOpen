<p class="p">Mechanism of water removal is as follows: dry SAP having higher concentrations of “free” COO– groups than the coal removes moisture preferentially from coal through osmosis [

   <p class="p">Structural integrity (high cross-linking density is crucial to retain the structural integrity of the polymer loaded with moisture as the high cross-linking density offers high mechanical strength).</p>

   <p class="p">The “availability” of target water, i.e., how tightly it is bound to the drying substrate.</p>
