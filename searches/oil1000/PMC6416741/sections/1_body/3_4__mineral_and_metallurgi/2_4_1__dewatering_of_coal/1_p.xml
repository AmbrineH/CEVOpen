<p class="p">Dewatering of fine coal, an important aspect of coal cleaning, adds significant cost to the price of clean coal. Victoria has a reserve of 430 billion tons of brown coals, contributing to 92% of electricity generation in Victoria. However, it has a high moisture content that reduces its net calorific value, and thus is a major contributor to total GHG emissions, besides adding to high transportation costs and energy penalties. The high heat capacity of water inhibits use of evaporative drying technologies due to high energy penalties. Capital expenditure (CapEx) of conventional dewatering techniques are: for the centrifuge technique: &lt; Au$50,000/t/hr/rel. reduction in total moisture content (TMC), for vacuum filtering: Au$450,000/t/hr/rel.reduction in TMC, for pressure filter technique: &lt;Au$350,000/t/hr/rel. reduction in TMC, and for briquetting: &lt;Au$350,000/t/hr/rel. reduction in TMC [
