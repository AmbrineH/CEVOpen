<p class="p">Victorian brown coals have high oxygen and moisture contents and hence low calorific value (≈8000 kJ/kg) before drying or dewatering. However, on drying or dewatering, the calorific value is high (≈28,000 kJ/kg). Osmotic dewatering of brown coals using anionic SAP carried out under ambient conditions has no associated energy penalties. Approximately 57% of water is removed within four hours of SAP contact under ambient conditions [

This process, in addition to enhancing the calorific value of low-grade coals, greatly reduces the penalties associated with transportation. This process offers a low carbon, clean energy footprint technology to address energy problems. Though SAPs are about 100 times more expensive (1000 Au$/tonne) than the coal, the pH and the temperature sensitive SAPS are regenerated, which makes it cost effective. The pH-sensitive SAPs are regenerated at room temperatures, while the temperature-sensitive SAPs are regenerated at 37 °C and 55 °C, making them energy efficient compared to the evaporative dewatering. Moreover, the spontaneous combustion associated with heavily oxidized low rank coals, and the loss of volatiles associated with high temperature drying, can be mitigated using the SAPs. This technology can be extended to dewatering tailings/waste sludges.
