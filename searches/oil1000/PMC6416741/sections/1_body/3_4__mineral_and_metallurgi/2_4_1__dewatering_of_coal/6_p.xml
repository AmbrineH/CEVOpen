 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> shows the mechanism of water absorption in SAP. The initial diffusion of water inside hydrophilic SAP causes ionization of neutralized acrylate groups into negative carboxylate ions and positive sodium ions. Negative electrical charge along the SAP backbone causes mutual repulsion of carboxylate ions, increasing the osmotic pressure inside the gel, thereby resulting in expansion and swelling of the SAP chains due to absorbed water. Finally, cross-links between chains inhibit solubilisation of SAP (in water), thus, governing the extent of swelling or absorption by restricting infinite swelling. Incorporation of nanofillers like graphene oxides or clay having laminar structures or pozzolanic flyash having high affinity to moisture within the SAP network (SAP-nanocomposites) can enhance the water-removing capacity of the SAPs while providing the necessary structural reinforcement against infinite swelling [
