<p class="p">The overall CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission factor is 0.81 t/tonne cement. Producing one tonne of clinker will have: 1 t × 65% × 0.79 = 0.51 t of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emitted from CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> decomposition. The magnesium and calcium have similar chemistry and a similar reduction in emissions, global warming potentials, energy and process temperature can be achieved in Clinker production. Use of plastics and biomass can reduce the emissions during raw material decomposition in addition to energy recovery.
