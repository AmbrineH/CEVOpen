<p class="p">Magnesium metal production (where the intermediate product can be magnesia as described in the research) is another high carbon footprint reaction. Use of plastics can greatly reduce the emissions, energy and process temperatures not only during the intermediate MgO formation, but also during the carbothermic reduction to magnesium metal, eliminating the need for the non-renewable coke. The above study [

The current operating temperature of ≈1600 °C can be brought down by at least 100–200 °C due to the reducing gases produced by the plastics and the biomass enhancing the energy efficiency of the process [
