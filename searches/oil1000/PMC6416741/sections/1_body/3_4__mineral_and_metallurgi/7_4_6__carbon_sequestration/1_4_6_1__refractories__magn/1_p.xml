<p class="p">Global growth in the magnesium market is expected to reach 1.2 Mt/year by 2020 (Magnesium Metal, 2016). Application of Mg has been limited by relatively high cost of production, associated energy costs and a high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission. The main environmental concerns to produce different types of MgO are the use of energy and emissions to air. The calcination process of magnesite has a high carbon footprint. It is the principal user of energy and the main source of emissions, with 1.1 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> resulting from the carbonate decomposition to produce 1 t of magnesia (MgO) accounting for direct CO
