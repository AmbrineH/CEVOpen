<p class="p">Boliden’s Rönnskär smelter, in northern Sweden (one of the largest recyclers of electronic material) has been recycling various waste materials since the 1960s. The smelter’s annual capacity for recycling electrical material is 120,000 tonnes, sourced primarily from Europe. Plastic in the e-waste acts as a source of energy during smelting and generates steam that is converted into electricity or district heating. Boliden has the technical capability to take the entire shredded PC scrap into their zinc fuming plant without extensive dismantling. </p>
