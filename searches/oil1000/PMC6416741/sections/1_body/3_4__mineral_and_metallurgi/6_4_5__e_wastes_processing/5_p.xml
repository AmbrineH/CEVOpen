<p class="p">The Kaldo furnace can recover metals from more than 100,000 tons of secondary raw materials from cable scrap and printed circuit boards. Plastics are used as fuel and easily oxidisable impurities are dissolved in a liquid slag and precious and base metals are collected as an alloy or “Matte” (liquid sulphides) [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. The role of plastics from cable insulation is to supply process heat for the smelting operation. PVC and cross-linked low-density polyethylene in the cable scrap, as well as the thermosetting resin in the printed circuit boards, perform this very valuable function in the Cu recovery process. Their high heat value provides most of the process heat needed for secondary raw material smelting to produce prime grade copper.
