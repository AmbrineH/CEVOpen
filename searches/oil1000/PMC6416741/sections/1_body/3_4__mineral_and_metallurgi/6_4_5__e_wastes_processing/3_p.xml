<p class="p">E-wastes are processed in large-scale integrated energy- and resource-efficient smelters/plants operated by multinational companies, such as Boliden Minerals (Sweden), Norddeutsche Affinerie (Germany), Union Minière (Belgium), Noranda (Canada) and Outokumpu (Finland). They use a combination of different recovery methods such as mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling and energy recovery. Integrated processing of e-wastes increases eco-efficiency, which otherwise could be lost in the isolated steps. Main features of integrated processing of e-wastes are:

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The integrated furnace has necessary installations to collect the off-gases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The plastic fraction serves as a replacement of coke either partially or fully as a reducing agent as well as the fuel.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The rapid heating above 1000 °C will contain the emissions of Dioxin/Furans within the acceptable limits.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The copper/nickel/lead base metal metallurgy allows the precious and the lead special metals to be collected as slag.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The smelter separates precious metals in a copper bullion. Other metals concentrate in a lead slag are further processed at base metals operations.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The ceramics and the glass are recovered as a slag.</p>
