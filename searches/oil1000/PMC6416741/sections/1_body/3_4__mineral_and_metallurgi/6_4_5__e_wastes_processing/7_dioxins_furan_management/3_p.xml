<p class="p">The heat balance analysis of plastic substitution from e-waste in comparison with normal operations using coke suggests plastics are used as the chemical feed stock, where carbon and hydrogen from the plastics substituted for the carbon and hydrogen provided by the coal for reducing the slag. This conclusion is arrived at by comparing the fuming speed, the generation of steam, and the specific energy as shown in
