<p class="p">Mechanisms of e-waste recycling involves combination of recovery methods such as mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, thermal depolymerization and energy recovery. Plastic components of e-waste cannot be easily recycled due to the mix of flame retardants, pigments and mixed types of plastics. The most common outlets for these mixed fractions are landfill and incineration plants, which are becoming increasingly restricted and costly given recent legislative developments. </p>
