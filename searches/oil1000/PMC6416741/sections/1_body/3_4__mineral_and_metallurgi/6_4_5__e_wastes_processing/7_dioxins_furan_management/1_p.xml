<p class="p">The zinc fuming furnace can effectively reduce the dioxins and furan content when processing the E-wastes [
 <xref rid="B96-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. The high risk associated with Polyhalogenated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans, PXDD/Fs presence in mechanical recycling of WEEE, in relation to handling and exposure is minimised in feedstock recycling. The process essentially represents an effective sink for dioxins and heavy metals. The average PXDD/Fs content of the E-wastes processed in the zinc fuming furnace must meet the “German Regulations for Hazardous Materials” [
 <xref rid="B97-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] and “The German Chemical Banning Ordinance” [
