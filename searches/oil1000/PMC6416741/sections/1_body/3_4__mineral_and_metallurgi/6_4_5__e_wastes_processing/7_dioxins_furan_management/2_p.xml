<p class="p">The zinc fuming plant consists of three separate processes, namely, the fuming furnace, settling furnace and the clinker furnace. The reduction process in the fuming furnace reduces metal oxides such as magnetite, lead oxide, zinc oxide, lead and arsenic, and extracts halogens from the slag. The resulting mixture of oxides is de-halogenated in the clinker furnace. The subsequent process of halogen removal in the clinker furnace can handle increased load of halogens from the steel making dust and other feed streams. Halogen removal is carried out in the clinker furnace by re-heating the raw fume together with coke additions to approximately 1200 Â°C. The zinc thus produced show dioxins values below the detection limits. The total halogen content liberated in the fuming plant is neutralised in the gas cleaning section [

The total halogenated dioxin/furan mass balance shows a destruction over 98% of all micro-organic compounds from this family. From the total input of 6.4 g per batch, only 0.104 g per batch leaves the fuming plant, evenly split between the gaseous emissions and the amount staying with the raw fume (
