<p class="p">Where re-use of plastic components from the e-wastes is not possible, mechanical recycling is opted. In mechanical shredding and sorting processes for e-scrap (pre-treatment), large volumes of various mixed plastic fractions are usually generated. Often, it is not economically viable to separate these further and recover the various types of plastic. There is also a difficulty of achieving acceptable product quality. Limited markets for recycled polymers and innovations in polymer performance and consumer acceptance add to the problems. This is because of the contamination during sorting process of plastics and subsequently during the recycling process affect the product quality adversely. Furthermore, all residual metals still contained in them would inevitably be lost. Separating residual metals by mechanical means can become quite costly while generating only little additional metal value. Mechanical recycling of older WEEE which contains plastics cause problems when dismantling processes do not utilize adequate means, facilities and trained people. </p>
