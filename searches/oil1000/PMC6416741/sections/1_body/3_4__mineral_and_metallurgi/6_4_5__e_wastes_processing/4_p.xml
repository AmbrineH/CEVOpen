<p class="p">At Noranda reactor recycling facility, about 100,000 tons of e-waste is processed for metal recovery. Energy usage in the Noranda reactor is reduced due to the combustion of plastics in the e-waste feedstock [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref>), treats roughly 250,000 metric tons annually, 10% of which is electronic waste. The major steps in Umicore’s process are collection, dismantling, shredding/pre-processing, and end processing. Umicore’s integrated smelting/refining process recovers Sn, Pb, In, etc., from mobile phones. In addition, their plastic components cannot be feasibly recycled due to the mix of flame retardants, pigments and mixed types of plastics. Umicore can process mixed plastic fraction in order to recover copper, precious metals, etc., while at the same time using the organic content of the plastics to replace the fuel and reductant used in this process [
 <xref rid="B95-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. This is only possible because of the sophisticated off-gas and water purification equipment installed at the Hoboken facility, safely preventing the emission of dioxins, furans or other harmful elements. Up to a certain range, this process can handle bromine and other halogens, which are often present in these plastic fractions as flame retardants.
