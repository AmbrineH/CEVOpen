<p class="p">Polymers or macromolecules are derivatives of petroleum or natural gas characterized by long chain molecules, classified as elastomers (rubbers), plastics and fibers. They are the second-most important basic materials and are expected to exceed a global production of 420 million tonnes annually in 2020 [
