<p class="p">Epoxy resins comprise at least two epoxy groups (a three-member ring) per molecule. Epoxy resins contain aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic backbones. The oxirane or the epoxy ring (

The reactions with curing agents result in three dimensional cross-links, which render the epoxies insoluble, and intractable thermosets. Epoxies have high adhesion to metals, glass and ceramic materials. They also possess high cohesive strength. Hence, the failure under stress does not occur at the interface or within the epoxy layer. They show high temperature resistance and low shrinkage as they do not release water or other reaction by products.
