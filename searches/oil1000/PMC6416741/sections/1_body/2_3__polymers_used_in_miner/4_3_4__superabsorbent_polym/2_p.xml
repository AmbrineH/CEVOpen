Highly anionic polymers are most effective in soft waters, having low mineral content comprising only sodium ions and free from dissolved calcium and magnesium salts. In hard waters, having high mineral content of dissolved magnesium and calcium salts, polymers with a lower anionic content perform better. pH-sensitive SAPs (cross-linked, partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide gels) absorb moisture and swell at neutral pH. The swollen gel is separated from the dewatered coal by filtering. Subsequently the pH of the swollen gel is lowered to release water towards regeneration of the SAPs for reuse. Temperature-sensitive SAPs (cross-linked poly(
