<p class="p">Use of virgin silicones provide a reduced carbon footprint for many essential products and services during their life cycle as per the studies conducted in North America, Europe and Japan. Use of virgin silicones, siloxanes and silanes in energy enabling technologies, energy and materials results in energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. The benefit/impact ratio = 9, calculated by dividing the benefits by the impacts from production and end-of-life; when using silicones, siloxanes and silanes outweighs the impacts of production and end-of-life disposal (
