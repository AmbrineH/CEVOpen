<p class="p">Silicones (organicâ€“inorganic polymers) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>) are a good source of reducing gases, such as CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and carbon residues, and thus can substitute for metallurgical coke and silica in blast furnace operations. The current recycling practice of landfilling or catalytic depolymerisation of silicones [

 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] results in the loss of valuable resources, such as silica, methane, carbon and hydrogen as alloying or reducing agents. Contamination of methane biogas by volatile organosilicon materials, disposed at the landfill sites, is a growing environmental issue. Noxious odours and extreme temperatures limit the recyclability of silicones.
