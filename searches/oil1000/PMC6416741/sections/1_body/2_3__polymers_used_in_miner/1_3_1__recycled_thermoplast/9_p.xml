 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> occurs due to cross-linking or cyclization reactions producing cyclic structures, where two adjacent side groups react to form a bond to produce carbon-richer residue than the original polymer. For example, polyvinyl chloride undergoes cyclization reaction to form hydrogenated char (Reaction (1)) and poly (vinylidene chloride) forms pure carbonaceous char with an almost graphitic structure (Reaction (2)). The char further breaks down by scission at much high temperatures [
