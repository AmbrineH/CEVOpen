<p class="p">Pyrolysis results in scission and/or cross-link products. Thermoplastics mainly undergo bond or chain scission reactions, involving breaking of the bonds (endothermic) of the long chain backbone, e.g., C–C and C–H bonds depending on the bond energies. Low thermal stability of polyethylene (PE) is attributed to the low bond energies of C–H and C–C bonds, i.e., 406 kJ/mol and 347 kJ/mol, respectively. Thermal processing of thermoplastics such as HDPE and LDPE at 550 °C shows no solid fraction (coke) (

Presence of tertiary carbon atoms in the polymer backbone and the side group linked to the main chain also affect the thermal stability, e.g., polypropylene (PP) is less stable due to the presence of tertiary carbon atoms in the polymer backbone than polyethylenes (LDPE, HDPE or LLDPE). They are susceptible to pronounced thermo-oxidative degradation during melt processing and/or during use, as well as photo-oxidative degradation.
