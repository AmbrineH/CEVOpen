<p class="p">Pyrolysis of plastics, mainly the thermoplastics, and to an extent, thermosets are particularly advantageous in connection with metallurgical processes running at very high temperatures. Thermodynamic calculations of the pyrolysis of plastics show only two stable phases, solid carbon and the gas phase, in which two species, namely methane and hydrogen, dominate depending on the temperature; higher-grade hydrocarbons and pyrolysis oil are a possibly thermally unstable third phase [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The pyrolysis product and wetting characteristics of the polymers determine their usefulness, for example, in blast furnace applications, which vary for thermoplastics and the thermoset plastics.
