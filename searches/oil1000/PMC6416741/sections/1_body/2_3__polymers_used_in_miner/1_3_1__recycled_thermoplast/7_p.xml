<p class="p">The cross-linking reaction is preceded by scission. Cross-linking in most cases is reflected in the strength, toughness and thermal stability of the polymers, which in turn depends on the molecular weight and the length of the polymer chains. High molecular weight and the size of the macromolecules and the intermolecular forces, e.g., hydrogen bonding enhances thermal stability. Cross-linking involves recombination of gases, liquids and solids resulting in non-condensable gas fractions, solid fractions including carbon, and liquid fractions (e.g., paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics such as benzene and toluene) [
