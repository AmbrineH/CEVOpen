 <xref rid="B15-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Amorphous thermoplastics undergo phase transformation from solid to the rubbery state above the glass transition temperatures. The ability of the thermoplastics to undergo phase transformation also determines their wetting characteristics. Crystalline or semicrystalline thermoplastics may not achieve the fluid or viscous state and they undergo thermal decomposition before they melt. Elastomers behave either like thermosets or as thermoplastics.
