<p class="p">Polyalphamethylstyrene undergoes “specific” chain scission with breakage at the chain ends to depolymerize into constituent monomers. Thermal stability of majority of polymers, e.g., PE, PP (polypropylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PMMA and PC (polycarbonate) reduces in air due to the presence of oxygen as compared to an inert atmosphere. </p>
