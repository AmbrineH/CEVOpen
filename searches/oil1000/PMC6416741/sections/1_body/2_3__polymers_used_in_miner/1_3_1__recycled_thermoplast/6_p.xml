<p class="p">Thermoset plastics, e.g., epoxy-based products and composites, once manufactured, cannot be re-formed or re-used as they are intractable by design (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00655-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Thermosets do not melt when heated unlike the thermoplastics. Therefore, they exhibit little or no wetting characteristics. However, thermoset polymers have calorific values that can be recovered as a source of energy for industrial processes. Most thermoset resins have a calorific value of approximately 30,000 kJ/kg [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Recycling options for thermoset composite materials include mechanical comminution to reduce the size of the scrap to produce filler materials, chemical degradation to break the polymeric matrix into simple chemical constituents and thermal degradation to break the scrap down into materials and energy [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. While the thermoplastics degrade thermally via chain scission reactions, thermosets form cross-links, an important process for char forming which generates high molecular weight structures that are less volatile.
