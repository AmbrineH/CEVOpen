<p class="p">Pyrolysis of thermoplastics yield more volatiles and less carbon residue (less carbonization), whereas, thermosets yield more carbon residue. Thermoplastics also show better wetting characteristics whereas thermosets show little or no wetting characteristics as determined by their bonding characteristics.</p>
