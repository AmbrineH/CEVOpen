<p class="p">Chlorinated polymers like PVC may lead to dioxin formation during landfilling and incineration. Exposure to dioxins can cause skin lesions, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also can cause cancer. However, dioxins are contained within the required level during pyrolysis of waste plastics. Heavy metals emissions, especially the Cd and Hg from the blast furnaces, could pose problems when the plastic wastes are sourced from mechanically separated packaging and commercial wastes and the lighter fractions from the end of life vehicles [
