In Japan, mechanical recycle, feedstock recycle, and energy recovery were used to increase the waste plastic utilization over 50 wt. % ratio to solve the problem of shortages in landfills and incineration sites. Consumable carbon anodes for the aluminium industry using high temperature interactions of waste plastics with petroleum coke have been developed [
