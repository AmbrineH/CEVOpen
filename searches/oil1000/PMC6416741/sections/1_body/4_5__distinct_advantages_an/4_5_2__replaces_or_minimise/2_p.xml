<p class="p">The virgin epoxy resin used in palletisation serves as the reductant, minimising the need for non-renewable resources, such as coke, as the reductant and fuel. The conventional iron ore reduction/palletization requires at least 1:3 Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to C, i.e., at least 10 times less carbonaceous material is used. The pyrolysis of resins provides for reducing atmosphere of H
