<p class="p">The pellets using epoxy resin as the binder show high compression strength of 4 kN without heat treatment compared to the industry requirement (2.5 kN) of an indurated pellet processed at 1200–1350 °C. Energy consumption during heat induration of magnetite concentrates ranges from 320,000 kJ/t to 740,000 kJ/t pellets and higher for higher non-magnetite ores due to the absence of exothermic and oxidation reactions. Cold bonded pellets being a low temperature alternative to heat-indurated pellets consume less energy for bonding self-reducing pellets and for refractory ores that are difficult to heat treat. The estimated cold bonding capital and operating costs is 2/3 of that of heat induration [
