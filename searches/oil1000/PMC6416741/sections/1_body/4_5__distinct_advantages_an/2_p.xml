 <xref rid="B56-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Waste plastics are thermally decomposed into approximately 20 wt. % coke, 40 wt. % hydrocarbon oil (tar and light oil) and 40 wt. % coke oven gas, which are utilized as iron ore-reducing agents in blast furnaces, raw materials for the chemical industry and a fuel for power plants, respectively. There is a higher carbon uptake when plastics are used compared to the coke in reduced iron. An added advantage of waste plastics utility in blast furnace operations is their low sulphur and alkali content. Plastic production uses far less energy compared to traditional materials.
