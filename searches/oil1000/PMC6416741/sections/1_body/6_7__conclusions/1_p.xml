<p class="p">Concerns are mounting regarding the usage, disposal and accumulation of EOL plastics in landfills and in natural habitats. Ingestion or entanglement in plastic and leaching of chemicals from plastic products can affect wild and marine life and humans. Currently there is a global consensus that plastics are a threat to the environment prompting many governments to ban single use plastic products, including Australia, India, Kenya, U.K., Taiwan, Zimbabwe, Montreal (Canada), Malibu and Seattle (USA), Hamburg (Germany), France, Morocco, and Rwanda. About 4% of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. When one third of the plastics produced are used in packaging and other short-lived applications only to be rapidly discarded [
 <xref rid="B109-materials-12-00655" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], such use of plastics is unsustainable or untenable. Solving the pollution problems of plastics will require appropriate planning and design for end-of-life recyclability and increased recycling capacity through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. This review highlights many current as well as novel future applications of recycled and virgin polymers in metallurgical and mineral processing which could greatly contribute in managing EOL plastics. Specific applications include: 
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Coal dewatering, where super absorbent polymers offer ambient non-evaporative technology to dry low-grade brown coals and fine black coals saving on costs, energy and emissions while simultaneously enhancing the calorific values of the same. These super absorbent polymers can be regenerated at low pH or low temperatures (37–52 °C)</p>

   <p class="p">Chemical feedstock recycling of waste plastics in coke oven and blast furnaces produce carbon residues and reducing gases such as methane and hydrogen and fuel oils. They reduce the coke consumption in blast furnace iron making and CO
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions &gt;30%. In EAF, they aid slag foaming contributing to energy reductions. Harmful emissions of dioxins are reduced during the feedstock recycling of waste plastics.

   <p class="p">For iron ore palletisation in this novel process, the epoxy resins used as the binder, reductant and as fuel, offer high compression strength under ambient conditions, far exceeding the heat induration strength, saving on costs, energy and emissions. In addition, the reducing atmosphere provided by the polymer resins reduce the reaction temperature by about 100 °C. Use of the bio-renewable epoxy resins, currently being commercialised, makes this a green process.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Iron alloy production, where silicones and the epoxy resins are used as the alloying agents, binder, reductant and fuel towards the production of ferrosilicon, silicon carbide with varying microstructures. The alloy formation occurs at 1600 °C as opposed to the conventional 2000 °C.</p>

   <p class="p">Carbon sequestration, where the plastics used totally consume the CO
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> produced in a high carbon high footprint reaction, such as thermal decomposition of magnesite or clinker production, simultaneously producing hydrogen, contributing to hydrogen economy.
