  <title class="title">Time course of lipid accumulation by fatty acids.</title>
  <p class="p">(A) Quantification of lipid content normalized by protein and (B) representative phase-contrast images of gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells stained with Oil red O. Cells were treated at day 4 with selected individual or combined fatty acids (200 μM), or were left untreated as control (CT, dashed line in A) for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h. In (A) data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3–4). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among time-points are indicated by different letters. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the control. In (B) magnification 20x, arrows indicate lipid droplets. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid; ALA: α-linolenic acid.</p>
