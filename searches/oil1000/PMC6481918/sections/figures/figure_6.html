 <p> PPARγ antagonists effects in adipogenic genes expression. Relative expression of genes related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism ( pparg, rxr, cebpb, lpl, cd36, fatp1 and fabp11) normalized to b-actin and rps18 in gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells. Cells at day 4 were incubated with the fatty acids (A) EPA or (B) LA in the absence (dashed line, used as control) or presence of a PPARγ antagonist (T0070907 or GW9662) for 6 h. Data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3–4). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among treatments are indicated by different letters. Asterisks show significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the control. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid. </p>
