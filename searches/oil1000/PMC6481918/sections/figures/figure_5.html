 <p> Fatty acids effects on adipogenic genes expression. Relative expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, including (A, C) enzymes ( fas, lpl and hsl) and (B, D) fatty acid transporters ( cd36, fatp1 and fabp11) normalized to b-actin and rps18 in gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells. Cells at day 4 were incubated with different (A, B) individual or (C, D) combined fatty acids, or were left untreated as control (dashed lines) for 6 h. Data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3–4). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among treatments are indicated by different letters. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the control. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid; ALA: α-linolenic acid. </p>
