 <p> Fatty acids effects on transcription factors gene expression. Relative expression of genes related to the processes of osteogenesis ( runx2) and adipogenesis ( pparg, rxr and cebpb) normalized to b-actin and rps18 in gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells. Cells at day 4 were treated with different (A) individual or (B) combined fatty acids or were left untreated as control (dashed lines) for 6 h. Data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3–4). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among treatments are indicated by different letters. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the control. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid; ALA: α-linolenic acid. </p>
