 <p> Summary of fatty acids effects on gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells. Schematic representation summarizing the effects of fatty acid (FA) treatments over bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of gilthead sea bream. The fatty acids produce an inhibition of the osteogenic process through causing a down-regulation of runx2 and a stabilization of the osteogenic genes relative expression. On the other hand, fatty acids induce adipogenesis, with those fatty acids characteristic from fish oils apparently via up-regulating pparg mRNA levels and in contrast, those typical from vegetable oils increasing the relative gene expression of fatty acid transporters ( fabp11 and fatp1), thus potentially enhancing cell lipid accumulation. </p>
