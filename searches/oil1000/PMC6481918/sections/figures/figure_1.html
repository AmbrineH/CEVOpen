 <p> Dose response of fatty acids on lipid accumulation. (A) Quantification of lipid content normalized by protein and (B) representative phase-contrast images of gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells after staining with Oil red O. Cells were treated at day 4 with different concentrations of individual fatty acids, or were left untreated as control (dashed line in A) for 48 h. In (A) data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3–4). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among concentrations are indicated by different letters. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the control. In (B) magnification 20x and enlarged views, arrow indicates lipid droplets. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid; ALA: α-linolenic acid. </p>
