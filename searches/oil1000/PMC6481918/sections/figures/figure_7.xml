  <title class="title">Summary of fatty acids effects on gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells.</title>
  <p class="p">Schematic representation summarizing the effects of fatty acid (FA) treatments over bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of gilthead sea bream. The fatty acids produce an inhibition of the osteogenic process through causing a down-regulation of 
   <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> and a stabilization of the osteogenic genes relative expression. On the other hand, fatty acids induce adipogenesis, with those fatty acids characteristic from fish oils apparently via up-regulating 
   <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> mRNA levels and in contrast, those typical from vegetable oils increasing the relative gene expression of fatty acid transporters (
   <italic class="italic">fabp11</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">fatp1</italic>), thus potentially enhancing cell lipid accumulation.
