  <title class="title">Effects of ethanol, fatty acids and antagonists treatments on cell viability.</title>
  <p class="p">Viability of gilthead sea bream bone-derived cells at day 4 determined by means of the MTT assay. Cells were treated (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) for 24 h with different concentrations of ethanol; or for 6 h (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) with different concentrations of selected fatty acids (EPA and LA) or were left untreated as control (dashed line), and (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) with the fatty acids EPA or LA in the absence (dashed line) or the presence of a PPARÎ³ antagonist (T0070907 or GW9662). Data are shown as mean + SEM (n = 3). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among concentrations are indicated by different letters. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) with the corresponding control. EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; LA: linoleic acid.
