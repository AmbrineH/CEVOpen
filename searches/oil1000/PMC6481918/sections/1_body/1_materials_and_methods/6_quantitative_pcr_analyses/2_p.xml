<p class="p">qPCR was performed using a CFX384 thermocycler (Bio-Rad, El Prat de Llobregat, Spain) as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Each qPCR reaction was performed in triplicate in a total volume of 5 μL, containing 2.5 μL of the iTaq Universal SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad, El Prat de Llobregat, Spain), 2 μL of diluted cDNA, 0.125 μL of each primer (250 nM) (
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and milliQ water. Samples were amplified as follows: 95°C for 3 min, and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, followed by annealing 60–68°C for 30 s (primer-dependent, 
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), followed by a dissociation step from 55 to 95°C with a 0.5°C increase every 5 s. A standard curve with a dilution series of a cDNA sample pool was constructed to determine the qPCR efficiency of each primer pair (

To determine the overall performance of each qPCR assay three control samples were used: no template control (NTC), no reverse transcriptase control (RTC), and PCR control (PCR). Relative expression levels of the target genes were determined by the Pfaffl method [
