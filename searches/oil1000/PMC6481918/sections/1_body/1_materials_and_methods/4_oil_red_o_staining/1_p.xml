<p class="p">Intracellular neutral lipid accumulation was analyzed by Oil red O (ORO) staining as explained in [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 1 h, subsequently rinsed with PBS, stained with 0.3% ORO prepared in 36% tri-ethyl phosphate for 2 h, and then rinsed with distilled water. Quantification of cell lipid content was calculated as the absorbance measured at 490 nm divided by the read at 630 nm (Infinite 200, Tecan) corresponding to the protein content. The latter was obtained after Comassie blue staining for 1 h and dye extraction by incubation of the cells with 85% propylene glycol during 3 h at 60Â°C [

The staining effectiveness was evaluated with a Zeiss Axiovert 40C (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany) inverted research grade microscope equipped with a Canon EOS 1000D digital camera (magnification 20x).
