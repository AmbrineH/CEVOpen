<p class="p">The methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate cell viability as previously described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Briefly, cells from 3–4 independent cultures were incubated the last 3 h of the total 24 h treatment with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Then, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 250 μL of DMSO per well and absorbance was read immediately using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Cell viability values were obtained from the absorbance measured at 570 nm, with 680 nm as the reference wavelength.
