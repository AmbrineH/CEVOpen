<p class="p">The cells were lysed with a cell scraper and TRI Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Alcobendas, Spain) in a total volume of 1 mL per each two wells. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, dissolved in DEPC-treated water (RNase-free), quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Alcobendas, Spain) and stored at −80°C. To eliminate any residual genomic DNA, total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Alcobendas, Spain) and converted into cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain), following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
