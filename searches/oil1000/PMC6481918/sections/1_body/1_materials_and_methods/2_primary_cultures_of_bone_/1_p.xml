<p class="p">Primary cultures of gilthead sea bream bone-derived MSCs were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Briefly, three juvenile gilthead sea bream were used for each culture. The fish were sacrificed by a blow to the head, and bone-derived MSCs were isolated from a piece of vertebra by mechanical disruption and enzymatic (i.e. collagenase) digestion. After several washes, cells and small vertebra fragments were plated with growth medium (GM) consisting on Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and supplemented with 19mM NaCl and 1% fungizone (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Alcobendas, Spain), in 10cm culture dishes. After 1week, the fragments were removed, and the attached cells collected with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and plated into new 10cm plates with fresh GM. From here, the cells were routinely subcultured every time they reached about 70–80% confluence and used for a maximum of 10 passages.
