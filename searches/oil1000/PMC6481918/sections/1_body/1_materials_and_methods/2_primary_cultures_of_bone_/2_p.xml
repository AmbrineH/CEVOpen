 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in 24 well plates for the viability test and the lipid quantification assay and in 6 well plates for the gene expression analyses. The fatty acids were applied 3–4 days after plating and the duration of the treatments were of 6 h for gene expression analyses, 24 h to determine viability and 6, 24, 48 and 72 h to quantify lipid accumulation. In all cases, two wells were used for each experimental condition. The fatty acids selected were the following: EPA and DHA since are the most abundant n-3 fatty acids in fish oil sources, and LA and ALA because are essential fatty acids that are present at a high percentage in vegetable oils commonly used in fish feeds (i.e. soya and rapeseed oils). The fatty acids obtained from Cayman Chemical Company (Michigan, USA), were first dissolved in ethanol and used at a final concentration of 200 μM both, individually and in all tested combinations unless stated otherwise. Final concentration of ethanol was very low (below 1%) and did not cause any negative effects in cell viability as confirmed in preliminary assays (ethanol concentrations up to 10% were tested for 24 h,

For the PPARγ antagonists experiment, two commonly used covalent PPARγ ligands T0070907 (2-Chloro-5-nitro-N-4-pyridinyl-benzamide) and GW9662 (2-Chloro-5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide) were used. These two compounds are referred to as antagonists because they physically block ligand binding by covalently modifying the Cys285 located in an orthosteric pocket embedded in the ligand-binding domain, although they do not have comparable effects with regards to transcription [
