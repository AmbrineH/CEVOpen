<p class="p">Regarding expression of adipocyte markers, specifically genes that codify for key enzymes such as 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>, involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, remained stable, maybe due to a direct inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesis caused by the addition of fatty acids into the culture medium. Similarly, differences could not be found in 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> gene expression during differentiation into adipocytes of rainbow trout cultured pre-adipocytes when the whole transcriptional profile of this process was analyzed [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Nevertheless, increased gene expression in the late phases of adipocyte differentiation has been reported for 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> in red sea bream [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and Atlantic salmon [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>].
