<p class="p">To further evaluate if the bone-derived MSCs are deviated from the osteogenic process when the fatty acid treatments are applied, the expression of various genes related to both early osteogenesis and late mineralization of bone ECM was determined [

 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], in the same cell model after addition of a standard adipogenic medium. With these results, we could suggest that the osteogenic process, to which these cells were previously predestined in their tissue microenvironment, has stopped. This deregulation of MSCs determination and/or trans-differentiation has been related not only in mammals, but also in fish, with developmental disorders or disease states, such as distraction osteogenesis in rats [
