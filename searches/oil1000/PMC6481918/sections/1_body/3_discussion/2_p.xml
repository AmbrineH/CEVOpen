<p class="p">The first step was to check that the incubation with the fatty acids was not causing any deleterious effect on the cells. Thus, an MTT assay was run showing that none of the fatty acids significantly affected bone-derived MSCs viability at concentrations up to 200 μM, although a slight rise in viability could be seen with the 100 μM concentrations, maybe related to the increased metabolic activity of the cells along the induced process of differentiation. These results coincide with those in another study, where fatty acid treatments were performed on human MSCs grown in osteogenic media, to see their possible effect on osteoblastogenesis [

Also, cell viability was verified after applying different fatty acids (e.g. EPA, DHA and arachidonic) at a 100 μM concentration on the skeletal VSa16 cell line of gilthead sea bream, demonstrating that such treatments can stimulate proliferation without signs of toxic effects [
