<p class="p">Concerning the genes involved in the uptake and transport of fatty acids, 
 <italic class="italic">cd36</italic> is, among others, a target gene of PPARγ [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In this context, PPARγ activation was found to induce 
 <italic class="italic">cd36</italic> expression and adipocyte differentiation of the arterial rat VSMCs line [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. In our study, the increased 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> mRNA levels at 6 h incubation in response to EPA, but not in 
 <italic class="italic">cd36</italic>, suggest a possible delayed up-regulation of the latter. Furthermore, in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, the mRNA levels of 
 <italic class="italic">fatp1</italic> increased during the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, at earlier stages than 
 <italic class="italic">fabp11</italic>, indicating that the former has an important role in the induction of adipogenesis and in the uptake of fatty acids from the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. In our study, the combination of LA+ALA or LA alone caused an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">fatp1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">fabp11</italic> mRNA levels compared to other combinations. Altogether, these results indicated a more direct stimulation of fat transporters expression by fatty acids of vegetal origin, especially LA, suggesting a possible mechanism of action to induce adipogenesis through enhancing fatty acid uptake. These observations together with the elevated capacity of lipid accumulation when cells were treated with LA are in agreement with a previous study in gilthead sea bream, in which diets with high content in vegetable oils induced adipocyte hypertrophy [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. On the other hand, DHA and more remarkably EPA, showed a higher potential to stimulate adipogenesis via up-regulation of 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> gene expression, thus inducing the adipocyte-like phenotype but with lower lipid content. Hence, since smaller adipocytes have the metabolic advantage of retaining insulin sensitivity and protect other tissues from lipotoxicity according to works in mammals [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], further studies would be of great interest to demonstrate if fish oil-derived fatty acids would lead to healthier cells as well in fish.
