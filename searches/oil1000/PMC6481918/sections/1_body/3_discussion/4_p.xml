<p class="p">Next, to further evaluate the effects of fatty acids on MSCs lineage determination, expression of relevant driving genes was analyzed. 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> codifies for a key transcriptional activator that promotes osteoblastogenesis thus, inhibiting the determination and subsequent differentiation of MSCs into other cell lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. On the other hand, PPARγ, a member of the hormone nuclear receptors family, after interaction with specific ligands such as LC-PUFA, activates the transcription of genes involved in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism determining the adipocyte phenotype of MSCs [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Moreover, induction of 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> expression can result in the inhibition of differentiation toward osteoblasts, as it has been described in some mammalian studies by acting as a suppressor of 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Besides, overexpression of 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> in rat MSCs derived from adipose tissue produces a decrease in the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]; consequently, these two transcription factors seem to act by negatively regulating each other. In Atlantic salmon, 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> is also silenced when the culture medium used is osteogenic, while 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> has its expression inhibited in the presence of an adipogenic medium [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In agreement with these observations, in our study, all fatty acid treatments, either alone or in combination, down-regulated 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic>, although only EPA was able to significantly increase 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> gene expression. In fact, when treating the gilthead sea bream osteoblast-like VSa16 cell line with EPA, a decrease in the mRNA levels of 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic> was also reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Accordingly, an increase in the transcript levels of 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> was also caused in human MSCs due to EPA treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Despite significant differences were not observed with DHA alone, up-regulation of this key adipogenic gene was found with all combinations containing this fatty acid. Interestingly, both EPA and DHA had been considered for years, natural ligands of 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic>, and to have greater potency on activating this transcription factor, compared to the n-6 PUFA (i.e. LA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]; so, these findings propose a direct effect of these n-3 LC-PUFA stimulating adipogenesis, as previously described in mammalian models [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">cebpb</italic> expression was also up-regulated in response to EPA and by the combination EPA+DHA, supporting that the initiation of the adipogenic process is taking place upon those treatments. In fact, at least in mammals, 
 <italic class="italic">cebpb</italic> contributes to stimulate 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> expression during early adipogenesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Moreover, similar results were found when the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">rxr</italic> was analyzed, since EPA, but also LA, could significantly up-regulate it. The nuclear receptor RXR forms a heterodimer among others with PPARγ, to regulate the transcription of genes related to lipid metabolism, thus also driving adipocyte differentiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Nevertheless, knowledge on the PPARγ-RXR heterodimers, as well as their response to fatty acids in fish is very limited.
