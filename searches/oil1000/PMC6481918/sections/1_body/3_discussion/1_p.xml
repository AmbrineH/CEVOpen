<p class="p">This study has focused on the characterization of the likely differential effects of fatty acids typical from fish oil (EPA and DHA) and those most commonly found in vegetable oils (LA and ALA) on cellular plasticity and metabolism. To this end, we used as a model an 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> culture of MSCs derived from vertebra bone of gilthead sea bream (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aurata</italic>), one of the most cultivated species in Mediterranean aquaculture. The main objective was to evaluate the lineage-induction potential over the MSCs of these fatty acids, not only for its possible relevance in fish nutrition and welfare, but also to validate the cell system to further study the multipotentiality of piscine MSCs and their regulation.
