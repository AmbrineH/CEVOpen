<p class="p">In this context, the aim of the present work was to study the effects of the fatty acids EPA and DHA, present mainly in fish oil, and those of LA and ALA, common in vegetable oils (such as soybean, rapeseed and linseed oils), on fat deposition and the expression of both adipogenic- and osteogenic-related genes, in MSCs derived from gilthead sea bream vertebrae. The study hypothesis was that these fatty acids, supplemented in the media, could induce the differentiation of bone-derived MSCs toward the adipogenic 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> the osteogenic lineage, potentially producing phenotypically different adipocytes depending on the fatty acid source.
