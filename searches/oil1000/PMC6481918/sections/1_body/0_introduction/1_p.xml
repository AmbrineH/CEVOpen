<p class="p">In the last decades, both the world population and the consumption of fish and seafood per capita have increased and will continue to rise. Fish products are rich in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3) acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], which are crucial nutrients for overall health [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. For these reasons, scientific research is indispensable to improve aquaculture production under sustainable conditions, which implies among others, a reduction in the use of fish oil in aquafeeds formulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The alternatives are vegetable oils, which in contrast to fish oil, are richer in n-6 or n-9 PUFA such as linoleic (LA, 18:2n-6), oleic (18:1n-9) or alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3n-3) acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Moreover, fish (especially marine) may have limited ability to convert C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> PUFA to C
 <sub class="sub">20/22</sub> [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] so, it should be considered that feeding fish with highly substituted diets can result in tissues with lower n-3 LC-PUFA content [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Apart from changes in the fatty acid composition of the fish filet [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], dietary vegetable oils in excess can cause adipose tissue and hepatic metabolic alterations [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] or affect the immune system [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Besides, low concentrations of dietary EPA and DHA during development, have been related to increased incidence of skeletal malformations [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Overall, these can lead to unhealthier or low-quality fish having consequences in aquaculture production.
