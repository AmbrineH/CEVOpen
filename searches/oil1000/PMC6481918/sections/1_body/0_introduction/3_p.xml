<p class="p">Interestingly, mammalian adipocytes can arise from the same MSCs as osteoblasts and a high degree of plasticity has been observed between the two cell lineages, even in very advanced maturation stages [

 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These factors successively promote the transcription of specific genes mainly related with lipid metabolism like fatty acid synthase (

 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Adipose tissue can grow not only by elevating the cellular number from resident precursors (hyperplasia) but also by increasing the size of existing adipocytes (hypertrophy), by accumulating lipids into their cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For that matter, fatty acid transporter proteins like FATP1 or the FAT translocase/CD36, together with lipoprotein lipase (LPL), are relevant actors that facilitate the fat uptake [

 <xref rid="pone.0215926.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], its growth by hypertrophy has been associated with less responsive adipocytes to hormones and metabolites (i.e. insulin). This situation in humans derives in hypertrophic obesity and is closely linked to major health issues such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia or cardiovascular diseases [
