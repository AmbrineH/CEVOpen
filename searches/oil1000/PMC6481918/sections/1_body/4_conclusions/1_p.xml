<p class="p">Gilthead sea bream bone-derived MSCs treated with one or two combined fatty acids undergo morphological and transcriptional changes, increasing lipid accumulation as well as the expression of adipogenic genes while decreasing or maintaining stable those related to the osteogenic process. This confirms the plasticity of these cells and supports their use as a model to study MSCs fate modulation. Besides, these findings should be also considered when studying fish bone structure and function, since at least in humans, there is a correlation between the appearance of bone marrow fat and the reduced bone forming capacity observed during diabetes and aging [

Our data also suggest that fatty acids might be inducing adipogenesis potentially through different pathways, with fish oil-derived fatty acids such as EPA causing mainly formation of new adipocytes through activation of PPARÎ³, whereas vegetable fatty acids like LA appear to rather induce a process of fat accumulation in committed pre-adipocytes (

While we should be cautious because most of our data is based on a transcriptional level, and further studies are required to validate these observations; overall, this needs to be considered in feeds formulation to carefully find a balance according to the nature of the oil sources to ensure a healthy and high-quality fish.
