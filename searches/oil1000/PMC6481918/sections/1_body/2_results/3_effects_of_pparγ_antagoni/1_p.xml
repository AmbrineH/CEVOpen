<p class="p">Two different antagonists of PPARÎ³ were applied to cells treated with either EPA or LA, to elucidate the potential different mechanism of action of these fatty acids inducing the differentiation of the bone-derived MSCs into adipocyte-like cells. First, viability assays were performed to assure non-toxicity of the products (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215926.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). Next, taking into account that the transcriptional effects of each fatty acid alone in comparison to the control were already reported, the condition of each fatty acid in the absence of antagonists was used as the corresponding control in this set of experiments. Cells treated with EPA and T0070907 showed an overall decrease in expression for the genes studied, which was significant in comparison to the treatment with the other antagonist, GW9662 for
