<p class="p">To further determine the effects through time of selected fatty acids on lipid accumulation, individual treatments with EPA and LA as representatives from the highly present fatty acids in fish and vegetable oils respectively, plus the mixtures EPA+DHA as the fish oil combination, LA+ALA as the vegetable oils one and EPA+LA as the combination containing one fatty acid of each source, were tested at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h. All treatments caused a significant increase in cell lipid content compared to the control condition. Moreover, a time-dependent response up to 48 h (remaining high at 72 h) was also observed by treatments including LA alone or in combination (

According to these results, the 6 h treatment was selected to evaluate gene expression in subsequent experiments, in order to observe the immediate effects of these fatty acids at a transcriptional level inducing changes on cell metabolism.
