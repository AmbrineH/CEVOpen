<p class="p">Preliminary analyses demonstrated that cell viability was unaffected by the addition of the different fatty acids up to the 200 μM concentration tested (

On the other hand, a dose response was observed with regards to lipid accumulation upon a 48 h treatment with each one of the four fatty acids (EPA, DHA, LA and ALA), showing at the 100 μM concentration significantly higher intracellular lipid content compared to lower doses and the control condition without fatty acids (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref> as a representation) confirmed this observation, being the 200 μM concentration the one causing higher lipid accumulation and therefore, the one selected for the following experiments. In addition, we could observe in these images the change of cell morphology in response to the treatments, becoming the cells more rounded with an enlarged cytoplasm while losing the fibroblastic shape of MSCs.
