<p class="p">The expression analysis of osteogenic genes involved in ECM formation and/or mineralization showed how these remained unaltered in cells in the presence of fatty acids either applied alone or in combination. Nevertheless, the treatments with two fatty acids combined caused 
 <italic class="italic">on</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">op</italic> to have a lower, but not significant expression, compared to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Moreover, genes encoding lipid metabolism-related enzymes and fatty acid transporters were studied to unravel whether a possible regulation of pro-adipogenic genes was related to the process of differentiation of MSCs into adipocyte-like cells. EPA treatment caused an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> mRNA levels, although only significant when compared to DHA-treated cells, while 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> remained stable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>). Concerning the fatty acid transporters, EPA, LA and ALA significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels of 
 <italic class="italic">fabp11</italic> compared to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B</xref>). Even applying combinations of the different fatty acids to the cells, the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cd36</italic> remained unaffected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). Nevertheless, the combination of the two fatty acids more common in vegetable oils (LA+ALA), significantly up-regulated the transcript expression of 
 <italic class="italic">fabp11</italic> in comparison to the combination with the fatty acids EPA+DHA and the control condition. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">fatp1</italic> levels were significantly higher in response to LA+ALA when compared to the combinations containing EPA and either one of these two fatty acids from vegetable oils, but not with the control (
