<p class="p">The gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">runx2</italic>, the key transcription factor of the osteogenic process, was significantly down-regulated by all fatty acids, either applied individually or combined, compared to the control condition, although differences were not observed among treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Contrarily, the principal genes involved in the first steps of adipogenesis, were up-regulated after EPA treatment, significantly for 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">cebpb</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rxr</italic>, and the latter also by LA treatment, when compared to the control. In addition, EPA-treated cells showed significant differences with respect to those treated with LA or ALA for 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> gene expression and with DHA as well in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">rxr</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the different combinations caused patterns of expression for these genes according to the fatty acids included in the mixture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215926.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>). Namely, the combinations containing one (i.e. DHA) or specially the two fatty acids present in fish oils, significantly up-regulated the transcript levels of the adipogenic genes 
 <italic class="italic">pparg</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cebpb</italic>, compared to the control condition and the combination of LA+ALA. In addition, the mRNA levels of 
 <italic class="italic">rxr</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cebpb</italic> were significantly lower in response to the combinations containing LA (especially in the one of LA+ALA), respect to the EPA+DHA mixture (
