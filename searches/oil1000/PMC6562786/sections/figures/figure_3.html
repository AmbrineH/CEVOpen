 <p> Morphological comparison of midgut and fat body from larvae reared on SD and VMD. ( A, B) Cross-section of the posterior midgut. Columnar cells display a different thickness of the brush border (arrowheads). ( C, D) Fat body. A higher amount of protein granules (arrowheads) and a smaller size of lipid droplets (arrows) is observable in trophocytes of larvae grown on SD compared to VMD. e, epithelium; mc, muscle cells; l, lumen; pm, peritrophic matrix. Bar: 50 Î¼m. </p>
