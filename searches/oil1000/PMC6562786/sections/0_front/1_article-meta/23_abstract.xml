  <p class="p">Protein production for animal husbandry is a crucial ecological problem because of its impact on the environment, as it requires water, energy, and land. These resources are limited and not reusable. In this study, we obtained a continuously regenerating system in which by-products of a process constituted rough material for another one. Leftovers from fruit and vegetable markets were employed as rearing substrate for insects (Black Soldier Fly). Insect biomass was transformed into meal and oil for fish feeding and food/pharmaceutical industry, respectively. The residuals from insect rearing were then used as substrate to grow earthworms, which transformed this material into compost for plants. Therefore, we returned to the starting point of our economic and ecological closed loop, i.e., to soil improvers (nutrient material) for fruit and vegetable production. Moreover, earthworms can be conveniently employed as fishing bites. We also studied a series of physiological parameters of the living organisms involved in this system to verify their health conditions (insects), and growth performances (insects and fish). Microbiological analyses of insects, rearing substrate, and insect meal were conducted to assess their safety for fish and humans. Related technological processes, such as insects drying, grinding, and oil extraction, were also tested.</p>

  <p class="p">The worldwide growing consumption of proteins to feed humans and animals has drawn a considerable amount of attention to insect rearing. Insects reared on organic wastes and used as feed for monogastric animals can reduce the environmental impact and increase the sustainability of meat/fish production. In this study, we designed an environmentally closed loop for food supply in which fruit and vegetable waste from markets became rearing substrate for 
   <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> (BSFâ€” black soldier fly). A vegetable and fruit-based substrate was compared to a standard diet for Diptera in terms of larval growth, waste reduction index, and overall substrate degradation. Morphological analysis of insect organs was carried out to obtain indications about insect health. Processing steps such as drying and oil extraction from BSF were investigated. Nutritional and microbiological analyses confirmed the good quality of insects and meal. The meal was then used to produce fish feed and its suitability to this purpose was assessed using trout. Earthworms were grown on leftovers of BSF rearing in comparison to a standard substrate. Chemical analyses of vermicompost were performed. The present research demonstrates that insects can be used to reduce organic waste, increasing at the same time the sustainability of aquaculture and creating interesting by-products through the linked bio-system establishment.
