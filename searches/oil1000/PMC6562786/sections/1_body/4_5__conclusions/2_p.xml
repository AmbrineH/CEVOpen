<p class="p">This paper does not have the ambition of describing a complete series of processing actions in details for the immediate transfer to large-scale production. In fact, many large-scale production processes for insect production, do already exist. On the other hand, these processes very often fail to obtain good results in terms of human security, environment, ethics applied to animal welfare. The final goal of our research was to delineate an interdisciplinary method, which can also be applied to other insects, based on the principles of the circular economy and with the objective to save natural resources, provide feed and food for animals and humans, create new technologies and job opportunities, and, at the same time, avoid microbiological risks and any kind of hazards for human health.</p>
