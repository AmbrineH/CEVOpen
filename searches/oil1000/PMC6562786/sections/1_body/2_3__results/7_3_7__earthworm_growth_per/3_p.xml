<p class="p">The ratio C/N is the lowest for BSF leftovers and it also remains the lowest after the earthworm development, despite the addition of peat moss. Therefore, there might be a relationship between earthworm behavioral data and substrate composition in terms of the C/N ratio, which might be further investigated in the future. According to the UDSA natural resource conservation service [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], materials with a C/N ratio greater than 24:1, when added to the soil, will result in a temporary nitrogen deficit (immobilization), and those with a C/N ratio lower than 24:1 will result in a temporary nitrogen surplus (mineralization). Therefore, the soil amendment coming from the joint action of BSF and earthworms appears to be optimal to be used to supply organic matter to plants.
