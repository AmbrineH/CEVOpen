<p class="p">Although the duration of the experiment was too limited to outline any difference regarding the reproductive behavior of earthworms according to the rearing substrate, it is quite interesting that Dominguez et al. [

 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] showed that some vermicomposting earthworm species raised on different diets modulate their growth, reproduction or both according to the food they receive. Aira et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] suggested that earthworms in low C/N diet conditions invested preferentially more energy in growth than in reproduction. In fact, in the experiment described by the authors the number of immature earthworms increased in the treatment with the highest C/N ratio, while in the treatment with the lowest C/N ratio the earthworm population was mainly composed of mature earthworms. Therefore, to better understand our results we analyzed the C/N ratio of the different substrates.
