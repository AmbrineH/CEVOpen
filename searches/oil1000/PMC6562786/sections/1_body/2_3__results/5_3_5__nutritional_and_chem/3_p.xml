<p class="p">However, previous preliminary analyses (data not shown) highlighted a lower content of protein (5â€“6% less out of the total d.m.) and a corresponding increase in the fat amount, in the BSF biomass obtained from larvae reared on VMD, in comparison to SD. Spranghers et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] also investigated the amino acid content in BSF pre-pupae, accordingly with the different rearing substrates. Glutamic acid, aspartate and arginine are the most represented amino acids in our BSF biomass reared on VMD (
