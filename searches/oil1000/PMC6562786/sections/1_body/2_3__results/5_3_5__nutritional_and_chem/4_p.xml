 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Most insect species contain a low level of Ca (less than 3% dry matter) as they have an exoskeleton primarily composed of protein and chitin [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. However, BSF larvae represent an exception since they have a mineralized exoskeleton in which Ca and other minerals are incorporated into the cuticle [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], and our data are consistent with the Ca profile previously reported for this species [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In agreement with previous studies, BSF appeared to contain high levels of Mn and Zn, too, in comparison to other insect species. According to Finke and Oonincx, [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] this is related to elevated levels of Mn and Zn in their mandibles, presumably to harden these appendages to better exploit hard feeding substrates. However, wild-caught insects appear to contain significant amounts of manganese, too [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. With regard to copper, chromium, cobalt, nickel and the heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead, their levels in BSF meal were in the range of Âµg/g dry matter (
