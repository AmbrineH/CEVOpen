 <xref rid="animals-09-00278-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows BSF contribution in terms of proteins, fat and sugars, although the final meal was partly defatted (still containing 17.45% of oil). Thus, the table refers to the whole insect composition, while fish meal preparation included the aforementioned defatting process. It is important to notice that a percentage of 4.02% is constituted by chitin. Protein amount is good, being 39.42% of the total dry matter (d.m.), i.e., in the range of the protein amount found by Spranghers et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], which varied from 39 to 41% for different substrates, including vegetable sources. Even nitrogen-free extracts, fat and ash contents are comparable to the values reported by Spranghers et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] for BSF reared on a similar substrate.
