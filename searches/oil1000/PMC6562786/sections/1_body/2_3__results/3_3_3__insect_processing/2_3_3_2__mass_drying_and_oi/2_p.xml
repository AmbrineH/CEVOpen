<p class="p">This dried biomass (72 kg) was analyzed before mass grinding and defatting, to evaluate total water and oil content, which resulted in 1.90% moisture and 35.62% crude ether extract. Thus, the total biomass was processed obtaining 18.8 kg of oily material (87.0% oil, 1.7% humidity, 11.3% impurity), and 53.2 kg (73.9% of the initial dry larvae amount) of the partly defatted meal (humidity:1.96%, crude ether extract:17.45%). Therefore, an oil recovery of 64% was calculated.</p>
