<p class="p">At the end of the drying process Wr values were 35.7 ± 0.1% for SD BSF after 360 min, and 26.1 ± 0.6% and 28.6 ± 0.2% for VMD1 and VMD2 BSF after 420 min, respectively. After the overnight drying at the lowest airflow rate, Wr values were 25.4 ± 0.1% for VMD1 BSF and 28.2 ± 0.2% for VMD2 BSF. At the end of the drying process, insects in the BSF biomass of SD e VMD2 were well separated one from each other, while VMD1 insects, due to the presence of some rearing substrate, resulted in a conglomerate difficult to crumble (
