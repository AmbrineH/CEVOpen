<p class="p">To evaluate the health status of the larvae grown on VMD and the suitability of a fruit and vegetable mix as feeding substrate in mass rearing, we performed morphological analyses on the midgut and fat body, two organs that are involved in food digestion, nutrient absorption, nutrient storage, and immune response. Tissues isolated from larvae grown on VMD were compared to those taken from larvae reared on SD, whose composition guarantees an optimal development of BSF larvae. Both organs were subjected to microscopy analysis to assess whether the feeding substrate could affect their morphology. The posterior midgut of larvae reared on VMD showed differences compared to larvae grown on SD. In particular, columnar cells (
