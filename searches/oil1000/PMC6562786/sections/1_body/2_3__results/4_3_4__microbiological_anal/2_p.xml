<p class="p">The results of the microbiological analysis of the feeding substrate (VMD), dried BSF biomass, defatted BSF meal and experimental fish feed at the four levels of insect meal addition (i.e., BSF 0, BSF 10, BSF 20, BSF 30) are reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00278-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The total mesophilic aerobes count was the microbial parameter characterizing all the products analyzed. The highest counts were observed in the fruit and vegetable waste substrate (6.55 ± 0.57 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>); they decreased of 1 and 2 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the dried biomass and defatted meal, respectively, and were kept at levels of about 4 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in all the experimental fish feeds prepared (

 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, present at a low level in the rearing substrate (1.70 ± 0.71 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), were under the detection limit of the count method after the processing steps for the preparation of the dried biomass and insect meal. They reached levels ranging from 1.00 ± 0.00 to 2.76 ± 0.49 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the experimental fish feeds. 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> counted at 44 °C, regarded as indicators of contamination with enterobacteria of faecal origin, was never detected (&lt;1.00 log cfu g

 <italic class="italic">Enterococci</italic>, another group of bacteria that could be used as indicators of faecal contamination [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], followed the same trend of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. Yeasts were enumerated at low levels in the fruit and vegetable waste substrate and dried pupae (2.48 ± 0.76 and 2.30 ± 0.43 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively), while mold counts were under the detection limit in almost all samples (&lt;2.00 log cfu g

 <xref rid="animals-09-00278-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The spores of sulfite-reducing 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic> were present in the rearing substrate (2.15 ± 0.75 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and were able to survive during processes for insect meal preparation (1.54 ± 0.51 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). They were found in only a few samples of fish feeds at low levels. The analyses for the detection of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> sp.pl. revealed the absence of the bacterium in 25 g of each sample.
