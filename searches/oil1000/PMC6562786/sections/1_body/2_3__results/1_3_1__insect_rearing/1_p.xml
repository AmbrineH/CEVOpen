<p class="p">Under laboratory conditions, the comparison between the development of BSF larvae reared on SD or VMD showed that the mix of fruit and vegetables represented a less nutritious substrate than a more balanced SD. In fact, although the maximum weight achieved before the prepupal stage was not significantly different in the two groups, the duration of the larval stage was longer in VMD group than in SD group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). More precisely, SD larvae needed to feed for about 17 days to reach the prepupal stage with a final individual weight of 225.4 ± 7.3 mg, while the time interval was more than doubled for the VMD group, with a final individual weight of 183.3 ± 6.6 mg. Nevertheless, when VMD larvae were mass-reared, their growth performances ameliorated, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The time necessary to reach the prepupal stage diminished in comparison to laboratory conditions (31 vs. 45 days, respectively) and the final weight was 230.8 ± 26.9 mg. Since BSF larvae have a gregarious behavior, the improvement in larval growth performance in mass rearing condition is likely related to the crowded environment (120 mg VDM larva

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in mass rearing condition vs. 200 mg VDM larva
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in laboratory rearing condition); in fact, the definition of the optimum quantity of feed under mass rearing conditions was the result of a long series of tests (data not shown), which were carried out to minimize feed waste and rearing leftover management and to maximize insect growth performance.
