<p class="p">WRI and D for the whole experiment were calculated. It is noteworthy that D, in the mass rearing on VMD, reached 96% although the WRI was rather low (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00278-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, the reason why WRI resulted low entirely depends on the fact that this index is the ratio between D and the days spent by the larvae to reach the pre-pupal stage. As BSF larvae delayed their larval development when reared on VMD, even under mass rearing, the obvious result was a decrease in WRI, although D was very high.
