<p class="p">In the present study we considered not only issues that are fundamental in a circular economy system, i.e., waste reduction, exploitation of different by-products, recycling of materials, but we evaluated even aspects that are important to make this closed-loop feasible, reliable and safe, i.e., insect health, insect meal acceptance by fish, nutritional composition of insect meal, microbiological quality of rearing products, and processing yields. In particular, studies on insect microbiology and health (the latter evaluated through microscopic analysis of the insect tissues and organs) were included in this paper according to the recommendations recently issued by IPIFF (International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed), which focused on good hygiene practices for the complete insect production chain and insect health [

Moreover, some aspects, such as the growth of BSF larvae on fruit and vegetable market leftovers and their drying were first studied at a laboratory scale and then the know-how was used to accomplish mass rearing after standardization of the method.
