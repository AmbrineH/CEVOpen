<p class="p">In accordance with this statement, we designed a continuously regenerating system in which by-products of each process constituted the rough material for another one. The cycle began with fruit and vegetable market leftovers that were employed to rear BSF larvae. Afterwards, insect biomass underwent drying, defatting, and grinding to obtain oil and meal and the latter was used for fish feed formulation. Feed containing BSF meal was then tested in a 3-month feeding trial using rainbow trout (
