<p class="p">Four diets were formulated with increasing percentages of BSF meal in substitution of fishmeal (FM). The BSF meal used in the trial derived from the aforementioned insect mass rearing and mass drying. Specifically, one control diet with 0% (BSF 0) and three experimental diets with 10% (BSF10), 20% (BSF 20), and 30% (BSF30) of BSF meal, were formulated to be isonitrogenous [crude protein: about 49 g/100 g dry matter (d.m.)], isolipidic [ether extract: approximately 18 g/100 g d.m.] and isoenergetic [gross energy: about 22.90 MJ/kg d.m.]. In order to maintain diets isonitrogenous, isolipidic and isoenergetic, and due to the different chemical composition of BSF meal compared to FM, with the increase of BSF meal inclusion, soybean oil and wheat bran amounts were correspondingly modified. Feeds were prepared at the Department of Agricultural, Forest and Food Science (DISAFA), University of Turin (Italy). The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter, proteins, ether extract and gross energy of each diet were assessed through an in vivo digestibility trial.

 <italic class="italic">(O. mykiss)</italic> fed twice daily with the four experimental diets. Feed was manually distributed and feeding rate was restricted to 1.5% of biomass for the entire duration of the experiment. At the end of the feeding trial all fish were individually weighed to calculate weight gain (WG = final body weight âˆ’ initial body weight).
