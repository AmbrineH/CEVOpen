<p class="p">Before each drying experiment, frozen BSF were thawed at 4 °C for 18 h. A pilot alternate upward-downward air circulated drier (Thermolab, Codogno, Italy) equipped with three grids and a 3 kg maximum loading capacity was used. The drying conditions were: temperature, 70 °C (dry bulb); air speed, 8 h at 1.5 m/s, then overnight at 1 m/s; time, until constant weight. Weights were recorded using a high precision platform of 25 kg capacity (Gibertini model PTF25D, Gibertini Elettronica, Italy). Before drying, each BSF replicate was packed into a tulle bag, to avoid possible losses of biological material, due to the air flow.</p>
