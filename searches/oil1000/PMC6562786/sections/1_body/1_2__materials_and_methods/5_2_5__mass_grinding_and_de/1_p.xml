<p class="p">The BSF dried biomass obtained from CREA-AA was pressed for obtaining oil and partly defatted meal. A continuous screw press (MIG srl, Fornovo San Giovanni, BG, Italy) mod. PC 25 was used. The equipment was constituted of a loading hopper, which was filled with the dried biomass, and a conveyor belt for material transfer into the continuous heater. The biomass arrived into the heater installed over the press where the temperature was kept at 80 Â°C by means of indirect heating. The pre-heated material was finally transferred into the press by simple drop assisted by a vibrating device. The dried BSF biomass was pressed using a screw-press rotating at approximately 20 revolutions per minute (rpm).</p>
