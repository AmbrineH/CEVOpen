 <italic class="italic">E. fetida</italic> specimens were collected from the field in the Veneto region (Northern Italy); they were chosen approximately of the same size, washed, wiped and weighed, so that each replicate of the three theses was composed of ten earthworms of similar weight. When earthworms were placed in the plastic containers, 500 mL of water were also added to each replicate; afterwards, water was added in the same quantity for all the containers at regular intervals, when the loss of humidity was detectable at touching. The environmental temperature in the room was maintained at 28 ± 1 °C. After 45 days the earthworms were separated from their feeding substrates, counted, and weighed. Their substrates were chemically analyzed to establish their value as soil improvers (see
