<p class="p">Three rearing substrates (experimental theses) to raise earthworms were prepared and put into separate containers. The test was carried out in three replicates; therefore, nine plastic boxes were prepared. The first substrate was composed of the dried leftovers of BSF rearing (250 g; 90% d.m.) and 750 g of peat moss; the second was prepared by mixing 750 g of the same fruit and vegetable material used as rearing substrate for BSF larvae (20% d.m.) and 750 g of peat moss; the fresh material was minced and let one month in the container to obtain a first partial decomposition; the third substrate, which was used as control, was composed of peat moss only.</p>
