<p class="p">Egg clutches were directly positioned on the two experimental diets: (1) Standard diet (SD) (Gainesville diet) [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]; or (2) a diet composed of a mix of fruit and vegetables (zucchini, apple, potato, green beans, carrot, pepper, orange, celery, kiwi, plum, eggplant) cut into small pieces of about 5 mm (Vegetable Mix Diet, VMD); both substrates were put in plastic containers (500 mL) where a perforated bottom assured drainage of excessive humidity. Eggs were collected within 24 h from the oviposition to obtain homogenous hatching. Eggs and larvae were maintained at 27 ± 1 °C, RH 50 ± 0.5% under a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod. A series of preliminary tests was carried out to establish the optimum quantity of feed under the aforementioned rearing conditions. Then, three replicates of 200 larvae were reared on both substrates (200 mg larva
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) (wet weight). Three samples of 10 larvae per each replicate were weighed every two days until 40% of the larvae reached the pre-pupal stage, which is indicated by the change in their color from creamy to black. Every two days, leftovers of insect feeding activity were weighed, after their removal from each container.
