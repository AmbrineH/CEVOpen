<p class="p">A mineral analysis was performed on BSF meal obtained from mass-reared insects and experimental fish diets, following the method described by AOAC [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The samples were dried to constant weight in an oven at 70 °C and then each sample was divided into three equal parts and mineralized in a microwave oven (Ethos one-Milestone) by adding HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> at 70%, and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 30% (Sigma Aldrich, Italy) to each part of the samples. The resulting solutions were transferred into 25 mL flasks making up the volume with milliQ water (Merck Millipore). All reagents were metal trace analysis grade. Analyses were performed on a Thermo Scientific atomic absorption spectrometer: three replicates of each sample gave RSDs ≤ 5%.
