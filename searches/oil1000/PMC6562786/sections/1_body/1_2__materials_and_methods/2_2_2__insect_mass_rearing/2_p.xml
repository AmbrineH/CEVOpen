<p class="p">Three replicates of ≈5000 eggs were directly put on VMD diet in plastic containers (40 × 60 × 5 cm) where a perforated bottom assured drainage of excessive humidity. A series of preliminary tests was carried out to establish the optimum quantity of feed with this sample size, and it was found to be 120 mg VDM larva
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (wet weight); starting from the tenth day after hatching, three samples of 10 larvae from each replicate were collected and weighed. At the end of the rearing cycle, BSF and rearing leftovers were removed from each container and weighed. While under laboratory conditions BSF pre-pupae were easily isolated and discarded from the rearing substrate, under mass rearing conditions stage selection was not just as simple; therefore, when BSF biomass is mentioned in the text, it refers to a mix of mostly larvae and occasionally pre-pupae.
