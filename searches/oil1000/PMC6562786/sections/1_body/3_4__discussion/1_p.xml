<p class="p">Fruit and vegetable leftovers, which are usually discarded from wholesale markets, represent a cheap substrate available in huge quantities that can be used to rear insects and obtain insect meal to be included in feed formulation. According to the results shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00278-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae can grow on this waste material and transform it quite completely, therefore, this insect can be advantageously employed to reduce food loss in this market sector. The comparison of laboratory and mass rearing tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated that it is possible to rear BSF larvae on a large scale on this substrate and that they actually thrive when are in crowded conditions because they are gregarious insects. The influence of rearing density on insect performances, food consumption, and digestibility is well-known. Norris [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] found that the Approximate Digestibility index was higher in crowded 
 <italic class="italic">Schistocerca gregaria</italic> adults than in isolated individuals; 
 <italic class="italic">Hyphantria cunea</italic> larvae reared individually or in small groups grew somewhat more slowly than larvae reared in large groups [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]; Long [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] assessed that crowded 
 <italic class="italic">Plusia gamma</italic> completed their larval stage quicker than isolated individuals. However, the underlying mechanism of the better growth of crowded BSF larvae might also be related to the regulation exerted by temperature on larval intestinal enzymes. In fact, according to Bonelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] the optimum temperature for proteolytic activity in the midgut of BSF larvae is 45 Â°C. This temperature can be generated by larval overcrowding and heat produced by their movement [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. As this feature strongly contributes to the efficiency of feeding substrate bioconversion by BSF larvae, a suboptimal density, such as that occurring under laboratory conditions, can impair the digestion processes in BSF larvae and result in a delayed growth compared to mass rearing. Notwithstanding we proved that BSF were able to transform the fruit and vegetable mix, there are many hints that the substrate is of primary importance for insect development in terms of larval cycle length, larval size and weight, and larval nutritional composition [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to analysing growth performances of larvae on different feeding substrates (VMD compared to SD), we focused on some physiological markers associated with the different feeding conditions. Even though our data demonstrated that VMD is suitable for rearing BSF larvae, a lower developmental rate was observed compared to SD. The lower nutritional content of VMD must be considered among the factors that can contribute to this difference. Nevertheless, the larvae are able to exploit this substrate thanks to some physiological and morphological modification of their midgut [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], in particular the length of microvilli present in the apical membrane of cells in the posterior region of the midgut (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00278-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A,B). This region is specifically involved in nutrient absorption [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and the increase in the length of microvilli can ensure a higher absorbing surface to maximize the intake of nutrient even when the diet has a low nutritional content. Although BSF demonstrates the capacity to adapt to the food substrate to some extent, it is important to assess the long-term effect of the use of this diet on insect growth. Deficiencies of some nutrients might accumulate across generations and epigenetic effects can also become detrimental after a few reproduction cycles. In this case, a possible solution to the problem might be to preserve a genetic stock for egg reproduction through rearing on SD and to use the VMD diet only to produce insect biomass for commercial purposes.
