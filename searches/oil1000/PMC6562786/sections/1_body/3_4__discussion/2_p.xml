<p class="p">The insect microbiota and its safety for insect transformation into feed are influenced by the nature and the hygienic conditions of the substrate and the farming environment [

 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Given these considerations, one of the aims of our work was to assess the microbial quality of the product obtained from BSF biomass through the entire production chain: From the feeding substrate to the intermediate product (insect biomass), and from the insect meal to the fish feed formulated using insect meal. The vegetable waste used to rear BSF larvae showed rather higher counts for some microbial indicators such as the total mesophilic aerobes, enterococci, sulfite-reducing anaerobic spores and yeasts. However, these microbial populations were within the ranges found on fresh-cut fruits and vegetables [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Other specific indicators of enteric contamination such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. were below the detection limit of the culture-dependent methods used. Raw insects are known for the elevated bacterial (10

 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>) and fungal (10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yeasts and molds) load, due to the presence of microorganisms on both the animal’s surface and inside their gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Processing of insects for production of food or feed by applying heat and pressure allowed to reduce the microbial loads and safety risks [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The microbiological quality of dried edible insects depends on the treatment conditions applied. The time/temperatures combination during the drying process represents the most effective way to reduce most bacterial and fungal counts [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The process applied in the present study for the production of insect meal started with the drying of BSF biomass at a temperature of 70 °C for the time necessary to reach a steady weight. This temperature represents a compromise between an unavoidable partial loss of nutritional function by some proteins and enzymes, which might be denatured, and the need to reduce the time required by the drying process. Afterward, a treatment for oil extraction was applied to reduce possible problems related to oxidation of insect meal and to obtain a product that can be used for the cosmetics industry or, again, for animal feeding. Finally, the defatted insect meal was used as a protein ingredient for fish feed formulation. The BSF drying and the processing to obtain the defatted insect meal resulted in a reduction of the microbial load with only the total aerobic bacteria and the sulfite-reducing clostridia spores at levels of about 4 and 1 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. Other microbial indicators such as enterobacteria and fungi were no longer detected, thus demonstrating the important role of the manufacturing processes on the reduction of microbial contamination. Furthermore, the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. (in 25 g) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (&lt;1.0 log cfu g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) at different stages of the production chain is in compliance with the safety and process hygiene criteria applied by the European Community for foodstuffs [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], to which we refer for lack of specific criteria for insects [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. In a survey on processed edible insect products [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], Grabowski and Klein [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] found all samples free of salmonellae, probably due to the efficiency of processing. However, dried and powdered insect products, evaluated according to process hygiene criteria applied by the Netherlands safety authorities [
 <xref rid="B58-animals-09-00278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], displayed high counts of total aerobic bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, yeasts and mold than in our study.
