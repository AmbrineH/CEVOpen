<p class="p">In the present study, the chemical composition of EOs isolated from several samples of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> was evaluated. Antibacterial activity of EOs obtained from various parts of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> against MRSA was also assessed. Finally, three main constituents of the EOs (α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene) were evaluated for antibacterial activity.
