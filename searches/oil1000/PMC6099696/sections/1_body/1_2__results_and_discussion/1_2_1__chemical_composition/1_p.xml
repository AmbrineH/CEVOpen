<p class="p">EOs were isolated from various parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Ferula</italic> species. The yield of EOs varied depending on the plant species and plant part. Specifically, the yields (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> EOs were: 0.97 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">I</sub>), 0.16 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Lfl</sub>), 0.04 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Sfl</sub>), 0.95 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfl</sub>), 1.12 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">U/s</sub>), 0.16 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Lfr</sub>), 0.03 (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Sfr</sub>), and 0.78% (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub>). The yields (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> EOs were: 0.95 (FAEO
 <sub class="sub">B</sub>), 0.14 (FAEO
 <sub class="sub">Lb</sub>), 2.52 (FAEO
 <sub class="sub">Rb</sub>) and 2.24% (FAEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub>) (see abbreviations for the EOs in the footnote of 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The chemical composition of two additional EOs isolated from umbels with seeds and stems at the fruiting stage of 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> were reported previously [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Hydrodistillation of the umbels with seeds and stems produced 0.7 and 0.02% EOs, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The chemical composition of all EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic> were reported recently, and yields of their EOs varied from 0.4 to 1.1% [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>].
