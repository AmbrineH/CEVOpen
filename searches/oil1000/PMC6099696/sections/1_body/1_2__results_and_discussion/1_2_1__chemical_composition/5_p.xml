<p class="p">The volatile compounds identified in EOs isolated from buds, leaves, and roots at the budding stage and roots at the fruiting stage of 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Analysis of these EOs revealed a total 105 different constituents. The most complex, FAEO
 <sub class="sub">lb</sub>, contained 51 constituents, while FAEO
 <sub class="sub">Rb</sub>, FAEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub>, and FAEO
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> had 45, 45, and 37 constituents, respectively. Predominant constituents of the EOs obtained from buds and roots at the budding and fruiting stages and umbels with seeds were monoterpene hydrocarbons (70.6–95.2%), with the main compounds being α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), whereas EOs from stems at the fruiting stages were distinguished by a high percentage of myristicin (67.9%) and 2-himachalen-7-ol (7.9%) [

 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> was reported previously, where we found (1

 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic> was recently reported by our group, with the major constituents of the EOs from all parts of the plant being sulfur-containing compounds, including (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-propenyl sec-butyl disulfide (15.7–39.4%) and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-propenyl sec-butyl disulfide (23.4–45.0%) [
