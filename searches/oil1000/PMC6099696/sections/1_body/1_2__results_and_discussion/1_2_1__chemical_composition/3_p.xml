<p class="p">Analysis of the EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> revealed a total of 102 different constituents. FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Lfl</sub> was found to be the most complex, with 62 constituents, while FOEO

 <sub class="sub">I</sub> had 56, 53, 50, 45, 43, 43, and 41 constituents, respectively. Sabinene, α-pinene, β-pinene, eremophilene, β-phellandrene, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol, and 6
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-2,5,5,10-tetramethyl-undeca-2,6,9-trien-8-one (all present at &gt;5%) were the most common volatile constituents detected. Their concentrations varied depending on plant parts. For example, the highest content of α-pinene was identified in the inflorescence (35.1%), umbels with seeds (47.4%), and roots (47.8% and 46.5%). EOs isolated from the roots had a higher content of β-pinene and eremophylene compared to other parts of the plant. The content of sabinene was 20.5% in the inflorescence, whereas it was present only in trace amounts in the roots. GC analysis of the volatiles on a Lipodex G chiral column revealed the existence of enantiomeric pairs of α-pinene and β-pinene in FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Sfr</sub>, where we found (1
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-(−)-α-pinene (49%) and (1
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-(−)-β-pinene (29%).
