<p class="p">It should be noted, that the main constituents previously reported for EOs from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> collected in China were polysulfide alkanes (86.3%), sesquiterpenoids (8.3%), and monoterpenoids (0.5%) [

 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> collected in Iran were mainly monoterpenes, specifically, Î±-pinene (50.0%) and limonene (11.5%) [
