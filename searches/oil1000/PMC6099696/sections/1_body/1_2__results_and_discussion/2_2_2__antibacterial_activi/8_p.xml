<p class="p">To account for inactive EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic>, we also plotted the reciprocal values of antibacterial activity (1/IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>), where inactive samples were assigned a value of zero, and obtained a good linear correlation for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol and eremophilene (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01679-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Antibacterial activity also correlated with the total quantity of sesquiterpenes present in the EO samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01679-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C), supporting the finding for eremophilene, an eremophilane-type sesquiterpene [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Moreover, various EOs isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Verbenaceae</italic> spp., which have a high amount of sesquiterpenes, were highly active against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]). Although we did not find a correlation with total amount of oxygenated monoterpenes (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), our finding of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol supports previous studies showing that oxygenated terpenoids may have more antimicrobial activity than some other EO constituents [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. For the remaining major constituents, including α/β-pinenes and other chemical classes, no significant correlation between antibacterial activity and their concentrations in the EOs was found (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This is also consistent with previous studies showing that the presence of α/β-pinenes does not correlate with antimicrobial/antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Overall, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol and eremophilene seem to represent reasonable targets for further analysis to define the anti-MRSA activity of the active EOs.
