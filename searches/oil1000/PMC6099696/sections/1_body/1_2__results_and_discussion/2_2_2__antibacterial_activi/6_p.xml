<p class="p">Studies on the antimicrobial activity of monoterpenes showed that only the (+)-enantiomers of α-pinene and β-pinene had antibacterial activity against

 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> EOs, and (±)-sabinene also had low activity. The highest percentage of the (+)-enantiomer of β-pinene was in FOEO

 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> EOs, some active EO samples (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfl</sub>, FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub>, and FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Sfr</sub>) had lower levels of β-pinene (1.9 and 1.5%, respectively) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), which is not consistent with this conclusion. Additionally, α-pinene is present at high levels in 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> EOs, yet these EOs had no antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Thus, it is unlikely that (±)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene contribute significantly to the overall antibacterial activity observed.
