<p class="p">In general, our analysis performed using two activity representations (LogIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and 1/IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) suggests that anti-MRSA activity of the EOs could be attributed to the presence of eremophilene and/or 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol and/or their additive or synergistic effect with α/β-pinenes, sabinene, and other constituents. Thus, compounds present in the greatest proportions are not necessarily responsible for the largest share of the antibacterial activity, and involvement of less abundant constituents should be considered. For example, evaluation of the major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper hispidinervum</italic> EOs showed that a low quantity of terpinolene increased the nematicidal effect of safrole when binary combinations of these compounds were tested [

 <italic class="italic">Glossogyne tenuifolia</italic> (linalool, 4-terpineol, α-terpineol, 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>-cymene) were additive instead of synergistic, as determined by checkerboard analysis with pathogenic bacteria, including 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> [
