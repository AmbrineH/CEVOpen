<p class="p">Eight samples of EOs isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic>, seven samples from 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic>, and six samples from 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> were evaluated for growth inhibitory activity in MRSA cultures, and the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The results show that 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> EOs, especially FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfl</sub>, FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub> and FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Sfr</sub>, had the highest growth inhibitory activity against MRSA, as compared to EOs from other 
 <italic class="italic">Ferula</italic> spp. Low inhibitory activity was observed for all seven EOs isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic>. Likewise, EOs isolated from buds and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> had weak activity, while EOs isolated from other plant parts had no activity against the bacteria.
