<p class="p">The most active EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ovina</italic> were characterized by a high content of monoterpene hydrocarbons (9.1–71.1%), oxygenated monoterpenes (3.0–17.3%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (7.9–25.9%). However, the various 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> EOs, which had weak or no antibacterial activity, also had a similar range of monoterpene hydrocarbons (0.4% to 89.1%), oxygenated monoterpenes (1.4% to 3.6%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.5% to 37.4%). In an effort to identify putative component compounds responsible for the observed antibacterial activity, we conducted a linear regression analysis based on antibacterial activity of the EOs evaluated and GC-MS data for their major (&gt;5%) constituents (
