<p class="p">Antibacterial activity of the most active samples (FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfl</sub>, FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub>, and α/β-pinenes) against MRSA was also evaluated by enumerating the number of colony-forming units (CFU). Following a 1-h incubation of bacteria with the selected EOs, the bacteria were plated on solid media and incubated overnight. FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfl</sub> and FOEO
 <sub class="sub">Rfr</sub> significantly inhibited growth of MRSA, even at the lowest concentrations tested (6.25 µg/mL), and only a few bacterial colonies were observed at the highest tested concentrations (100 µg/mL) (
