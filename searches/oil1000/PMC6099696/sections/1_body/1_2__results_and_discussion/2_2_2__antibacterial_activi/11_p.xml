<p class="p">In conclusion, we report that EOs isolated from selected 
 <italic class="italic">Ferula</italic> species have antibacterial activity against MRSA USA300, which is a relevant clinical strain. The most active EOs were isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ovina</italic> and were characterized by an abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic> EOs had low antibacterial activity, suggesting that (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-propenyl sec-butyl disulfide and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-propenyl sec-butyl disulfide do not have significant activity against MRSA. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> EOs possessed weak or no antibacterial activity. Although EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of MRSA growth, their major constituents (α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene) had low activity, suggesting that they were not responsible for the observed bioactivity of the unfractionated EOs. On the other hand, correlation of the GC-MS data with antibacterial activity suggested that the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon eremophilene and the oxygenated monoterpene 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol could be the constituents responsible for antibacterial activity. Further studies are clearly necessary to evaluate efficacy and elucidate the exact mechanisms by which EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> exhibit their antibacterial effects.
