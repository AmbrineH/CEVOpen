 <xref rid="molecules-23-01679-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), three major constituents were selected for further analysis (α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene). The specific enantiomers were available from commercial sources: α-pinene and sabinene as racemic mixtures and the (−)-enantiomer of β-pinene. The effects of α/β-pinenes and sabinene on MRSA growth are presented in
