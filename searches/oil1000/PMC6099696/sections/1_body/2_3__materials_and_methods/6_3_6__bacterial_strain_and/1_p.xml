<p class="p">MRSA pulse-field gel electrophoresis type USA300 cultures were grown in TSB containing 0.5% glucose. Overnight cultures of bacteria were diluted 1:200 in 20 mL TSB in a 125 mL flask and grown at 37 Â°C with shaking at 250 rpm. For all experiments, cultures were grown to mid-exponential growth phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>] = 1.5).
