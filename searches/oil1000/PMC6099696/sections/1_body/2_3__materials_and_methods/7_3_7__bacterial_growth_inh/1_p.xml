<p class="p">For analysis of antibacterial activity in culture, bacteria (2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/mL) were resuspended in TSB and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 5 different concentrations of EOs (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) or with each of the constituents (α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene at 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 µg/mL) in 96-well tissue culture plates. EOs or pure compounds diluted in DMSO were added to the wells (final concentration of DMSO was 1%). DMSO was used as a negative control. The growth suppression of bacteria was monitored as absorbance (λ = 600 nm) every 5 min for 4 h using a SpectraMax 190 microplate reader. Spectinomycin was used as positive control, and 50 µg/mL of this antibiotic completely inhibited bacteria growth.
