<p class="p">Chromatographic separation on a chiral column was performed for α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene. GC-MS analysis of the enantiomers in the oil was performed with an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with a FID and 5975 MSD with a triple-axis detector and an Agilent G 4513 autoinjector, integrated with a Gerstel CIS (Gerstel, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany; SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey). Chiral separation was performed on a Lipodex G column (25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.125 μm film thickness; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) with He as the carrier gas (65 min at 5 mL/min, average velocity 77.985 cm/s). Injection quantity was 1 μL (10% in hexane). The temperature program for separation of α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene enantiomers was 50 min at 35 °C and then increased 40 °C/min to 200 °C for 10.875 min. Run time was 65 min. The split ratio was adjusted to 40:1, and the injector temperature was at 250 °C. FID temperature was 250 °C.</p>
