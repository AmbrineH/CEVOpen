 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01679" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] using GC-FID and GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 5975 GC-MSD system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). An Innowax FSC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used with He as carrier gas (0.8 mL/min). GC oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 10 min, increased to 220 °C at a rate of 4°C/min, kept constant at 220 °C for 10 min, and then increased to 240 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The split ratio was adjusted to 40:1, and the injector temperature was 250 °C. MS were collected at 70 eV with a mass range from m/z 35 to 450. GC analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890N GC system. To obtain the same elution order as with GC-MS, simultaneous injection was performed using the same column and appropriate operational conditions. Flame ionization detector (FID) temperature was 300 °C. The EO components were identified by co-injection with standards (whenever possible), which were purchased from commercial sources or isolated from natural sources. In addition, compound identities were confirmed by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library (Wiley, New York, NY, USA), MassFinder software 4.0 (Dr. Hochmuth Scientific Consulting, Hamburg, Germany), Adams Library, and NIST Library. Confirmation was also achieved using the in-house “Başer Library of Essential Oil Constituents′′ database, obtained from chromatographic runs of pure compounds performed with the same equipment and conditions. A C8–C40 n-alkane standard solution (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was used to spike the samples for the determination of relative retention indices (RRI). Relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from FID chromatograms.
