<p class="p">The inhibitory effect of EOs against MRSA USA300 (LAC) was determined by calculation of the inhibitory concentration values (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. To calculate median IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, curve fitting was performed by nonlinear regression analysis of the dose–response curves generated using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the datasets, followed by Dunnett’s test. For correlation analyses, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (
