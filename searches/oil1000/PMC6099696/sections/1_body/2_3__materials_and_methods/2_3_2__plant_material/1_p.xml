 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> B. Fedtsch. ex Koso-Pol. were collected from the Almaty region of Kazakhstan in May–July 2015 at two stages: 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic> were collected during the flowering and fruiting stages, and 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> was collected at the budding and fruiting stages. GPS coordinates: 
 <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic> was collected at an altitude of 695 m above sea level (latitude, N 43°35′29′′; longitude, W 78°36′95′′). 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> was collected at an altitude of 1014 m above sea level (latitude, N 43°31′52′′; longitude, W 78°35′17′′). 
 <italic class="italic">F. akitschkensis</italic> was collected at an altitude of 1525 m above sea level (latitude, N 43°16′70′′; longitude, W 77°42′86′′). Voucher specimens were deposited at the Institute of Plant Biology and Biotechnology (Almaty, Kazakhstan). Separately collected plant parts (buds, inflorescences, leaves, stems, roots, and umbels with seeds) were air-dried for 7–14 days at room temperature in shaded, well-aired rooms. Weighed samples were cut under laboratory conditions before hydrodistillation.
