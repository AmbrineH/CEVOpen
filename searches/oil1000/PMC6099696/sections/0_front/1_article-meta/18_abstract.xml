 <p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) were obtained by hydrodistillation of various parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Ferula ovina</italic> (Boiss.) Boiss., 
  <italic class="italic">Ferula iliensis</italic> Krasn. ex. Korovin, and 
  <italic class="italic">Ferula akitschkensis</italic> B. Fedtsch. ex Koso-Pol., collected in the flowering/budding and fruiting stages. Eight samples of EOs isolated from 
  <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> and four samples from 
  <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major constituents of 
  <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> EOs were α-pinene (6.9–47.8%), β-pinene (1.5–7.1%), sabinene (0.1–20.5%), β-phellandrene (0–6.5%), 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol (0.9–7.4%), eremophilene (3.1–12%), and 6
  <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-2,5,5,10-tetramethyl-undeca-2,6,9-trien-8-one (0–13.7%). The major constituents of 
  <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> EOs were α-pinene (0–46.2%), β-pinene (0–47.9%), sabinene (0–28.3%), eremophilene (0–10.6), β-caryophyllene (0–7.5%), himachalen-7-ol (0–28.2%), and an himachalol derivative (0–8.3%). Samples of EOs from 
  <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">F. iliensis</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">F. akitsckensis</italic> were evaluated for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) pulse-field gel electrophoresis type USA300 (LAC). EOs from 
  <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> exhibited the highest antibacterial activity compared to samples from other 
  <italic class="italic">Ferula</italic> spp., with the most potent EOs being isolated from roots at the flowering and fruiting stages and stems at the fruiting stage (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 19.1, 20.9, and 22.9 µg/mL, respectively). Although EOs demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of MRSA growth, analysis of the major constituents (α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene) showed that they had low activity, suggesting that other components were likely responsible for the observed bioactivity of the unfractionated EOs. Indeed, correlation of the GC-MS data with antibacterial activity suggested that the putative components responsible for antibacterial activity were, either individually or in combination, eremophilene and 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol. Overall, these results suggest that the EOs from 
  <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> could have potential for use as alternative remedies for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by MRSA.
