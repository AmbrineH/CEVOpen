 <p> Ferula ovina essential oils (EOs) and their constituents inhibit MRSA growth in a dose-dependent manner. MRSA strain LAC USA300 was grown to mid exponential phase then resuspended in TSB (2 × 10 5 CFU) and incubated with varied concentrations of EOs or constituents. CFUs were recovered following a 1 h incubation with the indicated concentrations of F. ovina EOs from roots at flowering (FOEO Rfl) and fruiting (FOEO Rfr) stages Panel ( A) or EO constituents (±)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene Panel ( B). * p &lt; 0.001, as determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test compared to LAC grown in DMSO. Data are from three separate experiments. </p>
