   <italic class="italic">Ferula ovina</italic> essential oils (EOs) and their constituents inhibit MRSA growth in a dose-dependent manner. MRSA strain LAC USA300 was grown to mid exponential phase then resuspended in TSB (2 × 10
   <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU) and incubated with varied concentrations of EOs or constituents. CFUs were recovered following a 1 h incubation with the indicated concentrations of
