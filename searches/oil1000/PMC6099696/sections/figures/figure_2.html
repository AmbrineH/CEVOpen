 <p> Plots of antibacterial activity versus the concentrations of eremophilene Panel ( A), trans-verbenol Panel ( B), and total sesquiterpene hydrocarbons Panel ( C) in the EOs based on GC-MS data. Activities are represented as inverse (1/IC 50) values to account for the four inactive EO samples from F. akitschkensis. These samples, indicated as closed circles, were omitted from the regression calculation and are shown as outliers. Dashed lines indicate area of the 95% confidence band. FAEO Lb, EO isolated from F. akitsckensis leaves at the budding stage; FOEO Sfl, EO isolated from F. ovina stems at the flowering stage. </p>
