 <p> Comparative analysis of the taxonomic composition of microbial communities at the genus level (C: n = 9; L: n = 10; P: n = 10). Representative genera with significant differences between groups are indicated by the histograms and P value determinations, as calculated by STAMP software. C: control diet; L: larvae diet; P: pre-pupae diet. </p>
