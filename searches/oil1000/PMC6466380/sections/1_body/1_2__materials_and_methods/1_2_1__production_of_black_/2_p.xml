<p class="p">BSF larvae and pre-pupae were dried at 60 °C for 48 h using a drying oven (DKN 602, Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To analyze for methionine and cystine contents, dried BSF larvae and pre-pupae were oxidized with performic acid. After undergoing hydrochloric hydrolysis, the dried material was then analyzed with an automated amino acid analyzer (L-8900, Hitachi High-Tech Science Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for proteinogenic amino acid (except tryptophan) content. Tryptophan was measured using high performance liquid chromatography as described by Çevikkalp et al. [
