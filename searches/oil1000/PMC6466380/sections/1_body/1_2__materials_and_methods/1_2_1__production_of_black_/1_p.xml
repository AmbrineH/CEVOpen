 <xref rid="animals-09-00098-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was used as BSF larvae feed. BSF eggs were hatched following the methods described by Nakamura et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. At seven days old, larvae were seeded (1 larva/g) in experimental household organic waste and raised on this material for 10–15 days at 25–30 °C. To remove their tract contents prior to using them as the experimental ingredients for laying hen diets, the obtained larvae and pre-pupae were fasted for 2 days at 25 ± 2 °C.
