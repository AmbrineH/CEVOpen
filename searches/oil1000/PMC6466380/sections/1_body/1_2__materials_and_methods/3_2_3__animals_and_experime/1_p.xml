<p class="p">A total of 54 laying hens (Julia; 168 days old) were equally allocated based on their egg-laying rate into P (pre-pupae), L (larvae) and C (control) groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 18). Diets and water were offered ad libitum and the duration of the experiment was five weeks. Egg production and egg weight were recorded daily; the egg-laying rate was also calculated on a daily basis.
