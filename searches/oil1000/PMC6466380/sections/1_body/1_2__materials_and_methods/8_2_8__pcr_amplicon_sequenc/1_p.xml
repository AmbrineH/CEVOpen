<p class="p">DNA was extracted from the cecal content using a Fast DNA SPIN kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, California, CA, USA), as according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The variable region V3-4 of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified using universal primers 341F [5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′] and 805R [5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′] [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The PCR reaction mixture was as follows: 10 µM forward primer, 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 10× EX buffer, and Ex-taq (TakaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan), pure water and the extracted cecal DNA template. The first PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 120 s, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The second PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 120 s, followed by 12 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplicon was purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The quality of libraries was evaluated using a Fragment Analyzer and a dsDNA 915 Reagent Kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc., Ankeny, IA, USA). Paired-end sequencing for all libraries was conducted with an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using a MiSeq Reagent kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
