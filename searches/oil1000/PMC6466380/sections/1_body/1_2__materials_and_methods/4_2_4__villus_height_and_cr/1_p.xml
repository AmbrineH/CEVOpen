<p class="p">Intestinal samples (0.5 cm) from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were fixed by immersion in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 48 h. These samples were then washed in a phosphate-buffered saline solution and dehydrated by serial immersions in ethanol (70% for 12 h, 80% for 1 h, 90% for 1 h, and 99.5% for 1 h). Finally, intestinal samples were rinsed with xylene, wiped and embedded in paraffin.</p>
