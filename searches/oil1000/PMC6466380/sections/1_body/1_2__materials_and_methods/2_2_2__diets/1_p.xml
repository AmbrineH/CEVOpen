<p class="p">Basal and experimental diets were formulated to compare the effects of replacing soybean meal and oil with BSF larvae and pre-pupae raised on experimental household organic waste in diets of laying hens. The basal diet consisted of maize grain, soybean meal and soybean oil, and was formulated and fed as the control diet. Dried BSF larvae and pre-pupae were pulverized to a size that prevented fat loss and that could be easily mixed with the other feed ingredients. Feed ingredients and the chemical composition of the experimental diets are shown in
