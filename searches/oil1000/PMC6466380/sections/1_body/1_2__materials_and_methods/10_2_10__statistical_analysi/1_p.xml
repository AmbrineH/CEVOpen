<p class="p">Egg laying rate, villus length, crypt depth, egg quality parameters, plasma minerals and cecal SCFA content were compared among the experimental groups by performing the Tukey–Kramer test (SPSS statistic, IBM, New York, NY, USA). Alpha (α) diversity (Chao1 index: richness, Shannon index: evenness) were calculated with a phyloseq package [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and statistically analyzed using the Tukey–Kramer test. Beta (β) diversity and the UniFrac distance between samples were calculated and statistically analyzed using multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA) and visualized using principal coordinate analysis plots. Plots were generated using Qiime. The relative abundance of fecal microbiota genera was statistically analyzed using the Welch’s
