<p class="p">Regarding the bacterial genera in the gut of hens, the 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> population was significantly lower in the treatment groups than in the control group. Indeed, the abundance of bacterial genera between treatment and control groups was different from that previously reported [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Although it remains unclear the reason why lactobacilli and bifidobacteria decreased in the treatment groups, BSF fat can be suggested as the possible cause. In the present experiment, no morbidity or mortality was observed. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>, known to cause food poisoning, remained unchanged among treatment groups. Nonetheless, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered probiotic bacteria that modulate the intestinal microbiota and inhibit pathogens [

 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], improve the immune response [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and induce growth [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] in poultry. Thus, to compensate for the decreased lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the gut of hens, the addition of beneficial bacteria to feed in which BSF larvae and pre-pupae have substituted other ingredients, may be necessary. Finally, the content of saturated fatty acids in diets seems to affect the intestinal microbiota greater than does the content of protein [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, feeding a diet with high contents of lauric acid and myristic acid to chickens did not affect the microbial population in their gut 
 <bold class="bold">[
  <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]
 </bold>. Therefore, it is likely that the effect of saturated fatty acids on the intestinal microbiota in poultry depends on the type of saturated fatty acid added to diets.
