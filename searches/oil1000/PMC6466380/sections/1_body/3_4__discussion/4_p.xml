<p class="p">Currently, no information is available on the effect of feeding whole BSF larvae and pre-pupae meal on the cecal microbiota of laying hens. In the present work, Chao1 index was significantly higher in the P group than in the C group. Therefore, although we believe that BSF pre-pupae acted as fermentable matter in the cecum of hens, the concentration of SCFA in the cecal content remained unchanged among hen groups. However, since the total concentration of SCFA in the cecal content of the P group was higher than in the other groups, it can be suggested that some indigestible material derived from BSF pre-pupae underwent fermentation. In Î² diversity, although no significant differences in the weighted UniFrac distance were found among hen groups, unweighted UniFrac distances was indeed significantly different among groups. Hence, it can be suggested that feeding whole BSF larvae and pre-pupae affected certain microbial populations in the cecum, in particular in the cecal microbiota of BSF pre-pupae-fed hens. Apart from the Shannon index and the weighted UniFrac distance, cecal microbiota diversity in the present study was comparable with that reported in a previous study [
