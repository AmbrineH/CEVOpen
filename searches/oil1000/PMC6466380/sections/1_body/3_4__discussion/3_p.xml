In the present study, although no significant differences in eggshell strength were found among groups, eggshell thickness was significantly greater in the P group when compared with the other groups.

 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] observed that dietary factors such as vitamin D, magnesium and dietary electrolytes affected eggshell quality. Interestingly, although the experimental diets of the present study had similar calcium contents, the calcium concentration in plasma of the P group was found to be higher than that of the L group. Hence, although the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, it can be speculated that a high concentration of cecal SCFA in BSF pre-pupae may have contributed to an increased absorption of dietary minerals, calcium included, which subsequently caused an increase of eggshell thickness. Previous studies reporting that SCFA production is strongly related with Ca absorption in the distal colon [
