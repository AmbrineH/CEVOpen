<p class="p">In summary, it was demonstrated that BSF larvae and pre-pupae raised on household organic waste could potentially be used as ingredients for poultry diets (â‰¤10% of total feed). However, further investigation is recommended to determine the highest possible level of BSF oil that can be added to poultry diets, paying close attention to the total fat content of the diet and its fatty acid composition. In addition, the effect of feeding BSF larvae and pre-pupae to poultry should be further investigated to detect any undesirable effect on the nutritional composition or flavor of meat and eggs. </p>
