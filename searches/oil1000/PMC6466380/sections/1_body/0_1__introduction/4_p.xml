<p class="p">The aim of the present study was to evaluate BSF larvae and pre-pupae raised on experimental household waste as potential ingredients for laying hen diets. To assess this theory, we fed whole BSF larvae and pre-pupae to laying hens, monitored egg quality, and analyzed intestinal tissues, cecal SCFA and the cecal microbiota in both BSF larvae and pre-pupae-fed and control hens.</p>
