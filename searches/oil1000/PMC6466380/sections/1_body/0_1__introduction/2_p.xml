 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], BSF larvae are nowadays commercially raised on cereal by-products [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, apart from agricultural by-products, larvae could also be raised on animal manure and household organic waste. Although growth performance and meat quality of poultry fed on BSF larvae raised on horse manure have been previously investigated [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], no studies have been conducted to date to test if BSF larvae could be raised on household organic waste and then used as livestock feed due to several reasons, including restriction by sanitary laws and a lack of public acceptance [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Nonetheless, using BSF raised on animal manure and household organic waste as animal feed could potentially offer a sustainable way to recycle untapped resources in waste [
