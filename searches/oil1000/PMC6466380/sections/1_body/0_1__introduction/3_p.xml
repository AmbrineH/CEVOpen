<p class="p">The use of defatted BSF larvae meal as feed for laying hens has been previously reported [

 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Indeed, feeding defatted BSF meal to laying hens was shown to either increase [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] or decrease [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] eggshell thickness and eggshell strength. Moreover, BSF larvae meal has been found to contain chitin [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], an indigestible substance. When indigestible material reaches the cecum of laying hens it modulates gut microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) production [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Indeed, complete replacement of soybean meal with BSF larvae meal was shown to alter the cecal microbiota in laying hens [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that the chitin content of BSF pre-pupae was higher than that of BSF larvae [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], which would likely cause a greater modulation.
