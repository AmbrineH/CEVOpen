 <xref rid="animals-09-00098-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In addition, total percentages of saturated fatty acids were lower in BSF larvae than in BSF pre-pupae. Nonetheless, BSF larvae had higher percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids than did BSF pre-pupae, as an effect of the increase levels of linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), an essential fatty acid for poultry (
