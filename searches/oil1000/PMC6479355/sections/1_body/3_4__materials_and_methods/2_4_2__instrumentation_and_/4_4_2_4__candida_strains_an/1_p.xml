 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 53, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 27). The clinical strains were from oral mucosa of patients with oral candidiasis in the Hainan Wenchang General Hospital located in Wenchang, China. Two clinical isolates were previously identified based on ITS gene sequence analysis. The obtained yeast isolates were stored at −80 °C freezer until use. All strains were streaked onto plates containing the sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate at 35 °C for 24 h. SDA plate composed of 2% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) agar powder, 2% glucose, and 1% tryptone. A single colony was streaked again to ensure the viability and purity of the strains and the colonies were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The colonies with the diameter of about 1 mm were selected and microbial suspensions were prepared in a saline solution. The MH agar plate was used for testing antifungal susceptibilities by the filter paper disc diffusion method.
