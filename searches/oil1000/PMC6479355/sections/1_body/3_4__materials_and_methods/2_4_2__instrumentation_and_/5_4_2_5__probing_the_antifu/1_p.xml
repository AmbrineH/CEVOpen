<p class="p">The antifungal activity of the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">C. lansium</italic> was first investigated using the filter paper disc diffusion method following the protocol described in CLSI M44-A2 [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Microbial suspensions were prepared in a saline solution and standardized to a turbidity equivalent to that of the tube No. 0.5 on the McFarland scale, corresponding to approximately 1–5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The antifungal drug FLZ (2.5 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and AMB (1.0 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), which are commonly used to treat candidiasis, were used as positive controls. 10 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs and positive controls was respectively added onto a piece of paper placed on the medium in a plate containing the fungal lawn. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 24 to 48 h, respectively. The antifungal activity the samples was evaluated by measuring zones of inhibition of fungal growth surrounding the paper discs. The zones of inhibition were measured with antibiotic zone scale (Cecon-Brasil) in mm. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate. When the inhibition zone diameters of FLZ and AMB against 
 <italic class="italic">Ca</italic> ATCC 10231 were within the prescribed range 28–39 mm and 20–27 mm, respectively, it is considered that the operation of this test was effective.
