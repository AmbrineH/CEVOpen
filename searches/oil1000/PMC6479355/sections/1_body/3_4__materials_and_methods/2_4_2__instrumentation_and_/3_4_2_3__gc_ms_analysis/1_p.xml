<p class="p">Samples were analyzed by the GC-MS EI method with column ZB-5MS. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in split mode (1:20). The column temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 5 min and then programmed to 120 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, further increased to 170 °C at a rate of 2 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and finally increased to 210 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for remaining 10 min. Temperatures of both injector and connector were maintained at 270 °C. Operating parameters of MS were: EI mode at 70 eV with a mass scanning range of 50–500 amu and source temperature of 250 °C. C8–C40 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes were used as reference points in the calculation of relative retention indexes (RIs). The percentages of compositions were obtained from the electronic integration of peak areas. The identity of each compound was determined by comparing its RI to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes and the NIST library database (NIST08 and NIST08s). Percentage of composition was computed from peak areas without applying correction factors.
