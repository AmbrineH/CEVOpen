 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> were dried in shade. After removing pulps and seeds of fruits, pericarps were washed and then dried in an oven at 40–50 °C. The leaves and pericarps were milled into powder with a grinder. The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation for 2.5–3.0 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The obtained EOs were stored at 4 °C in an air-tight container and dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate before being analyzed.
