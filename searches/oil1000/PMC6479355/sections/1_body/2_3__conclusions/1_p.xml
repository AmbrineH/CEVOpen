<p class="p">This study described the chemical compositions of the EOs from leaves and pericarps of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> (Lour.) Skeels, where a total 101 compounds were identified. EOs of leaves and pericarps of HLW and CHW in Hainan, China were classified into four clusters by cluster analysis. The major components of cluster I were caryophyllene (21.13%, 23.48%), β-sesquiphellandrene (18.52%, 21.80%) and α-bergamotene (9.49%, 10.63%); Cluster II: 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-α-santalol (14.72%, 21.31%), santalol (17.31%, 12.24%) and caryophyllene (12.72%, 5.46%); Cluster III: β-phellandrene (26.13%, 23.15%) and β-bisabolene (7.74%, 10.21%); Cluster IV: β-phellandrene (32.43%, 45.15%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (10.89%, 7.35%). Correlation between chemical composition and antifungal activity is an important finding. EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> pericarps showed higher antifungal activity than that of leaves against all the tested 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains, and EOs of CHW had better inhibiting effect than HLW. Higher contents of β-phellandrene, β-sesquiphellandrene and β-bisabolene may be positively correlated to antifungal activity. The present results increase the biological knowledge about 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs, which could be exploited particularly for the treatment and prevention of fungal infections caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp.
