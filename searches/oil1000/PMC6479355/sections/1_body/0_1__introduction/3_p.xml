<p class="p">Hainan Province, a tropical region of China, is one of the main geographic regions for growing 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> with globose fruits is named Hainan local wampee (HLW): the berry fruit is approximately 1.5–2.5 cm in diameter. 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> with broadly ovoid fruits is named chicken heart wampee (CHW), with berries approximately 1.5–2.5 × 2.5–3.5 cm in diameter [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The compositions and contents of 
 <italic class="italic">C. lansium</italic> EOs from China, Thailand, and Cuba have been studied by hydrodistillation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, limited effort has been made to analyze and compare the differences of EOs of HLW and CHW. In addition, due to the increasing number of fungal diseases caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species and insufficient effectiveness of traditionally applied azole agents, new therapeutic strategies are necessary and natural products especially EOs can play an important role in the treatment of infections [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Therefore, the search of new and effective natural antifungal agents has dramatically increased [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to comparatively analyze the chemical compositions of leaves and pericarps EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> of HLW and CHW and to investigate the in vitro antifungal activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, including 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>. The results of this study can provide experimental basis for further exploitation of
