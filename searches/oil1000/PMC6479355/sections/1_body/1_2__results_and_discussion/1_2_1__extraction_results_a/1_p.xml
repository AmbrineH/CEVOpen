 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs extracted by hydrodistillation were light yellow to yellow in color. The yields ranged from 0.23 to 0.51% (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01394-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. There were differences in the color and yield of the eight EOs, which may be related to the geographic source, cultivar, and part of plants, but it is uncertain which is the most important of these factors. It is possible to come to a conclusion from the specific differences of the components. To compare the compositional differences, each EO extract was injected into GC-MS for analysis.
