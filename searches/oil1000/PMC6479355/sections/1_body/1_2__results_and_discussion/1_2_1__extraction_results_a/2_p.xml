<p class="p">According to the GC-MS analysis, components and contents were different in leaves and pericarps of HLW and CHW. A total of 69, 63, 65, 63, 70, 71, 69 and 66 compounds were identified in MCL, MCP, RCL, RCP, MHL, MHP, RHL and RHP, amounting to 98.87%, 96.90%, 99.19%, 98.18%, 98.10%, 98.60%, 96.87% and 96.39% of the total components, respectively. These components were monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, esters, etc. Some samples such as MCL and RCL were dominated by sesquiterpenes, with β-caryophyllene and β-sesquiphellandrene as the main components. MHL and RHL were rich in sesquiterpenes with 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-α-santalol and santalol being the most abundant species. There were a large number of monoterpenes in some samples, such as MCP, RCP, MHP and RHP. In all the combined samples, we detected 101 chemicals in the EO extracts. However, the distributions of the 101 chemicals differed widely among the extracts. To investigate the similarity and differences among these extracts in EO profiles, a cluster analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 17.0). The clustering result is shown in the
