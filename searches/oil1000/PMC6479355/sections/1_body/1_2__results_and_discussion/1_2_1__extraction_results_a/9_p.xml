 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. Thirty-two components were identified in leaves samples from China. The main components identified in the EO of leaves were β-santalol (35.20%) and bisabolol (13.70%). In both fresh and dried fruit samples from Thailand, fifty-three components were identified, and the main components were sabinene (33.68–66.73%), α-pinene (9.57–13.35%) and 1-phellandrene (5.77–10.76%). For leaf samples from Cuba, seventy compounds were identified. The most prominent components were caryophyllene oxide (16.80%) and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-α-santalol (11.70%). The components and percentages were different from different areas, and the differences were much greater in different parts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. lansium</italic>. There were some common components in EOs of leaves in the present study and the above reports, such as 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-α-santalol, β-bisabolene, and caryophyllene oxide. In contrast, the components of pericarps in our study were very different from those of the fruit samples in previous studies. The reason may be that fruit contains not only pericarp, but also pulp and seed.
