 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] analyzed the volatile components of fresh leaves and pericarps in Thailand by headspce (HS) GC-MS. Thirty-nine components were identified in the leaves, and the major components were sabinene (15%) and β-bisabolene (9.88%); thirty components were identified in the pericarps, and the major components were sabinene (69.07%) and α-phellandrene (10.63%). The components and percentages obtained by SFE and HS were quite different from that by hydrodistillation.
