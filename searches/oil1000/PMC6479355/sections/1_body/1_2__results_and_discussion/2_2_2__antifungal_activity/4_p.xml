<p class="p">However, antifungal activity may not entirely depend on the main chemical components. Other chemical components in lower concentrations may also have antifungal activity or have synergistic effects with other components. Therefore, it is necessary to study antifungal activity of the component alone or in combination with others, in order to further elucidate the material basis of antifungal activity of
