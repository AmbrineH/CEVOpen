<p class="p">The antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. lansium</italic> EOs was examined using the filter paper disc diffusion method. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01394-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the EOs inhibited the growth of all seven yeast strains tested in our study. The inhibition zone diameters were in the range of 6.5–23.1 mm. The EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> pericarps showed significant activity against all the 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains, whereas, EOs of leaves showed relatively poor activity. The RCP EO exhibited the greatest antifungal effect against 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>, with an inhibition zone diameter of 23.1 mm. Notably, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 27, a yeast strain which is resistant to FLZ and AMB, can be inhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs with an inhibition zone diameter of 11.3–15.3 mm. This observation suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs is active towards certain FLZ and AMB resistant strains.
