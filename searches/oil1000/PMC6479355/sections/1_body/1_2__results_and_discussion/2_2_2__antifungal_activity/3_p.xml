<p class="p">There are few studies reporting the antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> extracts against infectious yeasts. XU et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] reported that the extracts of pericarps of 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> using 95% alcohols had the significant inhibitory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> with an inhibition zone diameter of 16.8 mm by the filter paper disc diffusion method. However, the components of this extracts are not yet clear. In the present study, we obtained 
 <italic class="italic">Clausena lansium</italic> EOs by hydrodistillation and determined the chemical compositions by GC-MS. In all the tested EOs of pericarps, β-phellandrene was determined to be present at the highest percentage which could be mainly responsible for the antifungal effects. β-Sesquiphellandrene and β-bisabolene were also important compositions which were possible to have antifungal activities. Perigo et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] studied the chemical compositions and antibacterial activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species from distinct rainforest areas in Southeastern Brazil, and found that higher contents of β-phellandrene were positively correlated to wide spectrum antibacterial activity. Antibacterial activity of essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Tripleurospermum disciforme</italic> was reported that the reason for higher antibacterial effect is the presence of β-farnesene and β-sesquiphellandrene [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Bocageopsis pleiosperma Maas</italic> rich in β-bisabolene were reported to have high antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Their results are consistent with ours. Taken together, we speculate that antifungal activities in our study may be attributed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. lansium</italic> EOs of pericarps rich in β-phellandrene, β-sesquiphellandrene and β-bisabolene.
