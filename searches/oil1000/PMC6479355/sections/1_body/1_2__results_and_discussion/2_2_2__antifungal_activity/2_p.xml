<p class="p">It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01394-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the antifungal activitives efficacy order was as follows: Cluster IV ≥ Cluster III &gt; Cluster I ≥ Cluster II. The two most active EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>, which were pericarps of CHW (Cluster IV) and were all rich in β-phellandrene (32.43%, 45.15%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (10.89%, 7.35%). Inhibition zone diameters were in the range of 12.0–23.1 mm. EOs of pericarps of HLW (Cluster III) were the most active against 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 27 (a clinical strains resistant to FLZ and AMB), with the most predominant components being β-phellandrene (26.13%, 23.15%) and β-bisabolene (7.74%, 10.21%). Inhibition zone diameters were in the range of 11.1–22.1 mm. The percentages of the monoterpene β-phellandrene in the two clusters were all high. There were some differences of compositions between Cluster I and II, but they were all dominated by sesquiterpenes as the main components. The antifungal activities against 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> were almost equal to Cluster IVand III with inhibition zone diameters 22.0–22.2 mm. However, the antifungal activities against other six 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains were relatively low, with inhibition zone diameters 6.5–13.0 mm. Antifungal effect of EOs of CHW was higher than that of HLW in both leaves and pericarps. Comprehensive analysis illustrates the importance of monoterpenes to antifungal activities and there were differences among different types of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains. The results agree with those of Białon et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] who suggested that the antifungal potential of lemon essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> yeast strains was related to the high content of monoterpenoids and the type of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains.
