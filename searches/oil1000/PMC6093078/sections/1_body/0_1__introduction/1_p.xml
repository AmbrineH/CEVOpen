<p class="p">Dengue is one of the most prevalent pandemic threats caused by mosquitoes. More than 100 countries with 75% of the global population are facing domestic mosquito-borne viral diseases, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Thousands of deaths globally reported each year were caused by the most typical vector of dengue,
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. One of the most preferential breeding habitats was found to be in the human living sheltered places [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In order to control the spreading of the disease caused by dengue virus, synthetic insecticide-based control strategies including organochlorines, carbamates, pyrethroids, and larvicide were used [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, the success rate is obstructed due to the development of resistance strands in the virus [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Moreover, vaccine-based control strategies were also investigated, aiming to reduce the prevalent rate of the disease. Despite 50 years of research, there still have been no promising vaccines available up till now [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Other alternative strategies have also been explored, but none of them have been successful. It is indeed necessary to find an effective, environmentally safe, biodegradable, low cost, practical strategy to control the spreadability of the mosquitoes-based diseases. Recent mosquito repellent research had focused on the potential use of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil, a kind of oil naturally produced from an indigenous perennial scented shrub. It was highly evidenced that this plant, the Lamiaceae family, possesses a biological control of mosquito-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Traditionally, the essential oil extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> leaves has been reported to have repellent effects and larvicidal and insecticidal activities [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>].
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> was long used to control the transmissibility of

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, the information of the mosquito oviposition deterrent activity of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> is still limited. In addition, the high volatility and degradation rates of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil when exposed to high temperatures, oxidants, and UV radiation also hindered the biological activity of the essential oil. Beads are a type of polymer formed into a small container wrapping around the active components in order to prevent the exposure of the bioactive compound to the environment and also to harden the liquid formulation of the ease of transportation [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Alginate beads have been introduced in the food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the bioavailability of the active component. A sodium salt of alginic acid or sodium alginate is able to form a cross-linked insoluble structure with valent cations by the orifice-ionic gelation method which results in a large and uniform shape of the beads [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The alginate bead system allows the active components to slowly diffuse through the wall in a control-released manner. This system will also enhance the efficacy, stability, and suitability of the pesticide active component [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Additionally, the natural polymer-based system is also biodegradable and biocompatible providing a nonimmunogenic approach for the drug delivery system [
