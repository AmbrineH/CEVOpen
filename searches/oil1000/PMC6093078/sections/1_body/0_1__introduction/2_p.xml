 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil entrapped in biopolymer beads by the orifice-ionic gelation method including the oil content, the yield percentage, and the entrapping efficiency. The bead system was also examined for an overall morphology, a drug release effect, and stability. The efficacy of the system to inhibit oviposition was confirmed by the
