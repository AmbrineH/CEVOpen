<p class="p">This research used orifice-ionic gelation method to manufacture
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil-alginate beads. This method reduces loss of the active principles, leading to high loading beads offering the possibility of controlled release of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil. Beads strongly deter oviposition of
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> for about 27 d by gradually releasing
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil from beads. This action seems attributable to the major constituent as eugenol of phenolic content in this essential oil. These results are very affordable approaches to control the dengue fever.
