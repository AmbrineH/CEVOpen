 <italic class="italic">Release Profile Study</italic>. Release studies were conducted on two optimized formulations with the maximal production yield and the highest entrapping efficiency (F2 and F3). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref"> Figure 2</xref> shows the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil release profiles of F2 and F3 formulations comparing with release profile of free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil. It was shown that free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was released up to 88.92% within 24 h, while F2 and F3 formulations only released 54.02% and 60.61%, respectively. This prolongation was explained by the reaction of sodium alginate and calcium chloride. The cross-linking reaction of sodium alginate with calcium chloride is based on the formation of a tight junction between the guluronic acid residues. Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> ions, with an atomic size of 1.14 Ã…, form a two-dimensional bonding structure with sodium alginate inside the alginate matrix causing an increase in the alginate gel density. When the beads were exposed to a moist environment, the beads initially absorbed water. This absorption led to some modifications in the shell material, which became swollen, rubbery, and sticky in appearance leading to the prolongation of the release of essential oil [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. High burst effect on the first day of release profiles of beads occurred by the cross-linking of essential oil loaded-calcium alginate on the surface of beads, which was rapidly released during the first period of the in vitro release study [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Comparing the release profiles of F2 and F3 implies that release rate of beads with low essential oil to alginate mass ratio (F2) is slower than those with high essential oil to alginate mass ratio (F3). Beads of formulations F2 and F3 could prolong the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil release with longer period of 10 and 8 days, respectively. This may be due to the increase in the amount of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil affecting the decrease of the alginate mass and the thickness of alginate wall membrane.
