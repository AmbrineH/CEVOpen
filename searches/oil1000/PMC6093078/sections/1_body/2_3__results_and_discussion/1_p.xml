 <italic class="italic">Yields and Chemical Constituents of O. gratissimum Oil</italic>. The yield of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>leaf essential oil was 3.54 g/kg fresh weight. Chemical identification of essential oil was accomplished by GC-MS analyses. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 2</xref> shows the constituents of the essential oil, their percentage area, and their retention time (min). A total of 16 compounds representing 100 % of the

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene (14.95 %). The percentage compositions of remaining 14 compounds ranged from 0.09 to 5.25 %. The major constituents of this essential oil from leaves of
