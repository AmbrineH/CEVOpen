 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> is the microscopic picture of the beads (F2) manufactured under the condition of 20% (w/w) of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil, 1% (w/w) of sodium alginate, and 1% (w/w) of Tween 20. Under this manufacturing condition, a good formation and dispersion of beads could be obtained. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(a)</xref>, the beads exhibited a good spherical shape and good hardness and flexibility with an average size of 1.49 mm. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref"> Figure 1(b)</xref> shows that several oil droplets were enclosed within the bead shell. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref"> Figure 1(c)</xref> shows that the beads had a nucleus-shell structure with a compact wall.
