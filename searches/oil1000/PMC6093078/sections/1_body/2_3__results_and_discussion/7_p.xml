 <italic class="italic">Persistency of Oviposition Deterrent Activity</italic>. The persistency study was evaluated using the beads in formulation F2 produced under the maximal yield condition of preparation and the best releasing property of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the oviposition deterrent efficacy against gravid female
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. Aegypti </italic>of free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil and
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil-alginate beads. Under laboratory conditions, the fresh preparation of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil-alginate beads used in a dosage equivalent to 0.5 g of essential oil content showed deterrence of more than 80% on the first 2 d and exhibited 100% of deterrence on the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> d of the investigation. This beads offered complete oviposition deterrence (100%) for a 5-day period and the deterrence to unacceptable rates (&lt;50%) after 19 d of application. These effects were obviously higher than those of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil alone (0.5 g; the lowest dosage yielding 100% deterrence), which offered a complete oviposition deterrence for only one day, with a decrease in oviposition deterrence to lower than 50% occurring in a shorter period of time (6 d). This indicated that when
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil was prepared in a form of alginate beads, it could reserve oviposition activity for a notably longer period of time than that applied in the oil form. A prolonged release of oil from the alginate beads yielded good initial and residual oviposition deterrent efficacy while the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil offered a magnitude of release that was adequate only in the initial period. This effect could be attributed to gradually releasing control of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil from beads by calcium alginate shell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) in order to increase a period of time for contact between
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. Aegypti </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil. This could be a reason for the enhanced oviposition deterrent efficacy of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil after the preparation in the form of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil-alginate beads.
