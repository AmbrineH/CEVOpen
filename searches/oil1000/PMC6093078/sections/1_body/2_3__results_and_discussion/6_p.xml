 <italic class="italic">Oviposition Deterrent Activity</italic>. Oviposition deterrent effects with various concentrations (0.5-3.5 mg/ml) of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil solution and empty beads against
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti </italic>are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. All treated groups exhibited oviposition deterrent activity against
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti </italic>with a high percentage of deterrence ranging from 91.19 to 100 %, whereas empty beads clearly provided no deterrent activity because the mean number of mosquito eggs in the treated group was greater than the control group. The tested concentrations of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/ml showed significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in oviposition deterrent effects, and the lowest concentration exhibiting 100 % oviposition deterrence was 2.5 mg/ml. According to previous literature,
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil with eugenol as a constituent was known to have repellent and larvicidal activity against mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Then, in this study, another activity exhibited by
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil containing eugenol as a major constituent was oviposition deterrent activity against
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> with a high percentage of deterrence. In related studies, essential oil from
 <italic class="italic"> Alpinia purpurata</italic> with 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene as major constituents at a concentration of 100 ppm was reported to induce a strong oviposition deterrent response against
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. Aegypti </italic>[
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, a high potential of oviposition deterrent property against
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> at a concentration of 0.01% (v/v) was observed in various plants including
 <italic class="italic"> Curcuma longa</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Zingiber officinale</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Vitex trifolia</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Melaleuca cajuputi</italic>,
