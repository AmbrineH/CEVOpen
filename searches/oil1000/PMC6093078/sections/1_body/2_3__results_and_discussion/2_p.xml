 <italic class="italic">Preparation Process and Characteristics of Beads</italic>. In this experiment, sodium alginate and calcium chloride played the role of shell forming substances and hardening agents, respectively. When droplets of aqueous solution of sodium alginate were added to a calcium chloride solution, an elastic round ball formation of water-insoluble calcium alginate around the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil drop was instantaneously formed. The gelation along with cross-linking of the sodium alginate was achieved by the exchange of sodium ions from the 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-L guluronic acid with the divalent Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> cations and the random 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-L guluronic groups to form a characteristic egg-box-like structure [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In the preliminary study, the bead formulations were prepared without emulsifier (P1-P4). Then, the complete mixing and thorough emulsification of sodium alginate solution and
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil could not occur, and the separation between oil phase and polymer solution phase was noticed. It was noticeable that, due to an increase in the amount of essential oil in formulations (P1-P4), the percentage of entrapping efficiency and production yield clearly decreased as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The low percentage of essential oil content in formulations without emulsifier (P1-P4) was obtained despite more intensified concentration of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil in formulations. These problems were solved by using Tween 20 as an emulsifier in formulations. In order to discuss the optimum formation condition of the beads, the changed factor in preparation was the concentration of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil in 10–60 % (w/w) prepared with Tween 20 as an emulsifier. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows that an increase in the amount of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil ranging from 10 to 30% (w/w) with Tween 20 increased the production yield, essential oil content, and entrapping efficiency of the beads. Then, good characteristics of beads were obtained when using Tween 20. This could be explained by the fact that the emulsifier, Tween 20, was used to enhance the solubilization of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil and stabilize the oil droplets in the continuous hydrophilic matrix of the beads [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The maximal production yield and the highest entrapping efficiency were obtained from formulations, F2 and F3. At an amount of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil higher than 30% (w/w), these characteristics clearly decreased. It could be explained that when an amount of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was higher than 30% (w/w), there would obviously be a lot of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil floating on the top layer of the emulsion, and the amount of polymer matrix of the beads was too low to completely cover the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil droplets. The mean particle size of the beads showed no marked differences in all formulations (
