 <italic class="italic">Analysis of Chemical Constituents</italic>.
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was analysed for chemical constituents, employing the gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) assay. Briefly, the essential oil (20 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l) was diluted with 2 ml methanol to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The diluted sample (1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l) was then injected into a BPx5 fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m) for analysis with a GC-MS instrument (Varian Saturn 3). The operation conditions were as follows: the injection temperature was 180°C; helium was used as a carrier gas; the purge flow rate was 1 ml/min; and the split ratio was 1:100. The chemical constituents of essential oil were identified by matching their mass spectra and retention indices with Adams EO Mass Spectral library and the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). Mass Spectral library and the percentage composition were computed from GC peak areas.
