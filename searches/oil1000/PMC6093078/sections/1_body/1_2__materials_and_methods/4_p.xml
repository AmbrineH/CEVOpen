 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The bead formulations as presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> consisted of a variety of amounts of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil prepared with or without Tween 20 as an emulsifier to obtain proper characteristics of beads and to study these effects on formulations. Sodium alginate was dissolved in distilled water to form 1% (w/w) of homogeneous polymer solution. The
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil with or without Tween 20 (1% w/w) was added to the polymer solution in a concentration of 0.25-60% (w/w) and mixed thoroughly under continuous mechanical stirring for 10 min in a 1000 rpm speed at a room temperature to make a viscous emulsion. The resulting emulsion was then added manually dropwise into a hardening bath containing 250 ml of 2% (w/v) of calcium chloride solution as a hardening agent through a syringe with a needle (size no. 24) at a height of 5 cm above the surface of the hardening solution. The added droplets were retained in the stagnant calcium chloride solution for 15 min to complete the curing reaction and to produce spherical rigid beads, followed by washing twice with distilled water. The beads were filtered and dried at a room temperature for 12 h to evaporate water on the bead surface [
