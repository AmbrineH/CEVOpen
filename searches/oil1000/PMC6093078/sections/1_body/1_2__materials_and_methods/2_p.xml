 <italic class="italic">Extraction of Essential Oil and Oil Yield</italic>. The aerial parts of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> were gathered from a farm in Pathumthani during the balmy period and distilled within 24 h by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. About 1-2 kg of fresh leaves were cut into small pieces and packed in a distillation flask. A sufficient quantity of water was added and brought to a boil. Live steam is alternatively injected into the plant charge. The distillation time was about 4 h, and the vapor mixture of water and oil was condensed by indirect cooling with water. The obtained oil was automatically separated from the distillate water into a separator.
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and kept in a dark screwed-cap glass vial at a temperature of 4Â°C until used. The yield of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was recorded, and the reported values were the mean of at least 3 distillations [
