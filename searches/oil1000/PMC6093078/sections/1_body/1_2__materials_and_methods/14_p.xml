 <italic class="italic">Persistency of Oviposition Deterrent Activity</italic>. The persistency of the oviposition deterrent effect after application of free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil and
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil-alginate beads was investigated. For this investigation,
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was applied at the lowest dosage yielding 100% deterrence of 20 gravid female mosquitoes within 24 h (2.5 mg/ml; 0.5 g of essential oil in 200 ml of distilled water), and beads (F2) were applied at dosage equivalent to 0.5 g of essential oil content. The persistency of oviposition deterrent activity against gravid
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti </italic>was studied under laboratory conditions at a room temperature as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The experiment was performed in six replicates. Thus, the total number of gravid
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> was 120 for each treatment, and the percentage of deterrence was determined after 24 h of exposure. The eggs laid in the control and treated cups were counted after the removal of the oviposition paper, and the new filter paper sheets were fitted inside the control and treated cups which, then, were placed in a new mosquito cage with a new batch of 20 gravid female
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. Aegypti.</italic> The percentage of deterrence was counted 24 h after placement. The treatment was challenged daily with a fresh batch of 20 gravid
 <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic>. The assays were performed continuously until the percentage of deterrence in each treated group reached zero. The results of the experiments were reported as the average of individual treatment.
