 <italic class="italic">HPLC Condition</italic>. Eugenol was analysed by the HPLC system using an Agilent 1260 infinity system equipped with a photodiode array detector (Agilent Technologies, USA). Separation was achieved at 25Â°C on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 (100 x 4.6 mm, i.d., 3.5 um). The mobile phase consisted of water (40% v/v) and methanol (60% v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 ul. The quantitation wavelength was set at 280 nm. The HPLC validated method had a good linearity (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9994) at a concentration ranging from 5 to 100 ug/ml. The limits of detection and quantitation were 25 ng/ml and 62.5 ng/ml, respectively. This method showed a good precision, and the relative standard deviation was less than 0.6% for both intraday and interday precision. In addition, the accuracy represented as percent recovery was 96.17-103.90%. However, the method validation was described in previous publication [
