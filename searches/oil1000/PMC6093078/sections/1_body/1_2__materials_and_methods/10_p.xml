 <italic class="italic">In Vitro Release Study</italic>. The release profiles of free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum </italic>oil and entrapped
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil were investigated by the slightly modified method under laboratory conditions at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The beads with a dosage equivalent to 0.5 g of essential oil content were placed in black plastic cups (250 ml in capacity) filled with 200 ml stagnant distilled water and covered with nylon nets. At time intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 d), each sample was analysed for the residual content of entrapped essential oil by using eugenol (major constituent) as the chromatographic tracer of the
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil in the HPLC system. Each sample obtained at those time intervals was filtered through filter paper and dispersed in 20 ml of methanol in a 50-ml polypropylene tube. The tube was sonicated about 10 min until the shell of beads was broken. The dispersion was filtered through a 0.45 um-PTFE syringe filter. The filtrate was appropriately diluted with methanol and analysed for the residual content of entrapped oil in the sample beads using the estimation by calibration curve [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The amount of
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil released was obtained by the difference between the initial content and the residual content of entrapped oil in sample beads after release study. The release profile of free
 <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil was also studied in similar conditions. The results obtained were averages of three determinations, and they were reported as percentage release profile.
