 <p class="p">This study was aimed at investigating the oviposition deterrent activity of
  <italic class="italic"> Ocimum gratissimum</italic> (L.) essential oil (
  <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum </italic>oil) and its product,
  <italic class="italic"> Ocimum gratissimum</italic> (L.)- alginate beads (beads), against
  <italic class="italic"> Aedes aegypti</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>) mosquitoes. Chemical analysis of
  <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil obtained by hydrodistillation, using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy techniques, presented eugenol (67.38%) and Z-
  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene (14.95 %) as major constituents. Good characteristics of beads were obtained by the orifice-ionic gelation method with calcium chloride as hardening agent and Tween®20 as emulsifier. The beads exhibited a good spherical shape and good hardness and flexibility with an average size of 1.49 ± 1.36 mm. The oil content, the yield percentage, and the entrapping efficiency were also examined. The beads (formulation code, F2) could prolong the essential oil release until the 10
  <sup class="sup">th</sup> d. This beads provided a remarkably longer oviposition deterrence activity against gravid
  <italic class="italic"> Ae. aegypti</italic> with high percentage for 27 d, whereas free
  <italic class="italic"> O. gratissimum</italic> oil showed a short period of time (8 d) in this activity. The stability study showed the stability of oil content and its compositions in storage condition. These results are very affordable approaches to control the dengue fever.
