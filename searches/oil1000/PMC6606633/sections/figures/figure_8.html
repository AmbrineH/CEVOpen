 <p> Controlled release mechanism of BCRNF in soil. ( a) BCRNF in touched with moisture. ( b) The granules start to absorb moisture and bentonite swells with irrigation water. ( c) Nutrients dissolve and release slowly through diffusion. ( d) Bentonite dehydrates and the stored nutrient solution diffuses into soil when there is water shortage. ( e) BCRNF could absorb moisture when the osmotic pressure is built-up again. </p>
