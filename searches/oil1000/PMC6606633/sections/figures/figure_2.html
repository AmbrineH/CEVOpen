 <p> XPS survey scans of biochar and BCRNF on indium foil. Analysis of the biochar surface modification induced by hydrothermal synthesis. XPS scanning spectra of biochar ( a) and BCRNF ( e) show three major peaks of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. XPS high resolution survey scan of C1s ( b, f), N1s ( c, g) and O1s ( d, h) region of biochar and BCRNF. </p>
