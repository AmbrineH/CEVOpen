<p id="Par22" class="p">It is difficult to accurately determine the interaction between urea, PVA, and biochar because of the many co-existing COOH, C-OH, C-O, C-N, N-C=O, and C-N=O functional groups in biochar, and N-C=O and C-N-H functional groups in urea. From the binding energies corresponding to the electron configuration of the electrons within the atoms of C and N obtained by XPS, it is impossible to distinguish the carbon and nitrogen energy spectra of urea or biochar itself or to determine the interaction between urea and biochar. Fortunately, XRD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) indicated that CO(NH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> probably reacted with acidic functional groups, or bound to species sites on the surface of biochar. The FTIR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and XPS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) spectra proved the complexation between C-NH-C and CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-CO-NH groups in BCRNF, and bentonite bonded with the polymer chains of biochar and PVA. Moreover, the FTIR study indicated that the nutrient sorption by biochar can be attributed to the chemisorption of polar and nonpolar compounds, including hydrophobic bonding

The binding to and within biochar might take a number of forms, such as ligand exchange, dissolved multidentate ligand, C-π-cation interaction, acid-base reactions with COOH, C-OH, C-O, and C-N functional groups on the biochar surface, coordination of deprotonated OH or COOH functional groups, and reactions of O-containing groups with multivalent Al

The results of XRD, FTIR, and SEM-EDS combined with the results of previous researches provided evidences that urea particles entered the inner pores of biochar and the newly formed complex could associate with biochar to form an organic complex.
