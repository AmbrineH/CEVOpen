 </sup>. Pore size distribution curves of biochar, BNF-2, and BCRNF (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) indicate that the pore size, especially that of the macropores, decreased dramatically after the hydrothermal synthesis. Hydrothermal processing led to ~98% reduction in SSA, likely due to the reduced size and number of pores, indicating that urea particles, bentonite, and PVA had been inserted into the micropores and mesopores in the channel and filled the macropores and exposed cavities of the biochar.
