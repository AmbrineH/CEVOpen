 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> shows the XRD patterns of samples reflections at 2θ = 28.39° and 40.65°associated with the disordered stacking of micro-graphites, consistent with the lower crystallinity of biochar. The characteristic reflection of urea also appeared at 2θ = 22.61°, 24.95°, 29.65°, 31.85°, 35.91°, 37.33°, 45.73°, 49.84°, and 55.24° in the XRD patterns of BNF-2 and BNF-4 indicating that biochar was effectively filled and loaded with CO(NH
