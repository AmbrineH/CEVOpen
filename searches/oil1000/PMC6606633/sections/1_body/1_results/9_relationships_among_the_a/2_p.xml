<p id="Par19" class="p">The correlation coefficients R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (0.9899) and adjusted R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (0.9770) were evaluated. The variance analysis was used to evaluate the above model equations. The polynomial model was extremely significant in this experiment, as the p-value for Y is &lt;0.0001 (P &gt; 0.05). This model is suitable for analysing and predicting the influence of the amounts of biochar, bentonite, and PVA on the release behaviours of BCRNF. Based on factors such as the release characteristics and the agricultural expenditure, the optimum composition is 32.4 g of biochar, 2.36 g of bentonite, and 1.33 g of PVA.
