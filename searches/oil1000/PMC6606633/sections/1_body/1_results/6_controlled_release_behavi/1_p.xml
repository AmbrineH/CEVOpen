<p id="Par13" class="p">Simple water incubation experiments were carried out to characterise the nutrient release rate and the cumulative amount of nutrient released from BCRNF. B + U (a ground mixture biochar (40 g) and urea (2 g)) showed the fastest release rate, with almost 94% of nitrogen released into water after 14 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). However, the rates of release from BNF-2, BBNF, BCRNF-1, BCRNF-2, and BCRNF, were retarded, with the cumulative amounts of N released into water only reaching 90.4, 86.7, 75.6, 68.6, and 61.3% within 28 days, respectively. The nutrient release plots clearly show the controlled release behaviour of BCRNF. The N release profiles of BNF-2, BBNF, and BCRNF follow analogous parabolic diffusion models, indicating that the release process involves a combination of dissolution, adsorption and diffusion processes

 </sup>. According to the SEM results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), urea particles on the surface or within the pores and cavities of biochar are released into water with their dissolution and diffusion.
