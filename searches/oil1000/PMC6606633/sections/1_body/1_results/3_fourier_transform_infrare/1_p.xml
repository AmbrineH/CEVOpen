<p id="Par8" class="p">FTIR spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) of BNF-2 (e) showed features similar to that of urea (f), the peaks associated with N-H stretching (3450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1462 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and C=O stretching of the acyl bond (1611 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), indicate that urea covered up the features of biochar (a). Biochar showed a characteristic adsorption band at 1383 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> attributed to C=O symmetric stretching vibration of COO− groups. Comparison of the FTIR spectrum of BCRNF (c) with the FTIR spectra of biochar (a), PVA (b), bentonite (d), BNFs-2 (e), and urea (f) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, indicated that the characteristic absorption band of bentonite at 3620 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (stretching vibration of Al-OH and Mg-OH) disappeared, while the bands at 1039 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Si-O stretching vibration) and 467 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Si-O-Si bending vibration) weakened in the BCRNF spectrum, implying that the -OH groups of bentonite reacted with biochar and PVA, and bentonite chemically bonded with the polymer chains of PVA

 </sup>. In the FTIR spectrum of BCRNF, the absorption bands at 2372 and 2936 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were corresponded to the stretching vibration of aromatic C=C and C-H out-of-plane in biochar, while the absorption band at 3432 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was ascribed to OH stretching and overlapped with these of N-H groups. The characteristic peaks at 1120, 1462 and 1682 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were ascribed to the C-NH-C asymmetric stretching vibrations, amine III C–NH bond, and CH2–CO–NH– bending vibrations, respectively
