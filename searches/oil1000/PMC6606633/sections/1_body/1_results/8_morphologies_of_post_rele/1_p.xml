<p id="Par17" class="p">After the release of nutrients into water, the microstructures of B + U and BCRNF are characterized by SEM. B + U shows smooth and tight surface morphology (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), and micro-holes were observed on biochar. However, BCRNF displayed an undulating and coarse surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). The nanoscale particles (many nanoscale rough bulges on the wall of the holes) are scattered in the holes of biochar, which is attributed to the graft polymerization of PVA with bentonite and biochar as well as to the introduction of bentonite.
