 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> leaves and 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic> branchlets were cut into small pieces (100 g) and hydro-distillated for 3 h, in a Clevenger apparatus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The oil was collected and the mass of fresh weight of sample was measured (3.15 and 4.70 mL/100 g fresh weight, from 
 <italic class="italic">C. citriodora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocarpa</italic>, respectively). The oil was kept dry in sealed Eppendorf tubes and stored at 4 °C prior for chemical analysis.
