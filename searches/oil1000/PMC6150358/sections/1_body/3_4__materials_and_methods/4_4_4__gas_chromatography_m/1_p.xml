<p class="p">The chemical composition of thyme oil was analyzed by an Agilent 6890A/5973N gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), operating on electron impact (EI) mode (equipped with a HP 5MS capillary column of 30 m length × 0.25 mm diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness). The initial temperature was set at 50 °C for 2 min, and then gradually increased to 280 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and held for 5 min. The injector temperature was maintained at 270 °C. 1 μL sample (diluted to 1% with

Further identification was conducted by comparing their mass spectra with the Wiley 09 (Wiley, New York, NY, USA) and NIST 08 MS libraries (Standard Reference Data, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) or with mass spectra from literature [
