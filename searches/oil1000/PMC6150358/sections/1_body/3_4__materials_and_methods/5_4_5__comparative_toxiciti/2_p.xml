<p class="p">In order to identify the contribution of each constituent to the overall toxicity of thyme oil, a series of artificial essential oils were made either as the full mixture or as a mixture each lacking one of the eight major constituents (proportion &gt; 1%). The artificial blends were prepared according to the composition in natural thyme oil indicated by GC-MS and tested at the concentration at which the natural thyme oil caused 95% mortality. The amount of missing compound was replaced by acetone. The types and concentrations of constituents were confirmed by re-analyzing the artificial thyme oil with the same condition mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot4-molecules-22-01873" class="xref">Section 4.4</xref>. Mortalities of the complete and incomplete blends were compared with that of natural thyme oil. Finally, constituents that contributed to the toxicity of the oil were taken as putatively active constituents while constituents that did not affect the overall toxicity were taken as putatively inactive constituents. Toxicities of both active and inactive constituent blend were then compared.
