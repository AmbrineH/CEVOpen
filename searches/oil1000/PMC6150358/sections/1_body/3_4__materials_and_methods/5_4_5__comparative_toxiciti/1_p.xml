<p class="p">The toxicity of natural thyme oil and each individual constituent was determined at two different concentrations. The first concentration was determined by multiplying 2500 mg/L by the proportion of that individual constituent. The second concentration was 2500 mg/L at which all individual constituents were tested. To further compare the toxicity of thyme oil and thymol, the toxicity regression lines of thyme oil and thymol were calculated using five different concentrations.</p>
