<p class="p">The combined actions of different binary combination of five active constituents were assessed to determine the types of interaction between them. The binary mixtures of these individual compounds were prepared at the concentration at which the individual compound caused about 30% mortality with the ratio of 1:1 (volume). The co-toxicity factor (CTF) taken as a criterion for evaluating of the combined toxic effect was calculated as follows:

A positive factor of +20 or higher indicates a synergy effect, a negative factor of −20 or lower means an antagonism effect, and values between −20 and +20 imply an additive effect [
