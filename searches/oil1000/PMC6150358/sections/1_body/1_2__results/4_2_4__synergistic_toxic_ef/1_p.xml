<p class="p">Binary mixtures of the five active components of thyme oil (thymol, terpinene, linalool, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and carvacrol) were tested for acaricidal activity and were analyzed for any synergistic interactions, using co-toxicity factor (CTF) as a criterion. The observed mortality (OM) of the ten binary mixtures showed statistically significant differences (Chi-square test, x
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 21.37, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). CTF values for thymol + terpinene and thymol + linalool were greater than 20, indicating a strong synergy. One mixture (linalool + carvacrol) exhibited the antagonistic effect. The other seven combinations with CTF values between âˆ’20 and 20 indicated additive effects (
