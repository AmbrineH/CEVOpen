<p class="p">Bioassays of thyme oil and major single constituents (proportion &gt; 1%) revealed that natural thyme oil possessed greater acaricidal activity than any other single constituent, whether at the same level (2500 mg/L) or at the level based on the proportion of thyme oil (

In order to further compare the toxicity of thyme oil and thymol, toxicity regression lines of thyme oil and thymol were calculated based on the mortality after 24 h of treatment. The results showed that thyme oil was more toxic than thymol with their LC
