<p class="p">In order to identify the contribution of individual constituents to the total toxicity of thyme oil, we compared the toxicity of natural thyme oil, a complete artificial mixture and incomplete artificial mixtures each lacking one major compound (proportion &gt; 1%). The results showed that there was a significant difference between the mortality caused by natural thyme oil and complete artificial mixture, with mortalities of 95.5% and 85.1%, respectively (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene also had a significant effect on the total toxicity, but less significant than thymol. Excluding the other four constituents (pinene, benzoic acid, carvacrol and ethyl gallate) from the mixtures did not significantly affect the total toxicity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01873-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we can conclude that thymol was the most active constituent and three constituents (terpinene, linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene) were moderately active constituents while pinene, benzoic acid, carvacrol and ethyl gallate were inactive constituents.
