<p class="p">The comparison of toxicity caused by selected blends of active and inactive constituents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01873-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) showed that the most active constituent (M1 = thymol) alone caused 42.5% mortality, mixtures of the moderately active constituents (M2 = terpinene, linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene) caused 22.3% mortality, mixtures of all active constituents (M1 + M2) caused 70.3% mortality, whereas mixtures of the inactive constituents (M3 = pinene, benzoic acid, carvacrol and ethyl gallate) caused only 0.6% mortality. Combination of the mixtures of M1 + M3 and M2 + M3 caused mortalities of 61.6% and 38.2%, respectively.
