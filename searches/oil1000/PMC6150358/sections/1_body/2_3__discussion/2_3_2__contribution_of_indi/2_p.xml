<p class="p">As shown by our results, the toxicity level of the most toxic constituent (M1) or the whole mixture of these active constituents (M1 + M2) was not as high as expected. The blend of inactive constituents (M3) did not cause any mortality. However, combination of M3 with M1, or M2 or M1 + M2, showed significantly greater toxicity than that without the inactive constituents. Only when the blends of active constituents were mixed with inactive ones, did the toxicity of artificial mixture reach the highest level. This indicated that the inactive constituents may have some synergistic effect on active constituents, and, although not active individually, their presence was necessary to achieve full toxicity. Similarly, Pavela et al. found that the toxicity of essential oil can be remarkably enhanced by its minor substances or substances that had no or minimal activity when tested alone. Specifically, borneol and camphor are substances that caused only low mortality when used alone, but both of them provided a high synergistic potential [

The fact that the insecticidal activity of an essential oil is not always determined by its main molecules, but reflects the molecule interactions of all constituents insect physiology and insect behavior has also been confirmed by many other studies [
