<p class="p">Our result showed that the toxicity of natural thyme oil was higher than that of an artificial mixture. The phenomenon that the toxicity of the artificial mixture of essential oil was not as high as the natural essential oil has also been previously proved by many researchers. For example, Jiang et al. found that mortality caused by the natural 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> essential oil was significantly higher than that caused by the full artificial mixture of the six constituents [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, there are few exceptions. Kim et al. found that there was no significant difference in the fumigant toxicities between full artificial mixture and commercial essential oils of hyssop oil, majoram oil and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus zygis</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. As the mortality of natural thyme oil was significantly higher than the full artificial mixture in our study, other compounds, although in minor proportion (2.2%), might also be a contributor to the total toxicity of the oil. Further studies need to be done to focus on their identification and contribution to the total toxicity of the oil.
