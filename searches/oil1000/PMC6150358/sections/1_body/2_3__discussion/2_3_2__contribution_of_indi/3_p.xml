<p class="p">It should be emphasized that we cannot unequivocally say a compound has low toxicity in the case that the elimination of this compound does not affect the overall mortality. The concentration of the compound should also be considered. In the research of Afshar et al., dillapiol was one constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">H. nodiflorum</italic> essential oil and had a lower LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (97.6 μg/insect) than natural oil (128.4 μg/insect). However, its elimination from the artificial oil did not affect the mortality because of its relatively low concentration (9.4%) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Another study showed that a dillapiole-rich essential oil possessed significant insecticidal activity [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Such a phenomenon also existed in our study, but was not so obvious as in the study of Afshar et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. According to the results of 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-molecules-22-01873" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref>, the toxicity of carvacrol was about the same magnitude as that of terpinene, linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, but whereas the component elimination results indicated that terpinene, linalool and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene were moderately active constituents, carvacrol was an inactive constituent. The reason why the elimination of carvacrol did not significantly affect the total toxicity may be also related to the low proportion of carvacrol (2.5%) in thyme oil.
