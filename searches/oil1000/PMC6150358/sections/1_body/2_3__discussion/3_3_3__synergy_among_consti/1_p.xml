<p class="p">Similar to our results, the synergistic effect between aromatic compounds has been observed and discussed in a few publications. For example, the binary mixtures of three active constituents (thymol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and linalool) of thyme oil in our study were proved to have synergistic toxicity against the third instar larvae of tobacco cutworm [
