<p class="p">These synergistic effects of essential oil constituents are possibly useful in two aspects. Firstly, they highlight the importance of using natural essential oils for pest control, rather than separating or synthesizing their major constituents, as the natural essential oils might be more efficacious and pestss may develop resistance slowly to pesticide based on only a couple of active compounds. Secondly, understanding the contribution of each constituent in the toxicity of the oil and the synergy between them could promote the development of more efficacious pesticides based on mixtures of monoterpenoids that do not exist in nature.</p>
