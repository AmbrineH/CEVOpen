<p class="p">It has been demonstrated that plant essential oils often possessed stronger insecticidal activity than any of their individual constituents because of the synergistic and additive effects [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our result that thyme oil exhibited stronger toxicity than all its major constituents tested individually was in agreement with that phenomenon. However, in the study of Afshar et al.,
