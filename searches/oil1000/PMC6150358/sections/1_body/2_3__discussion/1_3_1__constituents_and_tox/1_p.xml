<p class="p">Similar to our results, 16 constituents were identified in commercial thyme oil in a study by Tak et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], with thymol (50.2%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (33.1%) of the first and second most abundant compound, respectively. Gaire et al. found that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (29.5%) and thymol (22.7%) were the major components in commercial red thyme oil [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], but there were differences in minor components and the proportion of constituents. Carvacrol accounted for 2.5% of thyme oil in our study but was found as 0 and 1.4% in the study of Tak et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and Gaire et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], respectively. Lemos et al. proved that the composition and proportion of thyme oil can be remarkably influenced by plant age, collecting seasons and storage time [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The variations in composition rate and minor constitutions mentioned above may be attributed to the diversity growing area, different growth time of the plants and different extraction methods used.
