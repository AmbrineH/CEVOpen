<p class="p">Yang et al. tested the toxicity of six commonly used acaricides against carmine spider mite by slide-dip method. The LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of abamectin (1.8%), emamectin benzoate (1%), pyridaben (15%), spinosad (2.5%) and envidor (240 g/L) were 0.2678, 0.6805, 17.93, 1511 and 1067 mg/L, respectively [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The toxicity of these commonly used acaricides such as abamectin (1.8%), emamectin benzoate (1%) and pyridaben (15%) was significantly higher than thyme oil whose LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 762.1 mg/L. However, the acaricidal activity of thyme oil was at the same magnitude as plants and essential oils which have been reported to have the potential to be developed into botanical acaricides. For example, Ding et al. found that the acetone extract of roots of 
 <italic class="italic">Phytolacca americana</italic> L. possessed acaricidal activity against carmine spider mite with the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 5539.1 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the crude extract of radix stemonae against carmine spider mite was 633.9 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Chen et al. screened the acaricidal activity of some plant essential oils against carmine spider mite and found that patchouli oil and zanthoxylum oil had a strong toxicity with their LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 5480 mg/L and 7770 mg/L, respectively [
