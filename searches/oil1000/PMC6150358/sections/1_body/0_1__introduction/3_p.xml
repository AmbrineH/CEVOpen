<p class="p">The chemical compositions of essential oils can be influenced by many factors including genotypes, geographic differences, nutrition levels, harvest time and extraction methods [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. These variations of chemical compositions also lead to different bioactivities. Isman et al. demonstrated that ten different commercial rosemary oils showed 2.2- and 5.7-fold different toxicities against armyworm and cabbage looper, respectively [

Understanding the contribution of each individual constitution and their interactions to the overall toxicity is prerequisite to use essential oils as substitutions to synthetic insecticides. As these are important factors that can ensure the quality of botanical pesticides based on essential oils.
