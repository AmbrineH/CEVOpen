<p class="p">Active substances of botanical pesticides are secondary plant metabolites synthesized by some plants as a self-defense mechanism to fight against attacks of insect pests and pathogens. Such substances include so-called essential oils, which are complex mixtures of a large number of low molecular weight compounds [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-01873" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The use of essential oils as botanical pesticides has numerous advantages. First of all, complex mixtures of active substances contained in essential oils, with different modes of action and often exhibiting mutual synergistic effects, can slow down the development of resistant pest populations [

It has been reported that green peach aphids develop resistance to pure azadirachtin (the major constituent of neem insecticide), but not to a neem seed extract containing not only the same amount of azadirachtin but also many other constituents [

In addition, essential oils have low persistence under field conditions because of their volatility, resulting in the low residue level after application. Consequently, they cause less negative effects on environmental and human health. Besides that, most of the essential oils with few exceptions have low toxicity against non-target organisms, including humans, and many of them are permitted to be used in foods and medicines as flavorings [
