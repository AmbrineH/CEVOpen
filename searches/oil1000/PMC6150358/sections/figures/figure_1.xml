  <p class="p">Mortality caused by natural thyme oil, full mixture, and blends of constituents of thyme oil when applied at the concentration at which the natural thyme oil causes 95% mortality. “Full mixture” indicates a blend of eight major constituents (proportion &gt; 1%), whereas all others indicate full mixture missing the constituent noted. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of four replicates (40 mites per replicate). Means followed by different letters are significantly different from each other (Tukey’s test,
