  <p class="p">Mortality caused by selected blends of active and inactive constituents of thyme oil when applied at the concentration at which the natural thyme oil causes 95% mortality. M1 (the most active constituent) = thymol; M2 (moderately active constituents) = linalool, terpinene, 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and carvacrol; M3 (inactive constituents) = α-pinene, benzoic acid and ethyl gallate. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of four replicates (40 mites per replicate). Means followed by different letters are significantly different from each other (Tukey’s test, 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
