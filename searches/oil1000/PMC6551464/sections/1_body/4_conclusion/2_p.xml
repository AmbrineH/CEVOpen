<p id="p0090" class="p">In summary, this study provides insight into the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of a wide variety of essential oils from many different plant genera against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. The data contributes to the ongoing scientific investigation regarding the application of essential oils as natural food preservative agents. As the comparison of MICs from different studies is most often difficult, due to the use of varying quantitative or semi-quantitative methods, this study aimed to normalize the discussion by testing a wide variety of plant essential oils with a single, standardized quantitative method for MIC detection. After benchmarking EOs from thyme and oregano as the most active, EO varieties from 
 <italic class="italic">Azadirachta indica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Litsea cubeba</italic> were identified as promising candidates concerning possible applicability in food.
