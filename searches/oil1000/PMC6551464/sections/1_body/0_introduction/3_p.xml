<p id="p0015" class="p">The findings published to date, are still very fragmentary regarding a wide variety of essential oils 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Some EOs are still untested or negative results remain unpublished. In addition, it is difficult to reliably compare results from literature data, due to the strong variance of the used antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. This complicates the selection of the most suitable EO candidates for further antimicrobial research and applications. Additionally, there are some constraints for EOs concerning food application, especially their sensory impact. EO components are considered aroma compounds (e.g. Thymol, Citral, Limonene, α-/β-Pinene, etc.), meaning they generally induce sensory activity 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Regarding food application it is therefore recommended to choose an essential oil based on the sensory profile of the targeted food product 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[11]</xref>. EOs with low inhibitory concentrations are considered advantageous to achieve antimicrobial effects in the product without affecting the sensory properties. For this study we defined a critical minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 400 μg/ml
