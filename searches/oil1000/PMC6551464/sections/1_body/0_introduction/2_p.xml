<p id="p0010" class="p">Investigating the antimicrobial activities of plant essential oils (EO) has concerned many scientific studies within the last two decades. Besides a few general screenings [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,

 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic> species. Significant activities of these and other EOs against certain foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as

 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> have been demonstrated [
