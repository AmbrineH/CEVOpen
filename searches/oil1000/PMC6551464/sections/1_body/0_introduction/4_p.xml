<p id="p0020" class="p">This study was performed to extent the available information on antibacterial activities of plant essential oils, intending to normalize the discussion on the antibacterial activity of plant essential oils with quantitative data for a large number of EOs. The comparability of the results is maximized by the use of a reproducible, quantitative method for MIC determination, combining the advantages of a dispersion approach, as developed by Remmal, Bouchikhi
