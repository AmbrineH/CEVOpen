<p id="p0040" class="p">A small number of EOs was found to be unstable in dispersion, due to complex-formation and clouding. For these EOs dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to aid oil incorporation. Final DMSO concentration was 4.4 % (v/v) and had no growth inhibitory effects. Oils incorporated in DMSO are marked separately in the results tables.</p>
