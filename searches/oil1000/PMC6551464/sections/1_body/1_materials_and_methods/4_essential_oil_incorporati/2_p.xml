<p id="p0035" class="p">Essential oil incorporation was optimized for the execution of a broth microdilution assay for antibacterial susceptibility testing 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[16]</xref>. To avoid the interfering influences of organic solvents or emulsifying agents, a dispersion approach, as first described by Remmal, Bouchikhi 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[17]</xref>, was chosen. To increase their viscosity, Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and deionized water were spiked with 0.15 % agarose (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) prior to sterilization. All media were adjusted to pH 7.0 Â± 0.1. EO stock solutions were adjusted to 12.8 mg/ml in glass vials which were sealed and vigorously shaken for 30 s. Oil containing stock dispersions turned slightly white and were stable towards phase separation for up to 48 h. Air bubbles were driven out by slight vortexing.
