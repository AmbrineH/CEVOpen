<p id="p0025" class="p">Essential oils were provided by three different German essential oil manufacturers (Neumond GmbH, Raisting, Germany; Frey&amp;Lau GmbH, Henstedt-Ulzburg, Germany; Düllberg Konzentra GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Overall, essential oils from 86 plant varieties were accessible, whereof 38 equal varieties where available in triplicate and 20 in duplicate, but from the different sources, respectively. Altogether 179 commercial oil samples were tested. The investigated samples did not contain additives or solvents and were confirmed to be natural by the manufacturers. Furthermore, EOs were considered sterile. EO samples were stored in resealable vials at 5 °C in the dark, but were allowed to adjust to room temperature prior to investigation. The samples were sorted in terms of plant name and the respective plant parts they originated from according to the manufacturer information. Geographical origins were excluded as information was mostly not available.</p>
