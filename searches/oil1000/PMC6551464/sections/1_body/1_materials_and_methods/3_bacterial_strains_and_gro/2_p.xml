<p id="p0030" class="p">The Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> DSM 1104 and the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> DSM 1103 were used as test organisms. The strains were obtained from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and are both recommended for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Stock cultures were grown in 100 ml sterile tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) (pH = 7.2) in shaking flasks at 37 °C for 18 h until their early stationary growth phase. Prior to use, cells were washed twice in sterile ¼*Ringer's solution (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) at 9000 rpm for 10 min, respectively. Cell count was adjusted to 1.0*10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu/ml in ¼*Ringer's solution by turbidity measurement at 620 nm wavelength, using a McFarland 0.5 standard. The cell counts were preliminarily validated by plate counts. Cells were kept in Ringer's solution for no longer than 15 min before assay medium inoculation.
