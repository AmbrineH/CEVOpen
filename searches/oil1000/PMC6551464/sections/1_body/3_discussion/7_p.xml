 <italic class="italic">Cananga odorata, Cupressus sempervirens, Juniperus communis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> may be due to the comparably low concentrations used. Authors, who found these oils to be inhibitory, used way higher concentrations, revealing MICs ranging from 12.5 mg/ml for

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[38]</xref>. In regard of future applications in food systems and the strong sensory impact of essential oils on food these EO varieties appear to be unsuitable. Given the focus of application it is apparent to select essential oils with very low MICs. As described before, we defined a critical MIC level of 400 μg/ml in order to identify EO varieties with a greater applicability concerning food preservation. In general it is recommended to couple food application studies with sensory profiling trials. Another peculiarity in this study is the fact, that none of the 
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> EOs showed any inhibitory activity. In previous studies fennel seed essential oil was found to be bactericidal at comparable concentrations between 20 μl ml and 80 μl/ml against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> by Dadalioglu and Evrendilek 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[39]</xref>. In this case clarification can only be achieved by chemical analysis of the respective oils which has not been performed as part of our investigations, due to the more broadened approach. On the other hand it was once more affirmed, that 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus carotta</italic> essential oils completely lack antimicrobial activity, as also stated by Hammer, Carson
