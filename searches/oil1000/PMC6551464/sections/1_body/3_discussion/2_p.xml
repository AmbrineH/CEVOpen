<p id="p0060" class="p">The number of scientific studies on the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils has strongly grown over the last three decades. Due to the use of many different microbiological methods for susceptibility testing and different definitions of antimicrobial activity, the comparability of studies on essential oils is often critical. Many studies focus on selected EOs, providing insight into their activity against one or more microorganisms [
