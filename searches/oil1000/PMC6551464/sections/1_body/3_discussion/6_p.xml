<p id="p0080" class="p">By comparing the results of EOs from a single plant species, but from different manufacturers, it becomes evident that simple postulations regarding the antibacterial effect of a certain EO cannot be made easily. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">TableÂ 1</xref>, most EO varieties revealed differing MIC values when purchased from another manufacturer. Possible reasons may be versatile, as chemical composition is affected by various external factors, such as geographic origin, environmental conditions, point of harvest or other processing dependent influences [
