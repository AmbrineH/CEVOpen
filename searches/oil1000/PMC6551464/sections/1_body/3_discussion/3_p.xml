<p id="p0065" class="p">As scientifically reviewed elsewhere, thyme, oregano and certain cinnamon EOs, as well as their major constituents, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde and thymol, are known to possess outstanding inhibitory potential against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [

Furthermore, the EOs from these plants appear to be scientifically less well investigated in terms of antimicrobial activity, as only a small number of preliminary findings exist [
