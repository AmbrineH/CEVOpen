<p class="p">The literature indicates so far only few studies were made to isolate and identify the phytochemicals from 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. Chemical constituents isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>, plant parts used for isolation, chemical nature and its reported pharmacological activities are illustrated in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref> and the molecular structure of the isolated compounds are given in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>. Kær et al. (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1979</xref>) reported eight isothiocyanates 
 <italic class="italic">viz</italic>. benzyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">1)</bold>, 2-propyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), 2-butyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>), 2-methylpropyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>), 4(α-L-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>), 4-(4′-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-Acetyl-α-L-rhamnosyloxy benzyl isothiocyanate (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>), glucosinolate (
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>) and 5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidine-2-thione (
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>) from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. But, no biological potential of these compounds were demonstrated. However, benzyl isothiocyanate was reported for anthelmintic (Kermanshai et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>), vascular contraction (Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), and antibacterial (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) activities. Antimicrobial (Padla et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), productive effect on spinal cord trauma (Giacoppo et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and neuroprotective (Galuppo et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) activities were also reported for 4-(α-L rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isothiocyanate. Vig et al. (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) extensively reviewed the antimicrobial, antioxidant, herbicidal, antiproliferative and antimutagenic potential of Glucosinolate. El-Haddad et al. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) isolated three nitrile glycosides 
 <italic class="italic">viz</italic>, niazirin (
 <bold class="bold">9</bold>), niazirinin (
 <bold class="bold">10</bold>) and 4-(4′- 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methyl-α-L-rhamnosyloxy benzyl nitrile (
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>) from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. However, the pharmacological potential of niazirin, niazirinin and 4-(4′- 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methyl-α-L-rhamnosyloxy benzyl nitrile were not extensively studied. The aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> yielded four flavonoid compounds namely quercetin (
 <bold class="bold">12</bold>), 6,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxy apigenin (
 <bold class="bold">13</bold>), chrysoeriol-7-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-rhamnoside (
 <bold class="bold">14</bold>), and rutin (
 <bold class="bold">15</bold>) (Elbatran et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Wild distribution of flavonoid compounds in plant kingdom were noted in several studies over the past decades and its concentration varied from plant to plant or even in different parts of the same plant (Justesen and Knethsen, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Dinelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Flavonoids provids significant health care benefits such as anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-artherogenic, and cardioprotective (Manach et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Quercetin isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> is one of the important bioflavonoids present in many plants and its various biological activities were already proved in many studies which were complied in several review articles (Sultana and Anwar, 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Salvamani et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; David et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Rutin has also received more attention due to its pharmacological activities such as anti-microbial, anti-allergic, anti-diabetes, anti-hypertension, and anti-cancer (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gullon et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
