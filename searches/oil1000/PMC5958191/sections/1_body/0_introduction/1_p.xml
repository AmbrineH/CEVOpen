<p class="p">Plants play a vital role in cultural, social, religious, environmental, and nutritional aspects. Among all other purposes, the use of plants as medicine for human health originated ~60,000 years ago in the mid-Paleolithic age (Solecki, 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>). To date, 391,000 vascular plants had been identified (Willis and Bachman, 
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Of these, only about 6% of plants were screened for their biological activity and 15% for their phytoconstituents (Verpoorte, 
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Among those, 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> is one of the most important genuses with outstanding economic importance. This genus is potentially used in traditional medicine, pharmacological screening and chemical constituents identification. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> consist of 13 species viz., 
 <italic class="italic">M. arborea, M. borziana, M. concanensis, M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii, M. longituba, M. oleifera, M. ovalifolia, M. peregrina, M. pygmaea, M. rivae, M. ruspoliana</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. stenopetala</italic>. The history of 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> dates back to 150 BC. The taxon name 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> was derived from the Tamil word “murunggi” or the Malayalam word “muringa” (Quattrocchi, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Historical proof showed that various civilizations viz., Indian, Greek, and Egyptian were using Moringa for thousands of years for several purposes. They preferred to take the leaves and fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> in their diet to maintain their skin health and mental fitness. In the warfront, the ancient Maurian warriors of India were fed the leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> as it was believed that the decoction relieves them from the pain and stress incurred during the war. Moreover, the drink provides added energy in the war field (Jahn, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Fuglie, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Manzoor et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Edible oil with pleasant taste (Ben oil) from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> was highly valued by the civilizations of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian for protecting their skin and making perfume. Since the middle and old kingdoms (3000–2000 BC), the ben oil was used by the Egyptians (Miller and Morris, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>; ICUN, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>).
