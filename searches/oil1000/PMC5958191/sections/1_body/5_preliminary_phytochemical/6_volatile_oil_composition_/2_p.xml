 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied the effect of salinity on volatile oil composition of shoot and root of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. Different levels of salinity 
 <italic class="italic">viz</italic>. 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 dS/m were used to treat the plants and the oil composition was examined by GC-MS. The results indicated that the salinity levels altered the quantity and composition of volatile oil. In control plants, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis (2-methyl propyl) ether was identified as the major compound (29.02%) in the shoots. But in roots, thiocyanic acid, phenylmethyl ester was the major compound. Benzyl isothiocyanate (29.6%) was identified as the major compound in the root samples of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> in all salinity levels. In shoots of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>, isobutyl isothiocyanate was identified as the major compound at 2 and 4 dS/m. Despite in other salinity levels n-butylisothiocyanate was identified as the major compound.
