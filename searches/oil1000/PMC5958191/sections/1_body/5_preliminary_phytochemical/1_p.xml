<p class="p">The desirable therapeutic effects of plant extracts may typically result from the combination of two or more compounds. So, the preliminary phytochemical quantification is essential to correlate the biological activity and it may also help to conduct further studies to discover the particular classes of secondary metabolites. Ullah et al. (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) screened the hydro alcoholic extract from the dried leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> for its phytochemical compounds. The preliminary quantification analyses showed the presence of major classes of compounds such as alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, and saponins at different concentrations. These phytochemicals are considered to possess extensive range of biological activities (Ramawat et al., 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Saponin was recorded in high concentration in the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> when compared to other compounds. Dehshahri et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) reported the presence of flavonoid glycoside (rutin) in the air dried methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>. But the authors were abortive to provide the detailed spectral and structure information.
