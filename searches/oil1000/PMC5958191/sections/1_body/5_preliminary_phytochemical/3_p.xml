<p class="p">Safaeian et al. (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) quantified the total phenol content of dried leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> by Folin-ciocalteu method. The results showed that the dried leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> had 2.3 mg TAE/g of total phenol content. The bark and seed oils of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> contain 454 and 12.6 mg/kg of total phenol content, respectively (Marwah et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Elabd et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The quantification of total phenol and flavonoid contents of aqueous and methanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> were reported by El-Awady et al. (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) Methanol extract showed a higher amount of total phenol content (137.53 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) when compared to aqueous extract (92.26 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract). The methanol extract also showed high amount of total flavonoid content (33.40 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract) compared to aqueous extract (9.59 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic>.
