<p class="p">Fatty acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> leaf oil was investigated along with two other 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa</italic> species (Al-Juhaimi et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). A total of 12 fatty acids were detected in the leaf oil and linolenic acid recorded the highest (32.53%). Furthermore, considerable amount of linoleic acid (19.5%), palmitic acid (17.6%), oleic acid (7.14%), and arachidic (4.85%) were also detected by GC analysis. Other fatty acids present in the leaf oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> were myristic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid, lignoceric acid, behenic acid, and erucic acid with 2.27, 1.96, 1.42, 1.37, 1.19, and 0.76%, respectively. The fatty acid composition analysis (Elabd et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) revealed that the seed oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peregrina</italic> contained palmitic acid (10%), linoleic acid (0.42%), oleic acid (78.33%), linolenic acid (2.75%), stearic acid (4.85%), arachidic acid (1.42%), and behenic acid (2.15%).
