 <p id="Par1" class="p">Research based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was conducted to explore the effects of salt-processing on Psoraleae Fructus (PF). Quantitative analysis showed that the contents of bioactive components were higher in salt-processed Psoraleae Fructus (SPF) extract than in PF extract. Pharmacokinetics indicated that the overall

  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
  <sub class="sub">max</sub> levels was higher, while 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>
  <sub class="sub">max</sub> was lower in the SPF group. In the metabolomics study, the differential influences of PF and SPF on 22 common biomarkers and associated metabolic pathways showed that salt-processing could enhance the effect of PF and reduce toxicity in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, suggested that the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants during the salt-processing procedure were the primary causes of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity.
