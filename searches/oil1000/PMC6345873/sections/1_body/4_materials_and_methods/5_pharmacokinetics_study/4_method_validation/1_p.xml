<p id="Par32" class="p">(1) Specificity: The specificity was evaluated by comparing the blank plasma samples with spiked bio-samples of psoralen, neobavaisoflavone, corylifolin, isobavachalcone, bavachinin, corylifol A and IS, and the actual plasma samples after administration of PF and SPF extract. 
 <bold class="bold">(</bold>2) Linearity and sensitivity: Calibration curves were prepared by plotting the measured peak area ratios of standards/IS versus concentrations. Then, linear regressions were carried out and correlation coefficients were obtained. The LLOQ for analytes were the lowest concentrations with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥10, while the precision and accuracy were within ±20%. (3) Precision and accuracy: The QC samples were analysed in six replicates on the same day for three consecutive days to evaluate the precision and accuracy. Relative standard deviation (RSD) and accuracy value were utilized to evaluate the precision and accuracy, respectively. The receivable values for validation of precision and accuracy were ≤15% and 85–115%, respectively. (4) Recovery and matrix effect: The extraction recoveries of analytes were assessed by comparing the peak areas of the spiked plasma samples (blank plasma spiked with low, middle, and high levels standards) with the ordinary prepared QC samples. The matrix effect was evaluated by comparing the peak areas of the post-extraction blank plasma samples spiked with standards with those obtained from mobile phase spiked with standards at low, middle, and high levels. (5) Stability: The stability of analytes in plasma samples was investigated at low, middle, and high QC levels under different conditions: three cycles of freeze-thaw, storage at −80 °C for 15 days and room temperature for 6 h. The receivable RSD values for stability were within ±15%.
