<p id="Par30" class="p">The calibration solutions of psoralen, neobavaisoflavone, corylifolin, corylin, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, bavachinin and corylifol A were prepared by adding 20 µL mixed standard solutions (refer to Supplementary Information) and 10 µL IS to blank plasma. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared at the concentrations of 1.77, 17.7 and 177 ng/mL for psoralen, 1.65, 16.5 and 165 ng/mL for neobavaisoflavone, 1.82, 18.2 and 182 ng/mL for corylifolin, 1.46, 14.6 and 146 ng/mL for corylin, 2.04, 20.4 and 204 ng/mL for psoralidin, 1.37, 13.7 and 137 ng/mL for isobavachalcone, 1.36, 13.6 and 136 ng/mL for bavachinin, 1.62, 16.2 and 162 ng/mL for corylifol A. All solutions were stored at 4 °C before analysis.</p>
