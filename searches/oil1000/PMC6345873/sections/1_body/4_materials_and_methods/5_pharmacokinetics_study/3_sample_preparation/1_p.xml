<p id="Par31" class="p">Prior to analysis, plasma samples were thawed in ice-water. Each plasma sample (100 µL) was mixed with 400 µL cold acetonitrile and 10 µL IS in a centrifuge tube. The mixture was vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to precipitate protein. Then, the supernatant was transferred to another clean tube and evaporated to dryness under N
