 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column (2.2 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Thermo Scientific, USA) at 40 °C. The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (0.1% formic acid-water) and solvent B (acetonitrile) with a gradient elution (0–2 min, 95–30% A; 2–5 min, 30–15% A; 5–8 min, 15–2% A). The sample manager temperature was set at 4 °C and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.
