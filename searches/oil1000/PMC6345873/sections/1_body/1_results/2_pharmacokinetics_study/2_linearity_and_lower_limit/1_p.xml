<p id="Par8" class="p">The regression equations, linearity ranges, correlation coefficients and LLOQs for the eight analytes were summarized in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>. The correlation coefficients of linearity were higher than 0.998, demonstrating that all calibration curves were linear over the entire calibration range. The LLOQs ranged from 0.136 to 0.204 ng/mL, suggesting that the method was sensitive enough for all of the analytes in plasma.
