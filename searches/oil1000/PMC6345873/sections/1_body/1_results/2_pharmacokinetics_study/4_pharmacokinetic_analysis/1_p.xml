<p id="Par10" class="p">The validated method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of analytes after oral administration of PF and SPF extract. All the analytes were analysed with the two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The mean plasma concentration-time curves (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) were shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The absorption of psoralen, isobavachalcone, bavachinin and corylifol A increased significantly after salt-processing, while neobavaisoflavone and corylifolin presented unclear variation trends. Except for psoralen, the SPF group exhibited a higher
