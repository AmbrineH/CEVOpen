<p id="Par14" class="p">Further analysis of the significant pathways influenced by PF and SPF was conducted through application of the MetaboAnalyst online database. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,b</xref>, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism pathways were influenced by both PF and SPF. The starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism pathways were influenced only by PF, while linoleic acid metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism pathways were influenced only by SPF. To investigate the latent relationships among the disrupted pathways, correlation network diagrams were constructed based on the above results and the KEGG pathway database. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c,d</xref>, the effects of PF and SPF on most pathways were similar, except for glycerophospholipid metabolism, which was upregulated by PF and downregulated by SPF.
