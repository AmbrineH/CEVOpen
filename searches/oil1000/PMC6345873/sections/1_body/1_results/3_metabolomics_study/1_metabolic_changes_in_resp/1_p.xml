<p id="Par11" class="p">The normalized data from ESI
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> and ESI
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> modes were merged and input into SIMCA-P software (version 13.0, Umetrics AB) for multivariate statistical analysis. First, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to investigate the holistic metabolic variations in the PF and SPF groups. In the process of analysis, no observations or variables had missing values exceeding the missing value tolerance. The PCA score scatter plots exhibited a clear separation between the control (C) and PF groups (R

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.243, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), as well as the C and SPF groups (R

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.314, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). A Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test on PCA scores was also carried out, and the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value for the C 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. PF group was 0.04 and that for the C 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. SPF group was 0.01. Therefore, the differences observed in PCA score scatter plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref>) were significant, i.e., the plasma metabolic patterns of rats were significantly changed by PF and SPF, respectively. Furthermore, an obvious grouping tendency between the PF and SPF groups was displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>, which confirmed the different metabolic phenotypes between PF- and SPF-treated rats (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>X = 0.585, Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.395).
