<p id="Par13" class="p">A heatmap was applied to intuitively inspect the variation tendencies of metabolite levels between the C group and the treatment groups. Compared with the C group, 24 metabolites were upregulated and 12 metabolites were downregulated in the PF group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>); however, 10 were upregulated and 26 were downregulated in the SPF group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>). Among the 22 common disrupted metabolites, 5-aminopentanoic acid and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) presented a converse trend that fell in response to SPF and rose in response to PF. Additional, the levels of thromboxane A2 (TXA
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), deoxycytidine monophosphate, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, 13,14-dihydro-prostaglandin E1 (PGE
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>), citicoline, phenylethylamine and D-glucose were all increased under the two treatments, and the effect of SPF was stronger than that of PF. The other eight metabolites, including arachidonic acid, hexadecasphinganine, diisobutyl phthalate, 1-monopalmitin, cholesteryl acetate, L-histidinol, sphinganine and phytosphingosine displayed the same decreasing trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
