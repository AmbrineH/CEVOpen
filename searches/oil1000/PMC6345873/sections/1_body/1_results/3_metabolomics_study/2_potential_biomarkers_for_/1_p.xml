<p id="Par12" class="p">The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was constructed to compare the differences in metabolism. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2a,b</xref>, clear separations were observed between the C group and PF group (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>X = 0.51; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>Y = 0.99; Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.953) as well as the C group and SPF group (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>X = 0.582; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>Y = 0.995; Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.974). The 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values provided by cross-validated ANOVA (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">CV-ANOVA</sub>) were 1.29 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> and 1.34 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup> for the above two OPLS-DA models, respectively, which conformed the significance of the models. For further validation, permutation tests with 200 iterations were performed. The goodness of fit of the randomly permuted models was compared with that of the original model. As shown in the validation plots for OPLS-DA models (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2c,d</xref>), all permuted R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> values to the left were lower than the original point to the right, and the blue regression line of Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> points had a negative intercept. Therefore, the original two OPLS-DA models were all valid. The five-pointed star symbols in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2e,f</xref> represent the significantly changed metabolites in the PF group and SPF group. The metabolites could be approved as potential biomarkers after being screened by adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and variable importance for the projection (VIP) values (VIP &gt; 1.5). The structures of potential biomarkers were then identified on the basis of data information, including MS/MS fragment, accurate mass and the origin in the Human Metabolome Database (

Further confirmation was achieved by comparing retention times and MS/MS fragment patterns with reference standards when necessary. Based on the above strategies, a total of 33 and 36 biomarkers in response to PF and SPF exposure, respectively, were obtained and were listed in Supplementary Tables
