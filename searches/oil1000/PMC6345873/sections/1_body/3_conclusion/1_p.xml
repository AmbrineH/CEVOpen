<p id="Par22" class="p">Research based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was successfully performed to explore the comprehensive effects of salt-processing on PF. The internal correlations among chemical composition, absorption characteristics and action mechanism, together with the influence of salt-processing, have led to the discovery of the salt-processing mechanism. In summary, the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants in the salt-processing procedure are the primary cause of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity of SPF. Furthermore, this integrated novel strategy is a feasible approach for future mechanism study of herb-processing.</p>
