<p id="Par20" class="p">Sphinganine and phytosphingosine are sphingolipids, the free types of which cause growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in renal cells. Under the actions of different enzymes, sphinganine and phytosphingosine are converted into other important metabolites in sphingolipid metabolism, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>, both PF and SPF inhibited the levels of sphinganine, phytosphingosine and the associated sphingolipid metabolism. I.e., PF and SPF could reduce the level of ceramide 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>, inhibit osteoblast apoptosis and prevent osteoporosis, by inhibiting sphingolipid metabolism. Additionally, PF and SPF exhibited similar impacts on arachidonic acid, hexadecasphinganine, diisobutyl phthalate, 1-monopalmitin, cholesteryl acetate and L-histidinol. These results lead to the hypothesis that the type and/or contents of certain components might be altered in the salt-processing procedure, but the basic chemical composition was preserved. Correspondingly, PF and SPF exert similar effects in some respects.
