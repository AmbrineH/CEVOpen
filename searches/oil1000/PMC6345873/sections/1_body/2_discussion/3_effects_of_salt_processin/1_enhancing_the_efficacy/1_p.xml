<p id="Par17" class="p">PF is usually used for improving the osteoporosis and diarrhoea in clinic. Before the present study, we investigated the effects of PF and SPF in both an osteoporosis model and a diarrhoea model. The results showed that SPF was more efficacious than PF in treating both osteoporosis and diarrhoea (detailed information is shown in Supplementary Information, section 2 and section 3). In the present study, the levels of deoxycytidine monophosphate, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, PGE
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, citicoline, phenylethylamine and D-glucose in SPF group were higher than that in PF group (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Therefore, SPF possessed a stronger effect than PF, which might be related to the increased contents of bioactive components in extract and the enhanced absorption
