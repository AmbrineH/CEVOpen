 </sup>. Compared with the C group, the levels of lysoPCs were upregulated in the PF group and showed a downward trend in the SPF group (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). These results indicated that the toxic side effects of PF on the cardiovascular and renal systems could be alleviated by salt-processing. All alleviation in toxicity might be attributed to the loss of volatile components during the heating process of salt-processing. Bakuchiol, as an example, is one of the major volatile components in PF
