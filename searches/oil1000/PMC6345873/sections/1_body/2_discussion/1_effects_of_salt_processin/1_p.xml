<p id="Par15" class="p">The levels of bioactive components in SPF extract were 30â€“50% higher than those in PF extract. This could be attributed to the following two aspects. (1) PF expanded in volume, and the internal micro-structure became loose due to the heating effect during salt-processing. Hence, it was easier for water to permeate into medicinal materials, dissolve the bioactive components, and then diffuse smoothly into the decoction in the boiling process. (2) Under the effects of high temperature and sodium ions, linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid in PF could generate sodium linoleate, sodium oleate, sodium palmitate and sodium stearate, which were substances possessing surface activity
