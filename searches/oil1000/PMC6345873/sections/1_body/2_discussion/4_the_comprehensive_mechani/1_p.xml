<p id="Par21" class="p">The two main steps of salt-processing were (i) infiltration by salt solution and (ii) stir-frying over a flame. The heat from the flame made the internal structure of PF loose and caused the volatile components to vaporize. The combined effects of high temperature and sodium ions initiated the emergence of surfactants, which could form micelles in water, combine with some components to generate complexes and dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells. The loosened structure and solubilization effect from micelles were crucial to the increased content of bioactive components in extract. The newly generated complexes and membrane lipid solubility of surfactants made it easy for the bioactive components to pass through the absorption barrier. Therefore, both the enhancements in the content and in the absorption of the bioactive components contributed to the strengthened efficacy of SPF. Moreover, volatilization loss that occurred during the heating operation was the principal reason for the alleviated toxic effects of SPF. The comprehensive mechanism of salt-processing on PF was simplified in Fig.Â
