 <sub class="sub">max</sub> are often employed to characterize the degree, intensity and speed of absorption, respectively. The pharmacokinetic results suggested that salt-processing was conducive to improving the absorptions of most bioactive components and alleviating the intensity and speed of action. This principle could be demonstrated by the following three points. (1) The surfactants generated during salt-processing could dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, thereby enhancing the permeability of the membrane and absorption of the components

 </sup>. (2) The complexes formed by surfactants and certain components changed the physical and chemical properties of the original compounds, such as solubility, molecular size, diffusion velocity and oil/water partition coefficient, and enhanced the associated membrane permeability

 </sup>. (3) PF has the function of accelerating gastrointestinal peristalsis. Administration of PF extract would cause more bioactive components to gather at the absorption site simultaneously and result in shorter residence time. Therefore, the corresponding results of higher

 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, shorter

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and lower 
 <italic class="italic">AUC</italic> in the PF group could be explained. In contrast, SPF could inhibit gastrointestinal motility efficaciously, slowing down the movement of bioactive components in the gastrointestinal tract and resulting in longer

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and higher

 </sup>. Moreover, this also provided theoretical support for the enhanced anti-diarrhoeal effect of PF after salt-processing.
