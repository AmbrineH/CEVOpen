However, the relationship between chemicals and efficacy, as well as absorption characteristics that are essential to the therapeutic effect of oral administration, have received little attention. To date, pharmacokinetics has been proven to be an efficacious approach to exploring the intracorporal course of drugs, especially absorption characteristics
