<p id="Par5" class="p">In light of the above, a novel strategy based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was proposed in this study to explore the internal correlations among chemical composition, absorption characteristics and comprehensive efficacy, as well as the influence of salt-processing. First, quantitative analysis of bioactive components in PF and SPF extracts was carried out to ascertain the alteration in chemical composition. Second, a pharmacokinetics study was conducted to explore the absorption characteristics of bioactive components. Lastly, a metabolomics study was performed to investigate the comprehensive efficacy of PF and SPF. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, were then comprehensively analysed to reveal the mechanism of salt-processing on PF.</p>
