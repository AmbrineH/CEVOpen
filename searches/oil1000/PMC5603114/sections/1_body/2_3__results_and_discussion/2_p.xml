<p class="p">Comparing the EOPh composition with literature data, it was noticed that, generally, phellandrenes, terpinolenes, limonenes, oxidized

 <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>-pinene was also found in significant amounts of fresh resin oil in most species reported in the literal data. Aged resins of this species, as well as commercial samples (mixture), usually show a lot of phenylpropanoids in their composition. Sesquiterpenes are usually detected in traces in most parts of the reported resin oils, but this ratio was described as an inverse to
