<p class="p">Of the 23 monoterpenes identified in this species, five of them had already been studied for their effects on the cardiovascular system:
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-cymene, eucalyptol, linalool, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, limonene, and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol. The main effects observed were hypotension and bradycardia
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> to
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-cymene [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], negative inotropic effect
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> to eucalyptol [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], cardiovascular system stimulation and depression
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> to linalool [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], reduction and prevention of cardiovascular injuries caused by pulmonary hypertension
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> to limonene [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and hypotension and vasorelaxation [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] and antihypertension to terpineol [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This paper showed that essential oils may be considered promising agents for prevention or treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system.
