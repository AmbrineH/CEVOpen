<p class="p">Furthermore, FN-loaded FA-PEG2000-DSPE-modified nanostructured lipid carriers (FA-FN-NLCs) were developed by using emulsification-ultrasonic and low temperature solidification method, optimized with central composition design, to increase the solubility and bioavailability of FN. The advantages being, increased circulation time in blood and improved targeting ability. Hence, this formulation emerged as an optimistic drug delivery system for FN in the treatment of cancer exhibiting high encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity. Even, through NiR fluorescence imaging study, it was seen that FA-FN-NLCs especially accumulated in tumor site, by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In vitro drug release exhibited a biphasic release pattern with an initial sudden drug release and followed by a prolonged drug release. In vivo study compared with FN solution (FN-SOL) and FN loaded traditional NLCs (FN-NLCs) and showed that FA-FN-NLCs had a longer blood circulating time (t

Recently, Pan et al. compared calebin A and calebin A encapsulated liposomes and concluded that liposomes of calebin A increased the bioactivity of calebin A by enhancing its anticancer activity in colon cancer. This study explained that, besides enhanced solubility, liposomal calebin A has the potency to change absorption pathway and signaling processes in an increased manner, establishing it as a promising agent in inhibiting colon cancer (SW480) cells [
