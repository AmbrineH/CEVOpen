<p class="p">Microcapsules are formed by incorporation of active agent in a polymeric matrix. A research showed that both Î²-elemene and zedoary turmeric oil encapsulated in microcapsules have marked improvement in their therapeutic efficacy. In addition, microspheres are free flowing powders consisting of synthetic polymers or proteins. These oil microspheres have great anticancer potential in transplanted hepatoma, which is used in the treatment of hepatic artery infusion, to relieve the abnormality of blood cell count caused by mitomycin [
