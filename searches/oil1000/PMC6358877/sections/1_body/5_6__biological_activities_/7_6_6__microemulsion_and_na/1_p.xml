<p class="p">Microemulsions are clear and thermodynamically stable; they are formed by isotropic liquid mixtures of oil, water and surfactant, where oil phase contains different olefins and hydrocarbons whereas aqueous phase contains salt or other constituents. Ju et al. proved that elemene microemulsions are beneficial for the treatment of malignant neoplasms, such as gynecological, breast, skin, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers and, hence, exhibit sustained release in vivo with improved bioavailability, stability, high entrapment efficiency and good clarity. In addition, it was found that submicron emulsion possessed high turmeric oil loading capacity. This can stay stable and sterilized at room temperature, as well as under high temperature, pressure for six months [
