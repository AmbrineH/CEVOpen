<p class="p">Solid lipids nanoparticles are solid colloidal particles in which the active agents or drugs are entrapped and dissolved. Researches showed that β-elemene, prepared in solid lipid nanoparticulate (SLN) system with various methods such as film ultrasonic wave, sonication and extrusion attained various benefits: achieving sustained release pattern by improving the protection of labile compounds from chemical degradation, increasing the availability and efficiency of the drug. Another research showed a comparison of normal SLN and folate receptor-targeted SLN encapsulated turmeric oil and β-elemene as well as observed that the later circulates for a longer period in blood as well as in many tissues to reach higher level of concentration [
