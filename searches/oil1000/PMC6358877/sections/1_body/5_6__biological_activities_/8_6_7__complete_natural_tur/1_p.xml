<p class="p">Our research group developed a more bioavailable form of curcuminoids—Cureit—formed by recreating a complete natural turmeric matrix (CNTM) using a novel PNS technology. This CNTM contains not only curcuminoids; but also, non-curcuminoids in the form of turmeric water extract and turmeric essential oil [

 <xref rid="B128-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. The presence of non-curcuminoids in Cureit intensifies the physical stability and facilitates sustained drug delivery along with the protection of drug molecules from degradation [

 <xref rid="B132-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. Hence, this novel nano drug delivery system promises to effectively encapsulate non-curcuminoids with curcumin without any drug interactions. Indeed, it is a successful system for the synergistic combination of non-curcuminoids with curcumin, which ameliorate the bioavailability and enhance the anticancer activities without rendering any adverse effects.
