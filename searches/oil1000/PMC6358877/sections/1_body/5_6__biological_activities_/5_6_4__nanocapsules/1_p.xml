<p class="p">Nanocapsules are nanoscale shell made from non-toxic polymeric membrane, which encapsulates an inner liquid core. Natrajan et al. developed chitosan-alginate nanocarrier for the encapsulation of ar-turmerone, which resulted in a clear supernatant and through hemolysis assay, confirmed that they were hemocompatible. The carrier showed high cell viability percentage, which insinuate it as nontoxic and with nanoscale shell. Moreover, turmeric oil loaded nanocapsules were found to have antiproliferative activity on A549 cell lines by using MTT assay [
