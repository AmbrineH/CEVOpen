<p class="p">In this review, we comprehensively attempt to establish the basic attributes including the identification, composition, physicochemical properties, and various anticancer activities, including the mechanism of action and molecular docking studies of non-curcuminoids having equipotent synergistic effects as curcuminoids. Its therapeutic efficacy is also evinced by evaluating the successful clinical trials. Furthermore, we reviewed distinctive approaches that tend to ameliorate the solubility and bioavailability to aggrandize the anticancer effects of non-curcuminoids.</p>
