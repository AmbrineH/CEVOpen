<p class="p">Turmeric (
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> L.), a nutritional dietary spice from the Zingiberaceae family, has been extensively used for various applications. This rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant found abundantly in Asia is renowned for its cosmetic, culinary, color, and medicinal applications for centuries [

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Basically, its volatile oil and nonvolatile oleoresin constitutes of bioactive components, which are classified as diphenylheptanoids (nonvolatile) diphenylpentanoids (nonvolatile), phenyl propene (cinnamic acid type) derivatives (nonvolatile), turmeric oil containing terpenoids (volatile) [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Major diphenylheptanoids are curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, which are collectively called curcuminoids [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Non-curcuminoids can be defined as all the biologically active compounds other than curcuminoids, precisely, curcumin-free bioactive components of turmeric [

Curcuminoids have a mixed bag of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antiviral, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antivenom and antioxidant. In addition, anticoagulant, antihypotensive, antihypocholesteremic, antifibrotic, antimutagenic, antifertility, and anticancer activities, which are well documented. Especially, the anticancer activities of curcuminoids are well established and evidenced with extensive studies on vivid disparate pathways to trigger apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are well established [

 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Recently, non-curcuminoids such as turmerones, elemene, bisacurone, curdione, cyclocurcumin, germacrone, furanodiene, curcumol, and calebin A were extensively studied, for their pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Researchers have specifically explained that non-curcuminoids have a broad spectrum of anticancer activities on different cell lines including intricate and drug resistant malignancies. Although these compounds promise to exhibit similar potency as curcuminoids, their anticancer studies are elusive and they still have to become a cynosure [
