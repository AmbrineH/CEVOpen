<p class="p">Furanodiene, (5E,9E)-3,6,10-trimethyl-4,7,8,11-tetrahydrocyclodeca[b]furan, another sesquiterpene extracted from the volatile oil fraction of turmeric by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> supercritical fluid technique. Fuanodiene had inhibitory effect on various cells, such as HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), SGC—7901 (gastric cancer) HeLa, K562 (leukemia), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MDA-MB-435s (breast cancer) HT-1080 (fleshy tumor), Hep-2 (laryngocarcinoma), SMMC-7721(hepatoma), and PC3 (prostatic carcinoma), displaying their benevolent potential with varied mechanisms of action. In hepatoma cells (Hep G2), the potency of furanodiene was demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay. The inhibition of cell proliferation brought cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis through the mitochondria-caspase apoptotic pathway, which activated p38, and inhibited the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway [

Another study evaluated the effects of furanodiene on human leukemia cell HL60 by DNA fragmentation and indicated that furanodiene brought apoptosis through cleavage of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and PARP. Along with this, the Bcl-2 family proteins and BID protein were activated, whereas Bax, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2 proteins were not at all affected by the stimulation of furanodiene. It was also seen that furanodiene promoted upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), with the formation of TNFR1 complex along with the production of TNF-α in HL60 cells [
 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Ba et al. studied the anticancer activity of furanodiene on HeLa, HL-60, U251, and Hep-2 cells. and explained that furanodiene is effective against uterine cervix cancer (U14) cells and has a protective effect on immune function [
 <xref rid="B76-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Further, the effect of furanodiene, studied on HeLa cells, revealed that furanodiene in a dose-dependent manner caused cell death. This proved its efficacy on sarcoma 180 cells in mice and uterine cervical cancer growth [
 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Further, successful development and validation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furanodiene in rat plasma through tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography were studied. The results explained that the bioavailability of furanodiene in rats was about 49%, which proved that their method of analysis might be helpful to prove the potency of furanodiene as an anticancer agent [
 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Another study showed that furanodiene inhibited protein expression of total cyclin D1, p-cyclin D1, p- cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors (CDK)2, total CDK2, pRb, total Rb, Bcl-Xl, and Akt. These expressions suppressed breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo and increased the protein expressions of Bax and Bad, along with elevation of proteolytic cleavage of caspase 9, as well as caspase 7 and PARP [
 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Furanodiene has also proved its efficacy in the inhibition of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and proliferation carried out by VEGF [
