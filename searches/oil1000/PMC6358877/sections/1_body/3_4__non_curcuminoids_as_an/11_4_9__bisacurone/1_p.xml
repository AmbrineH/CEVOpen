<p class="p">Bisacurone, (6S)-6- [(1R, 4S, 5S)-4, 5-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl]-2-methylhept-2-en-4-one, is a terpenoid, known as a very potent anticancer agent. Studies showed that vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (VCAM-1) promoted carcinogenesis. Therefore, Sun et al. carried out investigation to find an herbal remedy for its suppression and found that Bisacurone in TNF-α activated by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner inhibits the level of VCAM-1. It showed significant blockage of the NF-κB p65 carried to the nucleus, phosphorylation of inhibitory factor kBα and suppression of ROS. Bisacurone, also showed inhibition of phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) and Akt that helps in the regulation of VCAM-1 by TNF-α. Thus, they prove to be potential anticancer agent by their promising results in regulating VCAM-1 [
