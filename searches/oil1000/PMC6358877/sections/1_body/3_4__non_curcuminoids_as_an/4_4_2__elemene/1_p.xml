<p class="p">Elemenes, (1-methyl-1-vinyl-2, 4-diisopropenyl-cyclohexane) are among the 109 sesquiterpenes present in turmeric [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The potency of elemene, isolated from turmeric, has been already stated in China’s food and drug administration and is extensively used in the chemotherapy of the cancer patients in China. Many investigations have led to the fact that elemene can inhibit the tumor growth of various cells, such as ovarian, laryngeal, non-small cell lung, prostrate, melanoma, leukemia, breast, brain, hepatoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and human cervix epithelioid carcinoma cells due to its apoptotic behavior [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Hua et al. demonstrated the antitumor activity of elemene by studying the inhibition property of it on HL-60 cell proliferation. This behavior is associated with cell cycle arrest between phase transitions from S to G2M phase, thereby promoting apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Elemene can also pass through the blood brain barrier combating the carcinomas of the brain due to its small size and lipophilic nature [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Elemene is found in three different structural isomers, namely α, β, and γ-elemene; among them, β-elemene is abundantly found and is more active than the other components.
