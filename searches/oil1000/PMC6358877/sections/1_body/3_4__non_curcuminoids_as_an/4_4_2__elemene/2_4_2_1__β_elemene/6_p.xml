<p class="p">Moreover, Jiang et al. reviewed and explained that the upregulation of pro-apoptotic signals and downregulation of anti-apoptotic signals. They concluded that this could be the possible origin of the mechanism of action of β-elemene in various cancerous cells such as melanoma cells, glioblastoma cells, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma cells, human bladder cells, thyroid cells, ovarian cancer cells, and prostrate cells [

Recently, a research demonstrated that β-elemene can be a promising tool in doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cells by altering the functionality and quantity of D-luciferin potassium salt, an ATP-binding substrate cassette transporter also known as ABC transporters. The researchers used bioluminescence imaging for studying the efflux kinetics of ABC transporters, which showed deadening functionality. The colorimetric test for assessing cell metabolic activity (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT assay) and lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values explained the increased effect of doxorubicin on doxorubicin resistant cells when combined with β-elemene [
 <xref rid="B70-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Guo et al. explained the mechanism of action and the mode of interaction with ABCB1 expression of β-elemene by molecular docking analysis. Their study analyzed that β-elemene interacted hydrophobically with the binding pocket of ABCB1 substrate, as well as its most feasible docking site-carrying double bond, connected via π-π interaction with aromatic residues to increase ABCB1 protein sensitivity. Thus, the possible mode of anticancer activity of β-elemene in altering MDR through the inhibition of ABCB1 transporter efflux activity was determined [

 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. But more molecular docking studies should be performed to authenticate its therapeutic potential. These studies prove that β-elemene is another major compound of non-curcuminoids possessing anti-cancer activities. It can alter and inhibit cancer cells of various types, such as brain, lung, the gastric system, and so on. In addition to this, their derivatives also possess potential anticancer activities as seen through these literatures. It is commendable that a strong component, such as β-elemene, possesses influential biological activities when taken alone or in combination to improve most chronic diseases like cancer and revamp multidrug-resistant cancers.
