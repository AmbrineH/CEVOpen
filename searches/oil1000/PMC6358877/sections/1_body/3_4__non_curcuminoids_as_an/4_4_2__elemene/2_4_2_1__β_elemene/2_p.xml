<p class="p">β-elemene has a promising therapeutic role in human SGC7901 and MKN45 gastric cancer cells. β-elemene inhibited the cell viability and clonogenic survival of gastric cancer cell that were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with induction of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B54-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The effects of β-elemene in murine hepatocellular cancer, and the relation with its expression level of c-Met (a receptor tyrosine kinase) were examined over neoplastic tissues. Analysis through western blot, immunofluorescence analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the presence of c-Met expression in H22 hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model in vitro and in vivo. The test results showed that the induction of growth inhibition in murine hepatocellular carcinoma cells by β-elemene was brought about by downregulation of c-Met expression [

It was further found by Zhan et al. that β-elemene inhibits human renal carcinoma (RCC) 786-0 cell proliferation by inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK signaling pathways, thus inducing protective autophagy and apoptosis [

Another study explored the efficacy of β-elemene when treated with taxanes over ovarian cell lines A2780/CP70 and its parental cell lines A2780. The results suggested that this combination reduced cell viability, arresting cell cycle at G2/M phase, increasing cell apoptosis [

Zhang et al. studied that β-elemene has the potency to reverse tumor MDR (multi-drug resistance) and revealed that their combination with doxorubicin enhanced the anticancer activity of the latter due to the presence of β-elemene. This was observed by the increase in the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin in both SGC7901/ADR cells and K562/DNR cells which influenced the inhibition of p-glycoprotein (p-gp). β-elemene downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt pathway and upregulated E3 ubiquitin ligases, Cb1-b and c-Cb1 when treated on SGC7901/ADR cells. Thus, β-elemene could target gastric cancer cells and p-gp overexpressing leukemia to increase the efficacy of doxorubicin treatment [
