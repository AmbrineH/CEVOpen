<p class="p">Apart from the above stated apoptotic pathways, β-elemene is thought to modulate through various signaling pathways to decrease the antiapoptotic protein expression of HIF-1 α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Bcl-2, Survivan, cellular FLICE- like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), upregulating apoptotic proteins mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)3, MKK6, P38 MAPK, and suppress the mTOR pathway [

They also works in combination with other anticancer drugs, like tamoxifen, arsenic trioxide, gefitinib, etoposide, and cisplatin to give results that are more positive. It has shown its efficacy in overcoming cisplatin-resistant (A2780/CP) and the cisplatin-sensitive (A2780) ovarian cancerous cells. In the same way, it partially reverses Adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADM) [
