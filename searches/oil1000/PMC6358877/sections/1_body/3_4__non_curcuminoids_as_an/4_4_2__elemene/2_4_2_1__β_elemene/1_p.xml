<p class="p">β-elemene, (1S,2S,4R)-1-ethenyl-1-methyl-2-4-bis(prop-1-en-2yl) cyclohexane, is a sesquiterpene which is studied for its anticancer activity in various cancer cells through its antiproliferative activity with subsequent induction of apoptosis. The research catalog of β-elemene has a range of studies dealing with their effects on different cancer cell lines, mainly on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and the effective mode of action to trigger apoptosis. To begin with, a study explained the effect of β-elemene on these cells caused cell death through the mitochondrial release of the cytochrome c-mediated apoptotic pathway. These lung cancer cells were arrested at the G2-M phase, which caused a decrease in levels of phosphor- cell division cycle (cdc)2 (Thr-161) and cyclin B1, with an increase in the levels of phosphor-cdc2 (Tyr-15) p27kip1 and partially by the check point kinase (CHK)2-dependent mechanism [

This was due to the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway which involves IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) and Bcl-2 family proteins in a time and dose-dependent manner. Hence β-elemene and cisplatin combination proved to be a promising regimen for the treatment of lung cancer and cisplatin-resistant tumors [

Further, investigation of β-elemene on human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells by Shu et al. explained that β-elemene inhibited the activity of the P13K/Akt/ mammalian target of rampamycin (mTor)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1(p70S6K1) signaling pathway, resulting in protective autophagy and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Li et al. also reported the rapid inhibition of ERK and Akt activation and upregulation of Casitas B–lineage lymphoma (c-Cb1 and Cb1-b) expression, which enhanced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in lung cancer cells (A549) [

Furthermore, the intensive antiproliferative effect of β-elemene on NSCLC cells was proved by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKa) and ERK1/2 mediated inhibition of transcription factor Sp1, followed by reduction in DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression. This study also found that metformin intensifies the effect of β-elemene by blocking Akt signaling and inhibits DNMTI protein expression. In addition, the reciprocal of AMPKa and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are responsible for β-elemene responses [
