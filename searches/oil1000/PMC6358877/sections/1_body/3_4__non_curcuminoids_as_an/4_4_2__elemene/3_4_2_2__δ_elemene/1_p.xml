<p class="p">δ-Elemene is also a terpene, which is the structural isomer of β-elemene with three consecutive isoprene units. It is reported that their anticancer activities are initiated by activation of caspase signaling pathway. This initiation led to the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) colorectal adenocarcinoma and Hela cells along with the activation of caspase-3. It also exhibited promising behavior when treated for NCL-H292 lung cancer cells, as it showed apoptotic behavior in Hela cells by attenuating L-glutathione or the Z-D (OM e) E (OMe)VD(OMe) fluromethylketone (z-DEVD-fmk) increment of p38 MARK, and showed inducible nitric oxide synthase levels [

These studies prove that even the isomers of elemene exhibit anticancer activities when examined on different cancerous cell lines. The rationale behind this is apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, which are similar to curcuminoids. Thus, these biological components can be considered along with curcumin or alone, as they have meager side effects, and has very promising efficiency to retaliate against cancer.
