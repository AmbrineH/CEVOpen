<p class="p">Curcumol, (1S,2S,5S,9S)-9-isopropyl-2-methyl-6-methylene-11-oxatricyclo (6.2.1.01,5) undecan-8-ol, is a potent anticancer sesquiterpenoid that inhibits proliferation of Hela, OV-UL-2, MCF-7, and MM231 cancer cells by RNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. It caused cell death in ARTE- induced human lung adenocarcinoma (ASTC-a-1) with the induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase with nuclear fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and rapid Bax translocation from the cytosol into mitochondria [

Huang et al. revealed that curcumol brought apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2 cells by downregulation of NF-κB. This compound also showed promising anticancer effects in ASTC-a-1 cell by apoptosis mechanism, mediated by caspase-independent mitochondrial pathways [

This suppression was due to the decrease in NF-κB and its DNA binding activity leading to the decrease in Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and increase in Bax expression along with the increase in caspase 3 [

This study showed that when curcumol was treated on these cells decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax to induce apoptosis. Further, the suppression of insulin-like factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) escalated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and decreased Camp-response element (CREB) expression to trigger apoptosis [

Thus, these studies elucidated the anticancer activities of curcumol on different types of cancers through different mechanism of action that ultimately led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that hold a promising path to acknowledge them as effective anticancer agents.
