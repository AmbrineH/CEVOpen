 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and purified by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction method were explained by Chen et al. This study explained the root cause of apoptosis, which was due to the elicitation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, eventually caused an increase in in p 53 up regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Bcl 2 associated X protein (Bax), first apoptosis signal (Fas) and death receptor (DR) 4 expression along with the induction of ERK and c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) activation. It was observed that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was initiated by ar-turmerone by activating caspase-3 and caspase-8, which upregulated Fas and DR4. Further, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was provoked by decreasing B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL and increasing PUMA and Bax with the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 [

Besides this, ar-turmerone possesses profound effect on P388D1lymphocytic leukemia, exhibiting positive rates of Bax and Bcl-2 expression and increased the apoptosis index values. Moreover, the densities of Bax and mRNA increased with no observed changes in the densities of caspase 1, caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 9, p53, and p21. A marked increase was also observed in T-lymphocytic proliferation and the IL2 production activity increased with increased tumor immunogenicity [

Turmerones also showed promising results when motif–fused by spiropyrrolidine oxindoles through 1, 3 dipolar cyclo–addition events of dienones 2 with azomethine ylides, which were attached to it. These turmerones motif–fused spiropyrrolidine oxindoles showed more potency than cisplatin kept as control over human leukemia cells (K562) and human lung cancer cells (A549) [
