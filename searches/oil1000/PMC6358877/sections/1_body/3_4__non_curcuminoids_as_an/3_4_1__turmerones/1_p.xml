<p class="p">Turmerones are one of the major sesquiterpenes derived from turmeric. They are further classified as α-turmerone, ar-turmerone, and β-turmerone, and among them ar-turmerone has shown to possess more potency as an anticancer agent. Nevertheless, Yue et al. explained the immunomodulatory and chemopreventive activities of α-turmerone and revealed its potency to be equivalent to curcuminoids. This study compared their potential in inhibiting of cell proliferation between the curcuminoids and α-turmerones on breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231). For this, propidium iodide staining, DNA fragmentation, and annexin-V were used to detect cell cycle phase, containing apoptotic cells, and its accumulation amount. It was observed that apoptosis was initiated due to the distortion caused to the mitochondria in the intrinsic pathway with activation in procaspase-3 cleavage in α-turmerone, whereas no effect was visualized when compared to curcuminoids. Further, this study explained that turmerones restrain the proliferation of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

However, this component of non-curcuminoid has not yet gained enough significance. In addition to this, various anticancer activities of ar-turmerone registered until now are discussed further.
