<p class="p">Ar-turmerone, (6S-2-methyl-6-(4-methylphenyl) hept-2-en-4-one), a sesquiterpene derived from 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, has been identified as a promising anticancer agent with distinct mechanism of action for different cancer cell lines. In this series, Lee et al. reported that ar-turmerone could bring DNA fragmentation (apoptosis) in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), rat baselophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3), human histiocytic lymphoma (U937), and mouse lymphocytic leukemia (L1210) in a dose- and time-dependent manner [

The bioavailability of curcumin could be significantly increased by (α, ar) turmerones as explained by Yue et al. in human intestinal epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. It was reported that α-turmerone significantly reduced the p-glycoprotein (p-gp) with the upregulated level of multi-resistance protein gene 1 (MDR1), multi-resistance protein gene 2 (MDR2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). This was observed by the levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, rhodamine-123 accumulation, and efflux transport studies. These studies proved that α-turmerone and ar-turmerone have promising potential as anticancer drugs in multi-resistant cancer cells and colorectal cancer, respectively [

Further, ar-turmerone was reported to efficiently inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced invasion, colony formation, migration, stimulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in breast cancer cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. In addition, suppression noticed in MMP-9 and COX-2 promoter activation was due to the inhibition of its binding to nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NF–κB) in vivo via modulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling in breast cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B36-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Other researchers, Yong-gang et al., examined the effects of purified ar-turmerone on murine dendritic cells (DC). This study utilized enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), cyto-chemistry assay, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) bioassay for evaluating the effects of ar-turmerone on breast cancer cells. These tests showed that ar-turmerone increased the expression level of cluster of differentiation (CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86), followed by the induction of phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs. Further, the treatment with ar-turmerone downregulated the acidic phosphatase (ACP) activity inside DC, promoting interleukin (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production. They also reported that both α and β-turmerones exhibited antiproliferative activities in breast cells [
