<p class="p">Germacrone, (3E, 7E)-3, 7-dimehyl-10-propan-2-ylidenecyclodeca-3, 7-dien-1-one, a well-known anticancer terpenoid, were isolated from Curcuma Rhizomes. Germacrone, through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis, brought about proliferation in breast cancer cell in vitro. This demonstrated marked rise in LDH release and induction of depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B99-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. Bin et al. explained that germacrone has proved to be beneficial as antitumor agent on human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Bel 7402), by activating CDK1, inducing P21 and reducing the protein expression of cyclin B1. Germacrone also showed oxidative damage in human hepatoma cells along with the increase of the intercellular reactive oxygen species. Various tests performed such as flow cytometry, MTT assay and fluorescent microscopy concluded that germacrone exhibited antiproliferative effect on Bel7402 and HepG2 cells. Through annexin V/P staining and Hoechst 33258, it was observed that in a dose-dependent manner, and amplification in the downregulation of Bcl-2/Bcl-xl and upregulation of Bax were observed. This amplification was associated with cell apoptosis, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and caused reduction in the cyclin B1 and its activating partner CDK1, which induced p21, along with the upregulation of p53 and ROS. Thus, these mechanisms proved germacrone as potent anticancer agent for liver cancer [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00013-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>G). The connectivity between germacrone induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells and Janus activated kinases (JAK2)/signal transducer (STAT3) signaling pathway facilitated anticancer activities. This analysis explained that germacrone downregulated the activation of JAK2/STAT3, regulated Bcl-2 family member and p-53, which are STAT regulated, to bring about apoptosis inHepG2 cells [
 <xref rid="B101-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Anticancer activity of germacrone on breast cancer cells was explained by Xie et al. They explained the aftermath of germacrone on human breast cancer MCF-7/Adriamycin (ADR) MDR cells with the help of flow cyclometry. The results revealed that germacrone in a dose-dependent manner brought about apoptosis and inhibited MDR1 gene promoter by reducing the p-glycoprotein expression. The combination of germacrone with ADR increased apoptosis, resulting in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression levels and refinement of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and p53 expression levels in MCF-7/ADR cells, which was much low when compared to ADR treatment alone [
 <xref rid="B102-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. Another research showed the effectiveness of germacrone in combination therapy with other drugs, namely 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate, in elevating its antitumor activity, on positive breast cancer cells estrogen receptor α (ER-α). These signals at transcriptional level undergoes inhibition in MCF-7 cells and replace it to estrogen response element on chromatin. Thus, with the inhibition of accessibility of estrogen-induced chromatin, target gene promoter, compromised with the binding of RNA polymerase II and complex of sucrose/switch non-fermentable chromatin remodeling, caused cell-proliferation [

A molecular docking study performed for essential oils against bacterial proteins present in enzymes 2X5O, 3UDI, murD ligases and 3TYE. These proteins were subjected to docking as co-crystal ligands and the docking score was validated by monitoring the docking of individual components of essential oil to the active sites of protein. This study highlighted that germacrone proved highly promising among the other constituents with a high grade of interaction with proteins. Hence, through this study, germacrone cleared a definite pathway, in possessing enormous biological activities. However, more studies should be conducted for germacrone from

 <xref rid="B105-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Therefore, these components are influential as anti-cancer agent as they are least harmful for human health. Hence, it is evident from these studies that germacrone exhibited anticancer activities through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which is comparable to the proven mechanism of curcumin [
