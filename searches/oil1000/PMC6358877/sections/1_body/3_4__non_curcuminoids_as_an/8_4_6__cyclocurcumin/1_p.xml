<p class="p">Cyclocurcumin,(E)-2-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-6-(4-hydrox-3-methoxystyryl)2H-pyra-4(3H)-one, isolated and identified from turmeric have some structural similarities to curcumin. They are formed by the addition of enol oxygen group through intramolecular Michael addition to enone group [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Simon et al. investigated that cyclocurcumin acts as a nematocidal agent when combined with curcumin [

Even, the molecular docking study provided an in-depth mechanism by which ternary DNA topoisomerase I and II complexes are induced by the derivatives of curcumin particularly cyclocurcumin and curcumin sulphate. This factor was determined by free energy binding analysis and polar- hydrophobic interactions. These topoisomerases are enzymes which resolve the topological problem such as transcription, recombination, chromatin remodeling, replication that are responsible for causing cancer. Docking of cyclocurcumin and curcumin sulphate were found to be the most promising, as their binding modes were at the DNA cleavage site which corresponded to the DNA base pairing axis, equivalent to the topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. Thus, these docked complexes are converted into permanent DNA strand breaks by cellular processes inducing apoptosis. This docking study provided an insight on the efficiency of cyclocurcumin as therapeutically potential compound for treating various cancers such as ovarian, brain, lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin), lungs, and adrenocortical cancers [
