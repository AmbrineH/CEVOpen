<p class="p">Calebin A(CA),(3E)-4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-en-1-yl(2E)-3-(4 hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) prop-2-enoate), isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, has a ferulic acid ester bond which lacks the 1, 3-diketonic structure of curcuminoid compounds. Many researchers have shown that calebin A is beneficial in combating numerous cancerous cells such as colon, gastric, multiple myeloma, breast cells as well as multi-resistant cancer cells. A study of calebin A suggested that it is an effective compound in chemotherapy for multi-drug resistant cancers, as it inhibits the growth of the cell and induced apoptosis in SGC7901/Vincristine cells, a multi-resistant (MDR) human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, A549/DDP (cisplatin)-MDR pulmonary carcinoma cell line and HepG2/ADM (Adriamycin)-MDR hepatoma cell line. This study revealed that drug efflux function of p-glycoprotein was inhibited with their treatment, but the expression level of P-glycoprotein remained the same. Calebin A was also found to modulate the activities of MAPK, which included increased protein kinase of p38, 38kda activity. They also, decreased JNK as well as ERK. These results suggested that this is a genuine compound for the treatment of human gastric and other MDR cancers [

Calebin A was found to be very effective for HCT-116 type colon cancer cells and has proved to be more potent, when compared with curcumin. The expression of regulatory protein of cell cycle such as cyclin-A, cyclin-B, cdc25A, cdc2 levels are decreased by calebin A, causing S and G2/M cycle arrest and increases the CDKI p53 and p21. In fact, this compound increases the ROS levels, which again leads to cell cycle arrest as it promotes the DNA damage response and upregulate the phosphorylation of H2A histone family member X on serine 139 to form (γH2AX ), CHK1, and CHK2. When intraperitoneally administrated on colon tumor cell in vivo, they showed decreases in the tumor volumes, tumor sizes and the cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein levels [

 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, utilized mouse macrophages and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in vitro. This study showed that CA causes suppression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of macrophages and forms osteoclasts, with downregulation of marker gene expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, including calcitonin receptor (CTR), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic (NFATc–1), and cathepsin K. Additionally, suppression of phosphorylation, followed by the degradation of kB, NF-κB, which were the main source for the suppression of osteoclastogenesis that induced multiple myeloma and breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Taken together, calebin A, alike curcumin exerts anticancer activities mainly on colon cancer cells through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These compounds have positive results on breast cancer cells and even on multi-resistant cancers.
