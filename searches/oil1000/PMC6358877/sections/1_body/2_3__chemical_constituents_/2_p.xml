<p class="p">One important class among them are diarylhepatanoids that include curcuminoids, are polyphenolic compounds containing curcumin (diferuloyl methane) and its two derivatives demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin. Their distinct compositions were found to be in the ratio, namely curcumin (70–80%), demethoxycurcumin (18–20%) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (2–10%) [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], these diarylhepatanoids also include some curcumin-free compounds, such as tetrahydrocurcumin and cyclocurcumin. Other non-curcuminoids involve 109 sesquiterpenes [

From these sesquiterpenes, bisabolanes were found in the greatest abundance. In addition, few phenylpropenes, such as calebin A and ferulic acid, and some monoterpenoids, such as carvacrol and limonene, were also reported [
