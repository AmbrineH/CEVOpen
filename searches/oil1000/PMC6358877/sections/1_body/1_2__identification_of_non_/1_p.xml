<p class="p">Although turmeric was well recognized in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine from past decades, its constituents such as demethoxycurcumin, bismethoxycurcumin, elemene, bisacurone, calebin A, turmerone, germacrone, and so on, were identified later [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A breakthrough came in when it was officially first isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> by Vogel et al. and they named this compound ‘curcumin’ [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Another advancement made by Anderson et al. were the development of a novel technique using organic solvent for isolating curcumin from dried rhizomes of turmeric and ascertained presence of three components with thin layer chromatography [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Further, Milobedzka and Lampe et al. inveterate the feruloylmethyl structure of this compound [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and, later, Lampe et al. revealed the synthesis of curcumin [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. By the mid-twentieth century, the various potential biological activities of these polyphenolic compounds came into the limelight [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Kuttan et al. discovered the anticancer activities of these species in in vitro and in vivo models [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. With the perception that there were other compounds in turmeric, Malingre et al. stated that turmeric contains p-cymene, β-sequiphellandrene, turmerone, and ar-turmerone [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Ohshiro et al. discovered and identified germacrone-13-al, pocurcumadiol, 4-hydroxybisabola-2, 10-diene-9-one, and 4-methoxy-S-hydroxybisabola-2, 10-diene-9-one [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Sesquiphellandrene, the active curcumin-free component of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> was also extensively studied [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Wang et al. isolated quinoline alkaloid and bisabolanes from the root of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> namely 2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)-4, 6-dimethyl-7-hydroxyquinoline, 2, 5-dihydroxybisabola-3, 10-diene, 4, 5-dihydroxybisabola-2, 10-diene, bisacurone A, bisacurone B, bisacurone C, zingerone, dehydrozingerone, and turmeronol A [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Further, studies reported two more new sesquiterpenes from the ethanol extract of rhizome of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, namely, 2-methoxy-5-hydroxybisabola-3, 10-diene-9-one, 2, 8 epoxy-5-hydroxybisabola-3, 10-diene-9-one, and one monoterpene: 2-(2, 5-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohex-3-enyl) propanoic acid were also isolated for the first time from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Even some lipid soluble fraction of this herb was isolated by solvent extraction method using non-polar organic solvents. These compounds were identified as turmerones and curlone, with a composition range of 50–60%, by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and standardized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These compounds were found light sensitive, but stable, at different temperatures and pH [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Kojima et al. discovered that the hydro distilled oil of turmeric contains α-turmerone, β-tumerone, and ar-turmerone by analysis through GC and GC-MS [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Besides, these non-curcuminoids were also found to be bioactive, exhibiting various anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Itokawa et al., in 1985, established the anticancer activities of ar-turmerone by conducting a bioassay on sarcoma160 cells in mice [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The potential use of β-elemene as an anticancer drug was officially reported for the first time in China in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-09-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>].
