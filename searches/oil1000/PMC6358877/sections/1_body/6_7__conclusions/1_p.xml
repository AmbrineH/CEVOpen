<p class="p">Non-curcuminoids are basically all other biologically active compounds of turmeric excluding curcuminoids. The latter has been well established in the research field for promoting green drug discovery. However, this review attempts to resolute the foundation for non-curcuminoids by highlighting a literature-based summary on their dynamic anticancer potential. The discovery, chemical composition including the structure and physicochemical properties of these bioactive compounds provide a useful scaffold of knowledge about each component. In addition, certain non-curcuminoids have shown similarity in their chemical structures as curcuminoids for example cyclocurcumin and calebin A. Some major non-curcuminoids such as bisacurone, elemene, turmerones, furanodiene, germacrone, curcumol, calebin A and curdione are considered in this review, which help apprehend that, the anticancer activities of these compounds that can be comparable to curcuminoids. Indeed, the alteration in various signaling pathways such as NF-Ä¸B, TNF and inhibition of enzymes such as COX-2, protein kinase, cytokines and MMPs transcription factors as well as blocking cancer cell proliferation at different phases of cell cycle such as G1, G2, M, S to induce apoptosis, are comparable to the cancer fighting mechanism of curcuminoids. Further, modulation of p-glycoprotein in non-curcuminoids could increase the uptake by the cells; help them to act synergistically with curcumin. Moreover, the molecular docking studies of elemene, germacrone, cyclocurcumin have been discussed which gives a thorough knowledge of the most favorable binding sites of these compounds, which reveal that these compounds hold a promising place as an anticancer agent to fight against various cancers. These similarities in structure and mechanism of action prove that non-curcuminoids are equipotent and highly effective as curcuminoids and can be used in combination or alone with the latter. Additionally, both are extracted from turmeric with certain variation in the end process and hence, these compounds provide an added perquisite to be established in the medicinal world.</p>
