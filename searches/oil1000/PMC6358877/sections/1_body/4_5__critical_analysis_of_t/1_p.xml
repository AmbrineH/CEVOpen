<p class="p">There are many studies, which prove the efficiency of non-curcuminoids. A recent study demonstrated that the total extract of turmeric is more superior to curcuminoids alone. This fact was assessed by methylthiazolyldiphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT assay), which concluded that the cell viability or proliferation decreased in cancer cells especially lung cancer cells. Additionally, isobolographic assessment revealed that when total extract of turmeric when used synergistically with cisplatin, the dose of cisplatin used can be reduced than the actual dose to bring similar effect with less toxicity and adverse effect as treatment with cisplatin alone [

Many evidence-based studies have also been initiated since long, which emphasize the therapeutic potential of the components of turmeric. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted for curcumin, which denote the clinical potential of them having a safe uptake of 12 g/day. These clinical studies also claim that curcumin is very efficient in treating various forms of cancer such as colorectal, breast, head, and neck, pancreatic, and so on [

 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, which is still extensively studied and also accredited by the Ministry of Health People’s Republic of China and State Pharmacy of China to be the most beneficial compound for medical purposes, mainly against numerous forms of cancer including non-small cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC), liver, brain, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and so on [

In earlier trials, the safety and efficacy of β-elemene used in combination was validated through controlled, randomized clinical trials. These trials involved around 1467 patients divided into group of two for studying NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Accelerated improvement in the survival and tumor response rate were observed with minimal side effects in patients treated with β-elemene injection as adjunctive for lung cancer in contrast to patient given medication without β-elemene injection [

Another successful investigation was carried on 102 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent chemoradiotherapy and, thereafter, were subjected to surgery. The recurrence rate with usual chemotherapy regimen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was about 60%, decreasing the survival rate. Therefore, this clinical trial with β-elemene treatment increased the survival (overall and progression free) rate and decreased the toxicity level related to synchronous chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil regimen [
