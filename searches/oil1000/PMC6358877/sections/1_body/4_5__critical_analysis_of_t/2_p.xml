<p class="p">Certain ongoing clinical trials are facing efficacy problems due to lack of promised delivery at specific tissue sites, these can be rectified if non-curcuminoids are encapsulated in different vesicles to facilitate target delivery. The combination of turmeric oleoresin (mainly ar-turmerone and 1,8 cineole) with β-cyclodextrin through co-precipitation or kneading method can form inclusion complexes, improved the solubility of turmeric oleoresin, which was determined through phase solubility studies. These complexes can improve the biological activities of non-curcuminoids significantly [

In this way, there are numerous studies, which improve the authentic properties of non-curcuminoids specially the solubility, bioavailability as well as stability and focus on such formulations can be a breakthrough in the clinical trials. Our research team, Aurea Biolabs, took initiative and formulated a novel technique, PNS technology, involving a complete natural turmeric matrix comprising of turmeric water extract, turmeric essential oils, and curcuminoids. In addition, a series of clinical trials were conducted to prove the potency of this matrix to deliver efficiently the most bioavailable form of curcumin to the target site. An open labeled parallel arm comparative study with two other curcumin formulation was conducted. This study engaged 45 healthy male candidates who were given a single dose of 500 mg through oral administration. This comparative study proved the worth of this formulation in contrast to the other two formulations in improving the solubility and bioavailability enormously. To ascertain the claimed high bioavailability of this formulation, a pilot crossover study was undertaken on 12 healthy male adults and the blood samples for curcumin content were analyzed. The results were promising as 10 times more increase in bioavailability was witnessed than curcumin (95% purity) as measured by concentration maximum (C

With the continuous success of these studies, another clinical study was carried as a double-blind, randomized, two-dose, placebo-controlled and three-arm parallel study with 36 rheumatoid arthritis patients to examine the efficacy and safety of highly bioavailable form of curcumin in turmeric matrix fabricated by Aurea Biolabs. Both 250 mg and 500 mg doses of this novel formulation in this study were well tolerated and devoid of adverse effects [

The outcomes of these concurrent studies are promising and help to evaluate that β-elemene is a multifaceted compound which could be significantly beneficial in chemotherapy when treated in combination with other regular supportive medicaments for various cancers such as liver, lungs, brain, and so on, to prolong the survival rate and revamp the quality of life. Indeed, an in-depth knowledge of curcumin-free compounds through these clinical trials help to understand that non-curcuminoids are powerful compounds that have the capability of treating various diseases and can even be more beneficial if impregnated in various formulations revolving liposomes, emulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, and so on. Large-scale trials should be conducted to prove the potency of non-curcuminoid drug delivery formulations, which might be beneficial to assimilate an approval for human use [
