<p class="p">Peptide fragments with different molecular sizes of &gt;5 kDa, 3.5–5 kDa, and &lt;3.5 kDa were obtained after ultrafiltration using a 5 kDa, 3.5 kDa ultrafiltration membrane. The three sections of the solution were separately collected for lyophilization, and the dried peptide was stored at −20°C.</p>
