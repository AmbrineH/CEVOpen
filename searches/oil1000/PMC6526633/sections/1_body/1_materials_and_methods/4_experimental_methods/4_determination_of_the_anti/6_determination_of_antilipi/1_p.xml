<p class="p">Briefly, a sample (5.0 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.0) and added to 0.13 ml of a solution of linoleic acid and 10 ml of 99.5% ethanol. Then, the total volume was adjusted to 25 ml with deionized water. The mixture was incubated in a conical flask with a screw cap at 40°C in a dark room, and the degree of oxidation was evaluated by measuring ferric thiocyanate values. The reaction solution (100 μl) incubated in the linoleic acid model system was mixed with 4.7 ml of 75% ethanol, 0.1 ml of 30% ammonium thiocyanate, and 0.1 ml of 20 mM ferrous chloride solution in 3.5% HCl. After 3 min, the thiocyanate value was measured at 500 nm following color development with FeCl
