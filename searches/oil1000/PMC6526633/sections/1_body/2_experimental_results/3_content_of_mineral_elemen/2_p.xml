 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed contains potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and other elements, of which the highest potassium content is 2,357.71 mg/kg and the lowest calcium content is 121.14 mg/kg. The contents of the four macroelements are K &gt; Na &gt; Mg &gt; Ca in order, which is different in order and much less than those contains in leaves (K, Mg, Ca: 3,562.19, 3,813.44, 17,638.41 mg/kg, respectively). At the same time, microelements such as iron, copper, and zinc were detected. The highest iron content is 36.2 mg/kg. The contents of three microelements are Fe &gt; Zn &gt; Cu in order, which is also different in order and much less than those contains in leaves (Fe, Zn, Cu: 1,274.12, 29.51, 8.41 mg/kg, respectively) (Juhaimi, Ghafoor, Babiker, Matthaus, &amp; Ozcan,

 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds also contain four heavy metal elements of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and tin, which are 0.01, 0.018, 0.015, and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively. These are low in content and are in line with GB2762‐2017 “The national food safety standard, food contaminants limit” (arsenic is limited to 0.5 mg/kg in grains and their products; cadmium and lead are limited to 0.5 and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively; and in nuts and seeds, tin is limited to 250 mg/kg in food).
