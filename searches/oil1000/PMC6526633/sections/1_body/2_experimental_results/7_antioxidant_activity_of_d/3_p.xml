<p class="p">As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, for the peptide fragment with molecular weight &lt;3.5 kDa, the EC

 <sup class="sup">−</sup> scavenging rates were 4.0, 4.2, 5.3, and 4.3 mg/ml, respectively, and were less than the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the peptide fragments of 3.5–5 kDa and &gt;5 kDa, which indicates that their antioxidant activity is superior to the latter. The activity of the lipid antioxidant inhibition rate was a component having a molecular weight of &gt;5 kDa and an EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 5.8 mg/ml. In summary, peptide fragment with the molecular weight &lt;3.5 kDa has the strongest antioxidant capacity.
