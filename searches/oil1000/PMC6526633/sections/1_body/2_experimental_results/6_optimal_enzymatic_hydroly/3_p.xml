<p class="p">As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the DPPH scavenging rate of the five enzymatic hydrolyzates increased gradually with the increase in enzymatic time. After 300 min, the scavenging rate tended to be stable, and the enzymatic hydrolysis was completed at this time. When the flavourzyme was used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of the 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed protein for 300 min at 50°C and pH 6.7, the DPPH scavenging rate was up to 85%. Therefore, this condition was selected as the optimum enzymatic hydrolysis process for 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed protein for subsequent studies.
