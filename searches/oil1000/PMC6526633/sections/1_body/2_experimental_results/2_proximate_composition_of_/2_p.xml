<p class="p">As can be seen from Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, the content of crude protein and crude lipid in Indian 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed is relatively rich, which are 40.34% and 39.12%, respectively. These are very close to those reported in the literature; however, protein is much more than that in 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> leaves (28.73%) (Juhaimi, Ghafoor, Ahmed, Babiker, &amp; Ozcan, 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Compared the content of crude protein and lipid with the well‐recognized peanuts (32.65% and 48.06%) and soybean (41.05% and 21.06%) (Liu &amp; Pan, 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Zheng, Jin, Geng, &amp; Yu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), the crude protein content of Indian 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed is equivalent to soybean, higher than peanut; its crude lipid content is much higher than soybeans, slightly lower than peanuts. It is reported that 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed protein has the effect of water purification and anticoagulation (Aline et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Luciana et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> oil can accelerate the healing of wounds (Duan et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31015-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). It shows that the Indian 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed is not only rich in crude protein and lipid, but also has various effects. We can deeply develop its plant protein and vegetable oil, such as functional foods, feed, water purification, cosmetic raw materials, plant growth promoters, and fungicides.
