 <xref rid="fsn31015-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed contains seven essential amino acids, namely threonine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and lysine, with the total content of 0.824 g/100g, accounting for 25.65% of the total amino acid content. This result is close to the 28.8% of essential amino acids in Liaoning peanuts reported by Shi (Shi, Yu, &amp; Han,

 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds contain seven kinds of hydrophobic amino acids: alanine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, and the total content is 0.834 g/100g. The antioxidant activity of the protein is closely related to its amino acid composition. Peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids can increase their solubility at the water–lipid interface and better interact with free radicals (Zheng, Si, Baseer, Li, &amp; Zhang,
