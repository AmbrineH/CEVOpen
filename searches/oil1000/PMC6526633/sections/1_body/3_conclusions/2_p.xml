 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds are rich in crude protein and crude lipids, with a protein content up to 40.34% and a crude lipids content 39.12%. Its content of macroelements such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium is much higher than other metals, and the K content is 2,537.71 mg/kg. Indian 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds contain seven essential amino acids and seven hydrophobic amino acids, and the hydrophobic amino acids contribute to the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds. The optimum enzymatic conditions were flavourzyme hydrolysis of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed protein for 300 min at 50°C and pH 6.7. &lt;3.5 kDa polypeptide fragment has higher EC

 <sup class="sup">− </sup>scavenging rates than fragments 3.5–5 kDa and &gt;5 kDa, and only the lipid oxidation inhibition rate of &lt;3.5 kDa polypeptide fragment is lower than &gt;5 kDa. Therefore, the &lt;3.5 kDa polypeptide fragment is the strongest antioxidant. It has the potential to be further developed into nutritional products, health products, functional foods, beauty and skin care products, and liver protection drugs.
