 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref>). The LDR increased with increasing levels of NPK, and peaked at 125% RDF. Both MUFA: PUFA, and saturated: unsaturated acid ratios started increasing at the initial levels of NPK up to 75% RDF, and then gradually decreased with further increment of NPK doses (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t012" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 12</xref>). The increase in NPK levels from 50 to 100% RDF lead to significant increase in linoleic: linolenic acid ratios in all tested cultivars in both the years. Omission plots demonstrated some crucial findings, and K omission registered the lowest ODR and LDR, and the highest MUFA: PUFA and linoleic: linolenic acid ratios. Opposite trend was found in case of P omission.
