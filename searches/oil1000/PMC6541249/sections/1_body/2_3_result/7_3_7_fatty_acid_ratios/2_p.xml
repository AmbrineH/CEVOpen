<p class="p">Year effect was found significant on ODR, LDR, MUFA: PUFA, saturated: unsaturated and linoleic: linolenic acid ratios (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref>). The values of ODR and LDR were higher in year 2; however, other fatty acid ratios were greater in year 1. Cultivar effect was also significant for all fatty acid ratios. The cultivar P 3522 showed highest values for MUFA: PUFA, saturated: unsaturated and linoleic: linolenic acid ratios, and lowest values of LDR. Just opposite trend was observed in case of P 3396. Significant interaction (year Ã— cultivar) effect was registered for all fatty acid ratios.
