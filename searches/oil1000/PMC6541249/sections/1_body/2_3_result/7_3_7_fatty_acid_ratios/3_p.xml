<p class="p">The year × levels of NPK, cultivar × levels of NPK and year × cultivar × levels of NPK effect was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) for all fatty acid ratios. The ODR value was significantly higher in P 3522 fertilizer with zero-NPK during both year 1 and year 2. The same cultivar recorded significantly higher values for LDR in year 1 on receiving 125% RDF and it was statistically at par with the values obtained in P 3396 during year 2, when fertilized with 125% RDF, 100% PK and 100% NK, and in Rajkumar receiving 75% RDF during year 2. Similarly, the significantly higher value of MUFA: PUFA ratio was obtained in P 3522 cultivar in year 1; being statistically at par with the values recorded in P 3396 with 100% PK and Rajkumar with 125% RDF during year 2 (

The value of saturated: unsaturated acid ratio was found significantly higher in P 3522 receiving 75% NPK in year 1 and 100% RDF in year 2. Significantly higher value of linoleic: linolenic acid ratio was exhibited by the cultivar P 3522 when fertilized with 100% RDF in both the years (
