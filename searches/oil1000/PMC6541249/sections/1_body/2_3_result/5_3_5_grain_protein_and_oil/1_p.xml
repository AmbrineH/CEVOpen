<p class="p">Quality parameters (grain protein and oil content) were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) influenced by NPK levels (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Irrespective of tested cultivars, application of 125% RDF recorded highest amount of protein content (27.8% more than control). Increase in NPK levels beyond 125% RDF (up to 150% RDF) failed to improve protein content significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05). While oil content of maize hybrids was decreased with NPK application beyond 75% RDF. Significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) reduction in protein content of tested maize grains was observed with NPK omissions, while the grain oil content was reduced significantly with K omission only. Omission of N determined lowest protein content (except Control), 13.4% less than 100% RDF while omission of K caused highest reduction in oil content (except Control), 10.2% less than those obtained with 100% RDF.
