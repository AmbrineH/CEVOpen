 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> also showed increasing trend in K uptake with successive increase in NPK levels up to 125% RDF. Omission of N/ P/ K significantly decreased the K uptake and it was drastically reduced in N limited plots (69.6 and 76.1% less than that obtained with 100% RDF during year 1 and year 2, respectively), followed by K limited plots (6.3 and 25.4% less than that obtained with 100% RDF during year 1 and year 2, respectively) and P limited plots (17.5 and 45.5% less than that obtained with 100% RDF during year 1 and year 2, respectively). Cultivar P 3522 accumulated significantly highest amount of K in grain, and the lowest accumulation was recorded in Rajkumar in both the years of study. Uptake of K in maize grain varied significantly (
