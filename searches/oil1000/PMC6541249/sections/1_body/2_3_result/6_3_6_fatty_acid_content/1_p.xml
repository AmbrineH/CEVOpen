<p class="p">The content of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in maize oil has been presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">9</xref>. The effect of NPK levels on fatty acid content in maize oil was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01). The palmitic acid content was higher with 125% RDF; however, further increase in NPK levels (150% RDF) did not bring significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) variation from the values obtained with 125% RDF (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). The stearic (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>) and arachidic acid (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>) contents were increased with 100 and 125% RDF application, respectively. The linolenic acid content increased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) with increase in NPK levels up to 150% RDF (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref>). Nutrient omission had significance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) in explaining the obvious role of macronutrients in increased or decreased concentration of fatty acid. All the measured fatty acids were limited by K omission, except for palmitic and stearic acid. Such inhibitory effect of K omission on linoleic and arachidic acid content was differed significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) from that of N and P omission.
