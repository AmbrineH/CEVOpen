<p class="p">The interaction among year, cultivar and levels of NPK put forth significant effect on the contents of all fatty acids in maize oil. The palmitic acid content was significantly higher in P 3522 with 75 and 100% NK during year 1 and year 2, respectively. While the cultivar P 3396 recorded significantly higher values of stearic acid content when fertilized with 150% RDF during year 2, closely followed by the concentration in P 3522 during year 1. The cultivar P 3522 had significantly greater concentration of oleic acid when fertilized with 75% RDF in year 1 and it was followed by the concentration in Rajkumar receiving 125% RDF in year 2. The values of linoleic acid content were significantly higher in P3522 receiving zero-NPK in both the years and it was statistically at par with the values obtained in Rajkumar receiving 100% PK in year 2 (

The significantly higher linolenic acid content was exhibited by the cultivar P 3522 when fertilized with 125% RDF in year 1 and it was statistically at par with the values obtained with zero-NPK. The next highest linolenic acid contents were recorded in P 3396 with 100% NK and zero-NPK in year 2. For arachidic acid content, the significantly highest values were obtained in the cultivar P3522 when fertilized with 75% RDF and 100% NP in year 2. The cultivar P 3396 receiving 100% NP also exhibited statistically at par results in year 1. As evident in
