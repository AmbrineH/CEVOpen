<p class="p">The year effect on fatty acid content was significant, except for linoleic acid (
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). In year 2, higher values of stearic, linoleic and arachidic acid, but lower of palmitic and oleic acid was observed as compared to year 1. The cultivar P 3522 registered highest palmitic and arachidic acid content, and lowest linolenic acid. On the other hand, P 3396 recorded highest linolenic acid and lowest palmitic acid content. It is however, noteworthy to mention that the year effect on fatty acid content would have been more prominent with the presence of longer time study.
