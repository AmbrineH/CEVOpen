<p class="p">Uptake of P varied significantly (

 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The cultivar P 3522 accumulated highest amounts of P in grain followed by P3396. Lowest P accumulation in maize grain was recorded in Rajkumar. The NPK application exerted significant influence on P uptake in maize grain. Data presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> also showed increasing trend in P uptake with successive increase in NPK levels up to 125% RDF and it was declined with further increase in NPK level (up to 150% RDF). It is also interesting to note that N omission had far greater impact on P uptake by hybrid maize cultivars, rather than P and K omission. Year × cultivar × levels of NPK interactions exerted significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) effect on grain P uptake. Among all the tested hybrids, irrespective of cropping season, P 3522 accumulated maximum grain P when fertilized with 125% RDF while P 3522 accumulated more grain P during year 1.
