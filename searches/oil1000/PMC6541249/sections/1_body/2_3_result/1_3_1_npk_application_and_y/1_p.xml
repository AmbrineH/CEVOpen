 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) yield loss with highest reduction in N omission followed by K and P. When compared with 100% RDF, grain yield reduction with nutrient omission was 43.9% for N omission, 16.6% for P omission, and 26.9% for K omission. The effect of all other sources of variation, such as year of cultivation and cultivar type, did not show any significant role on the grain yield (
