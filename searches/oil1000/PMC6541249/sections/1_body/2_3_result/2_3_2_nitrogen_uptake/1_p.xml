<p class="p">The N uptake varied significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) due to applied N levels, and it was increased with the increase in N levels up to 125% RDF. Omission of nutrients (N/P/K) showed poor N accumulation in grain of the tested cultivars. Greater reduction in N uptake was recorded with N omission (56.6%) followed by K (25.6%) and P omission (10.1%). However, cultivars showed no significant variation in grain N uptake at crop maturity (
