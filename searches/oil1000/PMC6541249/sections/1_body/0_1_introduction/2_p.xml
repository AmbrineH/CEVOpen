<p class="p">Different agronomic practices have direct and indirect influence on maize oil quality. Fertilizer application is one of the most important factors influencing the composition of fatty acids in oil. The fatty acid composition of grain oil can largely be affected by N management [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Results of previous research work on the effect of NPK fertilization on nutritional quality of the grains have shown that optimum N fertilization decreased the levels of undesirable long-chain fatty acids and increased the linoleic and oleic acid contents [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Fatty acid composition of grain can also be altered with P fertilization [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], and Israel et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] reported an increase in oleic acid concentration with higher P rates. Similarly, Krueger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] recorded higher linolenic acid concentration in soybean seeds with high P fertilization (56 kg P ha

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). Potassium (K) also has a key role in augmenting crop yield and improving quality of the produce [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], but little is known about its influence on corn oil quality. Ahmed et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] confirmed that the increase in K application rate up to 250 kg K
