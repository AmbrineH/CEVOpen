<p class="p">The present study reported the role of macronutrient management in explaining maize yield, nutrient uptake and oil quality. The cultivar P 3396 was superior over other tested cultivars on account of highest oil content and saturated fatty acid content and lowest unsaturated fatty acid contents. The effect of increasing NPK levels was well documented, as it increased saturated fatty acids and decreased unsaturated fatty acid contents in maize oil. However, 100% RDF (200 kg N, 60 kg P
