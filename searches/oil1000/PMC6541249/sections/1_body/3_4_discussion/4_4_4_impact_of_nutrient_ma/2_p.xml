<p class="p">The present study observed significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) year-effect on almost all measured fatty acids, except linoleic acid. Lambert [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] also identified two major factors namely cultivar and environment/year affecting maize oil content and fatty acid composition. Significant effect of environment (especially temperature) on maize oil fatty acid has also been illustrated by previous investigators [

 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In the present study, content of different fatty acids differed significantly. Such results are in good agreement with that observed by Goffman and Bo¨hme [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] and Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In maize oil, palmitic acid shared the major portion (about 12.2 to 13.9%) of saturated fatty acids, oleic acid was the only mono-unsaturated fatty acid (29.0 to 33.7%), and linoleic acid was the highest contributor (47.5 to 50.7%) to poly-unsaturated fatty acid. Based on the above quality attributes, our tested cultivars can be categorized in the group of quality protein maize, as suggested by Sanjeev et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], although the protein, palmitic acid and stearic acid contents were a little lower and linoleic acid content was higher in our tested hybrids.
