<p class="p">In the present experiment, about 64% variation in LDR was explained by ODR values. Such results denote the efficiency of consecutive desaturation systems from oleic to linoleic and from linoleic to finally linolenic acid [

Our findings have shown that increase in NPK rates from 50 to 150% RDF led to increasing linoleic acid content with concurrent lowering of linoleic: linolenic acid ratio. Unexpectedly higher linoleic: linolenic acid ratio was recorded in cultivar P 3396, and it should be modified through efficient breeding management.
