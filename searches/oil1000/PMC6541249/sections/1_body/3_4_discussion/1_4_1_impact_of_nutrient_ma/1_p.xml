<p class="p">Improvement in yield as well as quality of economic part (grain), nutrient uptake and use efficiency are the major indicators for successful implementation of any fertilizer recommendation in maize. In India, plenty of information is available on nutrient uptake pattern in rice-wheat system; however, such type of information is limited in maize, particularly for Eastern India where maize is an emerging crop in this geography. The steady increment of maize grain yield due to better nutrient management is distinct from the previous research findings, both at country level as well as at global scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For instance, Patra et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and Prodhan [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] reported grain yield of maize up to 5 and 6 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> which were more than 1 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> higher than the existing recorded yield. After more than a decade, latest literatures are showing that the yield of hybrid maize could be around 10 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with improved nutrient management practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. All the new maize hybrids used in the present study, due to their ‘stay-green’ nature [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], might have accumulated more post-silking dry matter and resulted in higher grain yield. There was no significant (
