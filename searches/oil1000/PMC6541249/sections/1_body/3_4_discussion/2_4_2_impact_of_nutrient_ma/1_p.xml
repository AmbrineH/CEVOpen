<p class="p">The present study showed the highest grain nutrient uptake in cultivar P 3522, followed by P 3396 and Rajkumar. Dibaba et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], studying the response of maize hybrids to nutrient management, reported significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> â‰¤ 0.05) difference among cultivars in nutrient uptake pattern. However, the variation in grain yield was non-significant among the cultivars. Several other investigators have opined that the genotypic difference in maize is the main factor which determines grain yield and yield attributes [
