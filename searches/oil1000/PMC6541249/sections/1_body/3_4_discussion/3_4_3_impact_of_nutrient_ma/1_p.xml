<p class="p">Both protein and oil content in maize grain were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.01) influenced by NPK levels. Greater amount of protein and oil content was recorded with 125 and 75% RDF, respectively. Significant 
 <italic class="italic">(p</italic> ≤ 0.05) reduction in those quality parameters was observed with nutrient omissions (-N/ -P/ -K), while the poor result was recorded with zero-NPK. Several studies have demonstrated that omission of N/ P/ K leads to significant reduction in protein and oil content [

 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The increase in protein concentration of maize grain with nitrogen supply was earlier confirmed by Tsai et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. They expressed that the increase could be due to preferential deposition of 
 <italic class="italic">zein</italic> over the other endosperm proteins. Besides, exclusion of N, in our experiment, resulted in lower protein content, corroborating with previous finding that N application is essential for maize plant to synthesize amino acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. It has also been reported that NPK applications cause slight improvement ingrain oil concentration [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], but greater oil production per unit area is attributed to increased grain yield. Our findings revealed that K omission registered highest reduction ingrain oil content. Aytac et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] also reported that increase in oil content was greatly affected by K omission than N omission. Similar to the present study, previous studies also reported that the grain protein concentration increases with the increase in P application rate, but oil content decreases [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Our results also showed that protein and oil content in maize grain maintained an inverse relationship (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216939.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). It was also earlier confirmed by Rehman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] that grain protein content increases with each incremental dose of NPK fertilizer, while grain oil content continues to decrease in maize grain due to dilution. However, sacrificing yield to increase oil content will not be economic as the total amount of oil will decrease with less grain yield. This is well highlighted by the control treatment that produced very low yields with high oil content. Therefore, there is a trade-off between yield and protein content compared to oil content in the maize grain. It has been suggested by Chaudhary et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] that protein and oil are chiefly found in endosperm and embryo or germ in maize kernel, respectively. In mature kernel, endosperm accounts for 80–85% of the total weight and contributes 80% to protein, while the embryo or germ accounts for 8–10% of the total weight and contributes 15–20% of protein and 95% of oil. Thus the negative correlation between protein and oil content might have originated from the relative weight distribution of endosperm and germ in mature maize kernel.
