<p class="p">Protein content in maize grain (%) was estimated by multiplying nitrogen content by 6.25 [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Oil content (%) in maize grain was determined by taking grain samples (100 g) from the harvest of each plot. The grains were ground and taken together with solvent (Hexane) washings to a Soxhlet apparatus for extraction of oil at 60Â°C for about 12 hours [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The hexane dissolved in extracted maize oil was then evaporated using a rotary vacuum and boiling water bath, and the oil percentage was determined after a constant weight was obtained.
