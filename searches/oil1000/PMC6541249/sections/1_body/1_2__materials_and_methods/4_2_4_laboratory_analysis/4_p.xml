<p class="p">The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were synthesized according to AOAC 996.06 method [
 <xref rid="pone.0216939.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Briefly, 200 mg of maize oil were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis with the addition of 8% KOH and heated at 80°C for 20 minutes. After cooling the mixture, 20% BF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-methanol solution (source: Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added and warmed for another 20 minutes. The mixture was cooled, extracted with hexane and filtered through 0.22 μm filter for analysis. The fatty acid composition was analyzed by 7890B GC (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with an auto-sampler, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a fused silica capillary Supelcowax 10 column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness) from Supelco (USA). Chromatographic data were recorded and integrated using ChemStation Software (Agilent Technologies, USA). The oven temperature was 170°C, held for 1 min, raised to 200°C at rate of 1°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and increased to 225°C during 5 min and held for 5 min, total runtime was 40 min, while the injector and detector temperature were set at 260°C and 270°C, respectively. The sample volume injected was 1 μL with a split ratio 20:1. The carrier gas (nitrogen) flow rate was 1.0 ml min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Hydrogen and compressed air used for FID were maintained at 275.6 kPa. The identification and quantification were performed by external standard method where five fatty acid standards (source: Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used.
