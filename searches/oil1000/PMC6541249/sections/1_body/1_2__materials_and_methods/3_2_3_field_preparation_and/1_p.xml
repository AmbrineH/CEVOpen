<p class="p">The experimental field was ploughed four times with the help of a tractor followed by a cultivator, and two times with tractor followed by a rotavator. After removing stones and weeds, planking was done to break clods and level the field. The plots were 4 m long and consisted of eight rows, 60 cm apart. There was a 0.5 m path between all of the plots, to eliminate the influence of lateral water movement.</p>
