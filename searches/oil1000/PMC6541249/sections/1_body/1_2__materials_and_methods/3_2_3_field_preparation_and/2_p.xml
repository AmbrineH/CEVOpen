<p class="p">The experiment was designed as strip-plot arrangement for the treatments, assigning three maize hybrids (P 3522, P 3396 and Rajkumar) in the vertical strip and nine fertilizer treatments [50% RDF, 75% RDF, 100% RDF, 125% RDF, 150% RDF, 100% PK (N omission), 100% NK (P omission), 100% NP (K omission) and control (zero-NPK)] in the horizontal strip, with three replications. The 100% RDF was considered as the optimum nutrient treatment. The recommendation from Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)—Indian Institute of Maize Research (IIMR), Punjab, was taken into consideration (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) for this location. Seeds of maize hybrids were sown at 25 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> during last week of November by dibbling 2 seeds at each position at 3–5 cm depth. The distance between the plants in the rows was 30 cm; thus, the plant density was approximately 55,555 plants ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The entire amount of phosphorus (through single super phosphate/SSP), potash (through muriate of potash/MOP, as per treatments) and 40% of the nitrogen (through urea) were broadcasted at final land preparation. The rest amount of the nitrogen was applied in two equal split doses at 40 days after sowing (DAS)/knee-high stage and at 85 DAS/pre-tasseling stage, respectively. During crop growth, weeds were manually controlled two times at 40 and 60 DAS. Lambda Cyhalothrin (Agent plus 5 EC) at 10 ml 15 L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was applied (65 DAS) to get rid of grass hopper attack in first crop season only. The crop was grown under assured irrigation and altogether seven irrigations were provided to the crop during both the year of experimentation. First two irrigations were given at 3 (year 1)-5 (year 2) and 35 (year 1)-40 (year 2) DAS. Next three irrigations were applied from 60 DAS onwards (pre-flowering stage) at 10–15 days interval. Sixth and seventh irrigations were given at 100 (silking stage) and 110 DAS (early grain-filling stage). Total amount of rainfall received during the crop growing season for year 1 and year 2 was 110.4 and 84.7 mm, respectively. For both the years, depth of irrigation during first and second irrigation was 30 and 50 mm, respectively; following that next three irrigations were applied at 60 mm depth, and last two irrigations were applied at the depth of 70 mm. Diesel operated water lifting pump (5 HP) was used for irrigating the crop. Harvesting was done when husks turned yellow, silks got a brownish discoloration, and grains became hard. After dehusking, cobs were sun-dried for 7–8 days for easy removal of grains with hand-sheller.
