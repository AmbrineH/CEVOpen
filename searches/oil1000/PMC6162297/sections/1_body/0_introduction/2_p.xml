<p id="Par3" class="p">Generally, natural gas resources are mainly distributed in dry gas and condensate gas reservoirs. As an essential part of Sinopec (China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation) in China’s hydrocarbon resources, the recovery of condensate gas is still low (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Currently, most of the condensate gas resources that have been discovered in China are distributed in Xinjiang province and offshore, of which saturated condensate content are middle-low

 </sup>. The typical development method is under primary depletion. However, the recovery of condensate gas is only around 40% and some reservoirs have entered middle/late development periods. It is necessary to explore new techniques to improve condensate gas recovery.
