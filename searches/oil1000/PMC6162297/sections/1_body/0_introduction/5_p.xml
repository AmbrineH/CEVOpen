<p id="Par6" class="p">Excessive mixing is a key risk associated with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> EGR as it would result in undesirable contamination of the natural gas asset and/or early breakthrough of the injected CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at the production wells. This risk of excessive mixing of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and natural gas within the reservoir has limited the practice of EGR. At present, rare literature reported the mix phenomena between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and natural gas under reservoir conditions and clearly revealed under what kind of conditions natural gas is not easy to be mixed by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Therefore, finding suitable gas injection conditions is the key to the promotion of EGR in suitable gas fields.
