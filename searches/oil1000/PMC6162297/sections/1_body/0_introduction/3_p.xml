<p id="Par4" class="p">The low recovery is due to complex physical and chemical phase transitions in condensate gas reservoirs. Different from dry gas reservoir, a liquid hydrocarbon phase called condensate is formed when the reservoir pressure around production wells drops below the dew point pressure in gas condensate formations. The liquid accumulates and occupies the pore space that otherwise would be available for gas flow, impeding the gas flow.</p>
