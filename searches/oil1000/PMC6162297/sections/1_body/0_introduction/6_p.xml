<p id="Par7" class="p">Although, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flooding has been discussed in dry gas reservoirs, still, it has complex challenges in condensate reservoirs. One challenge is how to enhance condensate recovery; Another challenge is how to enhance condensate gas recovery. Previous research related to enhancing recovery of condensate gas field by injecting CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has until now focused on boosting condensate recovery. For this reason, the studied fluid of most reservoirs has been high-condensate content. Plenty of studies have been conducted to discuss the physical and chemical processes when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> contact with condensate liquid. These experimental data revealed the possibility of improving condensate by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flooding and can be utilized to validate the numerical studies in modeling tools. For example, JJ Chaback

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can inhibit condensate precipitation and move condensate
 <sub class="sub">.</sub> Their studies indicated that the dew point drops, the liquid-volume percent (liquid saturation) decreases, the compressibility factor falls and the two-phase envelope diagram shrinks with the increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> composition. All these trends showed the positive impact of CO
