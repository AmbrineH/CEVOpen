<p id="Par8" class="p">However, there has been little investigation on how CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mix with condensate gas and whether CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can improve the recovery of condensate gas, despite these numerous studies on mitigating condensate precipitation and enhancing oil recovery by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flooding. In fact, condensate gas reservoirs produce both condensate gas and condensate, and both have high profits. In order to elucidate the possibility of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> EGR in condensate gas reserovirs, a series of experiments and model were used to analyze mixing procedure when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> contact with condensate gas. The focus of this research is to demonstrate under what kind of conditions in terms of pressure, temperature and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas are not easily mixed into one phase.
