 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mix with condensate gas, we set up a non-equilibrium experiment with high-pressure and high-temperature laboratory. A schematic of the experimental setup is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. A mercury-free DBR (Donald B. Robinson Company) PVT cell was used to study the phase behavior properties of the fluid samples. A transparent cylinder sapphire cell with a volume of approximately 150 ml and a maximum working pressure of 70 MPa at 200 °C was one of the most important parts of the experimental system. A half cone piston in cylinder cell can closely calibrate the fluid change in the experiment. The test fluid sample was placed in the cell by pushing a Ruska pump connected to the top of the cell. The volume of the injected sample was monitored by a cathetometer. Incandescent lamp, which was filled with hydrogen and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, was placed at the opposite side of the sapphire cell to observe the change of the transmittance of the system. Fluid phase change in PVT cell was recorded via the computer video acquisition camera.
