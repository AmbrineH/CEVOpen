<p id="Par15" class="p">When the temperature was kept constant, the pressure search method was used to determine the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> opalescence existence conditions. The first step was to pump CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into sapphire cell at reservoir temperature (132.18 °C) and pressure (43.5 MPa). Then, pressure reduced from 43.5 MPa to 18 MPa, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> status in sapphire cell was recorded every 3 minutes. To confirm the accuracy of the onset and end of the pressure of appearance and disappearance of opalescence CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, three repetitive tests by increasing and decreasing the pressure around the appearance and disappearance of opalescence CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were preformed. Similar to the pressure search method, the temperature search method was used.
