<p id="Par12" class="p">Usually, it is difficult to survey the mixing process of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas in experiments through visual observation, because CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas are both transparent. Inspired from the critical opalescence of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, critical opalescence is used to distinguish CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from condensate gas in these experiments. Critical opalescence is a striking light scattering phenomenon, which was elegantly explained by Einstein. In the critical region the light scattering is so large that the substance appears milky white in reflected light and brownish dark in transmitted light. The phenomenon arises from the large fluctuations in the critical region of the substance

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> existed in high temperature and high pressure, which is far away from critical pressure and temperature.
