<p id="Par26" class="p">To perform a detailed assessment of the spatial distribution of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas and discuss interface property, the diffusion test was carried out with the composition analysis of 10 equal division subdomains based on pressure search experiment. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> shows the composition of different subdomains in Sapphire cell containing condensate gas and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> when pressure is 25 MPa and temperature is 132.18 °C, after mix experiment was stood still for 30 minutes. The gas was discharged and tested with cathetometer. Composition shows that domain 1–3 is primarily composed of condensate gas. Domain 4 to 6 see a dramatic rise of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content rise and changed from 3.519 to 86%; a considerable decrease of the C
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>~C
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> content occurs from 5.39% to 1.95%; as for the domain 6 to 9, the content of compositions remain still. Thus, compared with the composition of different domains, the interface between condensate gas and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> locate at domain 4–5, which means that the composition of interface may be a compound of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas. Based on the definition

 </sup>, the layer between condensate gas and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is also called interface. Aforementioned conclusion needs further investigation.
