<p id="Par22" class="p">The unequilirium experiment of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas snapshots revealed that obvious phase behavior change between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas at 25Mpa and 132.18 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). First the pure CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the PVT cell, with weak background light source, was chosen as the basic condition before injecting condensate gas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(1)</xref>). At this point, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> stays in opalescence state with high density. After starting to inject condensate gas from the top of PVT cell, condensate gas looks like bright light appears at the top of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which shows injected condensate gas has good transmittance. There is no obvious difference of the phase and physical characteristic between condensate gas and supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(2 and 3)</xref>). After keeping injecting condensate gas from the top of PVT cell, there is convection diffusion and mass transfer between condensate gas and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. As condensate gas was injected from the top continually, the layer between two fluids with dark color appears. Similar to the phenomena near critical region reported in literature

 </sup>, even temperature and pressure far away from critical point, these domains are dynamic and fluctuate strongly when the layer is between two fluids; we capture them immobilized during the transfer process(Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(4 and 5)</xref>). After keeping injecting condensate gas from the top of PVT cell, the layer between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas becomes clear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(6~10)</xref>). Continuing injecting condensate gas from the top of sapphire cell, the layer between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate gas shrinks and then contracts to a bright yellow opaque. There exists transparent uniform condensate gas on the top and transparent supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> phase at the bottom (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(11 and 12)</xref>).
