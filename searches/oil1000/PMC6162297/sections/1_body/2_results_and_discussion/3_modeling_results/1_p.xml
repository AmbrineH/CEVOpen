 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration which can yield interface phenomena is a very labor intensive and time consuming process, especially when the components differ greatly from different gas fields. A possible solution to this problem is to develop a new approach to describe experimental data that would allow construction phase transition interface out of a limited data set. Such approach will make it possible to obtain not only reliable information on properties of mixtures, but also data on composition.
