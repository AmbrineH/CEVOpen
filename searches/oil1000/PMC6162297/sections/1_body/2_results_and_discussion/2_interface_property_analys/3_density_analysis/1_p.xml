<p id="Par31" class="p">The density of interface was calculated based on molar percentage of the condensate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. At 132 °C, the density of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, condensate gas and interface were plotted in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>. When the pressure is 24.97 MPa, there is a stable density difference among three phases. With the pressure decreasing, the density of interface is closer to the density of supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. When the pressure is below 10 MPa, the densities of interface and condensate gas are exactly the same. Thus, in order to form a stable interface, it is considered that there is a certain density difference between the three phases.
