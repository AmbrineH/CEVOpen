<p id="Par30" class="p">The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mole percentage and interfacial tension were plotted for driving simulation of condensate. Dimensionless distance 0.375 is the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> displacement front of in the displacement process of condensate, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. At the displacement front of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, there is low interfacial tension between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate, which is about 0.6 dyn/cm, when the pressure is 25 MPa. With the pressure decreasing, the interfacial tension between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and condensate increases gradually (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Therefore, when the temperature is 132.18 °C and the pressure is 25 MPa, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can mix with condensate and forms interface. But with the decrease of pressure, condensate in the interface is separated, and the interface begins to be unstable.
