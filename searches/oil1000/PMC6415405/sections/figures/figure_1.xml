  <p class="p">Schematic of the lifecycle of 
   <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> grown in glucose media. Images of inverted fluorescence microscopy with 400× magnification present stages of biofilm development. In stage I, planktonic bacteria attach to a solid surface. In stage II, the attachment becomes irreversible. Stage III elucidates the microcolony foundation. Stage IV illustrates the biofilm maturation and growth of the three-dimensional bacterial sanctuaries. In stage V, dispersion occurs and free planktonic cells are released from the cluster biofilm to colonize new locations. Images characterize a 250 × 250 μm
