  <p class="p">Representative examples of plasma polymerization of plant secondary metabolites, where retention of the antimicrobial activity was achieved. As soon as a bioactive secondary plant metabolite (or an essential oil) is placed under low pressure, the molecules gain sufficient kinetic energy to separate and begin independently moving towards the glow region within the deposition chamber. Exposure of the molecules to the highly reactive plasma initiates various chemical reactions, such as bonds fragmentation, oligomerization, and polymerization. At the chosen plasma parameters, the process allows for the preservation of active functional groups of PSMs within the cross-linked solid polymeric films. Direct observations of SEM demonstrated the powerful antimicrobial performance of geranium, terpenen-4-ol, and carvone films in contact with different pathogens. The antimicrobial activities of these films included antibiofouling effects and/or bactericidal actions (e.g., membrane distortion, pores creation, and membrane damage).
