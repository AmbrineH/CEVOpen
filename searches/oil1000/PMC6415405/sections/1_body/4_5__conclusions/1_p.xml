<p class="p">A better understanding of the way to preserve/retain the bioactivity of essential oils within a thin film is critical for the development of a wide range of bactericidal coatings suitable for medical devices. The aforementioned polymer materials that were derived from renewable resources present a promising approach toward producing antimicrobial and biocompatible materials and tissue contact coatings. However, information on the long-term performance of plasma polymerized PSMs thin films requires further exploration. Also, although a small number of systematic studies showed promising antimicrobial activity using encapsulating essential oils, further research in this direction is warranted.</p>
