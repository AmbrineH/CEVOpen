<p class="p">As mentioned previously, typical plasma polymerization of PSMs (continuous mode) yields the fragmentation of large quantities of precursor molecules. The random recombination of fragments, radicals, and atoms renders the chemical structure and configuration completely irregular. In fact, the density of desired functional groups remain relatively insufficient even if the used fabrication power is low. Pulsed-plasma polymerization can address this issue. This technique offers a sequence of on-periods (a few μs-long periods during which fragmentation takes place) and off-periods (μs to ms-long periods during which recombination and polymerization occurs), where the resultant polymer should consist of more chemically regular structures than those of the continuous mode [
 <xref rid="B191-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>]. The idea is to further reduce the degree of dissociation/fragmentation of the precursor molecules, and hence the off-period reactions contributing more non-fragmented functionalities into the formed polymer. To date, the pulsed-plasma polymerization has not been used for the synthesis of antibacterial surfaces from PSMs. We highly encourage researchers to explore and expand the usage of the pulsed-plasma method, where the optimization of the desired functionality will essentially include the increasing/decreasing the off-period in pulsed polymerization.
