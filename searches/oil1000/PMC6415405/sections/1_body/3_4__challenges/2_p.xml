<p class="p">Another concern comes from the varying properties of the renewable precursor. It is well documented that essential oil composition is very complex and depends on multiple interacting factors. In addition, De Masi et al. (2006) reported that the chemical compounds of essential oils were found to be extremely variable in various cultivars/genotypes of the same plant species and they these differences were not necessarily correlated with genetic relationships [
