 <xref rid="B186-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. A major issue of plasma techniques is the constancy of the result, particularly across different plasma systems, due to differences in processing parameters (e.g., power, pressure, temperature, flow rate, and tube geometry). For example, changes in the design of plasma equipment can affect the flow dynamics of vapors through the system, and the profile of the plasma discharge zone, which could potentially alter the nature, homogeneity, and density of the gas phase species inside the reactor. Indeed, this problem becomes more obvious during the fabrication of functional coatings from PSMs, where retention of certain chemical moieties is essential [

To minimize the variation of films produced across different plasma systems, a scaling factor route can be applied that takes into account both the actual energy consumed in the active plasma field, and the differences in the geometry of the utilized reactors [
