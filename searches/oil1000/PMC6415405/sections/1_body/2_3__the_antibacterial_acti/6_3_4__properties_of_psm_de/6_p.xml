<p class="p">Given their potential application as an antibacterial coating for implants, the cytocompatibility of PP-PSMs was examined for several types of mammalian cells. A study that tested the biocompatibility of coatings fabricated from various oils (e.g., limonene, tea tree, lavender, and eucalyptus) at different deposition powers showed minimum toxic effects. After being implanted in mice for 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days, all PP-PSM films were demonstrated to be biocompatible. While in most cases, these coatings did not produce an unwanted host or material response, in a number of cases mice sinus formation was observed, however, it was deemed not significant [

The biocompatibility of polymer films is a property that should be addressed carefully for protective coatings in medical applications, in particular for implantable devices, since the film surface directly interfaces with various bio-components including blood, proteins, cells, and tissue growth. Hence, non-biocompatible coatings may lead to failure, toxic responses, abnormal cell/tissue responses, and device degradation.
