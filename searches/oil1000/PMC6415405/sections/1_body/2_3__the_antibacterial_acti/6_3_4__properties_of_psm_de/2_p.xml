<p class="p">As a general trend observed in PP-PSMs, polymers deposited at a higher input power are typically less susceptible to mechanical deformation. This trend is owing to an increase in the degree of cross-linking correlated with higher input power, and hence, films are likely to be more stable and less susceptible to wear [
 <xref rid="B156-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. Highly cross-linked polymers are expressively more stiff and dense compared to conventional polymers (amorphous or crystalline arrangements). This is related to the vibrational movement of the carbon backbone of the polymeric structure that is constrained by the presence of a multiple covalent bonds between polymer chains [
