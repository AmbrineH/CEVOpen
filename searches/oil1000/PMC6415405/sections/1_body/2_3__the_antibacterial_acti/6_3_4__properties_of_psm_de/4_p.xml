<p class="p">A large number of plasma polymers developed from PSMs were reported to have favorable optical properties. Although optical properties were affected by processing parameters during film deposition, PP-PSMs were found to be optically transparent in the visible region and have high absorption in the infrared region. The refractive index and extinction coefficient were in the range of 1.5 and 0.001 (at 500 nm), respectively [
