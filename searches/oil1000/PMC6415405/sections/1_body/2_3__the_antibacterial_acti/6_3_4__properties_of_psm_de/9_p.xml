<p class="p">Generally, it is accepted that the chemical composition of essential oils varies by plant health, growth stage, climate, edaphic factors, and harvest time. On the other hand, the degradation kinetics of these oils, due to external factors (e.g., temperature, light, and atmospheric oxygen exposure, presence of impurities), should be thoroughly taken into account [
 <xref rid="B175-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>]. For example, pure cinnamaldehyde was reported to decompose to benzaldehyde at temperatures approaching 60 °C. But, once it combined with eugenol or cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamaldehyde remained stable at 200 °C [

Compounds rich in allylic hydrogen atoms could be potential targets for autoxidation, where hydrogen atom abstraction is giving rise to resonance-stabilized radicals, which are highly preferable due to their lower activation energy [
 <xref rid="B177-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Furthermore, essential oil components are generally known to easily convert into each other (through processes such as isomerization, oxidation, cyclization, or dehydrogenation reactions), because of their structural relationship within the same chemical group [
