<p class="p">For a successful polymeric antibacterial coating to satisfy the requirements of biomedical applications, the material should possess a range of specific biological, physical, and chemical properties. Films fabricated from PSMs display a wide range of desired properties, including optical transparency, moderate hydrophilicity, relatively high degradation temperature, low post-annealing retention, and good biocompatibility, forming simple, useful, and versatile bioactive coatings. Hence, a brief description of some important physico-chemical characteristics of PP-PSMs fabricated at a low input power (below 100 W) is provided below.</p>
