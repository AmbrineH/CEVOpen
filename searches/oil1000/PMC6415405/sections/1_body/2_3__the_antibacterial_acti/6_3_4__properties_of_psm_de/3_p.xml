 <xref rid="B163-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>]. The uniformity indicates that polymerization reactions occurred on the surface of the substrate in preference to the gas phase. Moreover, ultra-smooth surfaces (with an average roughness of less than 1 nm) were attained for plasma polymerization of various PSMs, which is a particularly significant factor that may influence the initial microbial adhesion [

 <xref rid="B165-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. It is worth to mention that the properties of the surface of plasma polymerized films make them highly susceptible to growth conditions, especially the input power, where more energetic ions can cause more surface bombardment and etching. Furthermore, the chosen precursor plays an important role in determining the overall surface properties, since to a degree, it defines the chemical functionalities and determines the quantities of free radicals in the plasma system [
