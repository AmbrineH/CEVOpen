<p class="p">In general, PP-PSMs were moderately hydrophilic, with values of contact angles ranging from ~50° to 80°. The wetting characteristics were defined largely by plasma conditions and the chemistry of the chosen precursor. For example, improved hydrophobicity of the surface was observed for films fabricated from γ-terpinene when increasing the deposition RF power from 61.0° (10 W) to 80.7° (75 W). This polymer showed strong electron donor and negligible electron acceptor behavior [
