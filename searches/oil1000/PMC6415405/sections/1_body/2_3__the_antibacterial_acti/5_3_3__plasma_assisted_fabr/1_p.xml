<p class="p">Among fabrication techniques, cold plasma polymerization is a multipurpose approach that is a relatively fast and low-cost method for fabricating coatings from a wide array of natural precursors, including those that do not usually polymerize by conventional methods, and do not require further chemical or physical processing (e.g., annealing and catalysts) [

From a processing point of view, many PSMs are compatible with plasma polymerization, which is in essence a chemical vapor deposition process enhanced by the catalytic activity of plasma, because they are highly volatile at room temperature no external heat or carrier gas are required to deliver the precursor macromolecules to the fabrication zone.
