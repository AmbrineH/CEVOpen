<p class="p">A number of attempts have been made to manufacture antibacterial surfaces, based on plasma polymerization of essential oils, where antibacterial performance is based only on the natural bioactivity of the polymerized surfaces, in the absence of synthetic additives, inorganic nanoparticles, or conventional antibiotics. Using this information, we strongly encourage the reader to further research this rapidly growing and highly-promising arena. Here, we highlight the successful manufacturing of antimicrobial coatings from different PSMs using the cold plasma polymerization technique.</p>
