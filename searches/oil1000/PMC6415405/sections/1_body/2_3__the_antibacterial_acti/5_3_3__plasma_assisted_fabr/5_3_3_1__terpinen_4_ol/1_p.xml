<p class="p">Terpinen-4-ol is a monocyclic terpene alcohol that is an active component of tea tree oil. Terpinen-4-ol has demonstrated powerful antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B135-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. Upon interaction with microorganisms, cyclic terpene hydrocarbons have been shown to accumulate in the cell membrane. This disturbs membrane integrity, triggering an increased passive flux of protons through the membrane and dissipation of the proton motive force [
 <xref rid="B136-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. Bazaka et al. (2011) prepared plasma polymerized coatings derived from terpinen-4-ol at various input power levels, showing a considerable potential in minimizing bacterial attachment and metabolic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>. Fabrication at a low input power level, 10 W, resulted in a partial retention of biologically-active groups of the original precursor, which led to significant antimicrobial and antibiofouling activities of the terpenol-derived coatings [
 <xref rid="B137-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Confocal laser scanning microscopy evidently showed that around 90% of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> cells retained on the films of the 10 W substrata were non-viable, in comparison to that retained on the surface of 25 W films [

 <xref rid="B139-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>]. However, when fabricated at higher input power (25 W), these films lost their biocidal activity, and promoted adhesion and proliferation of tested bacterial cells and biofilm development. In a recent report, the decrease in antibacterial activity with increasing radio frequency (RF) energy was also observed in the plasma polymerization of polyterpenol films [
