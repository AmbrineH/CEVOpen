<p class="p">Carvone is found in various essential oils, such as caraway, spearmint, and dill. This PSM has shown a variety of antiproliferative effects with regards to microbial cells; likely due to the presence of a monoterpene group in its structure [

 <xref rid="B142-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. In addition, carvone and its related compounds were shown to be potential chemopreventive agents, due to their ability to induce increased activity of detoxifying enzymes. The α,β-unsaturated ketone system in carvone is generally expected to be responsible for the high enzyme-inducing action [
 <xref rid="B143-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. Recently, Chan et al., (2016) fabricated polymer coatings resultant from plasma polymerization of carvone [
 <xref rid="B144-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. At an input power of 10 W, carvone polymerized coatings demonstrated almost equal antimicrobial performance against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (86% decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 84% reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>), with no cytotoxic effect towards primary human endothelial cells. In addition, these coatings were smooth, highly cross-linked hydrocarbons, with low fractions of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amine-amide functionalities. Although the carvone surfaces reduce bacterial adhesion, it was observed that some cells were damaged and died after attaching to the surface. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images clearly exhibited membrane distortion, pore creation, and membrane rupture of microorganisms attached on the surface of plasma polymers of carvone.
