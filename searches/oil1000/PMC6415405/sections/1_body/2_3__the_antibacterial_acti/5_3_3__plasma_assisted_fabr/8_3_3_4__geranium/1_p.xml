 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The input RF power, in particular, played a substantial role in controlling the surface biochemistry and extensively enhanced the biocidal activity of the fabricated coatings. Films deposited at 10 W caused a significant decrease in the number of cells, biovolume, and biofilm thickness. In contrast, there was no significant change in the bacterial colonization between films fabricated at 50 W and an unmodified glass control. In addition to their biological activities, geranium polymer films showed several advantages, including low density, uniform coverage, good adhesion, and considerable physical stability [
