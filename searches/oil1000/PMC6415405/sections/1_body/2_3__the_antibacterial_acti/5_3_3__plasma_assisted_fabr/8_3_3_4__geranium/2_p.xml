<p class="p">Despite the fact that the mechanism by which the deactivation process takes place is not fully understood, the attractive antibacterial performance of PP-PSMs surfaces indicate that the original active chemistry of the oils are partially retained within the structure of the fabricated films. Undeniably, plasma parameters are the key factors that determine the extent of retention of biological functionality. The degree of precursor fragmentation is directly related to the amount of applied energy (RF power). For example, during the polymerization of geranium oil and terpinen-4-ol, a slight increase in the input power resulted in the failure to preserve the desired functional groups within the polymer. One reason for this loss of bactericidal activity could be the complete dissociation of the precursor functionalities upon plasma exposure. Furthermore, these polymerized films demonstrated a wide range of functional groups in their structure, such as primarily methyl/methylene functionalities, as well as hydroxyl, alkene, and carbonyl groups. The hydroxyl group particularly is broadly accepted to be an antimicrobial agent of polymer surfaces. It was previously reported that

It is well known that surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, free energy, and architecture of polymer films have the potential to significantly influence the final antibacterial outcome. The synergistic effects of these parameters may determine the inhibition of bacterial attachment and proliferation.
