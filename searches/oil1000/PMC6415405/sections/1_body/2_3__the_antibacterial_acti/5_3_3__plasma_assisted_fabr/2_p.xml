<p class="p">Introduction of PSMs molecules, in vapor phase, into a highly reactive plasma field triggers a wide range of reactions including fragmentation, oligomerization, rearrangement, and polymerization. The degree of dissociation is highly dependent on the amount of energy provided into the plasma system and the pressure in the chamber. Fragmentation is initiated by active electrons rather than thermal excitation or chemical reactions, creating a unique mixture of chemically diverse species (e.g., unsaturated bonds, ions, neutrals, and free radicals), which may not be reachable under other conditions [
 <xref rid="B129-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. It is believed that weakly ionized plasma and relatively low substrate temperature during deposition promotes condensation and adsorption of non-excited species, which help to increase the proportion of non/partially-fragmented precursor molecules on the substrate [
 <xref rid="B130-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. The recombination of the reactive species and precursor molecules may lead to the formation of the organic thin layer (polymer) on the surface of a given substrate. Due to the diversity of functional groups and reactive species, the polymer can be formed in several ways, involving free-radicals and induced-polymerization of fragments containing unsaturated carbonâ€“carbon bonds; recombination fragment/recombination is initiated by the plasma-generated and surface-attached reactive ions [
 <xref rid="B131-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. The formed polymer is often highly branched and highly cross-linked (amorphous), comprising large quantities of trapped free radicals in its structure [
