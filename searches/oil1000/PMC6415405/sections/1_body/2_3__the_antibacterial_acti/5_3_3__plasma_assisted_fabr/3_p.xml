<p class="p">A large number of species that exists in the discharge (e.g., ions, electrons, stable molecules, radicals, and photons) can react with each other and the forming chains through a range of interaction mechanisms, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00515-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The complexity of the process of PSM plasma makes the evaluation of each specific reaction, along with the prediction of material properties, very challenging. In some cases, few specific reactions can dominate the formation of the film, especially at low input power. Thus, it is rational to propose that films fabricated from PSMs, using plasma under specific deposition conditions (e.g., specific input power, frequency, flow rate, and temperature), could retain some/most of the functional groups of the original PSMs within the bioactive three-dimensional solid film. In addition, the unfragmented precursor molecules trapped within the polymer during the fabrication may elute over time, acting as a drug release coating, with the capacity to retard microbial attachment and biofilm development on the surface [
