<p class="p">Even though synthetic antibiotics have been the best weapon for eradicating microbial infections since the arrival of penicillin, the overuse of these medications is gradually rendering them ineffective. It is anticipated that if new strategies are not developed soon, medical treatments could retreat to the era where slight injuries and common infections develop into a serious medical problems. One promising strategy has been inspired by the inherent bioactivity of plant secondary metabolites [

In the past few decades, the progress in the synthesis of nanoscale materials, in particular plasma-assisted fabrication provides the means to retain the antimicrobial activities of PSMs within bioactive coatings. This family of techniques is compatible with PSMs, and offers several advantages such as being an environmentally friendly, versatile, and low-cost technology (discussed further in this article).
