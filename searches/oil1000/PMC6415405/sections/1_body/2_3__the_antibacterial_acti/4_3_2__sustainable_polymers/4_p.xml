<p class="p">Encapsulation of oils has been developed as one such technology that has great potential to improve the physical stability of the active components, protecting them from degradation due to environmental aspects (e.g., oxygen, light, moisture, and pH) [
 <xref rid="B119-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. Among the nanometric encapsulation structures currently being used, nanoemulsions are mainly utilized due to the possibility of formulation with natural components and the compatibility with industrially scalable manufacturing processes by high pressure homogenization [
 <xref rid="B120-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Nanoemulsions are defined as emulsions with ultra-small droplet sizes of approximately 100 nm. At this scale, there is a potential of enhancing physico-chemical properties and stability of the active compound. In addition, the oil bioactivity can be considerably increased, since significant increases in the surface area per unit of mass can be achieved, improving the passive mechanisms of cell absorption, which again allows for the reduction of the oil quantity required to ensure antimicrobial action [
 <xref rid="B121-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. The encapsulated essential oils are promising antimicrobial agents for biodegradable/edible coatings in food packaging industries to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B122-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. It has been reported that the encapsulation in nanoemulsion formulation of a terpenes mixture and limonene increased the antimicrobial performance of the pure compounds against various microorganisms such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, through increases of transport mechanisms in the membrane of the target cell [
 <xref rid="B120-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Mohammadi et al., (2015) also encapsulated 
 <italic class="italic">Zataria multiflora</italic> essential oil in chitosan nanoparticles (average size of 125â€“175 nm) and reported a controlled and sustained release of essential oil for 40 days, along with a superior antifungal performance in comparison with the un-encapsulated oil [
 <xref rid="B123-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. Moreover, films with 1.5% nanocomposite marjoram oil diminished the numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> populations with respect to the control of up to 4.52, 5.80, and 6.33 log, respectively [
 <xref rid="B124-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Similarly, introduction of carvacrol nanoemulsions into modified chitosan have led to the development of a bioactive film, which was active against Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria [
