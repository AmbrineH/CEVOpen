<p class="p">The ecological concerns of current petroleum processing, along with the economic recession, depleting reserves, and political aspects, have led to increased interest in the production of sustainable polymers derived from renewable resources [
 <xref rid="B100-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. These eco-friendly polymers can be derived from a wide range of possible precursor materials, including oxygen-rich monomers (e.g., carboxylic acids), hydrocarbon-rich monomers (fatty acids, terpenes, and vegetable oils), and non-hydrocarbon monomers (carbon dioxide) [
 <xref rid="B102-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. So far, polymers derived from essential oils, vegetable oils, bio-ethanol, cellulose, fats, resins, naturally occurring polysaccharides, microbial syntheses, and other natural ingredients have been widely used for a variety of applications [
 <xref rid="B103-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. Essential oils, in particular, are renewable in nature, relatively inexpensive, available in commercial quantities, and display minimal toxicity compared to many conventionally-used precursors, which make them an appropriate precursor for “green” functional materials. Among them, terpenes (major components in a large number of essential oils) have received considerable attention. Their structure contains one or more carbon–carbon double bonds, showing a carbon skeleton of isoprene. The abundance of double bonds allows for cationic and radical polymerization of terpenes, along with epoxidation as a path to biodegradable oxygenated polymers [
 <xref rid="B109-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. Cationic polymerization has been generally accepted to be the most appropriate kind of chain reaction for these monomers [
 <xref rid="B110-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. However, essential oils have not been widely applied to the production of bioactive polymers due to limitations associated with fabrication systems and oil properties [
 <xref rid="B111-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="B112-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. These limitations include challenges in controlling the surface chemistry and morphology of the synthesized materials, and solubility and/or volatility of the natural monomers.
