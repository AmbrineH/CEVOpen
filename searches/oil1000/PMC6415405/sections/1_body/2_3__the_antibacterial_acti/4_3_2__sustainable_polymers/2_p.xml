<p class="p">Recent technological advances in the field of controlled polymerization, catalysis, nanoencapsulation, and effective organic functionalization, give great potential for the application of essential oils in manufacturing of sustainable polymers with innovative designs and characteristics. This allows the fabrication of organic films with good control over film thickness, physico-chemical properties, and, importantly, biological functionality. For instance, it was possible to successfully engineer antibacterial UV-cured networks by using a thiol-ene route with covalent immobilization of natural terpenes (linalool and a trithiol) as antibacterial agents, without employing any organic solvent. These bio-based materials exhibited attractive thermal properties, were not affected by water penetration under high moisture conditions, and displayed strong inhibition of microorganisms [

Chen et al., (2012) developed the reversible transfer polymerization approach to design a series of cationic rosin-containing methacrylate bioactive-copolymers. The antibacterial activities of these rosin-containing copolymers were found to be dependent on both the degree of quaternization of the rosin group, the molecular weight of copolymers, and the conformation of hydrophobic group [
