<p class="p">Several studies have been carried out in order to incorporate active essential oils into selected polymers through applying emulsification or homogenization methods, where ultra-fine emulsions of oils are formed containing polymer at the continuous aqueous phase. Upon drying, lipid droplets remain incorporated into the polymer structure. The releasing rate of the embedded-oils from films is subject to multiple factors, such as electrostatic interactions between the oil and the polymer chains, osmosis, structural variations induced by the presence of the oil, as well as environmental circumstances [

Remarkably, a small fraction of an incorporated essential oil within a polymer structure is sufficient to achieve the desired antimicrobial properties. For example, quince seed mucilage films containing a low percentage (1.5–2%) of oregano essential oil were reported to be very effective against several microorganisms, including
