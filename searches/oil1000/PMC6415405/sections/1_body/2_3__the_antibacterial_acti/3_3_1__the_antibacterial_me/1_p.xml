<p class="p">The antibacterial action of PSMs (in their liquid form) is complex and not yet fully understood; it potentially involves several mechanisms, as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00515-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. A number of researchers have proposed that the hydrophobic nature of PSMs allows them to accumulate and perturb the structure and function of lipids of the microbial cell membrane, disturbing biological function, and causing the failure of chemiosmotic control, thus rendering the membrane more permeable [
 <xref rid="B75-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. An increase in membrane fluidity and permeability results in membrane expansion and the damage of membrane-embedded proteins which triggers inhibition of the respiration system and alteration of ion transport activities of bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="B88-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. For example, carvacrol oil was reported to make the cell membrane permeable to K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, consequently dissipating the proton motive force and inhibiting ATP production [
 <xref rid="B89-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Similarly, menthol and citronellol cause an expansion of the cell membrane, leading to the passive diffusion of ions between the stretched phospholipids [
 <xref rid="B69-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Ultee and Smid (2001) hypothesized that during exposure to PSMs, the driving force for the optimal secretion of the toxin (ATP or the proton motive force) is not sufficient, causing accumulation of the toxin inside the cell, which in turn inhibits normal microbial metabolism [
 <xref rid="B90-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Some active PSMs are capable to coagulate the microbial cytoplasm, leading to cell inactivation [
 <xref rid="B91-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. For example, it has been observed that coagulated materials (related to denatured membranes, cytoplasmic constituents, and proteins) were formed outside of the bacterial body when cells (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>) were grown in the presence of tea tree oil. These coagulates were released through microscopic holes produced in the cell wall as a result of the interaction with the oil [
