<p class="p">The antimicrobial performance of PSMs is linked to their chemical structure, particularly the presence of –OH functional groups [
 <xref rid="B94-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Each compound may reveal a different biocidal mechanism toward microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B69-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The bioactivity of several active oils is associated with the presence of phenolic groups. For example, the antimicrobial efficacy of clove, thyme, and oregano oils is related to the presence of phenol-containing eugenol, thymol, and carvacrol, respectively [
 <xref rid="B95-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. However, other findings indicate that the components present in high quantities in the oil are not necessarily responsible for the entire biological activity of a PSM. The antibacterial performance of these complex mixtures relies on a variety of synergistic effects of different sub-components in the oil. Furthermore, it can also be attributed to the presence of other components that may be effective even in small quantities [

 <xref rid="B97-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. In the case of essential oils containing a high percentage of phenolic compounds (e.g., carvacrol, thymol), it can be assumed that their bactericidal action would be similar to other phenolic groups, e.g., by way of the disturbance of the membrane, disorder the proton motive force, electron flow, and coagulation of cell contents [
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. In the case of complex mixtures, where numerous active molecules are present, potential synergistic and antagonistic influences, as well as minor compounds that can have an important contribution to the oil’s activity, need to be considered [

 <xref rid="B98-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. It is important to state that the biocidal mechanisms of PSMs are dissimilar from currently used synthetic antibiotics, which should minimize the likelihood of the development of microbial cross-drug resistance [
