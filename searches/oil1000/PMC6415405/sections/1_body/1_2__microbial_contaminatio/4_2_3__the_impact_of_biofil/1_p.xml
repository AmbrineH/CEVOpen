<p class="p">Microbial infections related to bacterial attachment and biofilm formation have been detected on various medical devices including prosthetic heart valves, orthopedic implants, intravascular catheters, artificial hearts, left ventricular assist devices, cardiac pacemakers, vascular prostheses, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, urinary catheters, ocular prostheses, contact lenses, and intrauterine contraceptive devices [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The three most common device-related infections are central line-associated bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Foley catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Studies have shown that 60â€“70% of nosocomial infections are associated with some type of an implanted medical device [
 <xref rid="B54-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. More specifically, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA reported that of the infections in medical devices, 32% are urinary tract infections, 22% are surgical site infections, 15% can be attributed to pneumonia and lung infections, and 14% constitute bloodstream infections [
 <xref rid="B55-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Microorganisms also form biofilms on the damaged vascular endothelium of native heart valves in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, causing Candida infectious endocarditis [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It is known that biofilms of Candida species cause malfunctioning of the valve in tracheo-esophageal voice prostheses, leading to an increase in air flow resistance and potential fluid leakage [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy confirmed biofilm development at the tip of urinary catheters even after a short period of exposure [
