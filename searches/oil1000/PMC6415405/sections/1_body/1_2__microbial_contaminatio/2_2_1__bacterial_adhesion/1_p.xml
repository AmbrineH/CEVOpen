<p class="p">Bacterial cells are essentially capable of attaching to all natural and artificial surfaces [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Yet it has been assumed that bacteria favorably stick to rougher surfaces for three reasons: (i) A higher surface area available for attachment; (ii) protection from shear forces; and (iii) chemical changes that cause preferential physico-chemical interactions [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Also, there is consensus among scientists that the solidâ€“liquid interface between a surface and an aqueous medium (e.g., water and blood) provides a suitable environment for the adhesion and propagation of bacteria [
