<p class="p">Before the first microorganism reaches the surface, water, salt ions, or proteins that exist in the environment will adhere to the substrate because of the nature of the attachment, which is dependent on the properties of the material [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and the chemistry of the environment. Consequently, a single layer of organic macromolecules called a ‘conditioning film’ is formed [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The characteristics of conditioning films in turn significantly influence the surface colonization. As the bacterial cell approaches the surface (a few nanometers), the initial stage of adhesion is governed by a number of physico-chemical effects, which include long-range and short-range forces. The long range forces include gravitational, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions, while the short range forces include hydrogen bonding, dipole–dipole, ionic, and hydrophobic interactions [

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The initial microbial attachment is considered reversible, as the cell will attach to the conditioning film not the surface itself. During adhesion to the surface, various bacteria can transiently produce flagella that render them very motile. Depending on the species, microorganisms may have appendages such as fimbriae, or polymeric fibers, also called pili or curli, which enhance attachment to surfaces [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For example, the curli fibres of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> are 4–6 nm wide unbranched filaments, having a distinctive morphology that can be easily detected by electron microscopy [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. If the microorganisms are not immediately removed from the surface, they can anchor themselves more permanently by producing a large amount of fibrous glycocalyx that performs the role of ’cement‘ to attach cells to the targeted surface [
