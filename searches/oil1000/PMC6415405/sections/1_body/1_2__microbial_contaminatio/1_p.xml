<p class="p">Global production of medical devices and associated materials is an industry worth over $180 billion, and is expanding swiftly [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Microbial contamination of these biomaterials is a serious and widespread problem facing current health systems, because it often leads to devastating infections and the failure of the affected device. Adhesion of planktonic microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) to surfaces is the first stage during surface colonization, followed by the subsequent formation of biofilms which provide an ideal environment for the microbial community to flourish and effectively evade treatment. An active biofilm can be up to 1000 times more resistant to an antimicrobial treatment than planktonic bacteria of the same species [

 <xref rid="B21-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Biofilms act as a nidus for systemic pathogenic infections, including dental cavities, periodontal disease, pneumonia associated with cystic fibrosis, otitis media, osteomyelitis, bacterial prostatitis, native valve endocarditis, meloidosis, and musculoskeletal infections [

 <xref rid="B23-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thus, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which microorganisms attach to the substrate, and the structure and dynamics of biofilm formation is necessary to develop bio-active coatings that reduce or prevent medical device-associated infections.
