 <xref rid="B35-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Typically, a viable biofilm involves three organic layers. The first layer is attached to the surface of the tissue or biomaterial, the second layer is called the “biofilm base”, which holds the bacterial aggregation, and the third layer, known as the “surface film”, performs as an outer layer where planktonic organisms are released [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Biofilm architecture is heterogeneous both in space and time. The thickness of a biofilm varies depending on the microbial species. For example, the mean thickness of a 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm is about 24 µm, while 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> has a mean biofilm thickness of 32.3 µm; thickness can reach more than 400 µm in some species [

 <xref rid="B39-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Biofilm sanctuaries can include a single infectious species or multiple infectious species, as well as non-pathogenic microorganisms which nevertheless can produce substances that would benefit the survival and proliferation of the pathogenic species. In the case of the infection of medical devices and implants, a single bacterial species is usually responsible for biofilm formation. While in environmental surfaces, groupings of various species will usually dominate the biofilm [
