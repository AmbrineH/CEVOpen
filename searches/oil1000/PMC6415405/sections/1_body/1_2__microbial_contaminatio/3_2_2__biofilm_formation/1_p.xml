<p class="p">After adhering to solid surfaces, the next step of permanent attachment is growing a bacterial “sanctuary”, which is the biofilm. Biofilm formation is a four stage process which includes: (i) irreversible attachment; (ii) early development; (iii) maturation; and (iv) detachment or dispersal of cells, as seen

It has been shown conclusively that bacteria secrete a highly hydrated layer (biofilm) that provides a shield against host defense system and antibiotics, and strengthens the attachment of the microorganisms to the surface. Early steps of biofilm formation are controlled by physical adsorption processes and evolution dynamics of planktonic pathogens [
