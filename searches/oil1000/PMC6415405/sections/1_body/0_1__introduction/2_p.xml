<p class="p">The emergence of bacteria that are resistant to typically used antibiotics is now well recognized [

 <xref rid="B10-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The most serious problem caused by antibiotic resistance is that some pathogenic bacteria have now become resistant to virtually all standard antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B12-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Significant examples are methicillin-resistant
