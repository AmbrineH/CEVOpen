In spite of significant progress in the development of antibacterial and antifouling surfaces, microbial adhesion and the resulting development of a thick sessile layer, i.e., the biofilm, on the surfaces of synthetic implants remains a major issue with their clinical use [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Therapeutic statistics have demonstrated that approximately 80% of worldwide surgical site associated-infections may relate to microscopic biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-10-00515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Further, owing to microbial infection, and the subsequent failure of medical devices, there has been a significant increase in the number of revision surgeries [
