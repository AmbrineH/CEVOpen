 <p> Cytotoxic activity of the methanol extract (A) and essential oil (B) of S. suffruticosa on cancerous and normal cell lines. MCF-7, HT-29, NCCIT, SH-SY5Y and HUVEC Cell lines were cultured and treated with various concentrations of the extract (20-2560 µg/mL) and oil (0.026-19.4 µl/ml) for 48 hr and cell viability percentage was measured. All data are reported as mean ±SD of at least three separate experiments </p>
