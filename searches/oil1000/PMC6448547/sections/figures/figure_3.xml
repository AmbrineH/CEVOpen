  <p class="p">The effect of 
   <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>extract on cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. Untreated cells (A) and MCF-7 treated with 
   <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>extract (320 μg/ml) for 48 hr (B) were stained with PI and analyzed using BD FACScan ﬂow cytometer. The DNA histogram shows the distribution and percentage of cells in different phases of cell cycle. Results are expressed as mean±SD of 3 independent experiments. *p&lt;0.05 shows significant differences as compared to the control as tested by the Student’s t-test. Each DNA histogram represents one of the three independent experiments
