 <p> Apoptotic effect of S. suffruticosa essential oil on MCF-7 cell line was assessed using PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I. Untreated cells (A), and cells treated with 5Âµl/ml of essential oil for 48 hr (B) were analyzed using flow cytometer. PE Annexin V and 7-AAD negative (Q3) were considered viable cells; live-gated cells within the Annexin-V +7AAD - compartment (Q1) were identified as early apoptotic cells and gated cells within the Annexin-V +7AAD + compartment (Q2) were identified as late apoptotic and gated cells with the Annexin V - 7AAD + (Q4) were considered necrotic cells </p>
