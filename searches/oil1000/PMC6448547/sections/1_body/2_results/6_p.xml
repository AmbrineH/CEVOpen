<p class="p">In order to study the possible anti-proliferative activity of methanol extract and essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> cytotoxic analysis using MTT colorimetric assay on different tumor cells and one normal cell lines was performed. A relatively dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines was detected for this extract. Although, growth inhibitory effect of the extract on NCCIT (IC50; 242 µg/mL) and SH-SY5Y (IC50; 220 µg/mL) was stronger than that against MCF-7 (IC50; 320 µg/mL) and HT29 (IC50; 341 µg/mL), but there was not much difference among susceptibility of different cancer cell lines to the plant extract. However, this study demonstrated that this extract displays low inhibitory effect on proliferation of normal HUVEV cell line with an IC50 of 1866 µg/mL after 48-hr incubation (

In order to test cytotoxic effects, cells were exposed to 0.026, 0.08, 0.24, 0.72, 2.1, 6.4 and 19.4 µL/mL of the essential oil for 48 hr. Our findings indicated essential oil-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in all cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HT29, SH-SY5Y and NCCIT) as well as HUVEC as a normal cell line (

A microscopic examination further revealed morphological changes in all cell lines following exposure to the essential oil which resulted in suspension of dead cells in the medium (data not shown). The IC50 values of the essential oil at 48 hr were 5, 4.2, 1.6, 1.5 and 0.72 µL/mL against MFC-7, SH-SY5Y, HUVEC, HT29 and NCCIT, respectively.
