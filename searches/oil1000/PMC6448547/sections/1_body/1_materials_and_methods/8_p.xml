<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was done using a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass spectrometer coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatography equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane, 30m×0.25mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The carrier gas was helium. All mass spectra were acquired in electron-impact (EI) mode with an ionization voltage of 70 eV. For identification of essential oil components, relative retention time and mass spectra of each compound were compared with the standards. The components of essential oil were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices relative to n-alkanes of
