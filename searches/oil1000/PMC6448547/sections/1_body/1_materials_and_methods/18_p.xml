<p class="p">PE Annexin V versus 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Briefly, cells were plated into 6-well culture dishes (3×10
 <sup class="sup">5 </sup>cells/well) for 24 hr prior to the addition of the essential oil (5 µl/mL). Following 24-hr incubation with the essential oil, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the annexin V-PE/7-AAD assay. The cells were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1X binding buffer at a concentration of 1×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/ml. Then, 100µl of the cell suspension was added to a tube, treated with 5 µl of PE Annexin V and 5 µl of 7-AAD and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the fluorescence of the cells was immediately determined by a flow cytometer (Partec FloMax, Münster, Germany) using fl2 and fl3 filters for detection of PE-Annexin and 7-AAD.
