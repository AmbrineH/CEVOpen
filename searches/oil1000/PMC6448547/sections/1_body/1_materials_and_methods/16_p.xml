<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of the methanol extracts and essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa</italic> on different cell lines including MCF-7, HT29, NCCIT, SH-SY5Y and HUVEC were measured using 3- (4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were grown in 96-well plates. After 24 hr, the culture medium was removed and cells were treated with medium containing increasing concentrations of methanol extract and essential oil in separate experiments and incubated for 48 hr. Later, 20 µl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and the plate was re-incubated for 3 hr. Finally, the medium was removed and 100 µl of DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The amount of formazan crystal was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm by using a multi-plate reader (ELISA reader; BioTek-ELx800, USA). Since the solvent (DMSO) has cytotoxic effects, the control treatments were treated with equivalent amount of DMSO. The experiments were performed in triplicate and the ratio of the absorbance of treated cells to the absorbance of DMSO-treated control cells was regarded as cell viability (%). The concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated from a graph plotting cell viability percentage against different methanol extract or essential oil concentrations.
