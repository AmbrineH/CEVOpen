The cells were detached from the culture dish using trypsin/EDTA, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min. After washing, cells were re-suspended in 1 ml PBS containing 20 µg/mL propidium iodide and 10 μg/mL RNase A and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in the dark. DNA content and cell cycle progression were studied by ﬂow cytometry using FACSCalibur
