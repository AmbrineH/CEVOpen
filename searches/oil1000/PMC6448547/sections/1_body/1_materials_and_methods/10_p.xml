<p class="p">Antioxidant potential of the plant essential oil and extracts was examined using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay. Here, 50µl of different concentrations of each sample was added to 150 μl of methanol solution of 0.004% DPPH and incubated at room temperature for 30min; then, absorbance was read at 517nm (Burits and Bucar, 2000
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"> ▶</xref>). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as reference drug. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as follow: I%=(A
 <sub class="sub">con</sub>-A
 <sub class="sub">sam</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">sam</sub>×100, where A
 <sub class="sub">con </sub>and A
 <sub class="sub">sam</sub> are the absorbance of control and sample, respectively. IC50 values of the extract and oil (i.e. concentration that is necessary to decrease the initial concentration of DPPH by 50%) were calculated.
