<p class="p">In this study, essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>collected from Lalehzar mountain in Kerman province was analyzed and Z-β-ocimene (25.1%), linalool (17.8%) and β-bisabolol (13.3%) were detected as main components. Ocimene and linalool are plant-derived monoterpene and β-bisabolol is a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol. Together, β-ocimene and linalool were identified among essential oil major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>collected from Yazd, Zahedan and Kerman, Iran. However, S.
 <italic class="italic"> suffruticosa </italic>in each region has a particular composition of chemical compounds. Because the environmental factors can change the quantity and quality of the essential oil composition, it is possible to detect different components in the same plant such as 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa</italic>, growing in different regions (Sardashti et al., 2012
