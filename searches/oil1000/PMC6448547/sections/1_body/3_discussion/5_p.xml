<p class="p">However, there is no comprehensive report on the biological activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>essential oil and/or its extract. Our study fills this gap and examined antioxidant potential, and cytotoxic and antimicrobial effect of the essential oil and methanol extract of

 <italic class="italic">vitro</italic> radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity of the essential oil and methanol extract were studied by using DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The DPPH is a blue/purple stable radical that can undergo scavenging by antioxidant. Using DPPH assay, capacity of plant extracts and essential oils to donate hydrogen atom and/or electron to DPPH and converting it to a yellow molecule reflects its ability to scavenge free radicals (Lu and Foo, 2001

 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa</italic> displayed very high radical-scavenging activity. Oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons are the most abundant compounds in essential oil. These components that possess different functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, etc.) have antioxidant properties and are responsible for high antioxidant potential of essential oil.
