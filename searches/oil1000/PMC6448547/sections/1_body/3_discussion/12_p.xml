<p class="p">According to our findings methanol extract has potent anti-proliferative activities against cancer cell lines via induction of cell cycle arrest, whereas no cytotoxic effect was observed at higher dose on normal cells. Therefore, the extract contains bioactive components responsible for anti-cancer potential of plant extract; nonetheless, further studies are needed to isolate and characterize these components. Furthermore, significant antioxidant activity of the essential oil reflected by DPPH- test, encourages researchers to perform more detailed research in this respect. </p>
