<p class="p">Todays, natural plant compounds are used for curing many diseases such as diabetes, malaria, and oxidative damage-related diseases such as cancer. Lower toxicity of plant-derived components compared to that of chemo-drugs and their fewer adverse effects make them promising alternatives for therapeutic strategies (Cragg et al., 2009

The results revealed that whereas, methanol extract exhibited considerable cytotoxicity in all tested cancer cell lines and low cytotoxic effect on normal cell, essential oil exerted high cytotoxicity against both normal and cancer cell lines. Therefore, methanol extract exerts tumor-specific activity and can be considered as a potential anti-cancer agent for furthers investigation. The cytotoxic effects of methanol extract and essential oil on MCF-7 cells were mediated through cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the external surface of the cell membrane which is recognized as a biomarker of apoptotic cells can be detected by annexin /7-AAD flow cytometric assays (Fadok et al., 1992
