<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Semenovia</italic> belongs to Apiaceae family and consists of twenty seven species. Eleven species are found in Iran and five of them including 
 <italic class="italic">S. tragioides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. frigida, S. suffruticosa, S. subscaposa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. dichotoma </italic>are endemic species to Iran (Rechinger and Teucrium, 1987

 <italic class="italic">Semenovia suffruticosa</italic> (Freyn et Bornm. Manden.) is one of these endemic plants which grow in Kerman, Yazd and Zahedan provinces. In previous studies, the composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>from Taftan mountain, Zahedan and from Shirkouh mountain, Yazd, Iran (Mottaghipisheh et al., 2017

 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>collected from Lalehzar mountain, Kerman, Iran. Furthermore, some biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-cancer properties of the essential oil and methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. suffruticosa </italic>were reported for the first time.
