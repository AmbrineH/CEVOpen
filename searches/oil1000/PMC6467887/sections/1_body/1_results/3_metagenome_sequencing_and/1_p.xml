<p id="Par10" class="p">To further compare microbiomes, metagenomic sequencing was carried out for these soil samples using the Illumina platform. Numerical data for metagenomic sequencing and assembled scaffolds are summarised in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. After annotation, numerical data is shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>. At the domain level, genes affiliated with the bacterial domain were predominant at 64.1–78.5%, while archaea associated genes only represented a minor proportion of the microbial community at 1.2–4.7% (See Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). In all samples, the Eukaryota domain accounted for 14.1–26.9%. The remaining identified genes comprised DNA viruses and unclassified organisms.
