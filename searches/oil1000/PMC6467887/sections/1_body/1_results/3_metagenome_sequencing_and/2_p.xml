<p id="Par11" class="p">Taxonomic analysis showed that all metagenomic samples were dominated by phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Streptophyta, and Ascomycota. The heat map of abundance profiles showed that some phyla were overrepresented in the wheat straw compost-based samples. For example, the relative abundances of phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were high in the sample FT2 300 kg/mu straw 60-day, whereas high abundances of Cyanobacteria, Basidiomycota and Chlorophyta were observed in the FT1 200 kg/mu straw 30-day sample (Fig.
