<p id="Par16" class="p">In the KEGG functional analysis, the results showed that, in general, different groups of genes displayed a down-regulating trend at 60 days but showed an up-regulating trend at 90 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). Metabolism was among the most abundant pathways; moreover, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, biosynthesis of antibiotics, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, and carbon metabolism also ranked as the most abundant gene pathways across all samples (See Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The variation that occurred between 60 days and 90 days was more pronounced in soils amended with wheat straw compost fertiliser. There were significant differences in the enrichment of ABC transporters (p = 0.0069) and biosynthesis of antibiotics (p = 0.0183) pathways among samples with different treatments. The temporal changes of the enrichment of the two pathways were showed in Fig.
