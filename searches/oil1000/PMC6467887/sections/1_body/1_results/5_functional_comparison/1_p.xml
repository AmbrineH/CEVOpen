<p id="Par15" class="p">In order to explore the function of metagenomes after treatment, the metagenomes were annotated against KEGG and COG databases. The genes of samples for each treatment at 30, 60, and 90 days were all significantly enriched in energy production and conversion, amino acid transport and metabolism (all p &lt; 0.05). The two signal pathways showed significant differences in functional enrichment analysis among different treatments (all p &lt; 0.05). The changes of the abundance of the two functions at different time points are shown in Fig.
