<p id="Par7" class="p">Initial increase observed in the bacterial population in the rhizosphere soil of the tobacco field was decreased later. The application of FT1 200 kg/mu straw and FCK2 pure nitrogen led to a significant increase in the bacterial population 60 and 75 days post-transplantation (P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>). Post-transplantation bacterial population with FT2 300 kg/mu straw treatment showed increase at 45 days, decrease at 60 days and reached peak at 75 days. With FT3 400 kg/mu straw treatment, the bacterial population reached a peak at 45 days post-transplantation followed by a gradual decrease. The fungal population showed increase with an increase in wheat straw compost and reached a peak at 60 days post-transplantation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1g</xref>), indicating that wheat straw compost fertiliser, especially FT2 300 kg/mu straw, could increase the fungal population. The population of actinomycetes reached a peak at 30 days post-transplantation, then decreased at 45, 60 and 75 days, and again increased at 90days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1h</xref>), indicating direct or indirect increase in the population of actinomycetes through the application of wheat straw compost fertiliser, especially FT3 400 kg/mu straw, at the later stages of tobacco leaf growth.
