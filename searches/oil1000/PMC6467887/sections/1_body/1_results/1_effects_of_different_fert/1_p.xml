<p id="Par6" class="p">Chemical and physical properties of soil were measured after fertiliser treatments. Soils with pH 5.5–6.5 are considered suitable for tobacco planting and high-quality tobacco leaf growth. Our results showed that the application of wheat straw compost fertiliser had no evident effect on the soil pH, which remained at about 5.7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Available N content in the soil was decreased with tobacco growth periods, which were regained at 60 days post-transplantation with the FT1 200 kg/mu straw treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Available phosphorus content continued to increase, reaching a peak at 90 days post-transplantation, which was evident in the samples that underwent FT3 400 kg/mu straw treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). There were no evident changes in available potassium content with wheat straw compost fertilisers. However, available potassium content was significantly increased by treatment with FT3 400 kg/mu straw at 60 days post-transplantation (P &lt; 0.001) and FT1 at 75 days post-transplantation (P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). Organic matter content in the soil remained unaltered during the growth period before 60 days post-transplantation. The organic matter content of the different soil samples was in the following order: FT2 300 kg/mu straw &gt; FT3 400 kg/mu straw &gt; FT1 200 kg/mu straw (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>).
