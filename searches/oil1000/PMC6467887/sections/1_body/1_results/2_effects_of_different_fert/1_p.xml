<p id="Par9" class="p">Agronomic traits were assessed during various tobacco growth stages after transplanting with different fertiliser applications. The difference between the height and the growth rate of the tobacco plant was maintained at a static rate, but the maximum leaf area per stem and the maximum leaf area per plant was greater under the FT3 400 kg/mu straw treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1i–k</xref>). Regarding factors of botanical traits, disease index and appearance quality of the original tobacco, treatments with wheat straw compost fertiliser showed superiority in all areas. Botanical traits were improved, the incidence of mosaic disease and black shank were reduced, and the applications of FT1 200 kg/mu straw and FT3 400 kg/mu straw led to superior gloss and oil content of tobacco leaves. However, in terms of agronomic properties and economic traits, tobacco grew better under the treatment of FT3 400 kg/mu straw than under other treatments, but showed the highest incidence of black shank disease. Overall, the application of FT1 200 kg/mu straw showed superiority for all the traits. Moreover, the contents of total sugars, reducing sugars, nicotine, chloride, potassium, and other nutrients were also determined in the tobacco samples under different fertiliser treatments (See Supplementary Table
