<p id="Par12" class="p">We made further taxonomic comparisons using community abundance profiles in the four fertiliser treatments. The heat map results showed that the different fertiliser treatments influenced the abundance of microbial communities (See Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). We also compared the microbial community abundance profiles across different fertiliser treatment samples (See Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>).
