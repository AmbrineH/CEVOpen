<p id="Par13" class="p">PCA was carried out on the relative order count data from the metagenomic reads. The greater the similarities in sample compositions, the closer were the distances in the PCA map. The results indicated that the soil under treatment of wheat straw compost fertilisers (FT1 200 kg/mu straw, FT2 300 kg/mu straw, and FT3 400 kg/mu straw) showed significant differences compared to soil amended with FCK2 pure nitrogen fertiliser (Fig.
