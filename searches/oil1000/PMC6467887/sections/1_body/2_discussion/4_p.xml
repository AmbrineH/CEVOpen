<p id="Par21" class="p">In line with previous studies showing positive correlations between soil properties and microbial communities, our results identified correlations between soil properties and the dominant phyla. A recent study found that nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and combined NPK treatments shifted bacterial community compositions, and under these four fertiliser treatments, Actinobacteria were predominant compared to the control. Redundancy analysis of bacterial community profiles and soil parameters revealed that available trace elements (Mg, total N, Cd, and Al) were positively correlated with variations in community composition
