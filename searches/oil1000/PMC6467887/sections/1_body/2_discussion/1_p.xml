<p id="Par18" class="p">The crop yield and healthy food production is dependent on plant nutrients. The type of fertilisers used is essential for the increased production to provide sufficient nutrients for plants. The sound management of fertilisers is essential to ensure the plant production and environmental safety. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chemical fertiliser treatments with and without wheat straw compost fertiliserÂ on microbial communities in tobacco planting soils by metagenomics sequencing.</p>
