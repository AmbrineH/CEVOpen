<p id="Par23" class="p">The application of different wheat straw compost fertiliser concentrations had a certain influence on the economic traits of tobacco. With different applications of wheat straw compost fertiliser, the content of total sugars, reducing sugars, chlorine and potassium in roots and leaves and the content of nicotine in root system increased to certain extent. The increased total sugars and reducing sugars under the use of wheat straw compost fertiliser treatments did improve the performance of flue-cured samples. High levels of chlorine have been shown to affect the flammability of tobacco, while high levels of potassium can lead to a lack of coordination between potassium and chlorine

 </sup>. In the present study, nicotine and potassium contents were not affected significantly but increased applications of wheat straw compost fertiliser did lead to an increase in chlorine content. It is reported that microbial metabolism is responsible for the fate of chemical components in the biosphere

 </sup>. In this study, Proteobacteria was found to have high abundance in straw fertiliser treated soil, which may contribute to the increase of chlorine content in soils. Overall, the application of FT1 200 kg/mu straw showed a comprehensive superiority in the overall desirable tobacco traits. We speculated that the dominated microbial populations play key roles in the variety of soil properties. Therefore, to improve tobacco quality and its economic qualities, growers need to consider applying an appropriate amount of wheat straw compost fertiliser during growth.
