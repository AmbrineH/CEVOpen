<p id="Par22" class="p">Furthermore, the application of different amounts of wheat straw compost fertiliser had a certain influence on the number of microbes in the rhizosphere soil of the tobacco field. Communities of bacteria and actinomycetes were highest in the FT1 200 kg/mu straw treatment and the fungal community reached a peak in the FT2 300 kg/mu straw treatment. The communities of bacteria and fungi reached a peak at 60 days post-transplantation whereas the actinomycete community reached its peak at 90 days. These microbial delineations were positively correlated with the amount of wheat straw compost fertiliser. The quality of the soil surrounding the root is dependent on the organic material from the vicinity of root and the microbial activity on nutrient cycling and plant growth. The composition of bacteria and fungi populations has positive, negative, or neutral role on plants depending on the soil conditions

 </sup>. One goal of fertilisation management is to increase the beneficial effects of soil microbial community. However, the association between fertilisation and the population of bacteria and fungi has not been determined. Further analyses are urgently needed.
