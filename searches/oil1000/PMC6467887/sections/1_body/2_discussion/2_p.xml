 </sup>. Our results show that soil amended with wheat straw compost fertiliser maintained pH at 5.7, slightly lower than that with chemical treatment alone (FCK2 pure nitrogen). Although wheat straw compost fertiliser had a relatively small influence on soil pH, a slightly reduced pH relative to other soil treatments may significantly affect soil microbial properties, nutrient availability, root growth, and tobacco plant yields. Previous reports suggest that variation in pH may induce the abundance and composition of acidobacterial community
