<p id="Par25" class="p">The experiment was carried out in 2015 in a planting field growing Zhongyan-100 tobacco variety in Tongchen Village, WenfengTwon, Wuyang County, Luohe City, Henan Province, China. The medium fertile soil contained 22.22 mg/kg soil organic matter, 124.01 mg/kg available nitrogen (N), 54.54 mg/kg available phosphorus (P), 108.06 mg/kg available potassium (K) and pH 5.31. Fertiliser treatments included: 1) nofertiliser application (CK), 2) 2.5 kg/mu pure nitrogen fertiliser (FCK2 pure nitrogen), 3) 2.5 kg/mu pure nitrogen fertiliser with 200 kg/mu straw compost (FT1 200 kg/mu straw), 4) 2.5 kg/mu pure nitrogen fertiliser with 300 kg/mu straw compost (FT2 300 kg/mu straw), and 5) 2.5 kg/mu pure nitrogen fertiliser with 400 kg/mu straw compost (FT3 400 kg/mu straw). Pure nitrogen fertiliser was 2.5 kg/mu with ratios of N:P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>:K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O = 1:1:3.5. A 70% dilution of fertiliser was used as base fertiliser during ridging, and a 30% dilution was applied during transplantation. Transplant spacing was 120 cm × 50 cm. The wheat straw was crushed and decomposed with straw decomposer for 18–22 days before applied to the field. The decomposed straw was evenly applied to the test field and soils were prepared by rotary tillage, watering, and sedimentation for one week followed by repeated tillage. The randomised block plots with sizes of 60–80 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> were set with 6–8 lines in each block and two protection lines between blocks. For metagenomic sequencing, soil samples from FCK2 and wheat straw compost fertilisers (FT1 200 kg/mu straw, FT2 300 kg/mu straw and FT3 400 kg/mu straw) were used. A major flow in the experimental design is shown in Fig.
