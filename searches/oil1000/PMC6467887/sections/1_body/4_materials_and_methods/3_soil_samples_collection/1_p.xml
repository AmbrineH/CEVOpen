<p id="Par27" class="p">Five fertiliser treatments were repeated 3 times and the rhizosphere soils were collected at a depth of 5–40 cm at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 days post-transplantation with five cores for each. Three repeated samples for each point were mixed equally and sieved. Then each soil sample was divided into two parts, one of which was subjected to biochemical analysis while the other was used for DNA extraction for metagenome sequencing. Sub-samples were frozen at −80 °C.</p>
