<p id="Par29" class="p">Fresh soil samples were used for DNA extraction with the E.Z.N.A. Soil DNA kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA). DNA library was constructed using TruSeq™ DNA Sample Prep Kit and subjected to Illumina Hiseq sequencing (OE Biotech CO., LTD, Shanghai, China). In detail, genomic DNA was checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis at various steps like after fragmentation, end-repair for DNA samples with ultrasonic treatment, A-tailing, and addition of sequencing adapters to both end of fragments. After removal of self-ligated fragments by magnetic beads purification and fragment screening, library amplification was performed by PCR. For sequencing data, reads containing less than 70% bases with Q20 were filtered out using NGSQC toolkit (version 2.3.2)
