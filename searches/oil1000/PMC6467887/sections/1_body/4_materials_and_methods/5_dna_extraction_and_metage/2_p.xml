 </sup>, and the abundant information of the gene in the corresponding sample was counted. The gene set representative sequence (amino acid sequence) was annotated with NR, KEGG, COG, SWISSPROT, and GO database with an e-value of 1e-5. The taxonomy of the species was studied as a result of the corresponding taxonomy database of the NR Library and the abundance of the species was calculated using the corresponding abundance of the genes. In order to construct the abundance profile on the corresponding taxonomy level, abundance statistics were performed at each level of Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. The GeneMark.hmm (version 3.26) in GeneMark software were used to predict the potential protein coding region in a DNA sequence. Representative sequences for enriched genes were used to label the drug resistance genes. The gene sets were compared with the CAZy database using the corresponding tool hmmscan (version 3.1b2) to obtain the information of the carbohydrate active enzyme corresponding to the gene and then calculated the carbohydrate activity using the sum of the gene abundances corresponding to the carbohydrate active enzyme abundance.
