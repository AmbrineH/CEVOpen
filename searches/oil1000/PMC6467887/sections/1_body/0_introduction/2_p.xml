  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup> supports the concept that soil microbial communities are neither functionally redundant nor similar. Recent research has demonstrated that prolonged elevations in nitrogen availability may directly or indirectly change the microbial carbon dynamics, thereby shifting the composition of soil microbial communities, their catabolic capabilities, and metagenomes
