<p id="Par2" class="p">Environmental soil degradation and production sustainability in different agricultural systems have aroused public concern about soil fertility and quality

 </sup>. As previous studies have shown favourable effects of soil nutrients (e.g. organic C, N, P and K) on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil, concentrations of these soil nutrients are good indicators of soil quality and productivity
