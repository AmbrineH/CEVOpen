<p id="Par4" class="p">A recent study indicated that the application of straw, with and without straw decomposer, could shift the soil bacterial community structure, specifically activating the copiotrophic bacteria and increasing the soil biological activity, thus, contributing to soil productivity and sustainability in agro-ecosystems

Indeed, advances in next-generation DNA sequencing approaches combined with traditional microbiological and chemical analyses of soil parameters may provide a biologically relevant assay to assess the potential effects of fertiliser applications and straw compost amendments on soil microbial communities.
