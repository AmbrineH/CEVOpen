<p id="Par5" class="p">Thus, in this study, we investigated the impact of different fertiliser treatments on microbial communities in tobacco planting soils. Soil samples were collected from a long-term field experiment involving use of conventional fertiliser treatments alone or in combination with wheat straw compost. Tobacco traits and soil properties were analysed and a metagenomics sequencing approach was undertaken to examine the microbiological profile diversity.</p>
