<p id="Par24" class="p">In conclusion, chemical fertiliser combined with wheat straw compost fertiliser improved soil fertility, tobacco quality, and economic traits. It also significantly shifted the microbial community structure. A significant correlation was identified between soil properties and the dominant phyla under different fertilisation treatments in our study. The chemical fertiliser combined with straw compost fertiliser can effectively improve the soil traits and microbial diversity. The straw compost fertiliser could be widely used in agricultural production. The application of straw compost fertiliser may cure soil contamination induced by chemical products.</p>
