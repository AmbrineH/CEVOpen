   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Bouncing process of a water droplet. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Penetrating process of an oil droplet. Snapshots of a water droplet impacting a superhydrophobic copper foam surface. The snapshots were obtained using a high-speed camera. The water droplet and gasline engine oil continually falls freely from a height of H = 6 cm and 8 cm, respectively. The volumes of each water droplet and gasline engine oil is 50 ÂµL, respectively.
