 <p> SEM characterization of Cu foam immersed into a mixture aqueous solution of FeCl3 (0.01 g mL −1) and HCl (0.1 M) at room temperature (scale bar = 500 μm). Numbers ( a– e) stand for the immersion time for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, respectively. The insets ( a– e) show the nanoscale patterns on the microscale roughness surface. The insets with a scale bar of 1 μm show the enlarged view of the surface. </p>
