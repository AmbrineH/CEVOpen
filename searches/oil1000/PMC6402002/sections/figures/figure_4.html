 <p> A series of snapshots showing a droplet of water bouncing and oil penetrating on the prepared copper foam. ( a) Bouncing process of a water droplet. ( b) Penetrating process of an oil droplet. Snapshots of a water droplet impacting a superhydrophobic copper foam surface. The snapshots were obtained using a high-speed camera. The water droplet and gasline engine oil continually falls freely from a height of H = 6 cm and 8 cm, respectively. The volumes of each water droplet and gasline engine oil is 50 ÂµL, respectively. </p>
