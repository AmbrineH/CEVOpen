<p class="p">The superhydrophobic Cu foams were prepared through a similar method as already reported [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The procedure of fabricating the superhydrophobic surface onto Cu foam is briefly illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="polymers-11-00097-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, which includes the chemical etching in FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/HCl mixed solutions to create rough structures and subsequent modification with four sulfhydryl compounds to reduce the surface energies. Briefly, a piece of Cu foam (10 × 10 × 1.5 mm, 30 × 30 × 1.5 mm) was firstly ultrasonic rinsed with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for several times sequentially, and then desiccated with N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl in order to keep the acidic condition during the reaction. Then, a piece of the cleaned Cu foam was immersed in FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution in the concentration range of 2.5–40 mg/mL for 5–25 min with consequent ultrasonication, followed by water washing, and drying. After the growth of nanostructures, the substrates were covered with a rough layer and modified with each thiol solution for 5–25 min, respectively. The concentration for four thiol compounds was selected in the range of 1–20 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in ethanol. At last, these Cu foams were rinsed with abundant ethanol and desiccated with N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>.
