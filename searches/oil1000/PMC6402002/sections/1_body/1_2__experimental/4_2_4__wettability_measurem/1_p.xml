<p class="p">The water contact angles (WCAs) at room temperature (about 4.5 μL of distilled water droplet was used for the measurements) were measured according to the sessile-drop method using a contact angle analyzer (SPCA, Beijing HaKe Test Instrument Factory, Beijing, China). The drop image was stored by the video camera, and an image analysis system was used to calculate the left and right angles from the shape of the drop. The droplet size of the fluid was about 5–50 μL. For the water sliding angles (WSAs) measurement, the substrate was placed on a custom designed stage measured with a protractor and a water droplet of 5–50 μL was used. All WCA and WSA values were averaged over three different measurements on each sample.</p>
