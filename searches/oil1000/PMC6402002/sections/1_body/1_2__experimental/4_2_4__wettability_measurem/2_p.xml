<p class="p">A FEI QUANTA 200 scanning electron microscope (Philips-FEI Corporation, Netherlands) was used to study the surface morphology of the foam copper and as-spun fiber. Before SEM observation, all samples were fixed on aluminum stubs and coated with gold. The surface composition was characterized by X ray diffraction (DX2700B-XRD, Dan Dong Hao Yuan Instrument Co., Ltd., Dandong, China). The impacting processes of water and oil onto tested Cu foams were monitored using a high-speed camera (video camera AG-HMC153MC, Panasonic, Inc., Osaka, Japan), for macroscopic and microcosmic observations, respectively.</p>
