<p class="p">The immersion time and the concentration of FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and HCl played a vital role during the preparation process. The surface morphology of the Cu foams after immersion and ultrosonication in the acid aqueous solution of FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> for different times was characterized by SEM in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. It could be seen that the immersion time of 10 min was enough to create many nano-size particles onto the surfaces with the help of the chemical reaction and ultrasonication. Furthermore, the mass of Cu components decreased with the progressive oxidation-reduction reaction. The Cu amount removed from the original substrate after 10 min immersion was decided by the amount of Fe
