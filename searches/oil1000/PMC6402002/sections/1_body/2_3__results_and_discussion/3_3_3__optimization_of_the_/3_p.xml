 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Figure S3 (Supporting Information)</xref>. It should be noted that the formed films onto the rough surface were very thin so that no obvious differences of morphology were recognized, but the original cube nanoparticles. Similar values of WCAs showed that the concentration effect of ODE on the wetting behavior could be ignored in the selected range. Moreover, the immersion time was changed in the range of 5–25 min with a constant ODE concentration of 10 mM. After the modified porous substrates were rinsed with ethanol and dried, they were selected for the determination of superhydrophobic properties. As shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00097-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the WCAs were achieved in the range of (150 ± 1.5)°–(158.3 ± 1.5)° with a WSA less than 5° and the largest absorbing amount of gasoline engine oil was obtained using 10 mM ODE.
