<p class="p">To examine liquid wetting behaviors of as-prepared Cu foam more intuitively, a high-speed camera system was used to record the gravity-driven oil–water separation process in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The processes of water droplet bouncing and oil penetrating were videotaped, respectively. The impacting water droplet viewed from the side (upper of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) spread to the surface, retracted, and then lifted off within 240 ms, until it rolled away from the surface. Little contact time between water droplets and the as-prepared interface proved that Cu foam had a fine ability to resist water. Due to the capillarity effect and van der Waals attractions, the gasoline engine oil had priority, compared with water (dyed with methylene blue), to pass through the as-prepared Cu foam. By simple initial immersion in oil solution, the foam surface could easily adsorb oil molecules due to its sticky force, thus this made oil pass through easily within 14.1 s. In the whole process, water droplets were observed to remain on the foam surface until most of the oil passed through the foam. Furthermore, when a waterdrop continuously hit the foam surface, it first flocked together to form a big water droplet, vibrated on the surface, and finally rolled away from the surface without being able to penetrate the surface. One possible explanation might be that the synergistic effect of both internal physical structures. Another key factor might come from the external chemical compositions of the current system. At the molecular level, Cu networks were composed of hydrophobic alkyl chains (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>(CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">16</sub>COO–), ensuring the strong resistance ability for water molecules.
