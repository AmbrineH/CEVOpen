<p class="p">The combination of superhydrophobic foam Cu boat and electrospun fiber with high oil absorption capacity may provide a good solution for the convenient collection of oil spill. Herein, one-step electrospinning to produce PS fibers with high oil adsorption capability was carried out by changing the compositions of polymer solutions; the PS fibers with different porous morphology and adsorption-capacity were tailored effectively [

 <xref rid="polymers-11-00097-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Due to the low dielectric constant, chlorobenzene (CB) alone cannot be used to produce dry PS fibers, the different surfactants, such as CTAB, SDS, Tween 80, and Trition-X-100, and TBAP as an organic salt are commonly added to enhance the conductivity of the solutions. The addition of DMSO as a high dielectric constant solvent can play an important role in the formation of the pores. These additives could enhance the electrospinning ability of the solution and produce bead-free fibers. Moreover, they might change critical parameters for electrospinning, such as the solvent quality to polymers, the viscosity, and the surface tension of solutions. As shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00097-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the WCAs of as-spun fibers prepared using different additives were in the range of (124.2 ± 4.2)°–(132 ± 2.2)°, with a fiber diameter of 1.6–3.9 μm. The roughness was created by the combination of the voids between fibers and the microscale pores, leading to a hydrophobic surface. The oil adsorption capacity for each fiber was investigated with gasoline engine oil with the largest absorption capacity being more than 85 g g
