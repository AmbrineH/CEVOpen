<p class="p">A sheet of copper foam was folded to a miniature boat with 4 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm. Then, the miniature ship was successively washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove surface impurities. Afterward, the superhydrophobic mini-boat was fabricated according to the above method: Etched in 10 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and 0.1 M HCl solution with ultrosonication about 10 min, followed by immersion in an ethanol solution of ODE (1 mM) for 10 min [
 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The as-prepared miniature boat floated freely on the water surface when in contact with water. The miniature boat weighs 1.2 g itself, but with a maximum loading weight of 12 g. Moreover, the folded boat has a height of 1 cm, but can endure a water pressure of 10 cm height.
