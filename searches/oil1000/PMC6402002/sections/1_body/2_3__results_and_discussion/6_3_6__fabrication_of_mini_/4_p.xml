<p class="p">The single and combinational modes using the mini-boat modified with ODE and as-spun fiber with the highest oil absorption capacity (b in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00097-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) were conveniently applied for the collection of oil spill, respectively. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a, the water droplets dyed with methylene blue performed like round balls whilst the red oil droplets dyed with Sudan red dispersed on the as-spun fiber surfaces. Additionally, similar phenomena were found in the mini-boat inner surface with water droplets sitting like a ball and oil droplets scattering on the floor of the mini-boat (the first picture in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>c). The as-spun PS fibers, the fibers embedded with a string bag, the superhydrophobic mini-boat, and the boat loaded with PS fibers were immersed in the oil over the water surface in the Petri dish, respectively, and effective oil/water separation were realized visually as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. After over 10 times oil absorption and collection, the superhydrophobic and oleophilic properties still remained for the mini-boat. It could be seen that bulbiform water droplets could sit on the surface of the upside mini-boat, but oil droplets dispersed and penetrated its surface (the last picture in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>d). In view of the superhydrophobic and oleophilic properties for both materials, high oil absorption capacity for the PS fibers, and rapid oil release by squeezing, these flexible approaches could conveniently apply to oil-water separation.
