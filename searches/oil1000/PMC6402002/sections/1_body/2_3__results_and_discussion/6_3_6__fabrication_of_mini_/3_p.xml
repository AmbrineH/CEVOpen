<p class="p">According to the SEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>), the diameter of the PS fibers is uniform, and, more importantly, the nonsolvent induces a highly porous structure throughout the fibers during the drying process. By combing the polar nonsolvent with the organic salt or surfactants, the as-spun fibers with small diameters and highly porous structures possess an exceptional ability to adsorb oils. Voids among fibers were the key for the high oil absorption capacity.
