<p class="p">The wet etching process was based on the oxidation–reduction reactions between the Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> and Cu, which is initiative and rapid, but enhanced by ultrasonic irradiation. Strong acid atmosphere (0.1 M HCl) could provide a stable and favorable oxidizing environment, so that the possible oxidation layers (CuO or Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) onto the surfaces of the Cu foam were easily dissolved and hydrolyzation of Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> was minimized effectively. Herein, ultrasonication increased the etching velocity through cavitation (bubble formation, growth, and collapse) and heating. When the microscopic cavitation bubbles collapsed near the surfaces of the Cu foam, they generated powerful shock waves and microjets that caused effective stirring/mixing of the acid and FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solutions. The numerous bubbles evolving at different locations on the pure copper surface that function as static and dynamic templates, so that many square nanoparticles were formed unevenly. The solution color was gradually changed from yellow to green, indicating Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ions were reduced to Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> ions, the color changes among the pores of the Cu foam were especially obvious if the etched foam was only rinsed with deionized water for several times (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>). Green color was observed among the pores of the Cu foam after several hours, indicating the existence of residual Cu and Fe ions onto the surfaces. In contrast, no green color was found among the pores of the copper foam after the etched surface was washed by deionized water several times and desiccated with N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fully. That is to say, the attached ions could be removed from the etched surface thoroughly via the combination of washing and desiccating methods. The post-modification of sulfhydryl compounds was carried out quickly by immersing the Cu foams into the ethanol solutions of EE, DE, HDE, and ODE, respectively. In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Video S1 (Supporting Information)</xref>, many water droplets were carefully added onto the fabricated foams by a micropipette of 20 μL. The blue and red waterdrops were dyed by methylene blue and allura red, respectively. These 5–20 μL waterdrops with less adhesive force onto the smooth surfaces could be removed easily by the tip of a micropipette. Four capital letters of HIST were written on the foam surfaces, with H, I, S, and T standing for the Cu foams modified by EE, DE, HDE, and ODE, respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Scheme S1</xref>). It should be noted that to attach these waterdrops regularly was very difficult due to their non-sticky behavior, as they could roll around easily onto the superhydrophobic surfaces. All Cu foams, but the EE foam, had good superhydrophobicity, indicating the alkyl chains (CH
