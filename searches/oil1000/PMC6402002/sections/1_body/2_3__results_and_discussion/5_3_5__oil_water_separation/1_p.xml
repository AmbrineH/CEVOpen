<p class="p">In an attempt to investigate the uptake capacities of the as-prepared Cu foam, the following experiment was carried out as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. Many dyed 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (Sudan, red) droplets were dropped onto the middle of the water surface in a watch glass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a), and then a piece of fabricated copper foam with a size of 30 mm Ã— 30 mm was held to approach the organic droplets (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (Sudan, red) was quickly absorbed by the superhydrophobic copper foam for about 10 s (
