<p class="p">Moreover, utilizing the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic copper foam, an oil/water separation apparatus was constructed as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> (upper) and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Video S6 (Supporting Information)</xref>. The flexible copper foam was immobilized in the rubber plug, where the vertical plastic tube was passed through. After the rubber plug was screwed on the plastic tube tightly, the mixture of 5 mL CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (red) and 5 mL water was poured in the plastic tube, thus CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> quickly permeated through the foam, owing to its superoleophilic nature, and dropped into the beaker below, while water was retained above the foam due to its superhydrophobic nature. Following this procedure, eight types of oil and organic solvents, including gasoline engine oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, coal tar, peanut oil, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, peanut oil, and chloroform, were successfully separated by using this simple filtration set-up.
