<p class="p">After the separation process was carried out, the oil was collected and weighed, respectively. The oil separation efficiency (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>s) was calculated by the equation, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>s = 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, where 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the volume of the oil in the oil−water mixture, and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic> is the volume of the oil, which is collected in the end. Taking CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> as an example, the separation efficiency of the copper foam was above 97% for the first cycle. Even after 10 cycles, the as-prepared metallic foam still performed well with a separation efficiency up to 95% and no obvious decrease of its absorption capacity was found, exhibiting its long-term repeatability (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Figure S4</xref>). Although the Cu foams could only absorb the selected five oils and three organic solvents 3.0–6.6 times compared to its own weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, below), it was still a good choice for oil/water separation as a porous superhydrophobic substrate. In addition, the durability and stability of the as-prepared copper foams treated with ODE were investigated by dipping in 0.1 M HCl, 0.1M NaOH, and 3.5% NaCl for 5 min, 10 min, and 12 h, respectively, and the surfaces still exhibited water repellency well as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00097" class="xref">Figure S5 (Supporting Information)</xref>, indicating that the coating film had excellent stability for the practical application.
