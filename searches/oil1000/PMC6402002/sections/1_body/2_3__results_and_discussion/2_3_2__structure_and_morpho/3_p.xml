<p class="p">The XRD spectra of the surface of bare Cu foam and the as-prepared surfaces after being etched and/or modified by four sulfhydryl compounds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. From the pattern, it was clear that all Cu substrates except the glass plate tied with double faced adhesive tape had three typical peaks at 43.5°, 50.6°, and 74.3° for the indices (111), (200), and (220), respectively, suggesting all Cu foams contain a cubic copper phase [

 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. If the Cu foam surfaces existed as oxides, the spectra should include their typical peaks of (110), (111), (200), (211), and (220) for the Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O phases, and of (110), (200), (220), (311), and (222) for the CuO phases, respectively [

 <xref rid="B41-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. From the results that XRD patterns agreed well with the reported data of the Cu element apparently, it could be believed that the Cu foams before and after being etched and/or modified were mainly comprised of pure Cu material devoid of any metal oxides of Cu
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and CuO in the crystallized part of pure material.
