 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The wetting performance decreased obviously after the blank copper foam that was etched with the WCAs increased from 40° to 108.3°. In addition, the longer the alkyl chains for the modified sulfhydryl compound, the stronger the hydrophobic ability. The resulted copper foams modified with the alkyl chain of C
