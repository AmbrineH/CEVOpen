<p class="p">It is reasonably believed that the main reaction includes the initial redox between the Cu atom and FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> enhanced by ultrosound irradiation. The important evidence was that almost all of Cu and Fe ions were removed from the surface after being washed by deionized water and desiccated with N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fully. Another reaction was that sulfhydryl molecules chemisorbed on Cu by the dissociative adsorption of a S−H bond to yield a copper thiolate [
