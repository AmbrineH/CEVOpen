 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> (upper) shows the SEM images of the Cu surface with different magnifications for the blank Cu foam, the etched Cu, and the modified Cu foams using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-EE, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-DE, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-HDE, and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-ODE, respectively. The commercial copper foam possessed a pore size in the range of 100–500 μm and a skeleton width in the range of 20–30 μm. After being etched and/or modified by sulfhydryl compounds, no apparent changes were found for the pore sizes and the skeleton widths. However, as shown in the insets, with 1 μm scaleplate, the blank Cu foam was observed with a very smooth surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a), but many cube particles were found for all other Cu foam surfaces on the micro-scale roughness surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00097-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b–f). Such a dual-scale hierarchical structure favored the superhydrophobicity of the Cu surface. In general, Cu foam was polycrystalline and its grains were distributed randomly. The FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/HCl etching behavior preferentially occurred on the randomly distributed facets or grain boundaries, so the irregular surface with micro/nano structure was created.
