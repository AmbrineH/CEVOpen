<p class="p">In this article, a simple solution-immersion and simultaneous ultrasonication with subsequent modification of four typical sulfhydryl compounds were developed to fabricate the superhydrophobic surface. It was composed of multiscale hierarchical irregular structures, including pure Cu phases, micro-/nano-size particles, and organic films. In addition, the modification mechanism of sulfhydryl compounds onto the surfaces of Cu foams was initially explained, suggesting the main coordination between copper atoms with vacant orbital and sulfur atoms with lone pair electrons. Moreover, the miniature boat made out of Cu foam and loaded with as-spun polystyrene (PS) fibers provided a good solution for the oil cleanup on the water surface. When our miniature oil boat floats on the surface of oil-water mixtures, oil could penetrate through the walls of Cu foam and then diffuse into the as-spun fibers embedded in a string bag rapidly, whereas water was completely repelled. Additionally, the adsorbed oil in the fibers were quickly released by squeezing, thus achieving an efficient way to collect the absorbed oil.</p>
