<p class="p">Constructing an extremely nonwetting surface onto different substrates with the water contact angles (WCAs) more than 150° is a great challenge for its tremendous application in areas, such as self-cleaning [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and anti-icing surfaces [
 <xref rid="B2-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] drag reduction [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and oil-water separation [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Recently, membrane-based metal meshes with special surface wettability have attracted a significant amount of attention for the treatment of increasing industrial oily waste water, as well as frequent oil spill accidents [

 <xref rid="B7-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Due to its excellent thermal and electrical properties, copper, an essential engineering material, is widely used in many fields, including the chemical industry, electronic industry, and computer technology [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Also, copper foil, meshes, or porous substrates are often widely chosen as oil-water separation materials by researchers because of its availability, low cost, and superior mechanic properties and high oil-water separation efficiency [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Oil-water separation could be used in many industrial fields, especially in a crude-oil-treating facility, which could be found from some excellent industrial reports [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the past several years, a lot of methods were reported for processing copper substrates with a superhydrophobic surface for oil–water separation. These methods were generally carried out by electrodeposition [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], chemical etching [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], ultrasound irradiation [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-11-00097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [
