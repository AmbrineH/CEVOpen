Likewise, the designed mini-boat exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity with a load about 10 times of its weight. Moreover, the as-spun PS fibers were produced with the highest oil absorption capacity of 85 times of its weight when using 1% (

Both the as-prepared superhydrophobic mini-ship and the as-spun hydrophobic PS fiber could separate and collect the oil over the water surface in the single or combinational mode and the adsorbed oil could be collected by simple squeezing. The simplicity, fabrication speed, and low cost make this approach potentially suited to industrialization, but further studies about the design of the solid filtration set-up, scale-up experiments, and hydrophobic recovery after long-term use should be done in order to be applied for large scales of oil/water separation.
