<p class="p">This investigation has shown that the Golden Yellow Nistari strain has particular nutritional properties that could make it an interesting alternative to conventional animal protein sources. This insect represents a natural source of carotenoids, especially when fed mulberry leaves. Such natural food also favours the accumulation of beneficial n-3 fatty acids in both the silkworm races. Considering that the scarcity of n-3 in respect to n-6 and the lack of EPA and DHA are the most important drawbacks in the use of insects as fish feed [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], the possibility of positively influencing the silkworm n-3/n-6 ratio using an appropriate feeding substrate may represent an added value in the use of silkworm oil in feed formulation. Even though the protein content was maximum when the insect was fed an artificial diet, using fresh mulberry leaves as feeding substrates gives the silkworm pupae a protein content comparable to that of soybean [
