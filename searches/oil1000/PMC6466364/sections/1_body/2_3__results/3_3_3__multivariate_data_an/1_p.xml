<p class="p">To visualize the chemical divergences of the two strains determined by their growing substrates, a PCA was performed using the data of the silkworm chemical composition. The statistical model of PCA proposed three significant components for a total variance of 11. The first two components explain about 88% of the variance, whereas the variance explained by PC3 was only 12%, so only the first two PC were considered. From the results reported in the biplot of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00103-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, we can deduce that 57% of the variance is associated to the rearing medium: on PC1, all strains fed on the ML diet (right quadrant) had positive scores, whereas strains fed with the AD (left quadrant) had negative scores. PC2, which explained 30% of the variance, was dominated by the type of strain: Golden Nistari had positive scores, and WP had negative scores. Specifically, silkworm pupae of the White Polyhybrid strain fed an artificial diet were characterized by a higher saturated fatty acid content with respect to the other groups; the same strain fed on fresh mulberry leaves was characterized by a larger total fat content with respect to the other samples.
