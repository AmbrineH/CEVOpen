<p class="p">The fatty acid profiles of pupae are reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00103-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Both strains had the highest amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFA), consisting mostly of palmitic (16:0) and stearic acids (C18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), represented by palmitoleic (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1), when fed an artificial diet. Oleic acid was the most representative fatty acid in silkworm pupae, reaching the highest percentage in the Nistari strain fed with an artificial diet.
