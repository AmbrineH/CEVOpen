Pupae of the Nistari strain had a higher moisture percentage than the Polyhybrid regardless of the artificial diet on which larvae matured. Both strains had a higher fat content when fed on fresh mulberry leaves; White Polyhybrid reached a total fat content of 33.3%, which decreased by 10% when fed on the diet. Likewise, Golden Nistari fed on fresh leaves showed a total fat content of 30.6%, which decreased by 5% in the same strain fed on the artificial diet.
