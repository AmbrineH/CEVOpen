<p class="p">Silkworm larvae were reared at the Sericulture Laboratory of Padua (CREA-AA) that preserves about 200 accessions, including geographical strains, mutants, and pure lines of 
 <italic class="italic">B. mori</italic>. Two strains, Golden Yellow Nistari (GN) and White Polyhybrid (WP), which was obtained by the cross of Japanese and Chinese pure lines (four-way hybrid: 118 × 129–120 × 125), were studied. The two strains represent the opposite conditions: Nistari is very similar to the wild ancestor of 
 <italic class="italic">B. mori</italic>, having a coloured cocoon, where pigments contained in the ingested mulberry leaf are stored through digestion in the midgut and transported in the haemolimph. The white cocoon hybrid is a cross of mutant strains widely reared on a massive scale.
