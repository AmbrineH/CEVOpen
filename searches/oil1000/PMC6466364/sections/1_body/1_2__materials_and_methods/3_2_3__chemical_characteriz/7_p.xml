<p class="p">After the total lipid determination, all samples were re-suspended in 4 mL of heptane for fatty acid profile detection according to [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Lipid extract (1 mL) was macerated in 400 µL of a 0.1 M KOH solution in methanol and vortexed for 1 min. The supernatant (0.5 µL) was injected in the Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m long, ID 0.32 mm, df 0.25 µm Mega-10 high polarity column (Mega, Milan, Italy). The injector and detector temperature was 260 °C and the analytes were separated by the following temperature gradient: Initially, T° 140 °C for 1 min, then from 140 °C to 200 °C with an increment of 5 °C/min, subsequently from 200 °C to 260 °C with an increase of 10 °C/min, and finally 260 °C for 3 min.
