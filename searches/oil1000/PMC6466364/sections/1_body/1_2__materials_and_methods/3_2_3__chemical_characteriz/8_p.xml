<p class="p">Solvents for carotenoid detection were chosen according to [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. For analysis, 1 g of sample was extracted at −20 °C by alternating for three times 5 mL of ethanol and twice 5 mL of tetrahydrofuran for 24 h. Each step was performed for a total of 5 days to obtain a clear pellet. Combined supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and 20 µL of this solution was injected in a HPLC system equipped with a dual piston solvent delivery pump LC-10ADvp (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), a low pressure quaternary gradient mixer FCV-10ALvp (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), a thermostated column compartment CTO-10ASvp (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), a vacuum solvent delivery degassers Gastorr 154 (Flom; San Diego, CA, USA), a photodiode array detector UV6000LP (Thermoquest; Waltham, MA, USA), and a chromatographic column Adsorbosphere UHS C18, 150 × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 µm (Alltech; Lokeren, Belgium). According to [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], samples were eluted at a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min by 2 mobile phases: Solution A tris buffer 0.01M pH 7.5—acetonitrile (60-40, v-v), solution B acetonitrile—dioxane (65–35, v-v). For elution, a linear gradient was used: T0 min 35% sol. A and 65% sol. B; T50 min 0% sol. A and 100% sol. B; then, an isocratic gradient was used: From T50 min to T65 min by sol. B 100%
