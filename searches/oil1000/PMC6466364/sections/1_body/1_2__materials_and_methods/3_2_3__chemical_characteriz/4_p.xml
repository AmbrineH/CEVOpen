<p class="p">For free sugar determination, 1 g of freeze-dried samples of substrates was extracted twice with 20 mL of a solution of imidazole buffer 0.05 M, pH 7: ethanol (1:1; v:v), for 12 h. 20 mg of b phenyl D-glucopyranoside were used as internal standard. After centrifugation (9000 rpm for 6 min), the supernatants were combined, and 4 mL of extract were washed twice with 4 mL of chloroform. After purification, the extract was dried by air flow. The dry residue was oximated with 400 µL of a solution of hydroxylamine/pyridine (1:20; p:v) and then silanized with 400 µL of a pyridine:hexamethyldisilazane:trimethylchlorosilane (1:4:1; v:v:v). 0.5 mL derivatized sample was injected in a gas chromatograph (Varian CP 3800) equipped with an injector splitter, a flame ionization detector, and a capillary column (HP1 30 m, 0.25 mm ID df 0.25 mm Agilent). The retention times of standards of the main sugars and organic acids present in the samples were used for qualitative determination. The quantification of each compound was performed using the internal standard calculation method.</p>
