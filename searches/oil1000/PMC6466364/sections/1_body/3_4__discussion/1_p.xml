<p class="p">The chemometric analysis confirmed the differences between the two strains and highlighted the influence of the feeding substrate on the pupa composition. From their positioning on the PCA, it was clear that the two strains differed from each other and that their chemical divergence was accentuated by the type of growing substrate. These results lead us to suppose that the chemical composition of pupae is influenced primarily by the diet, and secondly by the strain.</p>
