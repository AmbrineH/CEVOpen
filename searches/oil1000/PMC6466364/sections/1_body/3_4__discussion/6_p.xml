<p class="p">The fatty acid profile of pupae fed with mulberry leaves was in line with those reported in the literature for silkworm pupae fed in the same way [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The principal factor that influenced the fatty acid composition of pupae was the feeding substrate, with the exceptions of C16:0 (palmitic acid) and C18:1 (oleic acid), which were, respectively, mostly influenced by the strain and by the interaction between strain and feeding substrate. C18:3 was the fatty acid most influenced by the substrate composition and its content in pupae reflected its amount in the substrate. The diet based on fresh leaves induced a higher PUFA content in both strains, with percentages in line with those reported by many authors [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. High levels of PUFAs are typical in insects, especially n-6 [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], while the greater part of the insects considered useful as fish meal is scarce in n-3 [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The analysis of variance showed that the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acid (n3/n6) was almost exclusively affected by the feed substrate factor. In the fat of silkworm pupae grown on fresh leaves, linolenic acid (n-3) was more than three times more represented with respect to linoleic acid (n-6) for White Polyhybrid and 2.8 times higher for the Golden Nistari. When larvae were fed an artificial diet, instead, the ratio of n3/n6 was approximately 1:1 in the pupae.
