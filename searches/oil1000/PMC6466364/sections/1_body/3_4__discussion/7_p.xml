<p class="p">These results are consistent with numerous reports affirming that the fatty acid profiles of insects reflect the composition of their food [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], thus reinforcing the fact that the nutritive value of insect meal could be amplified by acting on the alimentary substrate [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Moreover, although the fatty acid content of silkworm pupae is different from that of fish meal, which is especially rich in long chain n-3 polyunsatured fatty acids, the high content of C 18:3, a precursor of the n-3 series, makes these insects good candidates as oil sources in the formulation of feedstuff.
