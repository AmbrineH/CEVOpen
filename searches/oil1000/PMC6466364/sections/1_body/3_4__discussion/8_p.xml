<p class="p">Carotenoids comprise more than 600 compounds that consist of hydrophobic pigments, affecting insect vision and other important functions, such as coloration, camouflage, and sexual attraction. Animals, including insects, are not able to synthesize these molecules, thus they must be acquired from dietary sources [
