<p class="p">Carotenoids have a double function in feedstuff formulation. Because of their ability to sequester free radicals formed during oxidative processes, they impart stability to the lipid content, preventing or reducing deteriorative processes in stored feed and prolonging safe storage. At the same time, carotenoids colour many important fish and shellfish products, and broilersâ€™ skin and eggs. A range of synthetic and natural carotenoids are available for the aquaculture and poultry industry for pigmenting flesh and eggs [

Natural pigments incorporated into the pupae of Golden Yellow Nistari silkworms could become a cost-effective solution for the formulation of less expensive feeds, considering that adding pigments, especially from natural sources, entails a cost increase of 8% to 10% to the diet cost [
