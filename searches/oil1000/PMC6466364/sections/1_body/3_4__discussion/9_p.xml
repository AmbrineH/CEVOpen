<p class="p">Artificial diet preparation involves subsequent thermal treatments (oven and autoclave) that affect the carotenoid content [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, the almost seven times higher carotenoid content of fresh mulberry leaves with respect to the artificial diet did not determine a corresponding increase of the pigment content in the pupae. Based on our experiments and from PCA, we can infer that the total carotenoid content was mainly influenced by the strain while the substrate composition accounted for less than 20% of the variation. Strain especially influenced the lutein content, while the feed substrate did not show significance as a variability source. In contrast, variation in Î²-carotene was mainly due to substrate composition, whereas strains accounted for 20.6% of the variation.
