<p class="p">Animal husbandry, due to the long feed chain, is highly demanding in terms of resources and is a remarkable source of greenhouse gases (GHG), accounting for almost 12% of global, 19% of anthropogenic, and 36% of agricultural emissions [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Along the feed chain, a large portion of GHG is related to feed field production, especially N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions from soil [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. An environmental priority is to identify and introduce new environmental-friendly and minimum-waste feed resources, especially in terms of protein content. Fishmeal and fish-oil are among the most exploited sources of proteins and fatty acids for feeding livestock and aquaculture [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Approximately 25% of these components are by-products of human fish consumption, while the remaining components come from fish purpose-caught in the open sea [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. This causes an over-exploitation of pelagic resources due to incidental catches of juvenile forms of commercial species. Fishmeal and fish-oil are becoming scarce and expensive, and their quality is not constant because their supply depends on the fish abundance and reproduction rate, which is in turn affected by natural phenomena, such as extreme El Ni√±o events due to climate change [
