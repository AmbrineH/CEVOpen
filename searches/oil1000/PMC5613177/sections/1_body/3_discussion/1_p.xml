<p class="p">Increasing salinity significantly inhibited rosemary plant growth due to the accumulation of salts in plant tissues and reduced vegetative growth which is consistent with several reports (Munns, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Gupta and Huang, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Shrivastava and Kumar, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The improved vegetative growth of several crops following SA treatments had been widely recorded (Gunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kovácik et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Bagherifard et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) reported that 5% SA was effective in enhancing fresh and dry weights and overall plant growth in Artichoke (
 <italic class="italic">Cynara Scolymus</italic> L.) under saline conditions. These morphological effects have been associated with enhanced gas exchange parameters including stomatal closure (Mateo et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Melotto et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Stevens et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) and hormonal status (Abreu and Munné-Bosch, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The relatively stable four major oil constitutes of the Egyptian rosemary found in this study were cineol, camphor, linalool, and α-pinene which showed variations in their overall ratios. Previous investigations reported that the major rosemary oil constitutes are camphor, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, camphene, β-caryophyllene, limonene, α-terpineol, myrcene, p-cymene, bornyl acetate, and linalool (Salido et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Langroudi et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In this study, significant changes in the essential oil composition following saline and SA treatments have been reported. Such variations following drought/SA treatments have been reported in other medicinal plants belonging to the same family (Lamiaceae) such as 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus daenensis Celak. Thymus daenensis Celak</italic> was subjected to drought stress conditions and higher oil yields and changes in specific oil constitutes such as a-pinene, β-caryophyllene, and thymol following SA treatments were recorded (Pribalouti et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Idrees et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) found that SA may increase the essential oil content of plants by increasing nutrient uptake and number of oil glands as well as influencing monoterpene biosynthesis. Langroudi et al. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) also reported that salinity may affect major essential oil constitutes of rosemary plants such as cineol, camphor and α-pinene which is consistent with our results.
