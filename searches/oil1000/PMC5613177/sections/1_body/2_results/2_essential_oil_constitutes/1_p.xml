<p class="p">Ten major oil constitutes were found in the essential oils of rosemary leaves such as cineole, α-pinene, camphor, linalool, borneol, and verbenone (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>). Plants irrigated with tap water (640 ppm NaCl) and sprayed with different doses of SA (100–300 ppm) showed significant differences in all of the 10 essential oil constitutes compared to SA-untreated plants. It was noted that specific oil constitutes decreased following spraying with 100–300 ppm SA in the first season such as that found in α-pinene which decreased from 8.56% in control plants to 4.02% in 640 ppm NaCl and 100 ppm SA treated plant in the first season. However, in the 640 ppm NaCl and 100–300 ppm SA treated plants, there were increases in several compounds such in linalool which increased from 5.43% in control plants to 6.59% in 640 ppm NaCl and 200 ppm SA treated plant in 2016. Similar increases were found in camphor, borneol, and caryophyllene oxide.
