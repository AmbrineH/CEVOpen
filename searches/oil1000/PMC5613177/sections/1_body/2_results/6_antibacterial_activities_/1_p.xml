<p class="p">The antibacterial activities of 2016 season essential oils treatments were compared as shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6" class="xref">6</xref>. There were increases in the antibacterial activities with increasing either salinity or SA treatment concentration. Essential oils MIC were in the range of 0.0001–0.011 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, whereas the MBC were in the range of 0.0004–0.030 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The highest antibacterial activities were found against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> compared to other bacteria. The essential oil of plants treated with 4,000 ppm NaCl and 300 ppm SA showed the highest antibacterial activity ranges with MIC and MBC of 0.0010–0.0001 and 0.0021–0.0004 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. The antibacterial activities of rosemary essential oils were much higher than antibiotics.
