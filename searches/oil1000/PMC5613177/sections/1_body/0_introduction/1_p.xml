<p class="p">Salinity as abiotic stress is a permanent major threat to the agriculture industry worldwide and usually associated with morphological (e.g., reduced growth and productivity), physiological (e.g., reduction of gas exchange parameters and homeostasis), and biochemical (e.g., oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species content) responses (Nazar et al.,

 <sup class="sup">âˆ’</sup> during saline conditions is a detrimental factor that may lead to ion imbalance, ion toxicity, and physiological disorder (Gupta and Huang, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Several approaches had been adopted to control salinity adverse effects on plants including breeding programs and utilization of transgenic plants (Bhatnagar-Mathur et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), chemical priming (Savvides et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), microorganisms (Jha et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), and salicylic acid (Fayez and Bazaid,
