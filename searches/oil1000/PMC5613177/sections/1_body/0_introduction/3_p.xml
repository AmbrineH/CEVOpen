 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinallis</italic> L. (Lamiaceae), commercially known as rosemary, is produced in the Mediterranean region such as in Egypt (Domokos et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>; Elansary and Mahmoud, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Rosemary leaves are consumed fresh or dried and might be used for essential oils production as well as for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (Elansary et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Habtemariam, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Previous investigations have shown that rosemary has antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities (Bozin et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Elansary and Mahmoud, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, there is insufficient information on rosemary bioactivity and its anti-oxidative mechanisms during salt stress and SA treatments. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous SA treatment on rosemary performance under saline conditions. Several important traits of rosemary such as morphological (e.g., plant heights, branches number, and fresh and dry weights), physiological (essential oil ratio and constitutes, phenolics, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, proline, and Na

 <sup class="sup">âˆ’</sup> of leaves), biochemical (antioxidant mechanisms) and genetic (expression of antioxidants genes and genes conferring tolerance to salinity) markers have been investigated in this study. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities against wide spectrum bacteria were investigated as an economic application.
