 </sup> Several species of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium verticillioides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium proliferatum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic> are responsible for the higher fumonisin levels observed in cereals. It is well known that these mycotoxins constitute a principal health risk for domesticated animals, being also associated with a number of human health problems, probably due to the consumption of large amounts of cereal-based products.

 </sup> These emerging problems need increasing attention because of their toxic effects. Particularly worrying is the recently found high contamination levels of breakfast and infant cereals, such as muesli and cornflakes, which usually contain favorable ingredients for fungi colonization, with 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> mycotoxins such as ochratoxin A that has a studied impact on human health.
