 </sup> The aims of this work were to (1) analyze the chemical composition of commercial essential oils of bay leaf, cinnamon, and clove, (2) determine the most important isolates and to identify four pathogens from rice seeds by morphological and molecular techniques, (3) evaluate in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of essential oils, and (4) evaluate a natural biofilm we have created as an antifungal product for rice conservation.
