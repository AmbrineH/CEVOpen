<p class="p">Clove and cinnamon essential oils with the highest amounts (89.37 and 56.34%, respectively) of eugenol, contrary to bay leaf essential oil containing 58.07% of the oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineole, have a significant antifungal effect against the four pathogenic fungi isolated from rice grains. In vivo studies showed that eugenol used with a polysaccharide such as agar–agar forms a fine coat that wraps the inoculated rice grains, creating a natural biofilm and reducing the development of all pathogenic fungi (80–95%) for 30 days. Eugenol could be used as an effective nontoxic preservative in stored rice grains against
