 </sup> and in the commercial clove oil analyzed here, the main compound is the phenylpropanoid eugenol (89.37 ± 0.29%), followed by the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons β-caryophyllene (6.02 ± 0.41%) and α-humulene (1.70 ± 0.09%). Only two compounds, caryophyllene oxide (0.77 ± 0.04%) and humulene epoxide (0.15 ± 0.01%), were detected in the oxygenated sesquiterpene fraction. In addition, neither hydrocarbons nor oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the commercial 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> essential oil analyzed here. However, the main compounds found in 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</italic> were the phenylpropanoid eugenol (56.34 ± 0.41%), eugenol acetate (19.48 ± 0.13%), 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-cinnamyl acetate (6.52 ± 0.03%), and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (2.08 ± 0.00%), along with a large amount of the aromatic compound benzyl benzoate (4.81 ± 0.03%). On the other hand, in this essential oil, 30 compounds biosynthesized from the mevalonic acid pathway were identified but only the monoterpene hydrocarbon β-phellandrene (1.00 ± 0.03%), the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon β-caryophyllene (1.81 ± 0.01%), and the oxygenated sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide (1.05 ± 0.03%) reached percentages close to or higher than 1%. Finally, oxygenated monoterpenes were quantitatively the minor fraction (1.14 ± 0.04%) in cinnamon essential oil, with linalool (0.57 ± 0.01%), α-terpineol (0.17 ± 0.01%), terpinen-4-ol (0.1 3± 0.00%), and borneol (0.12 ± 0.00%) as the main compounds. Although both essential oils have the same main compound, eugenol (89.37 ± 0.29 vs 56.34 ± 0.41%), commercial clove essential oil contains a higher quantity of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (8.06 ± 0.50 vs 2.56 ± 0.02%), whereas commercial cinnamon essential oil has more oxygenated sesquiterpenes (1.40 ± 0.03 vs 0.90 ± 0.03%) and both hydrocarbons (3.84 ± 0.13%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (1.14 ± 0.04%) that were not detected in clove essential oil. 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> and

 </sup> Although 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> has a lower content of eugenol than 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic>, the presence of eugenol acetate (19.48 ± 0.13%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamyl acetate (6.52 ± 0.03%), benzyl benzoate (4.81 ± 0.03%), and
