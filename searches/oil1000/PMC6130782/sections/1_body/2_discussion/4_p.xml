 </sup> However, the tested bay leaf essential oil with a high content of the oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineol did not show a significant antifungal effect against the four pathogenic fungi isolated from rice grains. These results are in accordance with the potency level of antifungal activity measured as in vitro mycelial growth of the main compounds (thymol &gt; eugenol &gt; carvone &gt; terpinen-4-ol &gt; 1,8-cineole) of essential oils.
