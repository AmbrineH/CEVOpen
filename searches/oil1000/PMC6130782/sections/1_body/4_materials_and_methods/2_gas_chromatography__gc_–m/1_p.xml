<p class="p">A gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was carried out with Agilent 5973N apparatus, equipped with a capillary column (95 dimethylpolysiloxane-5% diphenyl) and an HP-5MS UI (30 m long and 0.25 mm i.d. with 0.25 μm film thickness). The column temperature program was 60 °C for 5 min, with 3 °C/min increases to 180 °C and then 20 °C/min increases to 280 °C. This program was maintained for 10 min. Helium was the carrier gas used at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Split mode injection (ratio 1:30) was employed. Mass spectra were taken over the
