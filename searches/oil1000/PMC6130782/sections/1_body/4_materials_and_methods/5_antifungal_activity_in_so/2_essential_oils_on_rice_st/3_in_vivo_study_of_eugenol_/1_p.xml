<p class="p">Rice caryopsis inoculated with the molds were placed inside 150 × 150 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> plastic boxes, 100 seeds per box. Two concentrations (300 and 600 μg/mL) of eugenol were prepared in Tween 20 (0.1%)–agar 0.25%. Then, 5 mL of each solution was sprayed into the boxes. The seeds were wetted with the prepared solutions and dried to complete dryness, forming a fine coating. Controls were prepared similarly for volatile treatment with equal amounts of sterilized water/Tween 20 (0.1%)–agar 0.25% but without eugenol. All boxes were then transferred to storage at 28 °C and high relative humidity (90–95%) for 30 days. The percentage of infected rice grains was recorded after 30 days of incubation with an Olympus SZX10 magnifying glass.
