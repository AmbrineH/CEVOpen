<p class="p">The eugenol (98%) used in this study was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Inoculated rice caryopsis were placed into Petri dishes containing PDA-bay leaf, PDA-clove, and PDA-cinnamon, 300 μg/mL (5 seeds per plate). For each fungus, six replicate dishes were used. Plates were incubated in the dark at 25 °C and high relative humidity (90–95%) for 30 days. Control Petri dishes contained equal amounts of sterilized water/Tween 20 (0.1%) on PDA but without essential oils. Fungal growth was evaluated through observation for 30 days.</p>
