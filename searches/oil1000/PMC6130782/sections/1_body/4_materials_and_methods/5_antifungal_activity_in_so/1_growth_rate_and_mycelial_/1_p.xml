<p class="p">Essential oils were dissolved, mixed, and homogenized in previously sterilized and still liquid PDA/Tween 20 (0.1%) at 300 μg/mL. Then, it was distributed in 90 × 15 and 150 × 15 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> Petri dishes. Fungi were sowed in the center of each Petri dish with 8 mm discoid explants from a 7 day culture. Petri dish plates were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 7 and 14 days. Control Petri dishes only had PDA/Tween 20 (0.1%). Fungi growth was evaluated by measuring the daily diameter of the colony in two perpendicular directions, calculating the speed of growth. Six repetitions were made per treatment. MGI also was calculated according to the following formula at 100, 200, and 300 μg/mL
