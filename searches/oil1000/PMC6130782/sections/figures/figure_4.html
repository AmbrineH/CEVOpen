 <p> Experiment 1. Effect of essential oils on rice grain conservation after 30 days. From left to right: A. alternata on PDA, PDA-bay leaf, PDA-clove, and PDA-cinnamon (300 Î¼g/mL). The PDA and PDA-bay leaf plates show the development of the inoculated fungus A. alternata plus endophytic mycobiota, whereas the PDA-cinnamon and PDA-clove plates show total inhibition of the development of A. alternata and endophytic mycobiota. </p>
