<p class="p">Microwave power, rose water temperature, ultrasound power, and ultrasonic exposure time were effective on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> count and energy/cycle. The final temperature of the rose water in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> count was more important than the microwave power that causes the temperature. The effect of microwave power on EPC was more than temperature. The ultrasound power was more effective in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in rose water as compared to the microwave power. Both sample temperature and ultrasonic duration were important independent variables and effective factors on 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> reduction. The main compounds of rose water pasteurized by the combined method had acceptable decrease as compared to raw rose water. Some compounds like Lianalool and cryptone were observed in combined method pasteurized sample while were completely lost in the conventional pasteurization method. Conventional pasteurization method caused to lose the chemical compounds of raw rose water and this would necessitate using non-thermal alternative methods to pasteurize rose water.
