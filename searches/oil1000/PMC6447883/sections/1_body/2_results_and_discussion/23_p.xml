<p class="p">At the end, the aimed process was optimized. The objective function was Equation 3 and the relationship between the amounts of consumed energy. The aim of this optimization was to achieve a condition for the independent variables (microwave power, sample temperature, and ultrasonic exposure time) in which with the lowest energy consumption, the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in the sample would be equal to zero. Boundary conditions in optimization process were specified so that values of independent variables were placed in the test range. All of the independent and dependent variables were assigned with identical weights and in the desirable end, minimizing the objective function was selected (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The optimum values for the microwave power, the sample temperature, ultrasound power, and ultrasound time were obtained as 326.4 W, 43.32 °C, 112.3 W, and 4.36 min, respectively. For these mentioned values, the amount of residual 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was equal to 0. Finally, to verify the optimal point, the independent variables were rounded to the nearest integer to have practical applicability. Accordingly, the microwave power, sample temperature, ultrasound power, and ultrasonic exposure time were equal to 300 W, 45 °C, 100 W, and 4 min, respectively. 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was determined in the laboratory and its value was equal to zero. This indicates the high accuracy of the analytical and optimization method.
