<p class="p">The effects of variables, including ultrasound power, microwave power, sample temperature, and ultrasonic exposure time on the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> count in the rose water were investigated. Finally, the results were modelled and optimized. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the quadratic model showed that this model had a significant reduction on the
