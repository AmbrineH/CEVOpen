<p class="p">According to 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, all coefficients of model except for the interaction of microwave power × ultrasound power were significant at 10% level. Therefore, in order to simplify, the interaction of microwave power × ultrasound power was removed from the fitted model. The adjusted values for the coefficient of determination, the coefficient of variation (C.V) and standard error of the new model were respectively equal to 0.9998, 0.32, and 0.65. The final equation was obtained as follows (4):
