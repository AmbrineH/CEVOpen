 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> indicates a direct relationship between the ultrasonic power and the rate of energy changes in a cycle of inactivation. It is observed that increasing the ultrasonic power from 100 W to 200 W increases the consumed energy to 58%. However, twice increasing of temperature caused 24% decrease in the energy consumption during a cycle of inactivation. In other words, it can be said that the changes in the temperature and the amount of energy consumed per a cycle were inversely related to each other. According to (Equation 4), due to the positivity of the ultrasonic power coefficient and negativity of the temperature coefficient, and also because of the higher value of the ultrasonic power coefficient, it can be concluded that the ultrasonic power had a direct effect on the energy consumption per a cycle.
