<p class="p">The data from GC/MS were used to identify the components of the samples. They are listed in the order of their elution from a DB-5 column (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Finally, the analysis of the GC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>) and comparison between the conventional thermal pasteurization method and the proposed method in this study showed that the composition of pasteurized product in the combination method was closer to the raw rose water. In total, 18-26 constituents were detected and identified in the samples. Identification was determined for 72.28–88.31% of the essential oil components. Other research results revealed that phenethyl alcohol, geraniol, and b-citronellol were the main constituents of the most samples. This study like other researches was confirmed that Phenethyl alcohol is the main component of natural rose and rose water and because of its high polarity and water solubility, it remained dissolved in the distillate water (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Phenethyl alcohol that is one of the main compounds of rose water, was completely lost in the conventional pasteurization method, while in the combined method showed an acceptable decrease as compared with raw rose water. Other compounds, such as Linalool and Cryptone were completely lost during the conventional thermal method, while they were observed in the product of the proposed method. It should be noted that some compounds such as Terpinene&lt;alpha&gt;, β-Citronellol, 7- Octene-2,6-diol, 2,6-dimethyl (which have small amounts in the raw rose water) were not detected in both of the conventional and combined methods. In the other research, various methods were applied to ensure the compositional quality and microbial safety of rose oil during shelf life. The methods used in the study were conventional pasteurization and ultra violet treatment, Phenoxyethanol and sodium benzoate application. Although there were minor compositional differences among methods, it was shown that all methods provided satisfactory prevention of microbial spoilage (
