<p class="p">According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">Figure 9b</xref>, ultrasonic exposure time has more effect on the consumed energy changes per one cycle as compared with the temperature changes. Increasing sonication time from 2 to 6 min resulted in 60% increase in the energy consumption. According to Equation 4 it can be concluded that due to positivity of time coefficient, there is a direct relationship between the time and the amount of consumed energy per a cycle.
