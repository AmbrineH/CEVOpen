 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, some coefficients of model are not significant for microbial reduction. Therefore, in order for simplification, they were removed from the fitted model. The adjusted coefficient of determination, coefficient of variation (C.V) and standard error of the model were 0.9934, 83%, and 0.031, respectively. The final equation was obtained as follows (2):
