<p class="p">According to the results, the importance of final temperature of rose water to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was more than the microwave power (producing factor of temperature); because increasing the temperature has led to an increase in the gradient of microbial decreasing but, increase in the microwave power has milder gradient than temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4a</xref>). Increasing the power of the microwave from 300 W to 600 W caused 5.59% decrease in the total microbial count, but increasing temperature from 30 °C to 60 °C reduced the microbial count by 28.7%. However, increasing the temperature to 60 °C by the microwave power (because of the higher speed of reaching to the mentioned temperatures and lacking sufficient time for microorganisms to be adapted with the new conditions), increased the reduction of

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). These results can be found from Equation 2 that multiplying the microwave power by the temperature has a negative coefficient. This means that with increase in the amount of two mentioned independent variables, the result of Equation 2 would be a greater negative number which indicates a more reduction in the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Destruction of microbes or enzymes by microwaves in lethal temperature is due to the selected heating property and interruption of cell membranes. Microorganisms were selectively heated due to the dielectric property, which causes them to become warmer in comparison with the temperature of the surrounding liquid, and consequently, collapse of the cellular structure (
