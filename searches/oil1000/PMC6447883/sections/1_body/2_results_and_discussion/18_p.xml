<p class="p">Considering the higher gradient of the ultrasonic power as compared with time changes and given the positivity of both variables, it can be deduced that the changes of ultrasonic power had greater effects on the energy changes per cycle (

Moreover, due to negativity and low values of microwave changes gradient versus the variations of sonication time, it can be concluded that the effect of microwave power on the energy changes per each cycle was lower than the sonication time (
