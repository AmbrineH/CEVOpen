<p class="p">The effect of ultrasound power was higher than microwave power in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Twice increasing of ultrasound power from 100 W to 200 W caused 29% decrease in the total microbial count, but twice increasing of microwave power from 300 to 600 reduced the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli </italic>count by 5.59%. By increasing the ultrasound power, its lethal effects increase. The reason for this decline of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> count can be justified by the increased range of horn motion in the fluid. Increasing the motion range causes to increase the number of bubbles formed in the fluid, and thereby, an increase in the cavitation is expected (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). Several researches were carried out on the effects of ultrasound power in the reduction of microbial count. In a study on the orange juice, by applying ultrasound treatment (20 kHz, 500 W ultrasonic treatments in the ranges of 50, 60 and 75%), logarithmic cycles of mesospheric aerobic bacteria, mould and yeast were reduced by 1.38 and 0.56, respectively. Furthermore, the treated sample (75% of sound range for 8 min) showed more shelf life than the control by 4 days (
