<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">Figure 9a</xref>, increasing temperature from 30 °C to 60 °C decreased E. coli as much as 28.7%, while three-folds increasing of time from 2 min to 6 min only caused a 7.3% decrease in E. coli count. Therefore, the effect of temperature on the inactivation of microorganisms can be more than time. As temperature rises, the effect of ultrasound and cavitation intensity decreases, but in general, the effect of temperature and ultrasound on E. coli reduction is more than the time when each process has been used individually. These results can be observed in another study that evaluated the effect of ultrasound and microwave on the
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> count during pasteurization of sour cherry juice. The microwave (352.21 W and 49.94 °C) and ultrasound (475.13 W for 6 min) methods were used. The results showed that temperature was more effective factor to decrease the total microbial count (
