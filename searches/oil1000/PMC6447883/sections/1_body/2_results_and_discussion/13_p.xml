 <italic class="italic">E. coli </italic>inactivation was higher than the effect of temperature created by microwave power. Increasing the microwave power from 300 W to 600 W did not have a significant effect on the energy changes per a cycle while increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 60 °C caused 24% reduction in consumed energy per each cycle (
