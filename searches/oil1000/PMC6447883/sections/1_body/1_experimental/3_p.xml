<p class="p">The first part of the system was a primary storage tank for aromatic waters. With starting the system, rose water was poured into the microwave oven by gravity force. The microwave power was used for aromatic water preheating. By reaching the sample temperature to the set point and providing the selected power, the product was transferred from microwave to the ultrasonic reactor to perform the ultrasound treatments. In the microwave compartment, two holes were made to pass the connecting tubes.
