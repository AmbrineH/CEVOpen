<p class="p">Once the lyophilized standard strain of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> vial was opened, the strain was cultivated on an agar nutrient culture (Micromedia, Hungary). Therefore, a loop of grown microbial strain on agar was inoculated with a 25 mL nutrient liquid culture (NLC) under sterile conditions in order to prepare the microbial suspension. The final concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in the inoculum was determined by plating serial dilutions on NLC and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h. The liquid culture containing the grown cells was centrifuged for 5 min at speed of 8000 rpm. Afterwards, the resulting cellular mass was suspended in the sterile aromatic water sample. A total of 3 mL of this suspension was inoculated into 300 mL of aromatic water sample to a final concentration of 2 × 10
