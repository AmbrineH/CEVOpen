<p class="p">GC analysis was done using a Thermoquest gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). The analysis was carried out using a fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 µm). The injector and detector temperatures were kept at 250 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas with flow rate of 1.1 mL/min; oven temperature program was 60–250 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, and finally held isothermally for 10 min; the split ratio was 1:100.</p>
