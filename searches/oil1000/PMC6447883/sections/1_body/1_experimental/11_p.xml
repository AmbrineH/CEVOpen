<p class="p">GC/MS analysis was performed using a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with the same column, coupled with a TRACE mass ion trap detector (Manchester, UK). Helium was used as carrier gas with an ionization voltage of 70 eV. Ion source and interface temperatures were 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The mass range was from 40 to 460 m/z. Oven temperature program was the same as the mentioned above for the GC. After injection, the essential oil ingredients were isolated by the gas chromatography and then the compounds were identified by mass spectrometer. Linear hydrocarbon series 8-24 were also injected into the gas chromatography at the same conditions. Essential oil compounds were identified based on the comparisons of Retention Time (RT), Kovat›s Index (KI), and mass spectra of each compound with libraries of Wiley and Adams 2007 (
