<p class="p">One of the other new technologies which is used for food processing is microwave heating. Microwaves are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that have a frequency between 300 MHz to 300 GHz. But the most commonly used frequencies are 915 MHz and 2450 MHz, which have wavelengths in the range of 12 to 34 cm, respectively (

Microwave heating is due to food ability to absorb microwave energy and convert them into the heat. In conventional methods, the heat from an external source is transferred to the food, but the microwave heating is due to ion conduction or dipole rotation in the foods (
