<p class="p">One of the most widely used forms of medicinal plants is their aromatic water. The aromatic water is aqueous solution of a volatile oil or other volatile substance prepared by distillation from a plant or a mixture of different plants (

 <italic class="italic">Rosa damascene.</italic> It is a traditional product that has long history in Iran and global reputation (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). The value of this product depends on the amount of microorganisms present, the essential oil content, and its naturalness. In some cases, rose water corruption is associated with turbidity. In case of aromatic waterÂ contamination with pathogens, these bacteria can be replicated in this environment. The contamination of herbal aromatic water is usually caused by raw materials, used water, packaging containers, and incomplete thermal processing. In addition to industrial applications, rose water is used to treat rheumatic and cardiovascular pains, as well as in food industries like baking pastries making (

Pasteurization is a process in which microbes found in foods such as bacteria, viruses, and mould are killed or their growth slowed down (

One of the conventional methods for microbial inactivation of products is pasteurization with thermal treatment that increases the shelf life; however, using high temperature causes undesirable changes in taste, colour, odour, and medicinal properties, as well as a nutritional quality decreasing and essential oil content (
