<p class="p">Ultrasound waves referred to as sound waves with, frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Usually, the highest frequency for human hearing is approximately 20 kHz (

Researchers believe that cavitation causes mechanical effects and sonochemical reactions such as Creation of free radicals and molecular compounds, as well as oxygenated water. In general, cavitation is a phenomenon resulting in the production of a large number of micro bubbles in a liquid when there is a negative pressure. When sound waves propagate in a liquid environment, they create dense and sparse areas.
