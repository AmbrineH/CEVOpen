<p class="p">After several cycles, these micro-bubbles grow as the unstable size and suddenly collapse by releasing a large amount of energy and producing temperatures higher than 5000 Â°K. The collapsed bubbles, cause severe shear forces in the fluid which is being stirred with pressure and this consequently splits adjacent particles (

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2007) examined the effect of ultrasound and mild temperature on the active and inactive microorganisms in orange juice during the sonication process and afterwards. It was found that use of ultrasound in combination with other methods was effective to reduce the microbial activity and increased storage time (
