<p class="p">The intermolecular distance extends between liquid molecules along these waves. At very low pressure in sparse areas of liquid, intermolecular distances exceed critical molecular distance and split liquid to form empty spaces or micro-bubbles. These microbubbles oscillate with motion of the wave and become larger by connecting other micro-bubbles (
