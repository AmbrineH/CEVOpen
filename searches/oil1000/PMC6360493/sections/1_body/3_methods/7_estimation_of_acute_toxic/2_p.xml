<p class="p">In order to identify the acute toxicity of the essential oil with few animals, a limit test was conducted according to OECD 425 guidelines. The animals were maintained in cages for at least 5 days prior to dosing to allow adaptation to the laboratory conditions. The EOZC (1000 mg/kg IP) was initially administered to one animal, followed by 24 hours observation. If the animal survived, 4 additional animals were sequentially administered with EOZC (1000 mg/kg, IP) under similar conditions. A total of 5 animals were tested. Observation was carried on for 14 days.</p>
