<p class="p">The chemical compounds of EOZC was determined by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (Thermo Quest Finningan, UK), as presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The GC-MS instrument was 5% phenyl methyl silicone and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane and equipped with DB5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). An electron ionization mode with ionization energy of 70 eV was used to determine the EOZC constituents (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shahbazi, 2015</xref>). The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min, with linear velocity of 29.6 cm/s and split ratio of 1:20. The initial oven temperature was held at 50°C for 3 min, then raised to 265°C at program ramp rate of 2.5°C/min. The final temperature was 265°C and maintained for 6°C. The temperature of the injector was 250°C. To improve accuracy of the results, the GC-MS analysis was performed in triplicate.
