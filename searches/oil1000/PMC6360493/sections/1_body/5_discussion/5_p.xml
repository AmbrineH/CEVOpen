The IP injection of EOZC revealed a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect on both phases of formalin-induced nociception in rats. Considering the effectiveness of EOZC in suppression of paw licking time in both phases of the formalin test, it seems that the analgesic activity of Z. clinopodioides is mediated by both peripheral and central antinociceptive mechanisms. Based on the GC-MS results, EOZC contained high concentrations of phenolic compounds including carvacrol (65.22%), thymol (19.51%), pcymene (4.86%) and Î³-terpinene (4.63%). Several studies have reported the chemical composition of EOZC (
