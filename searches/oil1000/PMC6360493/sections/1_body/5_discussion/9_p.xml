<p class="p">Naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist) was evaluated in the formalin test to explore the effect of endogenous opioidergic system on the antinociception mechanism exerted by EOZC. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of μ, δ and κ receptors, with a high affinity for the μ receptor (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trescot et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings revealed that the antinociception caused by the EOZC was significantly attenuated by the pre-treatment of rats with naloxone (2 mg/kg), thus it reverses the analgesic activity of EOZC, to some extent.
