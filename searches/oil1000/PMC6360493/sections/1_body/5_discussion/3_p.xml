<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first report on the interaction of antinociceptive effect of the EOZC and opioidergic system by the formalin test in rats. Two phases of pain were evoked by formalin injection into the hind paw of the animals. Each phase of formalin test has different mechanisms of nociception. The first phase consists of neurogenic nociception, by direct stimulation of nociceptors (via C fibers) to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after substance P is secreted and acts as a neurotransmitter. The second phase consists of inflammatory-induced pain because of release of various inflammatory mediators such as serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, Prostaglandins (PGs) and excitatory amino acids from the tissue damaged by formalin (
