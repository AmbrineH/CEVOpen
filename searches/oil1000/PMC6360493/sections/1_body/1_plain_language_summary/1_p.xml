<p class="p">Pain is a displeasing sensation associated with tissue damage. Medicinal plants have been widely used in the treatment of pain. The essential oils are volatile molecules and have shown many biological activities, such as analgesic activity. In this study, we described the antinociceptive effect of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Ziziphora clinopodioides</italic> (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, IP). Antinociceptive activity was investigated by measuring the nociception induced by formalin. EOZC dose-dependently suppressed both phases of formalin pain. Additionally, pretreatment with naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effect of the EOZC, suggesting the involvement of opioidergic system and its receptors. These results confirm the ethnomedical uses of
