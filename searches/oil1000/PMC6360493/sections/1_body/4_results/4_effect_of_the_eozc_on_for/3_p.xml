<p class="p">The EOZC at dose of 10 mg/kg did not show any significant effect on both first and second phases of formalin pain in comparison with vehicle treated group (P&gt;0.05). However, 20 and 40 mg/kg of EOZC induced a significant reduction in the pain response compared to the vehicle group in a dose-dependent manner in both first (39.16±3.80 s and 31.33±3.76 s, respectively) and second (121.66±10.44 s and 108.50±11.87 s, respectively) phases (P&lt;0.05). As expected, the standard drug morphine (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the nociceptive response in both first (10.33±2.61 s) and second (87.00±8.05 s) phases of formalin test, compared to vehicle treated group (P&lt;0.05) (
