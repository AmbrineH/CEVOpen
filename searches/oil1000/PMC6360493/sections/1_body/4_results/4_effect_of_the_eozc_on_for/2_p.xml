<p class="p">The intraplantar injection of formalin 2% produced a biphasic pain-related behavior. Effects of normal saline and vehicle (Tween-80, 0.5%) on licking and biting time of the injected paw in male rats are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. No significant differences were observed on the first phase of pain in the control (72.16±6.39 s) and Tween-80 (0.5%) (66.50±5.02 s) groups (P&gt;0.05). In addition, no significant differences were observed on the second phase of pain in the control (208.50±15.21 s) and Tween-80 (0.5%) (196.66±14.43 s) groups (P&gt;0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the data obtained from the experimental groups were compared with vehicle treated group.
