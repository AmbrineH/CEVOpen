  <italic class="italic">Torreya grandis</italic> Fort. ex Lindl. is a plant belonging to the Taxaceae family and
  <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis </italic>cv. Merrillii is the only grafted and thoroughbred species belonging to this species. In this study, we extracted five different seed oils, including
  <italic class="italic"> T. grandis</italic> seed oil (TGSO),
  <italic class="italic"> T. grandis</italic> “Xiangyafei” seed oil (XYSO),
  <italic class="italic"> T. grandis</italic> “Zhimafei” seed oil (ZMSO),
  <italic class="italic"> T. grandis </italic>“Majus”seed oil (TGMSO), and
  <italic class="italic"> T. grandis</italic> “cunguangfei” seed oil (CGSO) using physical pressure. The resulting extracts were analyzed to determine their fatty acid composition, antioxidant activity, and inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase. The results of the antioxidant activity assays revealed that XYSO and ZMSO exhibited much greater DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power than TGSO. Notably, all five of the seed oils showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase. XYSO and TGSO gave the highest activities of all of the seed oils tested in the current study against monophenolase and diphenolase, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 227.0 and 817.5
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The results of this study show that wild TGSOs exhibit strong antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities. These results therefore suggest that wild TGSOs could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidant agents and tyrosinase inhibitors.
