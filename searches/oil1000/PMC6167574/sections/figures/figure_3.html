 <p> Determination of the mode of tyrosinase inhibition for the seed oils derived from the five different species of T. grandis. Lineweaver–Burk plots for the tyrosinase activity (monophenolase activity) using L-tyrosine as a substrate with seed oil concentrations of 50 (□), 100 (●), 200 (■), 400 (▲), and 800 (◆) μg/ml (The inset represents the slope (Km/Vmax) versus seed oil concentration ( μg/ ml).) (a) TGSO, (b) XYSO, (c) ZMSO, (d) TGMSO, and (e) CGSO. </p>
