<p class="p">It is generally believed that there are four main methods for inhibiting tyrosinase activity: (1) affecting the chelating activity of copper at the active site of the enzyme, thereby preventing the binding of copper ions to oxygen, leading to the irreversible deactivation of tyrosinase [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]; (2) the introduction of a powerful antioxidant, thereby preventing the activation of oxygen by tyrosinase [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]; (3) the use of a free radical scavenging agent to prevent the formation of melanins [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]; and (4) the use of competitive inhibitors. Compounds with high antioxidant and radical scavenging activities could inhibit tyrosinase [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The seed oils derived from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> in the current study all exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase (especially TGSO and XYSO), most likely because of their strong antioxidant activity. It is possible that the free radical scavenging activities of these oils prevented the initiation of a radical chain, thereby inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by reducing the supply of oxygen during the tyrosinase reaction. There could be several antioxidants present in
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya</italic> seed oils, which could reduce the catalytic activity of tyrosinase by preventing the active effect of oxygen on tyrosinase. However, only in vitro experiments showed that seed oil of the five T.
 <italic class="italic"> grandis</italic> has the potential application as skin-whitening, the research has yet to be validated by animal experiments in vivo. Although the diphenolase IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> are not particularly low in seed oil, it has no powerful inhibition of tyrosinase, but some of their constituents might be more effective and have strong whitening effect. Further in depth studies would be required involving the individual components to accurately determine which compounds are responsible for inhibiting this enzyme. These findings suggest that wild TGSOs (especially XYSO) exhibit significant antioxidant and inhibitory activities towards tyrosinase (especially diphenolase), and that they could therefore be used to develop skin-whitening and/or anti-food-browning agents. Notably, the yields of the wild TGSOs (XYSO and ZMSO were particularly outstanding) were similar to that of TGSO, highlighting the potential for wild seeds to be converted into edible oils.
