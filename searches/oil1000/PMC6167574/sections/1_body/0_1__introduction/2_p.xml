<p class="p">From an agricultural perspective, the overexpression of tyrosinase is related to the discoloration of some fruits and vegetables, as well as changes in their flavor and nutritional characteristics, which can have an adverse impact on their commercial value. The development of new biocompatible tyrosinase inhibitors capable of reducing the production of quinone and hydroquinone to prevent enzymatic browning and improve the color and nutritional characteristics of food is therefore highly desirable [

Several synthetic tyrosinase inhibitors have been reported in the literature, such as kojic acid, which is widely used as a skin-whitening agent in cosmetics. However, the use of this compound in this context has been associated with several serious side effects, including erythema and contact dermatitis [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Further research is therefore required to identify natural and biocompatible tyrosinase inhibitors that can be used as whitening agents and antibrowning agents in the cosmetic and food industries.
