<p class="p">Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.0) is a copper-containing mixed-function oxidase that is ubiquitously expressed in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Furthermore, tyrosinase is a key rate-limiting enzyme that can catalyze enzyme browning and melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase also exhibits monophenolase and diphenolase activities, which catalyze the hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA and the oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone, which can undergo nonenzymatic polymerization to give dark pigments [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Free radicals also play an important role in the biosynthesis of melanin, and several studies have shown that free radicals are involved in the catalytic reactions of tyrosinase to give dopaquinone, which can undergo various oxidation reactions. Increasing in the number or the activity of the free radicals present in living systems can therefore lead to an increase in the production of melanin [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Materials capable of inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase have attracted worldwide interest from researchers working in a variety of different fields, including biological medicine, agricultural sciences, chemistry, and pharmacology. Tyrosinase inhibitors capable of inhibiting the biosynthesis of melanin are used currently in various hyperpigmentation and cosmetic agents to control the formation of freckles [
