<p class="p">TRP was determined using a previously published method [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Briefly, 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of each sample was treated with 2.5 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 mol/L, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide, and the resulting mixture was incubated at 50°C for 30 min. The sample was then treated with 2.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 4000
 <italic class="italic"> ×g</italic> for 10 min. The upper layer (2.5 mL) was collected and mixed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% ferric chloride and 2.5 mL of distilled water. The absorbance of the resulting mixture was then measured at 700 nm against a blank. Several Trolox standards were prepared as calibration solutions with concentrations in the range of 0.04–0.80 mg/ml. Each sample was tested three times (n=3), and the results were expressed as TEAC with units of mmol Trolox equivalents/g.
