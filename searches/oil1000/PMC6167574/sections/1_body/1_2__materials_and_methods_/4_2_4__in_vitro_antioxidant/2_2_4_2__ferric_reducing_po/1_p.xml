<p class="p">The FRAP assay was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Fresh FRAP reagent was prepared each day by mixing 300 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of acetate buffer (pH 3.6, 0.3 mol/L) with 30 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of TPTZ (10 mmol/L) and 30 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of iron(III) chloride (20 mM). A small sample (10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) was added to 300 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the FRAP reagents described above, and the resulting mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was then measured at 593 nm. Each sample was tested three times (n=3), and the results were expressed as TEAC with units of mmol Trolox equivalents/g.
