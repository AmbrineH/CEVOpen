<p class="p">The inhibition kinetics of the different seed oils (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) towards tyrosinase were determined using different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mM) of L-DOPA and L-tyrosine. The type of inhibition was analyzed using a Lineweaver–Burk plot. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. The enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant (K

 <sub class="sub">m</sub> values were obtained from the slope of each plot and the y-intercept versus the seed oil concentration, respectively [
