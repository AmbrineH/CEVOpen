<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was conducted on a Bruker SCION SQ 456 Gas Chromatograph (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA), which was attached to a mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph system was equipped with a nonpolar, HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 250

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m), which was coated with 5% phenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane, as well as a flame ionization detector (FID). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 45°C for 2 min; 45 to 270°C at a rate of 10°C/min; and 270°C for 6 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at the rate 1 mL/min. All of the oil samples were dissolved in hexane at a concentration of 0.1 mg/
