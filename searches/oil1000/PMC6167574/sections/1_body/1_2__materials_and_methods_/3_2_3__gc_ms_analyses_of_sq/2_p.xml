<p class="p">Mass spectra were recorded in the EI mode at 70 eV with a scan quality range of 50-550 amu. Temperature of the ionization source is 200Â°C, voltage of the detector is 350 V. Mass spectra data for the different peaks were cross referenced with those found in the NIST27 and WILEY7 libraries to identify the different components. Each mass spectrogram corresponding to each chromatographic peak is qualitatively determined by computer chart-base; the relative content of each component is calculated by the peak area normalization method according to its total ion current chart.</p>
