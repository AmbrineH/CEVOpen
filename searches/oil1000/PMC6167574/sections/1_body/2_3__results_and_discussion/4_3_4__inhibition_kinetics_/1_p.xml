<p class="p">The inhibition kinetics of the five different oils were analyzed using the Lineweaverâ€“Burk method to determine their inhibitory activities towards diphenolase and monophenolase, and the corresponding plots are shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3</xref>. The results revealed that the K
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> values of the oils varied considerably with increasing concentration, whereas their V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values remained largely unchanged. This result indicated that all five oils were behaving as competitive inhibitors of diphenolase and monophenolase. The inhibition constants (K
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>) of the different oils are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, together with their K
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> and V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values.
