<p class="p">Plant seed oils continue to receive growing interest from researchers working in a variety of different fields, including chemists, pharmacists, and physicians because of their potential applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries [

 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> cv. Merrillii is the only grafted and thoroughbred species of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis </italic>Fort. ex Lindl to have been reported in the literature to date and its seeds possess a unique flavor, as well as being rich in nutrients. Despite their huge potential, wild
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> are currently poorly utilized, especially those that cannot be eaten, with most of these plant resources simply going to waste. To develop a better understanding of the composition of the seed oils derived from these plants, we conducted a series of gas chromatography experiments, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The results showed that the chemical compositions of the seed oils derived from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> were roughly the same, although there were some subtle differences. Oleic acid, linolenic acid, and palmitic acid are the main fatty acids compositions in the five seed oils, in particular, the content of conjugate linoleic acid is relatively the highest, and it has been reported that linolenic acid has obvious tyrosinase inhibition activity [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The nonedible wild
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> seeds, such as XYSO and ZMSO, showed similar chemical compositions to TGSO. Although it would not be possible to directly commercialize the seed oils obtained from wild
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic>, they could potentially be used to develop edible oils.
