<p class="p">The effects of the five different varieties of seed oils on the oxidation reactions of L-DOPA and L-tyrosine using mushroom tyrosinase were determined experimentally. Tyrosinase is an important enzyme that plays a big role in melanogenesis within melanocytes. Furthermore, melanogenesis plays an important role in protecting the skin from sun-related injuries and is principally responsible for skin color. However, abnormal hyperpigmentation problems such as freckles, chloasma, and lentigines can have an adverse impact on the physical appearance of skin, representing serious esthetic problems [

Tyrosinase inhibitors can be used to achieve healthy skin-whitening and have consequently been widely used in cosmetics, medicine, food, and agriculture, where there is a growing interest in the development of safe and effective tyrosinase inhibitors from natural plants [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Kojic acid is a metabolite of fungal that exhibits inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase. The inhibitory effects of kojic acid in this context have been attributed to its ability to chelate copper at the active site of this enzyme. For this reason, kojic acid is often used as a positive control to discover new tyrosinase inhibitors, as well as being used as a cosmetic skin-whitening agent and a food additive for preventing enzymatic browning. But, its uses are restricted because of its several side effects [

The effects of the five different varieties of squeezed oil on the diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase were assayed using L-DOPA as a substrate with kojic acid as a reference compound. The results revealed that all five of the oils inhibited the oxidation of L-DOPA in a dose-dependent manner (
