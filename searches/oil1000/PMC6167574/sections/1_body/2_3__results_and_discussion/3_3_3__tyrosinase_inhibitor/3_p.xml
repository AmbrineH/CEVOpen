<p class="p">The seed oils from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> all exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase (especially TGSO and XYSO), most likely because of their strong antioxidant activity. It is possible that the free radical scavenging activities of these seed oils prevented the initiation of a radical chain, thereby inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by reducing the supply of oxygen during the tyrosinase reaction. These could be antioxidant active components present in
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya</italic> seed oils, such as conjugated linoleic acid and Oleic acid, which could reduce the catalytic activity of tyrosinase by preventing the active effect of oxygen on tyrosinase.
