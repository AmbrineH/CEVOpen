<p class="p">Ascorbic acid is commonly used as a tyrosinase inhibitor because of its antibrowning effect, and this compound has also been used as positive reference compound to evaluate new monophenolase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Ascorbic acid can also be used to affect the chemical reduction of dopaquinone, thereby avoiding the formation of dopachrome and melanin by the subsequent reduction of o-dopaquinone to L-DOPA. However, the application of ascorbic acid in this context has been limited by its poor stability [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The effects of the five different seed oils on monophenolase activity were studied using L-tyrosine as a substrate and ascorbic acid as a positive control. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, all five of the seed oils tested in the current study exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory activity towards the tyrosinase-mediated oxidation of L-tyrosine. However, the inhibitory activities of all five oils were less than that of ascorbic acid, especially at a high concentration (800

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the seed oils derived from the five different varieties of

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Lastly, as is known in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the five different seed oils showed slightly better diphenolase activity than their monophenolase activity.
