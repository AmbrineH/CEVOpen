<p class="p">Oxidation is essential to many living organisms for the production of energy to fuel biological processes. However, free radicals and several other reactive oxygen species are continuously produced
 <italic class="italic"> in vivo</italic> as a consequence of oxidation processes, and these reactive species can result in tissue damage and cell death. The oxidative damage caused by free radicals plays a major contributory role in aging and numerous debilitating diseases, including diabetes, cirrhosis, and cancer [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Although several enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase) and antioxidant compounds (e.g., ascorbic acid) can protect most organisms against free radical-induced oxidative damage, these systems cannot prevent this damage completely. The use of antioxidant supplements or the consumption of foods containing antioxidants can therefore be used as a strategy to reduce the level of oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The antioxidant activities of the seed oils obtained from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya grandis</italic> evaluated in the current study were measured using DPPH, FRAP, and TRP assays. The DPPH assay, which measures the scavenging ability of an antioxidant towards the stable DPPH free radical, is one of the most commonly used methods for evaluating the radical scavenging activity of an antioxidant. Furthermore, it is well known that radical scavenging ability correlates well with antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Ferric reducing ability (FRAP) and the TRP are commonly used methods for assessing the reducing power of an antioxidant in vitro. The research groups of Yen and Siddhuraju reported that there is a close relationship between the reducing power and antioxidant activity of antioxidants, and that the antioxidant capacity generally increases with increasing reducing power [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In this way, it is therefore possible to evaluate the antioxidant ability of an antioxidant based on its reducing power. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the antioxidant capacities of the seed oils obtained from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya</italic> were weaker than that of the positive control ascorbic acid. However, the DPPH scavenging capacities of the seed oils obtained from the five different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya</italic> were similar. The FRAP and TRP properties of the different seed oils also showed a similar trend, and there were significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the seed oils obtained from the different varieties of
 <italic class="italic"> Torreya</italic> in one assay. The DPPH free radical scavenging abilities of the oils tested in the current study were found to be of the following order: ascorbic acid &gt; XYSO &gt; TGSO &gt; ZMSO &gt; TGMSO &gt; CGSO; whereas the FRAP and TRP properties of the five different squeezed oils were of the order: ascorbic acid &gt; TGSO &gt; XYSO &gt; ZMSO &gt; TGMSO &gt; CGSO.
