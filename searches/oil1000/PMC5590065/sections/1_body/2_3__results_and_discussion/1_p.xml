<p class="p">A total of 39 volatile constituents in the leaf, stem, seed, rhizome and pod of 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic> essential oils were identified by GC-MS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); oil yield of 1.0%, 0.65%, 1.3%, 1.1% and 0.55% were obtained, respectively. The percentage of identified components in the analysis ranged from 85.33 to 96.03% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00029-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Individual oils displayed their unique chemical profile in quantity and quality characterized by a high amount of monoterpenoids (60.74–89.83%) and a relatively low level of sesquiterpenoids (3.73–30.5%). It was also observed that 
 <italic class="italic">A. danielli</italic> volatile oils contain low amounts of oxygenated compounds in the leaf, stem, rhizome and pod (10.41–19.19%), with the exception of the seed oil, which is dominant in oxygenated constituents (72.63%) (
