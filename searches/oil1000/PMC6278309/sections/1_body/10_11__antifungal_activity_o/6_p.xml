 <xref rid="B206-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>] tested the EO from the 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> leaf on a 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain by disc diffusion. Miconazole (1000 μg/mL) and clotrimazole (1000 μg/mL) were used as controls. The MIC was determined by microdilution with the EO dissolved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted in Sabouraud dextrose broth. The result recorded an inhibition zone of 7.7 mm, a result similar to the inhibition determined for miconazole (10 mm) and clotrimazole (9.3 mm). The MIC for the EO was 3180 μg/mL. 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains were used by Shirazi et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] to perform experiments with the 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> EO. MIC was determined, and ketoconazole (10 μg/mL) was used as a control. The MICs for 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were 135 and 115 μg/mL, respectively.
