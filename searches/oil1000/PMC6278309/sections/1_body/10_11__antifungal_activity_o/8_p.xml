<p class="p">Tests with the methanolic extract from the 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> plant against the fungi 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium moniliforme</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium ultimum</italic> were performed by Mares and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>]. The extract was tested in solid medium at concentrations of 5, 10, and 50 μg/mL. Treatments were performed with sunlight (Biolux lamps), ultraviolet (UV)-A, and in the dark with scanning electron microscope readings. For 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> under solar irradiation, the inhibition was dose-dependent reaching 39.3% growth in colonies treated with the maximum dose (50 μg/mL). At the same dose, irradiation with UV-A improved the action of the extract with 57.4% inhibition, and, in the dark, a value of 24.8% was observed. For 
 <italic class="italic">F. moniliforme</italic> under sunlight, the inhibition observed at 50 mg/mL had the value of 50.9%, while it was 47.3% for UV-A and 33.8% in the dark, while the results for 
 <italic class="italic">P. ultimum</italic> were 72.6% (solar), 62.7% (UV-A), and 51.4% (dark).
