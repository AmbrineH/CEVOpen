<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes pusilla</italic> EO was investigated against the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain using the cavity diffusion method. Alzamora et al. [
 <xref rid="B205-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>] used micoral (100 mg), sporostantin (330 mg), mycostatin (10,000 UI/mL), and oxonasol (200 mg) as controls. The analysis resulted in an inhibition halo greater than 20 mm in diameter, suggesting that the 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain was extremely sensitive to the EO. Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], using the same methodology, tested the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> leaves against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. The EO showed good anticandidal activity with a 26-mm inhibition zone, compared to nystatin.
