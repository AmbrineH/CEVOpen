<p class="p">Romagnoli et al. [
 <xref rid="B203-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>], extracted the EO from dried 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> flowers and investigated its antifungal effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium digitatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</italic> strains. The EO showed remarkable activity in both fungi, reaching 100% inhibition, even at the lowest concentrations. The MIC of the EO against 
 <italic class="italic">P. digitatum</italic> presented a low value (1.25 μL/mL), with no colonies being observed at this concentration. 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> showed dose-dependent growth inhibition with an MIC of 10 μL/mL. Still with the same species, 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic>, Sesan et al. [
 <xref rid="B204-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>] using the hydroalcoholic extract at concentrations of 10% and 5%, analyzed its action on the isolated 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma viride</italic> (TV 82) strain, a fungal biocontrol agent that can cause infections in humans. The extract was made from fresh biomass such as stems, leaves, flowers, shoots, and bulbs. The 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> extract inhibited the development of the fungus, even when applied at low concentrations (10% and 5%), with inhibition varying between 50 and 54%.
