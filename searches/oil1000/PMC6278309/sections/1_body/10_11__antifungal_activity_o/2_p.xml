 <xref rid="B199-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>] carried out an experiment to verify the antifungal potential of the 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> species. The petals were collected, dried, and ground for the preparation of hexane and methanolic extracts. Spores of the species 
 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma lucidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria alternata</italic> were used. The disc diffusion method was used, with the drug flumequine (30 μg/disc) used as a control. MIC was determined by microdilution with flumequine (1.0 mg/mL) as the control. The results of the test showed that the values for the inhibition zones varied from6.4–8.5 mm and in the control from 20.6–21.8 mm. The MIC was established between 7.5 and 13.3 mg/mL, while it was 0.21–0.30 mg/mL in the control. The 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> species showed higher antifungal activity compared to 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic>, with inhibition zones ranging from 6.5 to 7.3 mm and MIC values from 0.19 to 24 mg/mL.
