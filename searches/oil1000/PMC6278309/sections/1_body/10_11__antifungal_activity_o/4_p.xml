 <xref rid="B162-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>] used the aerial parts from 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> against isolates from four fungi species of agricultural and clinical importance: 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium verticillioides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">F. proliferatum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. parasiticus</italic>. The extraction solvents used were hexane, dichloromethane, methanol, and water. The concentration of the extracts was 10 mg/mL. The drug amphotericin B and the agricultural fungicide 
 <italic class="italic">Cantus</italic> were used as positive controls. The MIC was determined by microdilution and some isolates from 
 <italic class="italic">F. verticillioides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. proliferatum</italic> strains were sensitive to hexane (0.02–2.5 mg/mL), dichloromethane (0.02–0.32 mg/mL), and methanol (0.02–2.5 mg/mL) extracts with fungistatic action. The aqueous extract had no activity on the fungal strains.
