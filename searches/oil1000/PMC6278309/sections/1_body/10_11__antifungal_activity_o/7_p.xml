 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] used 70% (5 mg/mL) ethanolic extracts from the aerial parts (stems, leaves, and flowers) of 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> to evaluate the antifungal potential of clinically important fungi by microdilution using amphotericin B (16 mg/mL) as a positive control. Extracts from the aerial parts with flowers, without flowers, and with flower extracts were evaluated. The best results verified against 
 <italic class="italic">T. rubrum</italic> were recorded using the extract from aerial parts with flowers (254 μg/mL), whilst against 
 <italic class="italic">T. mentagrophytes</italic>, the ethanolic extract from aerial parts with and without flowers were more effective, with MIC values of 573 μg/mL and 625 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, for 
 <italic class="italic">M. canis</italic>, the flower extract (195 μg/mL) stood out, also displaying the lowest inhibitory concentration of all the extracts tested. 
 <italic class="italic">Metarhizium anisoplia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. bassiana</italic> were not sensitive to the extracts, which is a good result, considering that these entomopathogenic microorganisms are important for biological control, despite the latter being responsible for hyalohyphomycoses in humans.
