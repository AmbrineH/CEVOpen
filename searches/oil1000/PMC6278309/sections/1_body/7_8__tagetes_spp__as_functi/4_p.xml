 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> species were originally used as a source of EOs, with applications as flavoring in the food industry, extracted from leaves, stalks, and flowers. What is more, marigold pigments have potential as a natural food colorant. The flowers and their extracts are rich in orange/yellow carotenoids [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. The status of marigold as a source of natural carotenoids was reviewed by Verghese [

 <xref rid="B179-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>]. The stability of these pigments was studied for oil-in-water emulsions or arabic gums. It was concluded that the composition of the emulsifying agents and the pH level have important roles in determining the effectiveness of the emulsions against color loss and coalescence kinetics. Anaerobic and lactic acid treatments of fresh flowers are promising in terms of pigment stability. What is more, compared with other natural sources of yellow and orange color, like turmeric, chill, and saffron, marigold is a cheaper and easily available source. Factors influencing the qualitative and quantitative profiles of carotenoids in flowers of marigolds are their storage conditions. It is widely known that carotenoids are beneficial for human health. However, the biological functions of many individual carotenoids like zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, antheraxanthlin, and neoxanthin, which are present in a large amount in marigold flowers, are not known. Although marigold as a colorant offers a strong intense orange to yellow color, no toxicity data are available in the literature on marigold extract, whether partially purified or raw, which makes it unusable in food.
