It was documented that quercetagetin has potential antidiabetic and antilipemic activities, showing inhibitory effects of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and pancreatic lipase. These results may be essential scientific support for the application of quercetagetin as a nutraceutical for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. What is more, according to the newest research, both flavonoids and carotenoids, primarily patuletin, constituents of
