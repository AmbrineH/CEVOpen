<p class="p">It is worth noting that marigold flowers can be a cheaper source as a starting material for the isolation of lutein, a valuable natural pigment that can also serve as a nutraceutical. The deficit of this compound in the human body is probably responsible for the age-related impairment of vision. Dried flowers of
