<p class="p">One of the first papers on marigold and its potential agricultural uses was published in 1958 by Uhlenbroeck and Bijloo, who studied the nematicidal activity of extracts obtained from the roots [

 <italic class="italic">Ditylenchus dipsaci</italic>, and

 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic> root extracts showed cidal or inhibitory activities against other plant-pathogenic nematodes,

 <italic class="italic">T. halisciencis</italic> roots against 
 <italic class="italic">M. incognita.</italic> The results of the study were important due to the fact that these nematodes are major agricultural pests of a wide range of crops cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, as well as in greenhouses in temperate climates.

 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. produce a number of potentially bioactive compounds; however, thiophene derivatives and particularly Î±-terthienyl derivatives seem to be responsible for these nematocidal properties [
