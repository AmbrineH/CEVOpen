<p class="p">From another point of view, Zoubiri and Baaliouamer [
 <xref rid="B154-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>] documented the high effectiveness of EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> against mosquitoes of 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles gambiae</italic>, which are responsible for malaria transmission. The results were comparable to commercial, synthetic, insecticidal agents. What is more, 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> oil possesses phytotoxicity toward common weeds, including green amaranth (
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus viridis</italic>), vegetable amaranth (
 <italic class="italic">A. tricolor</italic>), hairy beggars tick (
 <italic class="italic">Bidens pilosa</italic>), little seed canary grass (
 <italic class="italic">Phalaris minor</italic>), nettle leaf goosefoot (
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium murale</italic>), and barnyard grass (
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic>) [

 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. are potential chromium hyperaccumulators. According to Coelho et al. [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>], at Cr(III) concentrations up to 0.12 mmol/L, the plants accumulated levels above that proposed for hyperaccumulators while still maintaining considerable growth and even flourishing.
