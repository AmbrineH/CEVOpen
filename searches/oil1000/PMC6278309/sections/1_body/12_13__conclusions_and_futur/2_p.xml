<p class="p">A clear-cut and feasible correlation of the biological effects reported for the various EOs and other extracts with their chemical composition is not evident, but some associations can be made. For example, the antimicrobial activity of limonene for medical purposes is well known [
 <xref rid="B208-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>], and its therapeutic effects involving anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antinoceptive, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antihyperalgesic effects, among others, were extensively studied [
 <xref rid="B209-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>]. In an in vitro study [
 <xref rid="B210-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>], antibacterial and antifungal activities of α-pinene and β-pinene enantiomers were evaluated, showing that positive enantiomers had antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), while also showing that pinene is useful in formulating strategies to limit 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. Marchese et al. [
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>] proposed a mechanistic viewpoint of antimicrobial activity, against both planktonic and sessile cells belonging to food-decaying microorganisms and human pathogens, of eugenol and EOs containing eugenol. Eugenol interferes with membrane functions or suppresses virulence factors, including toxins, enzymes, and the formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms. Interestingly, the authors suggest a synergist effect of eugenol and other compounds present in EOs such as thymol, carvacrol, and menthol (compounds also present in 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> EOs). Some studies were conducted with major and common compounds present in the extracts; however, much research is missing with the minor and uncommon compounds, with a lack of investigation into the mechanisms of action. However, in this review, we evidenced the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. extracts.
