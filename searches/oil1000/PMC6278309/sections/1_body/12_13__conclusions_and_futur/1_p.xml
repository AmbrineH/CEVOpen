<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> genus is rich in aromatic compounds and resinous exudate, and the EOs of these plants are rich in ocimenes, limonene, terpinene, myrcene, tagetones, dihydrotagetone, and tagetenones, which are the primary odorants, and lower amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. However, the chemical EO composition is high dependent on several endogenous and exogenous factors, including genetic traits, plant organs (leaves, stems, capitula, or roots), growing, drying, and storage conditions, and stress factors such as adverse climatology and diseases affecting the plant. Moreover, one crucial aspect of the EO composition is the type of extraction, the solvents utilized, and the standardization of the extracts. Thus, plant extracts from different parts of these plants may show different biological abilities, and therefore, can be used in a variety of industries, including cosmetic, pharmaceutical, or food production, due to the presence of biologically active compounds such as 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (apigenin trimethyl ether), patuletin (
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methylatedflavanol), quercetagetin and its 7-arabinosyl-galactoside, and other flavonoids, carotenoids (lutein), and thiophene derivatives (α-terthienyl).
