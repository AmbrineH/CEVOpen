<p class="p">The results indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. may potentially play an important role in food preparation and food preservation, as well as for use as an excellent food spice. Even from a traditional point of view, the nature of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. and their composition affect the quantity and quality of the extracts [
 <xref rid="B172-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. Despite promising results obtained in vitro, more detailed studies of the mechanisms of action of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. extracts and EOs would be beneficial for reaching their potential in biotechnology. It was documented that EO components, especially terpenoids such as dihydrotagetones, tagetones, and ocimenones, are sufficient to account for the observed antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B171-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>]. Further progress in determining the active components of the EOs may be achieved by fractionating the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. and determining the antimicrobial activity of each component individually. Caution is required in this approach, as both synergistic and antagonistic antimicrobial interactions between constituents of EOs can occur, giving the whole extract a different activity from the sum of the individual components.
