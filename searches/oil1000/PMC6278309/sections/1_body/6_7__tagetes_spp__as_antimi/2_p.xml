<p class="p">In research conducted by Tereschuk et al. [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>], extracts obtained from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> showed antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The major component of the extract, quercetagetin-7-arabinosyl-galactoside, showed significant antimicrobial activity against tested pathogen microorganisms. In studies conducted by Tereschuk et al. [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>], almost all of the tested strains were susceptible to 
 <italic class="italic">T. terniflora</italic> extracts at concentrations of 200 mg/mL, except for bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Zymomonas mobilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, and yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Moreover, these results were generally comparable with chloramphenicol at 100 mg/mL. Hernández et al. [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>] indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">T. lucida</italic> extracts, containing 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone, showed wide antibacterial activity. 
 <italic class="italic">T. lucida</italic> extracts also showed high activity against Gram-negative bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi in the study conducted by Cespedes et al. [
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. Antifungal activities of the EOs against species belonging to 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> were also described [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>,
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. What is more, Gakuubi et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] documented the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> EOs against phytopathogenic bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseolicola</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">phaseoli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">X. axonopodis</italic> pv. 
 <italic class="italic">Manihotis</italic>, which are responsible for different plant diseases. The results obtained confirmed the biopesticidal nature of EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. and their potential uses as cheap, safe, and effective alternatives to chemical bactericides used for the protection of agricultural products. Recent research on the antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> was done by dos Santos [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>], correlating the extract of this plant with traditionally used antibacterial, insecticidal, biocide, disinfectant, anthelminthic, antifungal, and antiseptic agents.
