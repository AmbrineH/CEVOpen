<p class="p">Metabolites synthesized by plants belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> show significant effects as antioxidants, enzyme inhibitors, precursors of toxic substances, and pigments. In addition, these bioactive compounds are involved in photosensitization and energy transfer, actions of plant growth hormones and regulators, control of respiration and photosynthesis, and defense against parasites, bacteria, fungi, and some insects. On the other hand, some of the secondary metabolites, especially those contained in the flowers, are responsible for the attraction of pollinators. It is believed that the activity of the secondary metabolites in the 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> species, like in the case in other plants, is related to their composition, concentration, and environmental conditions affecting their content. Thus, plant extracts or EOs obtained from different parts may show different biological abilities, and therefore, can be used in a variety of industries, including cosmetic, pharmaceutical, or food production [

 <xref rid="B142-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Although the extracts from these plants are not so popularly used as preservatives, 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. are characterized with high potential in the field of agriculture. According to the approach “from the field to the fork”, the use of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> spp. as bioactive agents in plant protection against micro- and macro-organisms is directed toward the first stages of the production, mainly in the plant breeding or post-harvest stages.
