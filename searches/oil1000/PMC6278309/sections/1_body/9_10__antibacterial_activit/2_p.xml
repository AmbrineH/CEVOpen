Although all plant samples showed antimicrobial activity, the hydroalcoholic extracts showed the most satisfactory results with all bacterial species. The 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> EO showed antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria with EO percentage activities of 1.3% for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 0.6% for 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus coagulase</italic> (+), 2.5% for 
 <italic class="italic">S. coagulase</italic> (âˆ’), and 0.8% for 
 <italic class="italic">S. uberis</italic>. On the other hand, for Gram-negative bacteria, the percentage activity values were 4.0% for 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and 5.0% for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>.
