 <xref rid="B200-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] tested the antimicrobial activity of crude, aqueous, ethyl acetate and butanol 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> extracts, in addition to leaf and stem extracts extracted with ethyl acetate and butanol. The antimicrobial activity was determined from cavity diffusion (20 Î¼L) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Inhibition halos of the crude extract were from 5 mm to 6.5 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas picketti</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> strains. The aqueous extract had inhibition halos only against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> (5.7 mm). However, the ethyl acetate extract from the flowers and seeds presented activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (3.0 mm) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. picketti</italic> (5.0 mm), while the butanolic extract was active against 
 <italic class="italic">P. picketti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> (5.2 mm and 7.6 mm, respectively). The inhibitory results from the leaf and stem extracts showed activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (3.1 mm), 
 <italic class="italic">P. picketti</italic> (6.3 mm), and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> (6.1 mm) for ethyl acetate extracts, and 1.0 mm and 5.0 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">M. luteus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> from the butanolic extract. For all assays, ampicillin was used as the control.
