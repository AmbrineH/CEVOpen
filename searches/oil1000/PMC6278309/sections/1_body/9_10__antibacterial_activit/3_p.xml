<p class="p">Two species, 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic>, were evaluated by Ayub et al. [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>], who observed the antimicrobial activity of the petal hexane and methanolic extracts by disc diffusion (100 Î¼L of the extract) and microdilution (0.03 to 72.0 mg/mL). The tests demonstrated antibacterial activity against the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pastrulla multocida</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains, with 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> presenting inhibition zones with values varying from 12.4 mm to 20.2 mm for the methanolic extract and 8.2 mm to 11.4 mm for the hexane extract. Meanwhile, the 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic> species showed inhibition zones varying from 10.0 mm to 17.5 mm (methanolic extract) and 8.3 mm to 10.0 mm (hexane extract). The MICs for 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> were from 0.19 mg/mL to 4.05 mg/mL (methanolic extract) and from 4.05 mg/mL to 24.0 mg (hexane extract), while 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic> displayed MICs from 0.63 mg/mL to 7.6 mg/mL (methanolic extract) and from 6.8 mg/mL to 24.4 mg/mL (hexane extract).
