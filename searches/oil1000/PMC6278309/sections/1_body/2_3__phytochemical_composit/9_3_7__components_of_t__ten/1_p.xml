<p class="p">An earlier paper [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>], examining two EOs from aerial parts, registered the following main components: (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-ocimenone (9.1–26.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-ocimenone (9.6–26.3%), dihydrotagetone (13.4–17.3%), tagetones (5.5–12.9%), limonene (8.7–10.2%), and β-ocimene (tr–6.0%). Of particular interest was the presence in one EO of significant quantities of thujone (11.9%). According to the recent review by Gupta [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], the EOs are characterized by dihydrotagetone, tagetones, ocimenones, and piperitone. One of the review papers [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] gave a breakdown of the composition of leaves and flowers, which were fairly consistent, with (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone, dihydrotagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetone, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene as the four main components. The only notable difference was that the leaf EOs contained 2.2% methylchavicol, while the flowers contained 2.0% camphor.
