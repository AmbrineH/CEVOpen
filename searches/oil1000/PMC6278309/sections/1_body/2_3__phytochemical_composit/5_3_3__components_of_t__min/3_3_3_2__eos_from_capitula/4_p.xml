<p class="p">Some papers evaluated the variation in EO content according to phenological stage. According to Worku and Bertoldi [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], who observed the evolution of EO composition from the pre-flowering stage to the immature seed stage, the content of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene increased through the process from 7.2% to 37.5%, and the content of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone declined from almost 40% to 13.1%, while little difference was observed for (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetone. Chalchat and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], measuring the same variations, found that the content of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene increased dramatically from the pre-flowering (2%) to early flowering (20.4%) stage, and then decreased slightly. The content of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone increased from 0.1% to 8.3% at the early flowering stage, and then decreased again. Dihydrotagetone increased from 16.5% to 33.4%, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetone decreased from 16.9% to 3.7%, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone remained stable at levels of 18.2–23.4%, and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone was stable around 0.2% apart from a peak at the early flowering stage of 2.2%.
