<p class="p">A more recent paper [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], examining Iranian EOs at budding, full flowering, and seed set stages, found a reduced yield, from 1.0% to 1.6%. It also found that limonene was the main component at the budding stage, at 49.2%; however, its content decreased dramatically to 4.0% and then to 2.8%. Dihydrotagetone remained pretty stable during the changes, passing from 14.8% to 21.4% to 20.7%, while α-terpineol was also present in significant quantities, and its percentage increased from 7.4% to 15.6% to 18.4%. Moreover, (

 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene went from 4.4% to 8.3% at the flowering stage and decreased again at the seed stage to 7.4%, while (

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone content increased from 3.3% to 11.8% at the flowering stage and decreased to 8.6% at the seed stage. Finally, spathulenol increased from 0.9% to 5.6%. Two papers analyzed the variations in EO content relative to various agronomical parameters [
