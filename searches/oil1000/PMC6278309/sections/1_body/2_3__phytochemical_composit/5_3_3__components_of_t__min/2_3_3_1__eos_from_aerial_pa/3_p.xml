<p class="p">Two previous reviews explored the chemistry of

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] and identified (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, dihydrotagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetones, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenones as the major components of the aerial parts. The (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene content varied quite extensively across the studies. In one study, it was observed that drying the plant material prior to distillation changed the chemistry of the EO. Both EOs contained (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone; however, the fresh plant contained larger amounts of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone, limonene, and allocimene, while the dried plant was characterized by a high content of dihydrotagetone.
