<p class="p">The chemical diversity could be independent of geographical origin, but could depend on plant phenology. A paper on an Indian EO revealed that EOs from plants harvested in the winter (December–January) were dominated by ocimenes (just like the first group above), and those from plants harvested in autumn (October–November) were dominated by dihydrotagetone (just like the second group above), while plants harvested in the summer (June) were dominated by tagetone, and a tagetenone-rich oil was obtained in the winter if the seeds were sown in September [
