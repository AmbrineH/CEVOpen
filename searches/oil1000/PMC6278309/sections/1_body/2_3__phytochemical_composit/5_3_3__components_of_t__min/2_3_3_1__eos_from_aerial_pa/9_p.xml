<p class="p">A paper that examined a commercial sample of aerial part EOs from South Africa [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] found that the major compounds were (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-tagetenone (8.7%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-tagetenone (6.9%), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone (5.1%), allocimene (4.5%), and ethyl 2-methylbutanoate (1.0%). The most important molecules in terms of their odorant impact (a combination of their percentage in the EO and their olfactory threshold) were (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone, ethyl isobutyrate, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-thiol, ethyl isobutyrate, 2-methylfuran-3-thiol, decanal, linalol, terpinen-4-ol, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetone, alloocimene isomer, octanal, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, octyl acetate, 1-nonen-3-ol, myrcene, 1-octen-3-one, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, hexanal, and butanone isomer.
