<p class="p">The authors concluded that there exist at least two different chemotypes, one characterized by a high content of terpenes such as limonene (10–13%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (0.5–14.6%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (6–16.5%), and α-muurolene (11–28%), as well as trace amounts of tagetone derivatives, such as dihydrotagetone, tagetone, and tagetenone, with verbenone (5–15.4%) as the main oxygenated compound. Even within this chemotype, the variability could be very high, such as in the case of one sample characterized by a high content of caryophyllene oxide (5.5%), and α- and γ-cadinenes (4.5% and 9.5%, respectively). The presence of linalol (4.6%) seems to be a mistaken identification, since, according to Lawrence [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], this molecule is not present in 
 <italic class="italic">T. minuta</italic> EO. The second proposed chemotype is characterized by a high content of tagetone derivatives with the sum of dihydrotagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetones, and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)- and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenones higher than 72%. It appears that these Malagasy EOs present a specific composition that differs from those described by Singh and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], in that both (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene and dihydrotagetone are present at very low percentages.
