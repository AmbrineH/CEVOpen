<p class="p">A recent paper on Argentinian EOs [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] found that the composition did not fit in any of the proposed subgroups by Singh and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], since the main molecule was dihydrotagetone (2.5–65.8%), while the next two most prominent molecules were α-phellandrene (31.0%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (17.7%) (which never occurred as characterizing constituents found by Singh and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-cymene (16.0%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetenone (0.8–30.7%), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone (6.8–13.2%), limonene (4.0–10.4%), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (3.5–14.9%), (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone (1.6–7.4%), and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-tagetone (1.2–7.8%). The authors identified three chemotypes, one having (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, dihydrotagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetone, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>) and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-tagetenone, and limonene as the major constituents; the second containing mainly dihydrotagetone; and the third characterized by a high percentage of α-phellandrene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene. While the first two chemotypes are recognizable in the subdivisions proposed by Singh and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], the third is not.
