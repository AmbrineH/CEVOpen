<p class="p">According to some taxonomical authorities [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula</italic> is to be considered a synonym of 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic>. However, given the relative large amount of literature on its EO chemistry, where it is always considered as a separate entity, it is treated here as a close relative but a separate taxon from 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic>.
