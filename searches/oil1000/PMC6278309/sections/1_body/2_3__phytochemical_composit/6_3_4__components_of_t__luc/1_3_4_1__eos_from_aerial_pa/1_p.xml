 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In fact, according to Ciccio [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] and Marotti and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], the EO is dominated by methyl chavicol (estragol) at levels up to 97.3%. However, according to other authors [

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], at least four chemotypes can exist, characterized by the main presence of (a) high levels of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole (up to 74%) and low to very low levels of methyl chavicol (11.57%) or methyleugenol (1.8%), and germacrene D; (b) high levels of methyl chavicol (up to 97%), in addition to methyleugenol, methylisoeugenol, and germacrene D; (c) high levels of methyl eugenol (up to 80%), in addition to methylchavicol and methylisoeugenol; and (d) high amounts of nerolidol (around 40%), in addition to methyleugenol, methylchavicol, and caryophyllene oxide. Other compounds include linalol (0.3–3.7%), myrcene (1.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (2.9%), linalol (1.1%), β-caryophyllene (0.5–2.4%), germacrene D (tr–5.4%), methylisoeugenol (tr–3.9%), bicyclogermacrene (0.6%), spathulenol (tr–0.2%), and caryophyllene oxide (tr–10.3%). These data were confirmed by later papers; an EO distilled from aerial parts from Colombia [

 <xref rid="B96-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] displayed methylchavicol (92.1%), β-myrcene (5.9%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (1.3%), and linalol (0.3%), while an EO from Egypt [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] contained over 90% methyl chavicol.
