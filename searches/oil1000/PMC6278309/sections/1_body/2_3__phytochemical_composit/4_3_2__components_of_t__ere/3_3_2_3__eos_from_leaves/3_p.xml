<p class="p">Another paper [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] reported the main components of leaf EOs from Brazil as piperitone (45.7%), limonene (9.7%), and piperitenone (5.9%). There were ambiguous data relative to the presence of phototoxic thiophenes in these plants. According to Marques and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], a thiophene derivative, α-terthienyl, was present in the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic>. This compound is able to generate singlet oxygen in organic solvents and superoxide radical anions in an aqueous medium. Gupta [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] mentioned the presence of β-terthienyl and α-terthienyl in 
 <italic class="italic">T. patula.</italic> The data on the EOs from various parts of 
 <italic class="italic">T. erecta</italic> are summarized in
