 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] reported that Italian EOs contained dihydrotagetone, tagetones, tagetenones, and piperitone as the major compounds. A later study confirmed the presence of piperitone (35.9%) and terpinolene (22.2%) as major compounds in EOs from aerial parts in Venezuela [
