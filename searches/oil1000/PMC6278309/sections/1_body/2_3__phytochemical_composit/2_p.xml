<p class="p">Generally speaking, the oils are rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (ocimenes, limonene, terpinene, myrcene, etc.) and in acyclic monoterpene ketones (tagetone, dihydrotagetone, and tagetenone) which are the primary odorants, in addition to lower amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. Within these groups, the chemical diversity is quite high. The only striking differences in EO composition come from 
 <italic class="italic">T. lucida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. filifolia</italic>, whose EOs are dominated by phenylpropanoids such as methyleugenol, methylchavicol, and anethole. The EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">T. tenuifolia</italic> contained 2.2% methylchavicol.
