<p class="p">According to Gupta and Vasudeva [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], EOs from aerial parts showed high amounts of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole (76.9–87.5%) and methylchavicol (10.7–19.3%), in addition to variable amounts of (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-anethole (tr–68.2%), and lower amounts of isomenthone (4.5%), menthone (4%), 1,8-cineole (1.5%), pulegone (1.1%), germacrene D (1%), bicyclogermacrene (1%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-farnesene (0.8%), cumin aldehyde (0.7%), and spathulenol (0.5%). An EO from Argentina [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-23-02847" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] was characterized by only two molecules: (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole (74.5%) and methylchavicol (23.7%). This chemical composition is uncharacteristic of 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> species, and is close to the specific chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">T. lucida</italic>, rich in (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole.
