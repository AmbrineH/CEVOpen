<p class="p">The scientific literature discussed here revealed the antimicrobial potential of species from the 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> genus. Four species presented antifungal effects and five presented antibacterial effects. In this sense, species of the 
 <italic class="italic">Tagetes</italic> genus had an effect on 17 different fungal strains and 15 different bacterial strains which cause infections in humans. From ethnobiological reports, the 
 <italic class="italic">T. filifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. lucida</italic> species, indicated for the treatment of diseases related to fungi and bacteria, are yet to be evaluated by the scientific community regarding their antifungal and antibacterial potentials. None of the species which had antimicrobial bioactivity were evaluated in combination with commercial antifungals or antibacterials, where a synergistic effect is often seen as a positive interaction from this association. This investigation was also not mentioned in the methodology and, consequently, results from this ethnobiological research are lacking, which is of the utmost importance, since many people use teas and medications concomitantly.
