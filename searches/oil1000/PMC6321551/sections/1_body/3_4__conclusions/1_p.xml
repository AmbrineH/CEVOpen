<p class="p">In conclusion, PUFA analysis in chia seed oil from Mexico was greater than 80% of fatty acids. This research indicates that Î±-linolenic acid was the most abundant fatty acid, followed by linoleic acid with an n-3/n-6 ratio of 3.21:1. Due to the large amount of easily-oxidized PUFAs in chia seed oil (induction period = 0.68 h), raw chia seeds might need special treatment during sample collection, processing, storage, and transportation, to prevent oxidation and maintain the quality of the oil. We also found that CSO presented some antioxidant effects in vitro, which are beneficial for human health. This is the first study to report the ability of CSO to reduce the levels of hepatic TG and LDL-C markedly, and increase the content of HDL-C in HepG2 cell model. Thus, this indicates that chia seed oil may help in reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease, and it can be widely used as cooking oil and in manufacture of healthy food supplements.</p>
