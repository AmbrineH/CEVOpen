<p class="p">Contents of TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C in HepG2 cell model were measured by commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Briefly, cells were collected and washed twice with pre-chilled PBS to remove culture medium after treatment for 24 h. Then, 200 Î¼L of 2% Triton X-100 was added for lysing cells by sonication. The supernatant was collected for analysis of TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C. Results were normalized to protein concentration using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
