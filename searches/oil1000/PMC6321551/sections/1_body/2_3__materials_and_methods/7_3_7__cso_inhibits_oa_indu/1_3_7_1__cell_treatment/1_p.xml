<p class="p">HepG2 was cultured in DMEM with high glucose (Gibco, USA) supplement with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in a cell incubator. The oleic acid (OA) was dissolved in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and diluted in a culture medium with 1% BSA as the final concentration of 200 μM. CSO was prepared in DMEM as stock solution. The cells were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h, before being cultured as follows: DMEM plus 1% BSA as a control group; DMEM with OA-BSA at 200 μM as a model group; CSO at final concentration of 500 μg/mL was applied with OA-BSA simultaneously as a co-treatment.
