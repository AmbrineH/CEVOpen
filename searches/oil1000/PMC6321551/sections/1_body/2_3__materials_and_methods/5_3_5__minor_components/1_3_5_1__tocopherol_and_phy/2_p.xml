<p class="p">The analysis of sterols and squalene was carried out by GC-MS equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and using a DB-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Gas chromatograph conditions were as follows: helium was used as carrier gas at the flow rate of 1 mL/min, then the split ratio was 1:100. Oven temperature program: initial temperature 200 °C for 1 min, then 200 °C to 300 °C at 1 °C/min, and maintained at 300 °C for 18 min; detector temperature set at 290 °C, injector temperature 290 °C, injection volume, 1.0 µL. Sterol and squalene were determined and quantified by the internal standard (5α-cholestane), and the contents were expressed as mg/kg.</p>
