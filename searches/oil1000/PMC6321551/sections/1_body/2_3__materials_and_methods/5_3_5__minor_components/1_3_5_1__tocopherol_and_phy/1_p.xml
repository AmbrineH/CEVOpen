<p class="p">Analysis of the composition of tocopherols was performed by HPLC using Waters 2475 multi λ fluorescence detector (λ
 <sub class="sub">Ex</sub> 293 nm; λ
 <sub class="sub">Em</sub> 325 nm) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) based on reported methods [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Briefly, the column used in this analysis was a DIOL column (100 mm × 3 mm, 7 µm, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). CSO was dissolved in hexane at 0.25 mg/mL and injected directly into the HPLC column. The optimized conditions for the run were as follows: in a linear gradient elution with the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and solvents hexane/tetrahydrofuran (A, 98/2,

The identification and quantification of α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols in CSO was determined by comparison with their retention times and the area of the standards of tocopherols, and the unit was expressed as mg/kg of CSO.
