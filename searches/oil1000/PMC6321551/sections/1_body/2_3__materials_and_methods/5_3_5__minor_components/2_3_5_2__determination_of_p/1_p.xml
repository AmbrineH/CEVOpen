<p class="p">PAH levels were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Briefly, CSO (0.5 g) was added a 10 ml Pyrex tube, and mixed with 5 µL of internal standard (2 mg/mL) and 3 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane by shaking. SupelMIP solid-phase extraction (SPE, Anpel, Shanghai, China) was applied to extract PAHs from the oil. The mixture contents were fully loaded to the SPE column, to allow adhesion of PAHs to the membrane. The column was then washed with hexane (5 mL), and PAHs were eluted with methylene dichloride (10 mL) at a low speed. Eluent was then dried and dissolved in acetonitrile (200 μL) for further experiments.
