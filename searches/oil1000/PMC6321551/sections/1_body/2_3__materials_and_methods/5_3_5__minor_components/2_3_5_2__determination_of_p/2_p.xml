<p class="p">LC/MS/MS with APCI Source (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was applied to detect PAHs in CSO. Separation was achieved using a C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a mobile phase comprising of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in water). The column oven temperature was set at 25 °C, and flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The optimized conditions for separation were as follow: linear gradient elution was started from 45% A and then increased from 45 to 100% A (1–15 min), held 100% A from 15 to 21 min, next decreased 100% to 45% A from 21–22 min, lastly maintaining 45% A for 3 min. The PAH concentrations in CSO were quantified with internal standard.</p>
