<p class="p">The in vitro antioxidant effects of CSO were evaluated by DPPH and ABTS assays [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Briefly, 50 μL volumes of different concentrations of CSO were added to 150 μL of DPPH solution (200 μM) with shaking. After incubation of 40 min, optical density was recorded at 517 nm (OD
 <sub class="sub">517</sub>). Tocopherol was used as a positive control. In the same manner, ABTS radical scavenging capability of CSO was measured at a wavelength of 734 nm. Catechin was used as the positive control in ABTS assay. The formula for calculating % scavenging effects (SE) by DPPH and ABTS was as follows:
