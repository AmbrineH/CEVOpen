<p class="p">The oxidative stability of CSO was evaluated by the widely used Rancimat analysis [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Briefly, 3 g oil was added to the reaction vessel in triplicate, followed by heating to 120 Â°C. The samples were then dried under airflow at the rate of 20 L/h. A receiver with 60 mL of distilled water was used for collecting the effluent air, containing volatile organic acids from CSO. The conductivity of the water as the process of oxidation proceeded, and the induction period in hours (h) was automatically measured by the machine.
