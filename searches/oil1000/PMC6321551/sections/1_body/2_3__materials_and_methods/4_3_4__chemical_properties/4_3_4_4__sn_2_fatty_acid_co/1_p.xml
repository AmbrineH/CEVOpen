<p class="p">Analysis of sn-2 fatty acids of CSO was conducted by the assay used in reference [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Briefly, 10 mg CSO was added to a reaction solution containing 1 mL of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 0.25 mL of bile salts (0.05%), 0.1 mL of calcium chloride (2.2%), and 10 mg of pancreatic lipase. The reaction mixture was kept incubated at 40 Â°C, with shaking for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mL of 6 M HCl. Separation of above reaction product was performed by preparative TLC on silica gel, with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (1/1/0.02,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) as the developing solvent system. The band responding to the 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG) on the TLC plate was scraped into a glass tube and extracted 3 times with diethyl ether. The 2-MAG was dried and methylated to esters following the same saponification process as above. The resultant product was finally analyzed by the same analytical method.
