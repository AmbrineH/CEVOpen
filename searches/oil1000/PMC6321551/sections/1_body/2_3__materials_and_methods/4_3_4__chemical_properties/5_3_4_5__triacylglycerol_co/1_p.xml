<p class="p">Analysis of triacylglycerol components of CSO was conducted by the official assay (AOCS Ce 5c-93), with HPLC-ELSD (Agilent 1200, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. CSO was prepared in hexane at 2 mg/mL and analyzed using the following conditions. Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and isopropanol with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The initial mobile phase was held at 60% acetonitrile for 40 min, changed linearly to 55% (40–80 min), returned to 60% (80–85 min) and maintained at 60% for 5 min (85–90 min). High sensitivity was obtained by using ELSD temperature set at 55 °C with a gain value of 8, and gas flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with standard reference compounds. Triacylglycerols were confirmed by comparison of RT with their standards. Relative content was reported as a percentage.
