 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and 5 mL of hexane were added and mixed thoroughly. Then mixed solution was subjected to liquid–liquid partitioning 3 times, and hexane fractions were combined. The hexane fractions with unsaponifiable substances were then washed with 10% alcohol until neutral pH was obtained, and finally dried by rotary evaporator. The hexane extract containing unsaponifiable substances was kept at −20 °C until further analysis for determination of sterols and squalene.
