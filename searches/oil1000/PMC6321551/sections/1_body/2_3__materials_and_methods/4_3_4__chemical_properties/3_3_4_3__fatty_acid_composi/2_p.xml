<p class="p">Saponified fatty acids were extracted from the aqueous layer (previously acidified with 2 M HCl) three times using hexane. The hexane layer containing saponified fatty acids was dried, and dissolved in 2 mL Boron trifluoride-methanol solution (14% methanol). The mixture reaction was then incubated at 60 °C for 45 min to obtain methylation of fatty acids. Hexane was used to extract fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from the cooled mixture. Analysis of FAMEs was further carried out by gas chromatography (7820A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), coupled with a FID and a Trace TR-FAME capillary column (i.d. 0.25 μm, 60 m × 0.25 mm, Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY, USA). The analysis condition was programmed as follows: the injector and FID temperatures were kept at 250 °C, and initial oven temperature was held at 80 °C for 3 min. It was then increased to 215 °C (15 °C/min), and finally up to 215 °C (20 min hold time). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at 1 mL/min, with a split ratio of 1:20. Retention times (RT) of fatty acids were compared with those of authentic standards, and contents of individual components were expressed in relative percentages.</p>
