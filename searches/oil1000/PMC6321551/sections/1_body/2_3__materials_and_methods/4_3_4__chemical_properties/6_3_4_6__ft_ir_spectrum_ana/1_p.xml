<p class="p">The infrared spectrum of CSO was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with a Vector 70 model FT-IR instrument (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) in the infrared region of 4000−400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This enabled investigation of structural information with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The assignment of functional groups corresponding to IR absorption bands was performed by comparison with distinctive bands of functional groups of the chemicals in edible oils.
