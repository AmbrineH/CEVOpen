<p class="p">The cytotoxic effects of the chia seed oil against LNcap cells and HepG2 were tested using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Cells were obtained from Stem Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Thermo, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). The dried CSO was dissolved in DMSO to 20 mg/mL and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) as a stock solution. To each well of a 96-microwell plate, 190 μL of LNcap cells or HepG2 (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cell/mL) was added with or without 10 μL of different concentrations of CSO. After 48 h incubation, 20 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and then incubated for an additional 4 h. The supernatant was then removed completely, and 150 μL of DMSO was added to each well. Lastly, the OD value at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Bio Tek, San Diego, CA, USA). Cell viability was measured and calculated by the formula: cell viability (%) = [OD 
 <sub class="sub">570</sub> (sample)/OD 
 <sub class="sub">570</sub> (control)] × 100%.
