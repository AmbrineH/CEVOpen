<p class="p">Trace elements like manganese (Mn) increase the rate of oxidation of oil by the formation of free radicals of fatty acids and hydroperoxides [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], so they are undesirable in oils. The content of trace elements in CSO are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), boron (B), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr) and arsenic (As) were detected in CSO. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, mineral composition of chia seed oil is low in elements, like all other oils (Ca = 1.226 mg/kg; Mg = 3.566 mg/kg; Zn = 0.153 mg/kg; Al = 4.104 mg/kg; Mn = 0.098 mg/kg; B = 0.193 mg/kg; Sr = 0.071 mg/kg). The most abundant trace element was aluminum (4.104 mg/kg). CSO is a rich source of minerals such as Ca, Mg and Zn. There were no toxic elements (Ni, Pb, Cd, Tl and Hg) detected except arsenic. However, mean levels of arsenic (0.014 mg/kg) do not raise concern. It is possible that concentrations of some elements were influenced by the growth, manufacturing process, and equipment. As arsenic was found in CSO, further investigation would be needed to determine its valence state, since different valence states vary in toxicity. All metals measured in CSO were lower than the maximum level accepted for virgin vegetable oils [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], and also lower than those in crude and degummed sunflower oils [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, it could be used in food, medical and cosmetics industry.
