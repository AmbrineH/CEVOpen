 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-03219" class="xref">Figure S4</xref>. CSO contained 76.96 mg/kg of tocopherols, mainly γ-tocopherol (&gt;91%) and α-tocopherol (6.6%). δ-Tocopherol was present in low concentration (1.48 mg/kg). However, β-tocopherol was not detected in CSO. The content of total tocopherols (76.96 ± 8.47 mg/kg) in CSO was much lower than that of research (238–427 mg/kg) reported by Matthäus [
