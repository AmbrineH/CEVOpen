Three phytosterols including campesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol were identified, with β-sitosterol as the most abundant sterol, accounting for more than 81% of the total amount of sterols. β-Sitosterol was predominant (2433.56 mg/kg), followed by campesterol (387.77 mg/kg) and stigmasterol (177.47 mg/kg). The total phytosterols of the CSO amounted to 3 g/kg, lower than the previous data ranged from 7 to 17 g/kg [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], which is probably linked to the loss of sterols during oil refining. Compared with other common edible oils, CSO contained a higher total tocopherol content than olive, soybean, peanut, corn, sunflower, and canola oils (260–1000 mg/kg) [
