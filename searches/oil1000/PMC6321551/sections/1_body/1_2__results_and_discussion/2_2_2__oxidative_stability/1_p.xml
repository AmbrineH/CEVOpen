<p class="p">The induction period, widely used to determine stability of edible oils, is an indicator of oxidative processes. The oxidative stability of oils was measured as the induction period in response to forced oxidation. The results in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> indicate that the induction period of CSO was found to be 0.68 h, which is similar to the reported value for Camelina oil (0.63 h) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], but much lower than that of soybean oil [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The possible reason for lower induction period is the high content of unsaturated fatty acids in CSO (89.84% of total lipids). However, as there is limited data available on the stability of CSO, there is rising need for investigation on the stability of CSO during processing and storage.
