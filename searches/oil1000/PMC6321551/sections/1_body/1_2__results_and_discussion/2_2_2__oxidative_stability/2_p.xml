<p class="p">At present there arenâ€™t any color standards for CSO, and thus the Lovibond colorimeter was used firstly for color measurement. The color of CSO, represented by R and Y Lovibond scale, displayed more yellow (13 units) than red (1.65 units), which was consistent with that reported by Maira et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The color ratio of CSO was also similar to that of linseed oil with yellow (70 units) and red (8.6 units) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, CSO has different color than oils such as palm (yellow, 3.2 units; red, 27.4 units) and soy oil (yellow, 4.6 units; red, 10.6 units), which show more red than yellow [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Total pigment and carotenoid content are responsible for the natural color of vegetable oil, which could be an indicator of metamorphic oils. Significant changes of the R and Y values were found on the CSO during the metamorphic process, which could be used as a mark in distinguishing the degree of metamorphism.
