<p class="p">PAHs constitute the critical hazards which are widespread in vegetable oil such as sunflower, olive, peanut, soybean, corn, canola, and palm oils. PAHs might occur from raw materials or the refining process [

 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> indicates the levels of the PAHs detected in CSO. Ten PAHs were revealed in CSO, including pyrene, fluoranthene, BaA, BbFlu, DBahA, Chr, BaP, BkFlu, IP and BghiP. Pyrene had the highest level (180.24 μg/100g) of the PAHs found in this oil. The concentrations of fluoranthene, BaA, and BbFlu were 84.72, 66.92, and 31.49 μg/100g, respectively. The total concentration of the other 6 PAHs was 45.18 μg/100g. The average sum of PAHs in CSO (41.06 μg/kg) was found to be higher than that in sunflower oil (17.36 μg/kg), and lower than that in soybean oil (65.33 μg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. One reason for PAHs introduced in vegetable oils is because of the heating-drying and extraction processes on oilseed or raw material [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Maximum concentration for total PAHs in edible oil in Regulation (European Union) is 10 μg/kg [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Thus, using uncontaminated raw materials, improving the refining process, and using activated carbon to remove PAHs during the oil refining process, are necessary requirements to decrease PAHs before market use [
