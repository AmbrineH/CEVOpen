<p class="p">The antioxidant capability of CSO was evaluated by the inactivation of DPPH and ABTS assays. The radical inhibition decreased after treatment with CSO, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value is the concentration of the sample required to inhibit 50% of radicals) of DPPH of the chia seed oil was 33.94 mg/mL, while the IC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> value (IC
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> value is the concentration of the sample required to inhibit 25% of radicals) of ABTS was 28.51 mg/mL. Overall, catechin and tocopherol demonstrated superior scavenging activity than CSO. Both the ABTS and DPPH methods as investigated in our study gave similar results as the study by Xuan et al. [
