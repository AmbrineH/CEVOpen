<p class="p">Hepatic steatosis can be induced in HepG2 cells by exposing cells to pathophysiological levels of oleic-acid (OA) to mimic the influx of excess lipo-toxicity of free fatty acids in hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. To date there have been no reports published indicating anti-hepatic lipogenic effect in OA-induced HepG2 Cells. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the anti-hepatic lipogenic effect of chia seed oil in the selected in vitro model. In the present study, upon establishing this successful hepatic steatosis model, intracellular TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C levels were significantly increased (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03219-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, significant decreases of TG and LDL-C levels by 25.8% and 72.9% were seen in the CSO treatment group, separately, compared with OA-group, similar to the tocopherol group. Moreover, the group treated with CSO (500 μg/mL) demonstrated a higher reduction of LDL-C than the tocopherol treated group. We have demonstrated that chia seed oil does not reduce the TC secreted in HepG2 cells, but increases the levels of cellular HDL-C. These results could be supplementary in vitro evidence to the in vivo studies by Ayerza et al., which indicated that chia seed diets for 4 weeks decreased TG levels and increased HDL-C cholesterol content in rat serum [

In terms of lipid lowering efficacy, this study indicates that chia seed oil is more effective at reducing triglycerides than total cholesterol, similar to tocopherol. Thus, chia seed oil has great potential as nutraceutical in the food industry with its TG and LDL-C reducing effects, and increasing effect on the secretion of HDL-C.
