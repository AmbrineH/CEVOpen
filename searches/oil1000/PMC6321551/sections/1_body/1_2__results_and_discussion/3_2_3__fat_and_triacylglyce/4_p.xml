 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The main composition of CSO was triacylglycerol, with its content up to 82.60%. The content of total diacylglycerol and FFA were 1.56% (1,3-DAG = 0.82% and 1,2 or 2,3-DAG = 0.74%) and 15.18%, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, seven different TAGs were found in CSO, including aLnaLnaLn, aLnaLnL, aLnLL, aLnaLnP, aLnLO, aLnOP and aLnOO (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-03219" class="xref">Figure S3</xref>). The main triacylglycerols in CSO were aLnaLnaLn, aLnaLnL, aLnLL and aLnaLnP, and their levels were 53.44%, 23.76%, 8.22% and 6.25%, respectively. We found that Î±-linolenic acid was present in all the measured TAGs, which was also discovered by Ixtaina and coworkers [
