<p class="p">CSO has very high contents of α-linolenic (63.64%) and linoleic acids (19.84%), together accounting for more than 83%. In addition, the level of palmitic acid was 7.07%. We found that the ratio n-3/n-6 in CSO was 3.21, in agreement with the range of 3.18–4.18 reported by Ixtaina et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], which is much higher than that of most vegetable oils, such as canola oil (0.45), olive oil (0.13), soybean oil (0.15), and walnut oil (0.20) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the sn-2 fatty acid composition of CSO is indicated in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-03219" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>. Obviously, α-linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids in CSO were the major sn-2 fatty acids, which were responsible for more than 95%. This result is in line with the recognized principle that unsaturated fatty acids mainly occupy the sn-2 position.
