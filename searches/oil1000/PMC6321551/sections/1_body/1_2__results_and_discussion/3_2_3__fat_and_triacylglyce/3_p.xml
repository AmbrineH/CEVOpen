<p class="p">Based on a daily nutrient criterion for linoleic acid and Î±-linolenic acid proposed by National Institutes of Health [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], CSO could be applied as a good dietary supplement. In addition, CSO was characterized by a high polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio, which is highly favorable for the reduction of serum cholesterol and atherosclerosis, and the prevention of cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Many studies have shown that CSO plays a role in lowering serum triglyceride, and also raises the level of HDL-C in rats [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the PUFA/SFA ratio of CSO was 8.85. Thus, the incorporation of CSO into the diet could bring great beneficial effects to the cardiovascular system due to the high content of PUFAs.
