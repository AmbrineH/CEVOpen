 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the most abundant fatty acid was α-linolenic acid (63.64% of total lipids), followed by linoleic acid (19.84% of total lipids), palmitic acid (7.07% of total lipids), and oleic acid (5.5% of total lipids). Among the fatty acids in CSO, the order of abundance of the identified components: α-linolenic acid &gt; linoleic acid &gt; palmitic acid &gt; oleic acid &gt; stearic acid &gt; vaccenic acid &gt; trianoic acid &gt; arachidic acid &gt; palmitoleic acid (

Interestingly, some research has reported that animal feed with chia seed of high PUFA content can increase the level of PUFA in meat fats, as well as aroma and flavor [
