<p class="p">The physical and chemical properties analysis of CSO are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-03219-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The oil content of chia seed ranged from 31.39 to 32.39 g/100 g, much higher than that in soybean (17.6 to 25.4 g/100 g) reported by Dornbos et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The result was consistent with the published data (31.2 g/100 g, on average, of Brazil chia seed) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and 28.5â€“32.70 g/100 g in chia seeds from Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Bolivia [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The results obtained in this study suggested that chia seed was a good source of crude oil based on the high yield of oil content.
