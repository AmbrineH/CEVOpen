<p class="p">The FT-IR spectrum clearly indicates that CSO contains C=C, representing the unsaturated fatty acids, and ester functional groups. The high level of α-linolenic acid (~64% in CSO), with three double bonds, led to a high degree of unsaturation in the spectrum. It was interesting to note that characteristic absorption of OH at 3470 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is not found on the FT-IR spectrum, which suggests that the moisture content could be neglected in CSO.
