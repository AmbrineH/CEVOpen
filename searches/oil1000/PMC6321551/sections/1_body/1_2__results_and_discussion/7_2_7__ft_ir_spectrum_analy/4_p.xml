<p class="p">FTIR is one of the most practical, non-destructive and relatively cost-efficient techniques to evaluate relative levels of unsaturated fatty acid in vegetable oils by their characteristic peaks. The integration area of absorption peaks at 3010 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1743 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were representative of the content of PUFAs and total lipid respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acid could be calculated by the area ratio of 3010/1743 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.The percentage of unsaturated fatty acid found in this study indicates that CSO contains a high concentration of UFAs, which provided the unsaturation observed using individual feature of the peak at 3010 and 1654 cm
