<p class="p">Research findings by Ayerza et al. indicated that the content of the bioactive nutrients of chia seed can be affected by the geographical location and climate condition [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. To date, research has been carried out on basic chemical and physical characteristics, including quantification of fatty acids, tocopherol, and polyphenols. However, to the best of our knowledge, sn-2 fatty acid composition and minor components of Mexican chia seed oil have not been extensively studied. The purpose of this research was to elaborate on most chemical compositions (fatty acids, triacylglycerol, tocopherols, sterols, polyphenols, metal elements, and PAHs) and functional values (antioxidant activity and lipid-lowering effects) of oil extracted from chia seeds grown in Mexico, to further evaluate its nutritional value and thus contribute towards identification of a potential food with medicinal and industrial applications.
