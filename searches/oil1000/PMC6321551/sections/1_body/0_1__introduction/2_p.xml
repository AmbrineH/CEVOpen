<p class="p">Chia, botanically known as 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia hispanica</italic> L., native to southern Mexico and northern Guatemala, is a 2 m tall herbaceous plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae family [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Currently, chia is grown on a commercial scale in the South America, Australia, Europe, and Southeast Asia, due to the high edible value in whole seeds, flour, and oil in food industry. In general, the major constituents in chia seeds include 25–40% oil, 17–24% protein, and 18–30% dietary fiber [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It also contains significant quantities of minerals and phytonutrients, including tocopherols, carotenoids and phytosterols, and phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Chia seed oil is probably one of the healthiest oils on the market, containing predominantly essential fatty acids such as α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. Numerous findings have confirmed that chia seed oil is a healthy oil for lowering the risk for cardiovascular disease, hepatoprotective effect, inflammation, and prevention of obesity-related disorders [

At present, the in vitro cancer cytotoxic properties of CSO have been reported by Ramzi et al., who showed that the CSO significantly inhibited the proliferation of human lymphoblastic leukemic cell lines, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Up to now, there has been no evidence of adverse effects of chia seeds, and toxicological data on CSO from animal and controlled human trials on the safety and efficacy are still limited. However, experience gained from previous and current use of chia seeds for food purposes in developing countries can be regarded as supportive evidence to allow a positive conclusion on the safety of CSO [
