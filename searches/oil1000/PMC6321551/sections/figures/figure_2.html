 <p> Effects of chia seed oil on accumulation of the intracellular ( A) TG, ( B) TC, ( C) HDL-C, and ( D) LDL-C in oleic acid (OA)-induced HepG2 cells. OA-induced accumulation of TG and LDL-C was significantly reduced by chia seed oil co-treatment in HepG2 cells. Vertical bars represent the mean Â± SE of three independent experiments. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 versus OA group. </p>
