<p class="p">The values described in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> show that the antifungal properties of the EO are related to the fungal cell wall biosynthesis pathways, as the MIC in the presence of sorbitol was higher compared to the MIC in the absence in all the tested strains, except for
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>LM04. For caspofungin, which was used as a positive control, the MIC was at least four times higher in the presence of sorbitol in all the tested strains.
