 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume OE inhibited the formation of the
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. monospecies and multispecies biofilm and reduced the mature biofilm in both tested groups (24 h and 48 h). The best results concerning mature biofilm reduction were detected after 24 h of exposure, as the lowest concentration of EO (250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) was able to significantly reduce
 <italic class="italic"> C. tropicalis </italic>ATCC 750 monospecies biofilm (p = 0.0017) and
 <italic class="italic"> Candida </italic>spp. multispecies biofilm (p = 0.0081). A concentration of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL induced a significant reduction in all phases of biofilm development in all biofilm types, except for the
 <italic class="italic"> Candida tropicalis </italic>ATCC 750 mature biofilm after 48 h of exposure (
