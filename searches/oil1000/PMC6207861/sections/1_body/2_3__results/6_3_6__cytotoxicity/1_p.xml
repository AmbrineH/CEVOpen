<p class="p">The percent hemolysis induced by EO is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Up to a concentration of 750 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, the EO diluted in the serum and neutralized serum exhibited a protective effect on human red blood cells. In concentrations of 875
