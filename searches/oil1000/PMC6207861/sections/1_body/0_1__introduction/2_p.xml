<p class="p">Essentially four classes of drugs exist for the treatment of fungal infections with
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic>: polyenic agents, azoles, echinocandins, and antimetabolites. As oral infections are superficial, treatment includes topical antifungals, such as nystatin and miconazole. Despite the number of available therapeutic options, microbial resistance to antifungals from different classes is increasing [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. One of the mechanisms strongly associated with such resistance is the ability of certain microorganisms to form biofilms. Microorganisms in these communities undergo genetic changes that increase their resistance to drugs and the immune system. In the case of
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic>, its ability to form biofilm on biotic and abiotic surfaces represents a relevant virulence factor and is thus an interesting target of study of the development of antifungal agents against candidiasis [
