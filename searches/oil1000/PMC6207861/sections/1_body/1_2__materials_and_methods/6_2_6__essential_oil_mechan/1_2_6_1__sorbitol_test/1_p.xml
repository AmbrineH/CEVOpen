<p class="p">The microdilution technique described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.4" class="xref">Section 2.4</xref> was performed with and without sorbitol. The fungal inoculums were prepared using SDB medium (KASVI®, Kasv Imp e Dist de Prod p/Laboratorios LTDA, Curitiba, Brazil) with added sorbitol (D-sorbitol anhydrous-INLAB, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) to a final concentration of 0.8 M. Sorbitol acts as an osmotic protector; therefore, a reduction in the action of the tested substance in its presence is indicative of action on the fungal cell wall. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h before being read [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Caspofungin (caspofungin diacetate, Sigma-Aldrich, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) was used as a positive control [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This test was performed in triplicate. The mechanism of action was established as involving the cell wall when the MIC attained by the test substance in the presence of sorbitol was higher than the one attained in the absence of sorbitol.
