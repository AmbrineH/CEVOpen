<p class="p">To establish whether the mechanism of action of the tested substance was related to the ergosterol present in the cell membrane, the microdilution technique described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.4" class="xref">Section 2.4</xref> was performed with and without exogenous ergosterol (Sigma-Aldrich, São Paulo, SP). The

 <italic class="italic"> C. tropicalis</italic> ATCC 750 inoculums were prepared in SDB medium with added ergosterol (at 400

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich, São Paulo, SP) and amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, São Paulo, SP) were used as positive controls [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]; the involvement of the cellular membrane was established as the mechanism of action when the MIC attained by the test substance in the presence of ergosterol was higher than the one attained in the absence.
