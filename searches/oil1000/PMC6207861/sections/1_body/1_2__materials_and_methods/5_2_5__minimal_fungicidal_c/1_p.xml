The dishes were incubated at 37°C for 48 h and a visual reading of the fungal growth was performed. The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration able to inhibit visible subculture growth. This test was performed in triplicate. To establish whether the tested EO had fungicidal or fungistatic activity, the ratio of the MFC to the MIC was calculated; activity was considered to be fungistatic when the MFC/MIC ≥ 4 and fungicidal when the MFC/MIC &lt; 4 [
