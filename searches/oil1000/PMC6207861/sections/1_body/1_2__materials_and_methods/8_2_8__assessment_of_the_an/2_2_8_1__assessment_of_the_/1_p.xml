<p class="p">The effect of the test EO on biofilm formation was assessed on 96-well flat-bottom plates (CRAL Artigos para Laboratório LTDA, Cotia-SP, Brazil). Each well received 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of SDB medium (KASVI®, Kasv Imp e Dist de Prod p/Laboratorios LTDA, Curitiba, Brazil).
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum </italic>Blume EO solution was added (100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) to the first wells on the plates and subjected to serial dilution from 1,000 to 7.81 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Nystatin was used as the positive control in concentrations from 100 to 0.78 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Next, the inoculums, which were prepared in the SDB medium with 2% sucrose and adjusted under the spectrophotometer (BioPet Technologies–722G) to a concentration of 2.5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL, were transferred to the plates. A volume of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of inoculum was used for the monospecies biofilm, and a volume of 50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of each strain (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 60193 and
 <italic class="italic"> C. tropicalis </italic>ATCC 750) was used for the multispecies biofilm. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h.
