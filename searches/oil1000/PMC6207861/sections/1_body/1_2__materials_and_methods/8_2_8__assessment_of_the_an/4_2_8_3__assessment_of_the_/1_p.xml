The samples were divided into two groups according to the duration of the incubation period and also to the duration of their exposure to the EO: G1 (24-h incubation in an oven at 37°C) and G2 (48-h incubation in an oven at 37°C). Once the time allotted for incubation was over, the mature biofilm reduction was quantified using the technique described in
