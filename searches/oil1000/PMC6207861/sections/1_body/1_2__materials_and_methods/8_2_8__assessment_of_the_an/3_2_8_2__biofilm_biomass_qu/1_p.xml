<p class="p">Once the incubation period was complete, the culture medium was taken from the plates, and the nonadhered cells were removed by rinsing the wells twice with 200

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of 0.4% crystal violet solution was added to the wells and left in contact with the biofilm for 45 minutes. The wells were then rinsed three times with 200
