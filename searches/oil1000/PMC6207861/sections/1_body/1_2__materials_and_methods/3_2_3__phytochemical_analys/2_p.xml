<p class="p">The initial temperature was set to increase from 60°C to 240°C (3°C/min). The run time was set to 60 minutes, and the temperature of the injector furnace was set to 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas (mobile phase) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, a split ratio of 1:20, and an injection volume of 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L. Component ionization was performed by means of electron impact at 70 eV with a 1.25 kV detector voltage. The spectrometer was used in the SCAN mode with a 40–500 a.m.u. mass range. The ion source temperature was 250°C, and the compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra to the ones contained in the device database.
