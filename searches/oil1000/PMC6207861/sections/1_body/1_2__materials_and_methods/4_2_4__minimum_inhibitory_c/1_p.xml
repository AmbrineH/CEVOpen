<p class="p">The MIC was estimated by means of the microdilution technique on 96-well plates. For this purpose, 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) medium (KASVI®, Kasv Imp e Dist de Prod p/Laboratorios LTDA, Curitiba, Brazil) was added to each well. C.

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Strain viability was assessed, as well as the sterility of the culture medium and of the Tween 80 (diluent of EO emulsion). The plates were incubated in an oven at 37°C for 24 h and then subjected to a visual reading [
