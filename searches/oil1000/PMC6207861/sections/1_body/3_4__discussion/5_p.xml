However, when the same authors compared the MIC of EO and eugenol individually, they found that the MIC was slightly higher for the latter, which suggests that other EO components, even if in small concentrations, act synergically, thus contributing to the antifungal effect of the EO. Therefore, eugenol can be inferred to be the main component responsible for the antifungal effect detected in the present study, but that other components, such as cinnamaldehyde, linalool, benzyl benzoate, alpha-pinene, and beta-pinene, must have also contributed to that effect, as the antifungal activity of each individual compound has been demonstrated [
