<p class="p">In the part of the study on the EO cytotoxicity on human red blood cells, the percent hemolysis found in the samples diluted in the neutralized and nonneutralized serum was dismissible in all the tested concentrations according to the reference values recommended by [

In all the tested concentrations, the neutralized solvent induced less hemolysis, which points to the relevance of the neutralization of solutions, as the occurrence of hemolysis in the living body is undesirable.
