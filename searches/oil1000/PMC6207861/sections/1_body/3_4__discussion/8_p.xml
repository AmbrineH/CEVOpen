<p class="p">In addition to the ability of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO to act on
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. planktonic cells, an interesting antifungal potential was detected relative to the
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. biofilm in the various stages of formation. At concentrations of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, the EO reduced the
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. biofilm formation by 34.94% to 49.42%. For the mature biofilm, the EO at a concentration of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL reduced all the tested biofilm types by at least 50%, except for the
 <italic class="italic"> C. tropicalis</italic> biofilm, which exhibited a decrease of 30.2% after 48-h exposure to EO. These findings suggest that the potential of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum </italic>Blume EO to reduce mature biofilm is superior to its ability to inhibit the formation of the microbial community as biofilm. On these grounds, the tested EO might be used as an antifungal for patients affected with candidiasis, i.e., already exhibiting formed biofilm, rather than as a preventive agent, in which case it would play a role in the inhibition of the microorganisms' adherence.
