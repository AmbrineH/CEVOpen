<p class="p">Notably, at a concentration of 250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and after 24 h of exposure, the EO induced a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction of the mature biofilm in two out of the three types of investigated biofilms (
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> monospecies and
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. multispecies). Similarly, all the stages of
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> biofilm formation were sensitive to EO at concentrations of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, suggesting the use of this concentration in the development of medicines based on
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO.
