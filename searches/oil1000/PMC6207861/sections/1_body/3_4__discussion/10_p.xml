<p class="p">Few studies exist in the literature on the antimicrobial effect of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO. A single study assessed its action on
 <italic class="italic"> Candida,</italic> and no study using
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO extracted from the plant leaves could be located [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] analyzed the effect of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume EO on
 <italic class="italic"> C. parapsilosis </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>biofilm formation and reduction and found the full inhibition of biofilm formation at concentrations of 250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and 125 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Mature biofilm reduction (after 24-h formation) was analyzed based on the minimum biofilm reduction concentration values, which were 1,000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and 2,000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL for
 <italic class="italic"> C. parapsilosis </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans, </italic>respectively. Although the authors did not mention the plant part used for the EO production, the extraction was presumably made from the bark because phytochemical analysis showed that cinnamaldehyde was the main component [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This component might account for the differences found relative to the present study, in which the EO was extracted from the plant leaves, and eugenol was the largest component. Eugenol was assessed for its ability to inhibit
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation and reduce the mature biofilm (after 24-h formation); the results showed that it could inhibit biofilm development by 70% when used at a concentration of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and that it could reduce the mature biofilm at concentrations of 1,000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL [
