<p class="p">The study of the mechanism of action of antifungals is a relevant strategy for limiting the emergence of resistance to the drugs currently available, as well as for developing more powerful and safe drugs against infection [

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. However, no studies assessing the mechanism of action of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum </italic>Blume EO against
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. could be found in the literature. The results of the present study indicate that the EO antifungal action seems to be related to the fungal cell wall biosynthesis pathways. However, the tested substance cannot be concluded to interfere with the cell membrane ion permeability through binding to ergosterol because the MIC of only one of the assessed species (
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis </italic>ATCC 750) increased twice in the presence of exogenous ergosterol. Considering the discrete increase of MIC detected in the presence of an osmotic protector (sorbitol) and the complex composition of EO, the antifungal activity of EO might involve other mechanisms of action, in addition to the ones addressed in the present study. Because the antifungal effect of eugenol, the main component of the tested EO, on
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. is related to ergosterol biosynthesis, a study of this pathway might provide promising hypotheses for future studies [
