<p class="p">To understand better the antifungal effect detected with the MIC and MFC tests, the effect of the EO on the fungal growth kinetics was assessed. This test showed that for the three concentrations assessed (MIC, MICx2, and MICx4), the effect of the EO on
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> began to be perceptible after 8-h exposure and that a 24-h exposure was sufficient for the antifungal effect of the EO to occur. No studies assessing the effect of EO extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume leaves on
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> growth and development could be found in the literature.
