<p class="p">The EO extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume leaves has eugenol as its largest component, has antifungal action on
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> spp. planktonic cells and monospecies and multispecies biofilm, acts on the cell wall biosynthesis, and is poorly cytotoxic against human red blood cells and PBMCs. The evidenced properties of the EO extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume leaves encourage the performance of phase I and II clinical studies to validate its use in oral fungal infections.
