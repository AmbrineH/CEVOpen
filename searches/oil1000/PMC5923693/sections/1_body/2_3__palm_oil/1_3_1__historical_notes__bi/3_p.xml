<p class="p">Palm oil should not be confused with palm kernel oil, derived from palm seeds, which has a significantly higher concentration of saturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Globally, palm oil is used as follows [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]: (1) 80% in the food industry (i.e., oil for frying, margarine, baking products, many processed foods); (2) 19% in cosmetics, soaps, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, lacquers and similar products; (3) 1% for the production of biodiesel. Crude palm oil is made up of almost 100% lipids, nearly all in the form of triglycerides. Saturated fatty acids (predominantly palmitic acid) constitute approximately 45% of its total fatty acids. The balance between saturated and monounsaturated plus polyunsaturated fatty acids (approximately 1:1) is nutritionally favourable.
