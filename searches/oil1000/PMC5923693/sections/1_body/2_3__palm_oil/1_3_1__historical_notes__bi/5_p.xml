<p class="p">The more efficient absorption of fatty acids esterified in the sn-2 position also explains the different absorption of the various fatty acids in breast milk versus bovine milk. Palmitic acid is the predominant saturated fatty acid in the human diet and is the most common saturated fat in breast milk. In contrast to bovine milk, breast milk contains a large quantity of palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position. This makes the absorption of palmitic acid easier for the nursling, which favours rapid growth in the first months of life [
