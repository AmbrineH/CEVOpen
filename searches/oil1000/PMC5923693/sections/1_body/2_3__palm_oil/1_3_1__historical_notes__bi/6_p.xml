<p class="p">Palm oil undergoing interesterification procedures has a nonselective distribution of saturated fatty acids in the sn-3 binding position of glycerol. After interesterification, palmitic acid is no longer selectively excreted in the faeces and is absorbed more efficiently owing to its presence in the sn-2 position. In the literature, palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position seems not to have direct effects on postprandial lipemia, glucose metabolism or insulin compared with palmitic acid esterified in sn-1 or sn-3 [
