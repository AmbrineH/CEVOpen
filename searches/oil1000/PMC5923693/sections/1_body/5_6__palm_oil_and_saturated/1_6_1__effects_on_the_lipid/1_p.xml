<p class="p">In the 1970s, the Seven Countries Study showed that the dietary consumption of saturated fats correlated to total cholesterolaemia and LDL, known factors in coronary risk [

The fatty acid composition of palm oil consists of high amounts of palmitic but also oleic acid. Consumption of oleic acid is considered as healthy. On the contrary, due to the fact that palm oil contains palmitic acid, which is a saturated fatty acid, it was extrapolated that palm oil should give rise to elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. However, the effects of palm oil on the lipid profile emerge from a meta-analysis of studies on the replacement of palm oil with mono-unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fats, myristic and lauric acid or trans-unsaturated fats: such substitutions do not induce variations in the LDL/HDL ratio [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In conclusion, palm oil does not exert significant effects on the lipid profiles of young people or of people with normal cholesterolaemia.
