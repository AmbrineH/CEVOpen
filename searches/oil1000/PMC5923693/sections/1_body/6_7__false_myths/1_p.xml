<p class="p">After careful evaluation of the literature, we reviewed the portrayal of palm oil role in mass media. Biscuit packaging seems to project the notion of better quality by quite simply adding the label “without palm oil”, suggesting that the absence of palm oil makes any food more desirable and safer for one’s health. This conception a mistake. To date, there is no evidence that palm oil is a threat to be avoided; it is more relevant to understand the amounts written on the label, paying attention to the quantity of saturated fats contained in the food, rather than which fat is used. Eliminating palm oil does not guarantee the greater quality of the product. Therefore, it is necessary to debunk some myths and state some truths.</p>
