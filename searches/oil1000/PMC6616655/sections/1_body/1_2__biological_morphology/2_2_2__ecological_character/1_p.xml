<p class="p">Natural ecological factors, such as parasites, microorganisms, hormone analogues, heavy metals, acid–base compounds, corrosive substances, and salt, affect the growth and development of insects [

 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Heavy metals in organic waste accumulate in 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, which can affect the developmental period of this insect, increase larval mortality, and reduce the rates of pupation and emergence [

 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Studies indicate that different concentrations of Zn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> have different effects on the developmental period of larvae, which mainly involve changes in weight, enzyme activity, total amounts of small molecule proteins and hemolymph levels of hormones in larvae [

 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Similarly, the weight, enzyme activities, levels of hormones, and, in particular, the contents of total sugars, proteins, and grease of larvae are affected by Cu

 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> accumulation in the larvae appears with high levels of the Cu
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> stress [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], the tolerance characteristics of mature larvae and pre-pupae can be affected by stress from alcohol toxicity, oxygen, and high osmotic pressure. Mature larvae and pre-pupae have been found to exhibit good resistance to these stresses, and their average mortality rates were found to decrease when the concentration of each stress factors (i.e., ethanol, mineral oil, and sodium chloride) is lower than 20–60%. In particular, at high levels of alcohol and osmotic pressure and low concentrations of oxygen, the development of larvae is threatened [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In addition, research has revealed that the Cd and Cr contents in the pupal shell are significantly higher than those in the pupa. This distribution pattern may be informative for studying the migration process of heavy metals in 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Insect growth and development are also affected by temperature, light, and humidity. Certain appropriates temperature (27.5–37.5 °C) [

 <xref rid="B60-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] and humidity (70%) [
 <xref rid="B61-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] are more conducive to spawning, emergence, and conversion of organic waste in this insect. Several studies have found that hydrolytic proteins and organophosphates from 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> are present in the gut and skin of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> has been reported to be a common microorganism that plays an important role in the intestinal tract of insects [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. For example, a 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> strain exists in the gut of 
 <italic class="italic">Apis cerana japonica</italic> (Japanese honeybee) that can inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">Paenibacillus</italic>, which in the American honeybee can cause larvae to emit an unpleasant odor [
 <xref rid="B65-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Bradley observed a 
 <italic class="italic">Trichopria sp</italic> (Hymenoptera: Hamiidae) that can parasitize and lay eggs on the pupae of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, which likely affects development in 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Although, the gut microbial communities (fungal and bacterial) in

 <xref rid="B68-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], identified communities in the gut of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> have been found to be unique relative to those of other insects [
 <xref rid="B69-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. These unique communities, by possessing certain metabolic properties might be key in the conversion and digestion of complex organic waste by the

 <xref rid="B73-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Thus, the gut microbiome in the larvae may play an important role in the conversion of organic waste.
