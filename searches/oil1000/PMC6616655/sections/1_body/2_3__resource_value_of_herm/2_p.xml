<p class="p">Due to the abundance of enzymes and microbes in the intestine of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, the larvae have a wider range of potential sources of food than do other saprophytic insects. The larvae can effectively digest and convert organic matter; therefore, high-quality fertilizers and organic matter can be acquired. Organic matter contains 20–70% protein, 30–60% amino acids, 10–50% fat, and 2–10% sugar. It also contains fatty acids, minerals elements, vitamins and other active substances that possess health functions for humans [
