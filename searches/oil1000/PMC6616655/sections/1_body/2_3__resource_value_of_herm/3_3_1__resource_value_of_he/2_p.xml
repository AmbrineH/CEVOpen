Based on an analysis of the growth performance, serum indicators, and nutrient digestibility of pigs, Zhang et al. reported that larvae powder can be added as a protein feed or can replace fish meal and soybean meal in pig feed. When the larvae were used in broiler chicks feed, body weight gain was improved, and frequency of CD4+ T lymphocytes, serum lysozyme activity, and spleen lymphocyte proliferation were increased. These findings indicted that as feed, the larvae have prophylactic properties, stimulating non-specific immune responses and reducing the burden of

The nutritional value of the protein is greatly affected by the drying method, Huang et al. reported that conventional drying (60 Â°C) yielded a higher digestible indispensable amino acid score and better digestibility than did microwave drying [
