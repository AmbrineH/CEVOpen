<p class="p">The larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> are rich in amino acids and minerals. The nutritional value of larvae varies according to the type of organic waste the larvae are fed [

 <xref rid="B100-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. Essential amino acids are abundant in the protein obtained from black soldier fly larvae. According to Sheppard and Newton, the leucine, isoleucine and valine contents of pre-pupa powder are much higher than those of fish meal, and the contents of all other amino acids except tryptophan are higher in pre-pupa powder than in soybean meal (

 <xref rid="B93-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Regarding mineral contents, the Fe, Mn, and Al contents of pre-pupa powder are much higher those in fish meal and soybean meal. The contents of some other minerals (Na, Mg, Zn) are also higher in pre-pupa powder than in fish meal and soybean meal, but those of K and Cu are slightly lower [
 <xref rid="B93-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Compared with other insects, soybean meal and fish meal, the crude protein contents of the larvae and pre-pupae of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> are slightly lower.
