<p class="p">Previous research has revealed that the ecological characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> are similar to those of houseflies and that the two species appear to compete with one another. 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> fly has been shown to inhibit the breeding of houseflies [

 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>. Subsequently, research on the treatment of livestock excrement and domestic waste has been ongoing. In 1997, Dr. Oliver of the United States Environmental Technology and Engineering Corporation invented a 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae biotransformer for domestic use. The biotransformer has been successfully used to treat municipal solid waste. In 2007, Dr. Xincheng An of the Guangdong Institute of Entomology designed a bioconversion system for the efficient large-scale treatment of organic waste; the system achieved satisfactory reduction, decontamination, and recycling of waste. Kitchen waste, livestock excrement, deteriorated fruits and vegetables, crop waste, and food-processing waste can be quickly and effectively converted by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae because of this insectâ€™s wide range of potential foods. The converted waste then forms the biomass of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae itself, such that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae can be applied in environmental ecology and as an effective treatment for organic waste [
