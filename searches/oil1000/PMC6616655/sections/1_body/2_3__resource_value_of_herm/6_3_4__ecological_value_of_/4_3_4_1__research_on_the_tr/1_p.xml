<p class="p">The accumulation of livestock excrement that cannot be promptly and effectively treated leads to environmental pollution, primarily through air, water, and soil pollution [

 <xref rid="B141-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. At present, the methods of converting or utilizing livestock excrement are mainly restricted to excrement use in high-temperature compost, as an energy source, and in feedstuff production [
 <xref rid="B142-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. In the late 1970s, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae began to replace houseflies in the bioconversion of livestock excrement, and substantial progress rapidly followed [

 <xref rid="B143-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. Recently, a model for converting livestock excrement by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae has been piloted and promoted for sustainable agricultural production in the United States. In 1994, Professor Sheppard of the University of Georgia (USA) established an efficient, low-cost a manure treatment system using 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae. The system converted half the manure into protein (42%) and grease (35%) as evidenced by the characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, and the nitrogen content and the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were significantly reduced [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Fermented and fresh pig manure was also converted by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae, with conversion rates of 23% and 28%, respectively. After conversion, the content of organic matter in the manure was 71.9%, the total nutrient content (N + P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> + K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) was 8.76%, and the pH value was 7.3. These nutrient values fully met the standard for organic fertilizer [

 <xref rid="B145-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. Cow dung, swine manure and chicken manure converted by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae can be used as high-quality organic fertilizer and produce no offensive smell. In particular, cow dung converted by this insect becomes less solid, and when as an organic fertilizer, can increase the growth of pasture. In addition, the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents of pig manure were found to decrease by 55.1%, 44.1%, and 52.8%, respectively, following conversion, and organic matter formed. These observations indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae offers significant economic and environmental benefits in the treatment and conversion of livestock excrement [
 <xref rid="B111-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. In addition, the treatment system has been adopted to the treatment of waste from animal farming and has achieved satisfactory results [

 <xref rid="B151-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Research has shown that after conversion, the pH of human feces increases, the total amounts of solid and total volatile solids and the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> significantly decrease, and the level of total ammonia nitrogen improves. No significant effect of such treatment has been observed on enterococci, phage 174, or 
 <italic class="italic">Ascaris</italic> eggs. These outcomes indicate the environmental and ecological value of such treatment [
