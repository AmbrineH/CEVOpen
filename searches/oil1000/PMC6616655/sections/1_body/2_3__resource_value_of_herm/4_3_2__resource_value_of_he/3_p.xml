<p class="p">Compared with typical energy-resource plants, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> has advantages of high fertility and a short life cycle. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> can convert livestock excrement and domestic waste into clean energy, which results in the resource utilization of organic waste. In addition, glucose and xylose have been shown to contribute to the accumulation of lipids in larvae, yielding a lipid content of 34.60% [
 <xref rid="B119-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. These findings indicate that, lignocellulose is a useful substance for lipid accumulation in larvae and that the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> is a very promising organism for the conversion of lignocellulose [
