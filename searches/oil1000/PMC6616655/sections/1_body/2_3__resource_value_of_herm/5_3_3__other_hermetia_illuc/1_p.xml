<p class="p">The larvae and pre-pupae can be developed not only as sources of insect protein and grease but also as high-value resource materials for the extraction of antimicrobial peptides, chitin, and chitosan [

 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. The induction and extraction of antimicrobial peptides from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> revealed that the best period for induction and production was the 5th instar. In one study, the abdomens of 5th instar 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae were punctured with needles dipped in 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> solution (3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">12</sup> individuals/mL) and then soaked in 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> solution for 60 s. After larval feeding for 24 h the activity of antimicrobial peptides against 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> was better than that induced by ultrasound of 100 W for 20 min [

 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], which exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and the immunity of the larvae can be promoted. The active antimicrobial peptide induced by methanol solution has strong inhibitory effects on many bacteria. The crude antimicrobial peptide can inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> well after purification, as evidenced from high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared with natural conditions, needle stimulation has been shown to result in stronger antimicrobial activity and a broader antibacterial spectrum of the antimicrobial peptide [

 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In addition, the antimicrobial peptide derived from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae has been shown to possess greater thermal stability than antimicrobial peptides derived from other insects and to exhibit good performance after repeated freezing and thawing. Storage time can reach 96 h at room temperature, and the suitable pH range is 5–9, which indicates good biological stability [
