<p class="p">Chitin derived from crustaceans is a linear biological biopolymer [
 <xref rid="B126-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>] and has been widely used in the textiles industry, papermaking, agriculture and forestry, food, medicine, environmental protection, bio-engineering, and other fields [
 <xref rid="B127-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B128-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. The resource value of insects derives not only from their protein, grease, and antimicrobial peptides but also from their chitin. In recent years, chitosan has been successfully extracted from the pupa shell of silkworms, maggots, and pine caterpillars [
 <xref rid="B129-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. White or yellowish chitin was extracted from the pupa shell of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> and successfully transformed into chitosan by Xu Qiyun for the first time. The extraction rates of chitin and chitosan were 12.3–14.3% and 83.2–86.3%, respectively, and the degree of deacetylation of the chitosan was 82.8%. Waśko and Bulak reported the physicochemical properties of chitin extracted from larvae and imagoes of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>. The surface morphologies of the two chitin types were separately analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, and the crystalline index values of the chitins extracted from the imagoes and larvae were 24.9% and 35%, respectively. Compared with the crystallinity indexes (CrI) of chitin from other insects, those of chitin extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> were much lower. Low-crystallinity chitin has desirable adsorption properties [
 <xref rid="B130-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>], and chitin with a low CrI index exhibits high heavy-metal-removal efficiency due to its low diffusion resistance [
 <xref rid="B131-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. The chitin extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae has unique physicochemical traits, suggesting 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> as a new source of this biopolymer for biotechnological applications [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Therefore, the resource value of the antibacterial peptides and chitin of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> may become a topic of further investigation in the biomedical field.
