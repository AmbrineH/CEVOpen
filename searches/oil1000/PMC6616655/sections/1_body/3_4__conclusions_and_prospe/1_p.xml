<p class="p">Due to its biological characteristics, the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> has been widely used for the environmentally friendly treatment of common organic waste, such as excrement, kitchen waste, domestic waste, and agricultural waste. Importantly, such treatment not only converts the organic waste to useful and harmless forms but also results in the conversion of the nutriment to insect biomass. The proteins and grease of this insect have been applied to the breeding industry and the fine chemical engineering industry. In addition, the antimicrobial peptides and chitin obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> are important raw materials for biology, medicine, and food production. However, the biological characteristics and resource value of this insect have not been used effectively or sufficiently because of the low level of industrialization. Although this insect has been applied to the treatment of organic wastes and the feed industry, the industrialized, large-scale breeding of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> remains in the exploratory stage. Reports on the detailed process and mechanism of conversion are lacking, although some research on the gut microbial communities of the larvae has been performed. Crop straw is an important source of biomass energy, but its utilization efficiency is low, and its processing is challenging due to its physicochemical properties. The bioconversion of agriculture waste by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> is in very early stages, and studies of the mechanisms of the bioconversion and degradation of crop straw by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> in cooperation with microorganisms are needed.
