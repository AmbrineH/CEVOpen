<p class="p">With the rapid development of intensive and modern industry, agriculture and livestock farming, problems related to food, the environment and energy will be aggravated. Research on the comprehensive resource utilization of waste using the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> will receive increasing attention. Studies of the process and mechanism of conversion, including the interactions with microorganisms, are needed, as are studies of the acquisition and safety evaluation of nutrients from this insect. The results of such efforts might encourage the development of industrialized, large-scale breeding and a processing industry based on 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> as well as the safe and useful treatment of organic wastes. These developments will play an important role in agriculture, industry and human health.
