<p class="p">Organic wastes are converted by biotransformation into organic matter comprising polypeptide-containing proteins, lipids, peptides, amino acids, chitin, and vitamins. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> is regarded as a non-pest and beneficial insect. Insects are regarded as an important source of protein for the 21st century [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The digestibility of insect-derived protein can reach more than 70%, which approaches the digestibility of fish and meat protein and is significantly higher than that of vegetable protein. In addition, much progress has been made in research on the replacement of fodder with 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> protein [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Several studies have indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> can be induced to produce antimicrobial peptides, that have activity against many bacteria [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], and that chitin can be extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> puparium to produce chitosan [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> grease has substantial future potential in the development of high-tech products, such as biodiesel. Because of its abundant nutritional value, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> offers considerable potential for exploitation. However, breeding on a scale appropriate for modern industrialization remains under-researched. Although studies have been conducted on, the application of chitin in the field of biomedicine; the industrial application of grease; and the efficient extraction of proteins, amino acids, peptides, and grease for the development of later high value-added products; detailed research on the feeding of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> using agricultural waste as the primary raw material has not been reported. In this article, the development value and resource utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> and the use of this insect to treat and render harmless manure, agricultural wastes, and domestic wastes are summarized. This article provides a theoretical basis for research on the future ecological treatment of organic waste and other potential uses for 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>.
