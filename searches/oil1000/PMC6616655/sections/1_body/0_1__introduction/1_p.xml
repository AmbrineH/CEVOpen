 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, was thought to originate from the South American savannah. It is widely distributed in temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, the recent discovery of a larva of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larva in the sarcophagus of Isabella d’Aragona (1470–1524) shows how the geographical origin and spread of this insect still represent an intriguing topic [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> inhibits multiplication of the housefly [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], but unlike the housefly it does not invade human living environments, pollute the environment, spread diseases, or harm crops [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Research has identified the larvae of this insect as a type of saprophytic insect that feeds on industrial, agricultural, and household organic waste or plant and animal remains [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The larvae can digest harmful and pernicious bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, in the process of organic waste decay [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], thereby reducing the harmful effect of such waste on the environment [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In early research, Sheppard and Tomberlin discussed the factors that influence 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> oviposition, which provided technical support for the artificial breeding of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and subsequent development of the resource value of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>. Due to its wide dietary range, the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> has been widely used to treat and render harmless food waste, manure [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and diseased or dead livestock. 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> has been studied and utilized in many fields to favorable effect. A complete list of substrates that have been tested as feeding substrates for 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae and the corresponding outcomes are provided in the table. It can be seen from the 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00349-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> that the effects on the development of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> vary among substrates. In additional to substrate type, environmental factors are key factors affecting the development of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>, contributing to variation among studies. In general, substrates rich in nutrients (protein and oil), are more suitable for the development of the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic>.
