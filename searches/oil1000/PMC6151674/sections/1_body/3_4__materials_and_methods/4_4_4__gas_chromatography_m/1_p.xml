<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis was carried out on Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent) attached to a HP-5MS fused silica column, interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5975C mass selective detector operated by HP Enhanced ChemStation software (Agilent). The analytical conditions for GC were the same as those mentioned for GC-FID. The injection volume was 0.2 Î¼L of 1% solution prepared in n-hexane with split ratio 1:50. Mass spectra were acquired in EI mode at 70 eV. The mass range was from
