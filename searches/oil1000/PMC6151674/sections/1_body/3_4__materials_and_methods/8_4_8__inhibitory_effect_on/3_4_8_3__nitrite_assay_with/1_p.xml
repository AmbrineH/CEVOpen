<p class="p">To investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of GR-EO, NO production was assessed according to the Griess reaction [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Each tested sample was dissolved in DMSO, and diluted with fresh FBS-free DMEM media to a final concentration with DMSO ≤ 0.1%. The RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL) and co-incubated with samples and LPS (10 μg∙mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, each 50 μL of the culture supernatant was mixed with 50 μL of Griess reagent I and 50 μL of Griess reagent II at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microtiter plate reader. A series of known concentrations of sodium nitrite (NaNO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was used as the standard curve.
