<p class="p">The cytotoxicity of GR-EO was evaluated by MTT assays. GR-EO was solubilized in DMSO, and afterwards diluted with culture medium for use. RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells per well) with 200 μL of culture medium were seeded in 96-well plates and grown for 24 hours to allow cell attachment. After that, the cells were treated with or without the dilutions of the oil for 24 h. Then, 20 μL MTT solutions (5 mg/mL in PBS) were added to each well for another 4 h and the resulting crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The optical density was read at 570 nm. Cytotoxicity was calculated from the plotted results using untreated cells at 100%. The percentages of cell growth were calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Cell growth (%) = [A (sample) / A (control)] × 100%.
