<p class="p">The MIC values were performed in 96 well-microplates using the microdilution assay according to the literature previously described by Ellof (1998) with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The essential oil was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and diluted with MHB to a final concentration with DMSO &lt;4%, then transferred into each well (100 μL per well). Chloramphenicol was used as the reference antibiotic control. The inoculum was added to all wells (100 μL per well). And bacterial suspension containing DMSO (4%) without EO was used as control. The plates were incubated at 36 °C for 12–16 h. Antimicrobial activity was detected by adding 20 μL of 1% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) aqueous solution. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited visible growth, as indicated by TTC staining [
