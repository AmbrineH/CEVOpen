<p class="p">Antibacterial activities were assessed by the disc agar diffusion method recommended by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) (2012) [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Briefly, each strain was incubated overnight in MHB and then adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL. Then 100 μL of bacterial suspension was spread on the MHA plates, on which filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) individually saturated with essential oil (10 μL, 10 mg/mL) were placed. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The DIZ values were measured with a caliper in millimeter. Chloramphenicol (10 μg/disc) was used as the control. All the tests were repeated in triplicate.
