<p class="p">Analysis of GR-EO was performed by gas chromatograph (GC) using an Agilent 6890 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID, Agilent). GC-FID analysis of the oil was carried out on HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) under the following conditions: Program the oven temperature stay at 60 °C for 1 min, then heat to 280 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, hold at 280 °C for 2 min. The carrier gas used was helium at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min, while the detector and injector temperatures were 250 °C and 240 °C, respectively.</p>
