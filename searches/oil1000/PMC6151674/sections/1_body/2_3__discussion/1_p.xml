<p class="p">In the present study, the major constituents in the GR-EO were found to be β-caryophyllene (23.3%), β-elemene (8.0%), farnesyl butanoate (7.4%), myrcene (3.5%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol (3.3%), and α-caryophyllene (3.3%). It is noteworthy that some major compounds had been reported to have various bioactivities. Such as β-caryophyllene, a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene, which is a constituent of many essential oils, especially clove oil. Previous studies have indicated that β-caryophyllene possessed a significant activity against gram-positive bacteria with MIC values from 0.032 to 0.256 mg/mL [
