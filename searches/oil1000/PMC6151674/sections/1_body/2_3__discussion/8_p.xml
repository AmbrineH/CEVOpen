<p class="p">Additionally, we also evaluated the inhibitory effects of GR-EO on NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. LPS is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and it has been recognized as important in determining both the virulence of these organisms and the symptomatology that accompanies gram-negative bacteria infection [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. When bacterial cells are lysed by the immune system, fragments of membrane containing LPS are released into the circulation. After exposure to LPS from gram-negative bacteria, inducible NOS (iNOS) can be induced in various cells, such as macrophages, kupffer cells, and hepatocytes, to trigger cytotoxicity, tissue damage, inflammation sepsis, and stroke, and can cause fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock. Therefore, LPS is in large part responsible for the dramatic clinical manifestations of infections with pathogenic gram-negative bacteria [
