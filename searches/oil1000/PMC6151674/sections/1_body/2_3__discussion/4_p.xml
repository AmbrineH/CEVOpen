<p class="p">From the results obtained, what is more noteworthy is that the combinations of GR-EO plus all tested antibiotics have conspicuous synergistic effects when tested against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (FICI range of 0.25 to 0.38). 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium, is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. Severe infections, such as pneumonia or bacteremia, are associated with high mortality rates and are often difficult to treat, as the repertoire of useful anti-pseudomonal agents is limited; moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> has high intrinsic resistance to antibiotic and exhibits remarkable ability to acquire resistance to these agents during treatment [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The ability of antibiotic resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> is significantly due to low permeability of the cell wall, which restricts the uptake of antibiotics, and the genetic capacity to express a wide repertoire of resistance mechanisms, like efflux pumps and enzymes, which modify or degrade antibiotics and drug targets [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Therefore, combination therapy involving GR-EO tends to open new avenues and a viable treatment option.
