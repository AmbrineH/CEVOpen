<p class="p">The evaluation of NO production showed that GR-EO presented a significant inhibitory effect. It could be attributed to the presence of significant amounts of β-caryophyllene and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol, which have been reported to possess excellent inhibitory effect on the NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages [

Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that β-caryophyllene is a dietary cannabinoid with important anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of the cannabinoid type-2 receptor. Meanwhile, in vivo, peroral β-caryophyllene strongly reduces inflammation in a mouse model of colitis [
