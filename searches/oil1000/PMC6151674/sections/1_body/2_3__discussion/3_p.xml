<p class="p">Furthermore, the synergistic effects of GR-EO in combination with four selected conventional antibiotics were evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The present study revealed the synergistic effect of GR-EO in combination with Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, Penicillin, or Ampicillin against a wide range of bacterial strains. It is to be noted that remarkable synergistic action was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> by the combination of GR-EO with Streptomycin (FICI of 0.13). 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium, has been linked to numerous common bacterial infections, including bacteremia, cholecystitis, cholangitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-01561" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Therefore, the combination therapy involving Streptomycin and GR-EO can represent a novel approach in the management of several infections. Besides, the combination of GR-EO with Chloramphenicol or Penicillin also possessed synergistic effects against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with the FICI values of 0.5.
