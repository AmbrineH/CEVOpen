<p class="p">More accurate data on the antibacterial activity were obtained through the MIC and MBC (Minimal bactericidal concentration) values of the oil. From the data, it is evident that GR-EO displayed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01561-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the most susceptible strains were 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 0.049 mg/mL, MBC = 0.049 mg/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> (MIC = 0.049 mg/mL, MBC = 0.049 mg/mL), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 0.250 mg/mL, MBC = 0.500 mg/mL). However, it showed a weak activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (MIC = 1.563 mg/mL, MBC = 3.125 mg/mL).
