<p class="p">GR-EO was tested against four pathogenic bacteria, including two gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>) and two gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>). The antibacterial activities of GR-EO were qualitatively assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition zone diameters (DIZs). The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01561-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. GR-EO exhibited obvious antibacterial activities against most tested bacteria strains with DIZs of (24.1 ± 0.6), (23.8 ± 0.7), and (15.8 ± 0.5) mm for 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, respectively. However, this oil showed low activity (DIZ &lt; 7.5 mm) towards 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>.
