<p class="p">We determined the inhibitory effect of GR-EO on the NO production of RAW 264.7 macrophages using Griess reagent system. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01561-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the essential oil exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the LPS-stimulated cells in a dose-dependent manner. It inhibited NO release by 19.35%, 24.94%, 29.66%, and 35.51% compared with LPS treated cells at the concentration of 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL, respectively. In the MTT assay, GR-EO was noncytotoxic by themselves at concentrations up to 50 μg/mL in RAW 264.7 cells (data was not shown), which suggested that the inhibitory activity against NO production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells was not induced by the cytotoxicity of the tested GR-EO.
