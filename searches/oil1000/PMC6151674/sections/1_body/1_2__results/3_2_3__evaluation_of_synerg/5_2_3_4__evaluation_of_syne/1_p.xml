<p class="p">As is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01561-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, combination of GR-EO and Ampicillin led to a synergistic effect against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (FICI of 0.38) and an additive effect against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (FICI of 1). The combination against strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> were not performed because these strains were sensitive when antibiotic was administered alone.
