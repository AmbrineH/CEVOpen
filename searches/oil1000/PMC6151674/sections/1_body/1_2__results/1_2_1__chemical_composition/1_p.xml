The analysis of the oil by Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID, Agilent) and GC-MS showed the presence of 77 constituents that were identified, which accounts for almost 98.0% of the oil. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were predominant (45.2%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (25.9%), and monoterpene hydrocarbons (7.3%), diterpenes (4.7%), and oxygenated monoterpenes (3.0%). The major chemical constituents were found to be β-caryophyllene (23.3%), β-elemene (8.0%), farnesyl butanoate (7.4%), myrcene (3.5%),
