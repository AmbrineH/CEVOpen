<p class="p">The current study identified the chemical components of GR-EO by GC and GC-MS, evaluated the antibacterial activity of GR-EO alone and the synergistic effects of the combinations between GR-EO and antibiotics, and assessed the NO production inhibitory effect. The results obtained revealed that GR-EO exhibits potent inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and possesses significant antibacterial effect, especially against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>. Additionally, synergistic effects were observed against tested bacteria when GR-EO was combined with conventional antibiotics, which could lead to new options for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and emerging drug resistance. Moreover, no antagonistic effect was observed in this study further augments the potential for the use of GR-EO in combination with antibiotics.
