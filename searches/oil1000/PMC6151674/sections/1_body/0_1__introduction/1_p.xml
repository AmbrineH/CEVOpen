<p class="p">At present, antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to public health, so it is clear that searching for new antibacterial agents is absolutely necessary. Antibiotic resistance can be intrinsic or acquired and can be transmitted within the same or different species of bacteria. The mechanisms can be divided into different categories: (i) modification of the active site of the target resulting in a reduction in the efficiency of binding of the antibiotic; (ii) direct destruction or modification of the antibiotic by enzymes produced by the bacterium; (iii) efflux or removal of antibiotic from the cell cause a reduced amount of antibiotic; or (iv) production of an alternative target that is resistant to inhibition by the antibiotic (metabolic by-pass) [
