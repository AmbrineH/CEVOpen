<p class="p">In the present study, we extracted the 
 <italic class="italic">Geophila repens</italic> essential oil (GR-EO) by hydrodistillation, and identified the chemical composition of GR-EO using GC and GC-MS for the first time. Then we demonstrated the in vitro antibacterial properties of GR-EO against four bacterial strains by disc agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods, and studied the synergistic effect of the combination of GR-EO with standard antibiotics using Checkerboard method. In addition, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of GR-EO on NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.
