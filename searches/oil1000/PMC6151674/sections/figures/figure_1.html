 <p> NO production with GR-EO in RAW 264.7 Cells. The cells were incubated with LPS (10 μg/mL) only and with LPS plus the indicated concentrations of GR-EO for 24 h. Results were expressed as a percentage of NO production by the LPS-treated cells (LPS group). All values were performed in triplicate and expressed as mean ± SD. ** p ≤ 0.01 and *** p ≤ 0.001 compared with the LPS only group. </p>
