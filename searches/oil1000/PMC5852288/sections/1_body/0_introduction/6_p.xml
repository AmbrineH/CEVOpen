In spite of the studies that have already been conducted on cocoa beans, there is almost no report on the effects of processing temperature and time on its phenolic content, antioxidant activity, lipid quality, proximate composition and mineral content. In one study, Rocha etÂ al

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref> have demonstrated the impact of the roasting temperature and time of cocoa beans on the sensory characteristics and acceptability of chocolate. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of oven and traditional roasting on the polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, lipid quality and nutritional value of fermented cocoa beans.
