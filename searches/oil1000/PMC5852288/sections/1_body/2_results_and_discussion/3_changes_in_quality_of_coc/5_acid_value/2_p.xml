 <italic class="italic">DORCB 5 min</italic>; meaning that the hydrolytic activities were less in these samples. However, the acid value of 
 <italic class="italic">DTRCB 10 min</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DORCB 10 min</italic> were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05). This might be attributed to the thermal hydrolysis of triglycerides of these samples. The acid value in all the samples was lower than 4 mg KOH/g which is the recommended acid value in crude oils
