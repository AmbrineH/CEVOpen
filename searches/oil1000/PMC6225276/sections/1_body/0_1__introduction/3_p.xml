<p class="p">In this study, the hydrodistillation method was used to extract essential oils from dried SO, SG, and SP aerial parts, and chemical composition analysis was carried out using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Subsequently, the bioactivities of the oils, including anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities, were evaluated in vitro. Furthermore, in order to provide a reference molecular marker for the plant origin, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 genomic regions of the three plants were amplified and sequenced. Our results revealed remarkable differences in the essential oil composition and bioactivities, and in the characteristic ITS sequence, which will facilitate the discrimination of the origins of the three plants and their subsequent utilization.</p>
