<p class="p">Plants produce a wide variety of volatile compounds, including terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ethers, ketones, phenols, and oxides, that play important roles in defense, pollinator attraction, signal transduction, and so on. These volatile compounds are also important resources for the pharmaceutical, food, beverages, perfume, and cosmetics industries, and are thus economically significant [
