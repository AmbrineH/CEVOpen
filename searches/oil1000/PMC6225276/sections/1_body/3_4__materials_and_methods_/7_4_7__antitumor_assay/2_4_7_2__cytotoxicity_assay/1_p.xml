<p class="p">The essential oils from HS were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against cells using the MTT cell viability assay with 5-fluorouracil as the positive control. First, cellular suspensions (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) were cultured in 96-well plates and exposed to different concentrations of the essential oils (1–200 μg/mL) using 3 wells for each concentration. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 48 h [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-02185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Then, 200 μL MTT solution was added to each well and the plates were cultured for 4 h. The absorbance of each well was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. The data were expressed as the mean percentage of viable cells as compared to the respective control cultures treated with the solvent. The half maximal growth inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values) was calculated from the standard curves of the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of the essential oils.
