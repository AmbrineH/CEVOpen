<p class="p">RAW264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL and cultured overnight. After pretreatment with different concentrations of essential oils (0.2–200 µg/mL) or the positive control (minocycline) for 1 h, the cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. The concentration of NO in the conditioned culture medium was examined with the Nitric Oxide Assay Kit and the release of IL-6 in the supernatants was assayed using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions [
