<p class="p">The MTT assay was used to evaluate the effect of essential oils on cell viability [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well. After overnight growth, cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for 1 h, then incubated in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL) for the next 24 h. Then, 20 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added and the cells were cultured for a further 4 h. After that, the supernatant was carefully removed and then the resulting formed azan crystals were dissolved in 100 µL DMSO with horizontal shaking. The absorbance at 490 nm (ref. 570 nm) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] was measured with a microplate reader.
