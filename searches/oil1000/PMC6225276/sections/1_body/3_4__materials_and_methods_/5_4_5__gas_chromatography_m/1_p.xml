<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu (TQ-8040) series GC-MS system (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AOC-20i autosampler. The columns used an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, i.d. 0.25 μm) with a stationary phase of 5% diphenyl/95% dimethylpolysiloxane. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C for 3 min and then programmed to increase as follows: rising from 40 °C to 130 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and holding for 2 min; rising from 130 °C to 150 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and holding for 3 min; rising from 150 °C to 180 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and holding for 3 min; and finally rising from 180 °C to 210 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and holding for 5 min. The ionization energy was 70 eV with a scan time of 0.3 s and a mass range of 45–500 AMU. The identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those from the NIST14 and NIST14s (National Institute of Standards and Technologies, Mass Spectra Libraries, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) [
