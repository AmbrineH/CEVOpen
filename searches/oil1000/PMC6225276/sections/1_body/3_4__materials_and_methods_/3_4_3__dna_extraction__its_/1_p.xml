<p class="p">Dried leaf tissues were ground into a fine powder. Then, DNA was extracted using a Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Kit following the manufacturer′s instructions. Extracted DNA (1 μL) was used as the template for PCR amplification, with 25 μL 2X Taq master premix, 3 μL 10 μM ITS1 primer (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′), 3 μL 10 μM ITS4 primer (5′-TCCTCCGCTT ATTGATATGC-3′), and 18 μL double-distilled H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. The amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s (30 cycles); 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). PCR product (5 μL) was applied to a 1% agarose gel containing GoldView dye and electrophoresis was carried out for 15 min at 150 V followed by observation under UV light in a Tenon gel imaging system. After confirmation of a strong, single amplified band of about 700 bp, the PCR product was sent for Sanger sequencing using ITS1 and ITS4 as sequencing primers. Sequences were confirmed by comparing them with the original sequencing chromatogram and were connected using Seqman software (Madison, MI, USA).
