 <xref rid="molecules-23-02185-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the composition of the three essential oils differed significantly. The essential oil of SO was dominated by hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (45.93%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.99%), and oxygenated monoterpenes (1.53%), among which trans-α-bisabolene (24.41%), caryophyllene oxide (16.88%), caryophyllene (14.13%), and spathulenolspathulenol (12.46%) were found to be the main components. The SG essential oil mainly contained oxygenated sesquiterpenes (65.51%), hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (9.79%), oxygenated diterpenes (9.26%), and oxygenated monoterpenes (4.90%), among which 4-(1,5-dimethylhex-4-enyl)cyclohex-2-enone (12.90%), cedrol (8.35%), phytone (7.83%), caryophyllene oxide (7.18%), dehydronerolidol (6.28%), and dehydrosaussurea lactone (5.49%) were the main components. The essential oil of SP was dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (83.46%), oxygenated diterpenes (3.69%), and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (0.94%), with caryophyllene oxide (21.89%), germacra-4(15),5E,10(14)-trien-1β-ol (14.10%), trans-longipinocarveol (5.87%), (−)-spathulenol (5.14%), and dehydrosaussurea lactone (4.85%) as the main components.
