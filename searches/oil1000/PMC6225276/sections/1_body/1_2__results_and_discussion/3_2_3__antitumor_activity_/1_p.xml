<p class="p">The in vitro antitumor activities of the essential oils were evaluated using two cancer cell lines, Hep3B (liver) and Hela (cervical). The cytotoxicity was expressed as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02185-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the positive control 5-Fu (4.19 μg/mL in Hep3B, 2.08 μg/mL in Hela) was significantly lower than the three essential oils tested (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Among the three essential oils, SP exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity (38.10 μg/mL for Hep3B, 37.72 μg/mL for Hela). These results suggest that essential oils from the three plants might be used as a natural source of compounds for anticancer compound screening.
