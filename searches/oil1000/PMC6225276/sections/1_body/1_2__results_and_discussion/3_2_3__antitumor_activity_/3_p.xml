<p class="p">In order to find out the possible relationships between common compounds and two kinds of activities, a linear regression analysis was carried out between percentages and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values. Our results showed that (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02185" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>) only caryophyllene oxide peak area percentages showed remarkably strong negative correlation coefficients with IC
