<p class="p">A recent study [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] showed that SO ethanol extract significantly inhibited the proliferation of 
 <italic class="italic">RL</italic> 95-2 human endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, SO ethanol extract was effective against A549 (lung cancer), HepG2 (hepatpma), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), and especially on LNCaP (prostate cancer) cell lines. At the same time, it was reported that caryophyllene oxide (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value = 14.90 μg/mL) and caryophyllene (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value = 33.20 μg/mL) were mainly responsible for most cytotoxic activity of SO ethanol extract against 
 <italic class="italic">RL</italic> 95-2 cells. As mentioned previously in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-molecules-23-02185" class="xref">Section 2.1</xref>, there are only four common compounds in the three essential oils, and caryophyllene oxide is one of the four common components in the three essential oils.
