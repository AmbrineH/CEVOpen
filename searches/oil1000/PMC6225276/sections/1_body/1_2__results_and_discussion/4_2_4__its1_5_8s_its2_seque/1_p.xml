<p class="p">Due to the similarity in morphological characteristics of dried and chopped commercial materials, it is difficult to distinguish the three plants from each other. Therefore, it is important to provide a reliable molecular marker for the identification of the plant origin and for comparison with other research studies. It has been accepted that genomic ribosomal DNA sequences, especially ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, can be used for the interspecific identification of plant origin. Therefore, the full ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence was amplified from genomic DNA of the three plants and sequenced. The accession numbers in Genbank are MH701787 (SO), MH701847 (SG), and MH701848 (SP). Multiple alignment of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence from the three plants was carried out using DNAMAN 9.0 software. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02185" class="xref">Figure S3</xref>, across the total sequence of 730â€“732 bp, the three plants shared 99.27% similarity with each other. There are 16 single nucleotide polyphorism (SNP), which can be used for the development of specific Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to distinguish the origins of samples of these three plants.
