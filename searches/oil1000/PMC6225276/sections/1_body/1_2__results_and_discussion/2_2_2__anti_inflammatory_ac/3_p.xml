<p class="p">Inflammatory cells can release a variety of inflammatory cytokines which participate in the regulation of the body’s innate immune response and directly kill target cells or mediate apoptosis, thus promoting the repair of damaged tissues. One of these cytokines is IL-6, a critical component of the inflammatory mediator network which plays an important role in the inflammatory response. The ability of the essential oils to inhibit the release of IL-6 was tested in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. As indicated in
