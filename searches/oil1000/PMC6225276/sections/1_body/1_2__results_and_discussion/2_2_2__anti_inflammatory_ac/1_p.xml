 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], of which kirenol was the main chemical constituent. Pharmacological studies suggested that kirenol could inhibit paw swelling, boost up the proliferation of splenic lymphocyte of adjuvant arthritis rats, regulate T lymphocyte subpopulation ratio, and inhibit specific immune response of normal mice [

Inhibition of excess NO production has been used as an assay in the screening of anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, in this study, we treated the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response and we investigated the inhibitory effects of the three essential oils on NO production by the activated cells. Before the anti-inflammatory activity assay, the cytotoxicity of the three essential oils was evaluated by MTT assay. Our results suggested that the three essential oils had no obvious cytotoxic effects on the RAW264.7 cell line when the concentration was lower than 200 Î¼g/mL (shown in
