<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02185-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the positive control minocycline showed the strongest NO inhibition activity with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.37 μg/mL, which is significantly lower than SG oil (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), SO oil (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and SP oil (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Among the three essential oils, SG oil showed the lowest IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.97 μg/mL, which is significantly lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than SO oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.83 μg/mL) and SP oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 13.48 μg/mL). Even though the SG oil showed weaker NO inhibition activity than minocycline, it still has the strongest NO inhibition effect of any crude essential oil as far as we know.
