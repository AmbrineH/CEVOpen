<p class="p">NO and cytokine IL-6 are important indicators of the cellular inflammatory response. Our results demonstrated that the three essential oils showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. In summary, the three essential oils significantly inhibited the LPS-induced secretion of NO and cytokine IL-6 by the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. These results provide important clues for the identification of possible candidate compounds from the three essential oils, especially SG and SO essential oils.</p>
