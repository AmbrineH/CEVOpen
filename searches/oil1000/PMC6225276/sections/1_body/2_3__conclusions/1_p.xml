<p class="p">In this study, hydrodistillation was used to extract essential oils from the dried aerial parts of SO, SG, and SP, and their chemical compositions and bioactivities were analyzed and compared. A total of 56, 62, and 59 constituents were identified in SO, SG, and SP essential oils, respectively, by GC-MS. There was a marked difference between the components of the three essential oils. The essential oils of SO, SG, and SP exhibited various levels of anti-inflammatory and antitumor activity in vitro. The essential oil of SP (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, 0.97 Î¼g/mL) significantly reduced NO release by LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages, and the essential oil of SO was the most effective at reducing the release of cytokine IL-6. The antitumor activities of the essential oil from SP were much better than SG and SO. Therefore, the essential oils of SO, SG, and SP were significantly different from each other in terms of phytochemical composition, but with similar bioactivities with various activity levels. Among four common compounds in three essential oils, caryophyllene oxide peak area percentages showed remarkably high negative correlation coefficients with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of Hep3B and Hela cytotoxicity, which suggested the contribution of this compound on the cancer cell cytotoxicity of three essential oils. Finally, in order to provide detailed information about the origin of the plants used in the present work, the complete ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was amplified from plant genomic DNA and sequenced. This sequence can be used by other researchers to confirm whether their plant specimens have the same origin as ours or not.
