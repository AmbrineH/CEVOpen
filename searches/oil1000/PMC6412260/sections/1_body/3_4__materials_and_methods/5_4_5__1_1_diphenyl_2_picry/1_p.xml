 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> M) was prepared by dissolving 22 mg of DPPH in 50 mL of methanol. This solution was kept at 20 °C until used. Samples (0.02 g) were extracted in two steps: first, to the dry material in an Eppendorf tube was added 1 mL of distilled water. Specimens were heated at 95 °C during 15 min and further for 5 min centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 25 °C). The supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube. The supernatant with 1 mL of dist. water was diluted and the same heating and centrifugation procedure was repeated. The study solution (6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> M) was prepared by mixing 100 mL of methanol with 6 mL of the stock solution. Then, 0.1 mL of each experimental solution was mixed in to react with 3.9 mL of the solution of DPPH, followed by vortexing for 30 s and a further reaction time of 30 min. The optical absorbance was gauged at 515 nm with the Jenway UV/Vis 6405 spectrophotometer. A sample without DPPH solution was utilized as a blank sample. The scavenging activity of DPPH was measured according to the formula below:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Scavenging activity of DPPH (%) = [(A control − A sample)/Acontrol] × 100</disp-formula>where A = absorbance at 515 nm.
