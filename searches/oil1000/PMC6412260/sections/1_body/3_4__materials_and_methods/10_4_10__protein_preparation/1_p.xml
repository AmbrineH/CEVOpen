<p class="p">The three-dimensional complex structures of AChE (PDB ID: 1EVE) and BuChE (PDB ID: 1P0I) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The protein structures were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard panel tool of the Scrödinger software suite (Maestro 11.8). Firstly water molecules (&gt;5Å radius) and other small molecules were removed from the crystal structures, hydrogen atoms were added and physiological pH was set at 7. Finally, the restrained minimization was performed with the added hydrogen atoms to OPLS3e.
