 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fraction of fruit was first applied to a silica gel column and eluted with a gradient of hexane:EtOAc (100:0 → 0:100,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and EtOAc:MeOH (100:0 → 0:100,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), and three fractions (Fr. A–C) were acquired. Repetitive silica gel column chromatography with hexane:EtOAc (85:15 and 80:20) solvent systems on Fr. A gave compound 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>. Fr. B was applied to a silica gel column and eluted with hexane:EtOAc (75:25) and a Sephadex LH-20 column eluting with ethyl acetate to give compounds 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>. Elution with hexane:EtOAc (70:30) of a silica gel column of Fr. C gave compound 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>. The chemical structures of compounds 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>–
