<p class="p">Aerial parts (150 g), roots (150 g), flowers (150 g) and fruits (500 g) were comminuted and macerated with methanol (3 times × 8 h) in a water-bath not exceeding 40 °C (3 × 150 mL) while mixing at 300 rpm with the use of a mechanical mixer. Conjoined aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits extracts were filtered and concentrated up to dryness using a rotating evaporator (Heidolph VV2000, Schwabach, Germany). After that the residue was dissolved in methanol:water (1:9) and subjected to three further fractionation steps with 150 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol, respectively. The weights of the comminuted parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Zosima absinthifolia</italic> and extracts/fractions obtained are indicated in
