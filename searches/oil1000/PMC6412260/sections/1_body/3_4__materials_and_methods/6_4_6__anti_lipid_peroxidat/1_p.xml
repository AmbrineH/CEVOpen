<p class="p">The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay was utilised to assess the protective activity of samples on liposomes against lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Seven different sample concentrations (0.016–1 mg/mL) were studied in this test. Chlorogenic acid, rutin and propyl gallate were prepared as reference compounds at seven different concentrations (0.000064–1 mg/mL), and chlorogenic acid and rutin were utilised in the same concentration interval. Brain extract (0.2 mL), phosphate buffer (0.5 mL), ferric chloride (0.1 mL), ascorbic acid (0.1 mL) and the samples were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes. Next, 25% HCl (0.5 mL), 1% TBA (0.5 mL) and 2% BHT (0.1 mL) were added into the mixture, which was shaken and incubated at 85 °C for 30 minutes. The mixture was cooled and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol (2.5 mL) was added. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the samples was recorded at 532 nm using the UV-1800 spectrophotometer. These tests were repeated four times. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were established through linear regression analysis. A low IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value means that the antioxidant activity is high.
