In the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations, leaf, stem, pedicel and fruit parts were attached to aluminium stubs and covered with gold for 4 min in a sputter-coater. Morphological observations were done in a Jeol JSM 6490LV scanning electron microscope at the Turkish Petroleum International Company (TPAO) Research Centre SEM laboratory, Ankara.
