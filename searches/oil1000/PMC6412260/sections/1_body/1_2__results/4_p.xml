 <xref rid="molecules-24-00722-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the TBA assay results of the specimens reported as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The highest antioxidant potential in the TBA assay was seen in the fruit CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fraction and flower essential oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 48.98 and 97.11 μg/mL, respectively). Among the isolated compounds pimpinellin and bergapten had strong antioxidant effects, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 49.23 and 56.99 μg/mL. Many of samples indicated considerable antioxidant activity on liposomes but not comparable to rutin or chlorogenic acid. The correlation coefficient between antioxidant capacity and content of total phenolics is remarkable (0.96).
