 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fraction and flower essential oil indicated considerable inhibition against BuChE (82.27 ± 1.97 and 78.65 ± 2.66%, respectively). The CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fractions of root and fruit also showed considerable inhibition against AChE (29.15 ± 2.45 and 31.46 ± 2.78%, respectively). Among the isolated compounds umbelliferone indicated strong inhibition against AChE (61.09 ± 4.46%) and pimpinellin had strong inhibition against BuChE with a 66.55 ± 2.61% value. On the other hand, none of the aqueous residues had activity against AChE, while only aerial part essential oil had no activity against this enzyme. The BuOH fraction of fruit and aqueous residue fraction of aerial parts and flowers displayed no butyrylcholinesterase inhibition activity. Amongst the essential oils the fruit (83.01%) and root (81.32%) ones indicated considerable inhibition towards BuChE.
