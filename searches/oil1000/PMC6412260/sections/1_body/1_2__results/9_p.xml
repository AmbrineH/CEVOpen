<p class="p">The determined compounds were categorized into two main classes on the basis of their chemical structures: isoprenoids (oxygenated monoterpenes, terpene hydrocarbons) and nonisoprenoids variously functionalized (alkanes, aldehydes, lactones, ketones, alcohols, furans, fatty acids and esters). Terpene hydrocarbons, esters, fatty acids-esters, and alcohols were the dominant groups of compounds in the essential oils (
