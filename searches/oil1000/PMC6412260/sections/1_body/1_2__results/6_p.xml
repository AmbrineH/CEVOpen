<p class="p">The most active compounds (umbelliferone against AChE and pimpinellin against BuChE) were docked at the binding sites of 1-EVE and 1-P0I. The molecular interactions of the compounds possibly accounting for the inhibition are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00722-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Umbelliferone exhibits a good docking score for 1-EVE (−7.46 kcal/mol) when compared to the standard donepezil. Umbelliferone has three π-π stacking interactions (4.25 Å, 3.89 Å and 4.70 Å) with PHE330 and TRP84. In addition, hydrophobic interactions were formed between the molecule and TRP84, PHE330, PHE331, TYR121, TYR334. The polar interaction was realized by HIS 440. On the other hand the docking score of pimpinellin was −5.78 kcal/mol compared to the standard donepezil. Pimpinellin has two π-π stacking interactions (5.09 Å and 5.10 Å) with the phenyl ring of PHE 329. In addition, hydrophobic interactions were formed between the molecule and the PHE329, PRO285, LEU286, VAL288, TRP231, PHE398, ALA199 residues. The polar interactions were realized by SER287, GLN119, SER198.
