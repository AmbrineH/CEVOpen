<p class="p">In general, the yield of the root oil was low compared to the aerial part, fruit and flower ones. The best yield results were obtained for fruit (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00722-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). A total of thirty-three compounds totaling 94.7% of the oil were identified in the essential oil of aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia.</italic> Octanol, octyl octanoate and octyl acetate were the primary components, amounting to 8.8%, 7.6% and 7.3%, respectively. The analysis of the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> resulted in the identification of forty-four compounds totaling 81.6% of the oil. 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-Pinocarvyl acetate at 26.7% was the most abundant compound in the essential oil, followed by Î²-pinene (8.9%). Eighty-three compounds were characterized in the oil of the flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic>, accounting for 82.5% of the oil. The primary constituents were identified as octyl acetate (19.9%), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans-p</italic>-menth-2-en-1-ol (4.6%). The analysis on the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> resulted in the determination of fifty-two essential compounds totaling 99.2%. Octyl acetate at 81.6% was the most abundant compound in the essential oil followed by (Z)-4-octenyl acetate (5.1%). The compositions of essential oils are presented in
