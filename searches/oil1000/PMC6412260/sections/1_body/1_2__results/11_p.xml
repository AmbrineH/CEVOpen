<p class="p">Secretory structures of stem, leaf, flower and fruit samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthifolia</italic> were studied in detail using light and scanning electron microscopy. The plant has secretory trichomes in the leaf, stem, pedicel and fruit. There are two types of glandular trichomes; capitate trichomes and sessile peltate trichomes. The capitate trichomes were identified on the leaf, pedicel and stem, peltate trichomes on pedicel and fruit. The capitate trichomes are composed of multi basal cells, a long stalk cell with the unicellular secretory head. Peltate trichomes exhibit a flattened head in the pedicel or a granular head in fruit formed by several cells arranged in a circle (
