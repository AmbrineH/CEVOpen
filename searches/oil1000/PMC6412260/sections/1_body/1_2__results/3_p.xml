<p class="p">The extracts, fractions and essential oils of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits were studied regarding their antioxidant capacity potential. The findings of content of total phenolics from the samples are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00722-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B. The highest level of total phenolics was seen in root and fruit (59.81 and 52.34 mg GAE g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> DW, respectively) while the least content of phenolics was seen in the aerial parts of the plant (34.07 mg GAE g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> DW). DPPH analysis results showed the presence of antioxidant activity in the range from 61.92–69.2% with the highest seen in the fruits compared to the extracts of the aerial parts of the plant (
