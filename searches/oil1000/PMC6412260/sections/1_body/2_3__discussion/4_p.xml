<p class="p">In a previous study, the major components of essential oils from different parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> were studied and it was shown that the main volatile compounds were lavandulyl acetate (23.9%, an ester of the irregular monoterpenol), bornyl acetate (12.0%), octyl octanoate (11.7%), lavandulol (5.0%), octyl hexanoate (4.2%) and lavandulyl octanoate (3.1%) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Another study reported that the major components of oil from the aerial part of Z. 
 <italic class="italic">absinthfolia</italic> were octyl acetate (32.50%), octanol (20.60%) and Î±-pinene (10.90%) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Octyl acetate (87.48%), octyl octanoate (5.03%) and 1-octanol (2.37%) were found the major components of fruit essential oil [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Octyl acetate (38.4%) and octyl hexanoate (31.9%) were detected as major components of fruit essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our study is the first comparative study on essential oils constituents of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> and their anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities.
