<p class="p">Essential oil components represent a diverse family of low molecular weight organic compounds with remarkable biological activity. In accordance with their chemical structure, these active compounds can be divided into four major groups: terpenoids, phenylpropenes, terpenes, and “others”. Besides, they might include diversified functional groups in accordance with which they can be categorised as hydrocarbons (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons); oxygenated compounds (monoterpene and sesquiterpene alcohols, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and other oxygenated compounds); and sulfur and/or nitrogen sulfur including compounds (sulfides, nitriles, thioesters, isothiocyanates, and others). Components that act as cholinesterase inhibitors still represent the only pharmacological treatment of AD. Many in vitro investigations have demonstrated that some compounds present in essential oils such as α-pinene, α- and β-asarone, δ-3-carene, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, thymohydroquinone, anethole, etc have certain cholinesterase inhibitory activity [
