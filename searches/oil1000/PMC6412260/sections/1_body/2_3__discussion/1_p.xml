<p class="p">Coumarins are compounds naturally present in a great number of plants. Coumarin and its derivatives are prevalent in Nature. Coumarins are benzopyrones, which are compounds comprised of benzene rings linked to a pyrone moiety. Human dietary exposure to benzopyrones is quite considerable, as these compounds occur in fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and higher plants. It has been determined that the mean Western diet includes ~1 g/day of mixed benzopyrones [

Coumarins have various biological activities such as anticancer, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antitubercular, antihyperglycemic, antiadipogenic, antifungal, antibacterial, anticonvulsant, antihypertensive, antiviral, antioxidant, neuroprotective and antidiabetic effects [
