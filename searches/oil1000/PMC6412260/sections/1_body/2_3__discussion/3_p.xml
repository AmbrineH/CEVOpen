<p class="p">The roots fractions have been characterized by the significant higher content of total phenolics than aerial part fractions. Previously, it was observed that methanol fruit extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> showed high antioxidant activities and a greater content of total phenols in comparison to the hexane and dichloromethane extracts of the plant [

 <italic class="italic">Z. absinthfolia</italic> plant extracts was studied. It was found that peroxidation inhibition of MeOH extract of
