<p class="p">The chemical composition of the different types of secretory canals present in the aerial parts, fruits and flowers were different. The canals present in the aerial parts are characterized by terpene hydrocarbons, while the secretory canals of roots, flowers and fruits include esters. Only canals of fruits contain lactones. Besides, canals of flowers and fruits contain alkanes. We can comment that the number of secretory channels, their location in the organs and their different shapes (broad, big, little, oval etc) could be related to the different chemical compositions of aerial part, root, flower and fruits. The chemical class distribution of the samples is presented in
