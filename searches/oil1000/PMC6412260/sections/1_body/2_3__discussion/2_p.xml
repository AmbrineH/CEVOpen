<p class="p">In the current research, umbelliferone and pimpinellin were isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Zosima absinthfolia</italic>, and indicated activity against AChE and BuChE. We assumed that the inhibitory activity of umbelliferone was primary due to the hydroxyl group at the C-7 position. Also, we assumed that the inhibitory activity of pimpinellin was primary due to the methoxy groups at the C-5 and C-6 positions. Umbelliferone and pimpinellin presented the best activity at 20 Âµg/mL, while bergapten indicated weak inhibitory activity.
