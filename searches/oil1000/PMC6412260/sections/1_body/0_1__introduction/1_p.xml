<p class="p">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the most widespread reason for dementia. The characteristical symptoms of dementia are troubles with memory, language, problem-solution and other cognitive abilities that influence a person’s ability to make daily activities. These troubles happen because nerve cells in parts of the brain involved in cognitive function have been ruined. In AD, neurons in other parts of the brain are finally damaged or destroyed as well, including those that permit a person to perform basic bodily functions such as walking and swallowing. People in the final stages of the disease are bed-bound and require around-the-clock care. AD is eventually fatal [

Drugs endowed with anticholinesterase and antioxidant capacity could thus be useful for the prevention/treatment of AD [
