<p class="p">In particular, curcumin, resveratrol, and green tea catechins have been identified to have the potential to prevent AD owing to their anti-amyloidogenic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. These polyphenolic phytochemicals also activate adaptive cellular stress responses, called ‘neurohormesis’, and supress illness processes [

A particular and important preventive action against AD with hop iso-α-acids, which are reponsible for the bitterness in beer, was discussed lately. Besides, proof has appeared for anti-carcinogenic action from hops’prenylflavonoids, as well as from phenolic components extracted from both malt and hops [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Numerous investigations were performed on the biological activities of plants which are utilised traditionally as memory enhancers and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Natural compounds of phenolic nature have shown a substantial role in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00722" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Phenolic compounds of medicinal plants and dietary plants are present as coumarins, curcuminoids, flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids, tannins, stilbenes, quinones, and others. The varied bioactivities of phenolic compounds are responsibe for their AChE inhibition capacities [
