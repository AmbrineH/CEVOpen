<p id="Par21" class="p">The total concentrations of short, medium, and long-chain fatty acids in the SS and LL muscles were similar among treatments (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>) suggesting a decline in the efficiency of the process of long-chain fatty acids absorption from the diets to muscles. These findings concur with [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] who showed that an unchanged composition of muscle fatty acids in the present study might be due to the constant stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene expression from the high content of Cu in the PKC. However, the high concentration of PUFA in the LL muscle of animals fed on 10% corn could be associated with the PUFA content of corn which is more resistant to biohydrogenation than other cereals. The muscles of such lambs normally have high percentages of PUFA, in particular linoleic acid (18:2n-6), compared to heavier lambs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. The concentrations of C14:0 were reduced in the SS muscle of 5% corn and 10% corn and this is in line with the results of [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>], while the addition of PKM raised the level of C12:0 and C14:0 in the diet as reflected in the concentration of fatty acids in the meat. Palm kernel cake has high concentrations of C16:0 and C16:1 (palmitoleic acid) and as a result the levels of C12:0 and C14:0 gradually increased in the SS muscles. Supplementing the diet of goats with palm oil blend decreased C14:0 and C16:0 concentrations in the SM muscles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. This could be attributed to the reduction in mRNA and the actions of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthesis and the acetylCoA carboxylase needed to synthesize medium-chain fatty acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. However, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] stated that the concentration of C14:0 was increased when PKM was added to the muscles of lambs. The levels of C14:0, C15:0, C15:1, and C16:0 in all the ST muscles did not vary significantly among the dietary treatments in the present experiment. These results contradict that of [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] who suggested that high SFA composition was found in the PKC. The present study did not observe any effects of PKC on the ST muscle. However, the level of C18:1trans11 and C18:2 n-6 fatty acids was elevated in the ST muscle of lambs fed the supplemented diets compared to the controls (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). This is similar to the results reported by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Compared to the present study it may be due to differences in the extent of ruminal biohydrogenation of C18:2n-6, with the lower biohydrogenation in our study being due to an acidic ruminal pH resulting from the high concentrate fed to the lambs. However, the rise in the concentrations of trans-vaccenic acid (and the other isomers of C18:1) in the plasma and the meat may be due to the high-lipid in the diet, which may have interfered with the rumen micro flora involved in the biohydrogenation of dietary C18:2 and C18:3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. This c9, t11 C18:2 is an extremely biologically-active conjugated linoleic acid isomer, which has a positive impact on the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, and protects the immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The results of this study show a significant increase in CLA c12 t10 of ST muscles within control and T2 diets. This finding agrees with Ribeiro et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] who reported that the level of this fatty acid declined with the introduction of palm kernel meal in the diet, thus allowing for a reduction in the levels of CLA in the meat. As such, it can be suggested that the reason for the higher CLA level in the ST muscle is the inclusion of corn in the PKC diet. The level of Î£PUFA n-3 decreased gradually in the 5% corn and 10% corn compared with the 0% corn. The high PUFA content, including non-essential fatty acids, namely palmitoleic (16: 1) and oleic (18: 1) acids in the mutton should make the meat more attractive to health-conscious consumers. Linolenic acid originates from dietary lipids and could enable the endogenous synthesis of long-chain PUFA by elongase and desaturase activities. This probably is the result of the decreased biohydrogenation activity in the rumen which increases PUFAs available for gut absorption and tissue deposition [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. The type of feeding regimens used in beef cattle production can impact the level of essential fats in red meat due to the differences in the fatty acid composition of the diet [
