<p id="Par16" class="p">The fatty acid profiles of the experimental diets are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. In general, there were small variations, but not significant, in the fatty acid contents of the diets with T3 having slightly higher NFE and calculated ME contents. The results of meat drip loss, cooking loss and shear force of the various muscles from lambs fed the treatment diets are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The dietary treatments did not affect (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt;</italic> 0.05) drip loss of the ST and SS muscles, although the LL from lambs fed T3 had lower (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) drip loss than the control diet. As for LL muscle drip loss, it was higher (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in lambs fed T2 (5% corn) than lambs fed the control diet. The results of cooking losses from various muscle types indicated that the ST muscle from lambs fed T3 was significantly greater (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) than from those on the other treatment diets whereas the muscles of lambs on T2 had a lower cooking loss compared to those fed the control diet (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05). Lambs fed T2 and diets showed significant (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.001) reductions in the percentage of SS muscles compared with the control. The cooking loss of the LL muscles showed no significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt;</italic> 0.05) among all the treatment groups. The dietary supplementation of corn reduced the shear force value of SS muscles in both T2 and T3 (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.001) compared to the control group. There were no significant difference in shear force values in the ST and LL muscles among the treatment groups. The inclusion of corn in the PKC-urea treated straw diets induced a significant increase (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in the pH of the ST and SS muscles of lambs fed on T2 diets and T3 diets which were lower than the control diet.. However, for the LL muscles there were no significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt;</italic> 0.05) in the pH among the treatment groups. The results of the meat color (L*, a*, and b*) evaluation is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. It appeared that meat colour was affected by corn supplementation. There was an increase (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.001) in L* in the both ST and SS muscles of lambs fed T2 while L* was reduced in the LL muscles under the same treatment. The color a* of the ST muscles was decreased (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.01) in lambs fed T2 and T3 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) while there was no significant effects of the treatments on SS and LL muscles. There was no difference in the meat color of the SS and LL muscles among the treatment groups except that the ST muscles of lambs on T3 had higher (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.01) b* values associated with the more yellowish color in the lean meat.
