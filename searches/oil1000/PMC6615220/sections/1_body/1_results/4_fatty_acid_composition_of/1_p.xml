<p id="Par19" class="p">The composition of fatty acids in the ST muscle was similar for all treatments although their levels increased slightly with the inclusion of corn in the diets (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3) differed from saturated fatty acids (SFA) (C14:0, C16:0, C18:0). The concentrations of C18:1trans11 and CLA c12 t10 content of ST muscle from the lambs fed T2 and T3 were consistently higher (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) than those fed on the control diet. The highest concentration of C18:2 n-6 was found in lambs fed T2, while the lowest were observed in the control lambs. The proportions of C22:6 n-3 and ΣPUFA n-3 declined (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) as the levels of corn increased in the diet. Lambs fed on T2 and T3 diets had similar (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt;</italic> 0.05) proportions of CLA c9 t11 as those fed the control diet. Although there were no significant (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt;</italic> 0.05) differences among the treatments in the total SFA, MUFA, n-3, and PUFA/SFA ratio in ST, the total n-6, n-6/n-3 ratio, and trans-FA were higher (
 <italic class="italic">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in lambs fed T3 diets compared to the other diets.
