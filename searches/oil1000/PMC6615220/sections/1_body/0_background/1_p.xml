<p id="Par15" class="p">The increasing use of unconventional feedstuffs for livestock especially in Malaysia requires an evaluation of their effects on the health status of the animals and consumers. Palm kernel cake (PKC) is used as a ruminant feed in Malaysia and its constant supply throughout the year and relatively lower price, makes it a reliable source of protein for dairy and meat animals as its crude protein content adequately meets their requirements [

Analysis of meat quality and fatty acid composition, among others, is important in meeting demand and promoting meat science as well as to achieve an integrated quality of research on products that are more similar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Therefore, since dietary factors are important in influencing meat characteristics, it is hypothesized that feeding lambs with PKC-urea treated rice straw diets supplemented with corn improves meat quality and affects fatty acid composition in the carcass. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of including corn as an energy source in the PKC-urea treated straw based diets for growing lambs, on the changes in fatty acid content and meat quality in the
