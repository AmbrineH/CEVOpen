<p id="Par24" class="p">At the end of the 120-day trial period, the lambs were slaughtered according to the standard protocol of the MS 1500:2004 at the Meat Science Laboratory, Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Universiti Putra Malaysia. They were fasted for 12 h with free access to drinking water, transported to the abattoir, allowed to rest, and then weighed before slaughter. The slaughter was performed by a certified and highly experienced technician with a sharp knife. The animals were slaughtered by severing the jugular vein, without being stunned, with a razor sharp knife. In this study, sustained absence of corneal reflex and rhythmic breathing were strictly monitored and checked to ensure that each individual lamb was dead prior to further processing and sampling. The carcasses were shifted to cold room and kept for 24 h at 4 °C. The pH and color of SS, LL

 <italic class="italic">,</italic> and ST muscles from the right half of each carcass were stored at − 80 °C for fatty acids analysis.
