<p id="Par25" class="p">The meat quality assessments were based on muscle color, water holding capacity, shear force, and pH for three muscles (SS, LL, and ST muscles). Samples were allowed to thaw at 4 °C overnight before analysis. Muscle slices of 1.5 to 2 cm thickness were left to bloom for 30 min at room temperature. Color measurements were documented in triplicate for each sample at randomly chosen positions and stated by the coordinates lightness index (L*), redness index (a*), and yellowness index (b*) of the CIELab colorimetric space [

 <italic class="italic">postmortem</italic> was trimmed and weighed and placed into vacuum bags before labeling, vacuum packed (98%) using a chamber Vacuum, and stored at 4 °C. After 24 h

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. The samples for cooking loss used frozen meat which was allowed to cool to room temperature. The thawed samples were each weighed and registered as first weight, kept in polyethylene bags, and inserted in a hot water bath (80 °C) until the inner temperature reached 78 °C. The cooking continued for another 15 min and the samples then removed from the water bath. They were counterweighed to room temperature and then removed from the bags, blotted dry without squeezing, and weighed again. The same muscle samples utilized to determine cooking loss were also used for assessing tenderness. Sample preparation was followed method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Three replicate blocks were cut parallel to the side of the muscle fibers from each sample and each block sheared in the center at right angles to the longitudinal orientation of the fibers. Shear force was the average peak positive force value for all individual sample blocks. The pH of the muscles was measured at 24 h post mortem according to [

The pH meter (Mettler Toledo, AG 8603, Switzerland) was calibrated with pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers before use. Each pulverized sample was homogenized for 20 s with 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline to avoid continuing glycolysis. The pH of the resultant homogenate was measured by the electrode attached to the pH meter.
