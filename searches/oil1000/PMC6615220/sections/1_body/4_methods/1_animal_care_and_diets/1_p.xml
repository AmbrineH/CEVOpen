Twenty-seven Dorper lambs (9 animals per treatment) with an average live weight of about 15 ± 0.59 kg were purchased from a local farm in Selangor and randomly assigned and tested under three treatment modes. The lambs were allocated in individual pens equipped with feeders and drinkers. They were fed a basal diet consisting of PKC and urea-treated straw. The dietary treatments were: Treatment 1 (T1) – (0% corn and 75.3% PKC) as a control diet; Treatment 2 (T2) - (5% corn and 70.3% PKC, and Treatment 3 (T3) - (10% corn and 65.3% PKC) (Table
