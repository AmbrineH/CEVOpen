 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa </italic>seeds have shown schistosomicidal properties against
 <italic class="italic"> Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>), through a strong biocidal effect against all stages of the parasite and an inhibitory effect on egg-laying of adult female worms [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. An ointment of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>seed significantly contracted and inhibited the inflammatory reactions to cutaneous leishmaniasis produced experimentally in mice by a subcutaneous inoculation of
 <italic class="italic"> Leishmania major</italic> at the abaxial base of the tail [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>].
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> extract at a dose of 1.25â€‰g/kg prominently lowered
 <italic class="italic"> Plasmodium yoelii</italic> infection in mice by 94%; however, the effect of chloroquine was only 86% as compared to the untreated group. In addition, methanolic extract of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>revealed higher parasite clearance and restoration of altered biochemical indicators by
 <italic class="italic"> P. yoelii</italic> infection than chloroquine [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Thus, considering
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>for future antiparasitic agents will have a very important input after conduction of further investigation of its curative, prophylactic and chemopreventive activity particularly in the era of emerging antimalarial drug resistance.
