<p class="p">The essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> of different origins has been reported to possess moderate inhibitory action against pathogenic strains of yeasts, dermatophytes and nondermatophytic filamentous fungi along with aflatoxin-producing fungi. The
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> treatment targeted the cell wall, plasma membrane, and membranous organelles, mainly in the nuclei and mitochondria as were evident in the morphology of these toxigenic fungi [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. Moreover, different extracts of black cumin and TQ exhibited powerful fungicidal activity against dermatophyte strains including
 <italic class="italic"> Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Microsporum gypseum</italic> superior to fluconazole, but lesser than that of ketoconazole [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. Thymoquinone also arrested the growth of
 <italic class="italic"> Aspergillus niger</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Fusarium solani</italic> comparable to Amphotericin-B [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>] and was effective against
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> C. tropicalis</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> C. krusei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. Similarly, as stated by Taha et al., the active constituent of black cumin such as TQ, thymohydroquinone, and thymol revealed potent antifungal effect against several clinically isolated fungal strains including dermatophytes, molds, and yeasts [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. As a potential candidate with multiple antimicrobial activities,
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> can also be explored as a natural preservative and food additive to protect foods from spoilage.
