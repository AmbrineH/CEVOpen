The administration of black cumin seed for one month to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats displayed a significant reduction of fasting plasma glucose, serum MDA, interleukin-6, and immunoglobulin A, G, and M while substantial increment of endogenous antioxidant enzymes; SOD, Glutathione-S-transferase, and catalase expression were noticed. The histology of pancreas in
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> treated group also revealed an improvement in the pancreatic 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-cells degeneration, inflammation, and congestion as compared to diabetic control [

 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Cinnamomum cassia</italic> extracts (NSCCe) to experimentally STZ-induced diabetic rats also showed significantly stabilized serum glucose concentrations, lipid profile, and renal function parameters as compared to the diabetic control. Significant effects were observed in animals that received combined extract and metformin on these parameters. A substantial reversal of the histopathological pancreatic cell injury was also observed in animals receiving the concomitant extracts of NSCCe [

 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>(2 g/day) along with oral antidiabetic agent in type 2 DM patients has also been reported. In this study,
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>received group showed significant reduction of fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and TBARBs, while marked elevation of the total antioxidant capacity, SOD, and glutathione levels were noted [
