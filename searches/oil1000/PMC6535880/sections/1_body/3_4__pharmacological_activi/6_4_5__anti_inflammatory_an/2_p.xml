<p class="p">In addition, the action of black cumin seed on tracheal sensitivity and pulmonary inflammation of guinea pigs, which were exposed to breathe Sulphur mustard together with black cumin, displayed expressively lower magnitude compared to that of only Sulphur mustard exposed group [

 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> in contrast with theophylline were assessed in asthmatic patients and it was found that black cumin extract caused substantial rises in entirely measured respiratory function tests and the starting time of bronchodilator action of the extract was comparable to that of theophylline [
