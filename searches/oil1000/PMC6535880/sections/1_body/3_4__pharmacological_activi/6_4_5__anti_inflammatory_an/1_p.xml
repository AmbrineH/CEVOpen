<p class="p">Inflammation has a key role in various medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, allergies, and cancer which all are associated with acute and/or chronic pain. The existing anti-inflammatory agents commonly comprise classes of drugs that produce severe adverse effects such as gastric ulcer, bone marrow depression, water, and salt retention, resulting from the extended use [

The volatile oil of black cumin and thymoquinone at various doses revealed a dose-reliant anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats' parallel to indomethacin [

As stated by Al-Ghamdi, the water extract of black cumin also retained anti-inflammatory effects in carrageenan-induced paw edema comparable to acetyl salicylic acid at corresponding doses but failed to display antipyretic activity against yeast-induced pyrexia [

Additional study also showed that essential oil of black cumin has notable activity as a painkiller in acetic acid-induced writing, formalin, and tail flick tests. It was also revealed that this extract might elevate a significant swimming and anoxia tolerance time [
