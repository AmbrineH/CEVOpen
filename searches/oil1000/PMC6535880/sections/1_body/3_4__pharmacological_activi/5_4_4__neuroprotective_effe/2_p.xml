<p class="p">The intragastric supplementation of TQ (20 mg/mL) in aluminum trichloride and D-galactose induced neurotoxicity in rats showed a meaningful improvement of cognition, SOD, and total antioxidant capacity while reducing acetylcholinesterase activities. It also exhibited a reduction in MDA, nitric oxide levels, and tumor necrosis factor-
