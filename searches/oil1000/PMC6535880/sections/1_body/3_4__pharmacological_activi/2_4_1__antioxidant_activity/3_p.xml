<p class="p">The separate administration of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> and nanosized clinoptilolite to Wistar rats also showed significant improvement on antioxidant parameters than concomitant uses of both extracts and diabetic groups [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. A randomized controlled clinical trial in fifty volunteer obese subjects also demonstrated that
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> seed oil along with a less caloric diet significantly diminished the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and body weight as compared to the placebo group in eight weeks' trial [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, the methanolic extract and essential oil fractioned from
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> seed in atherogenic suspension nourished rats has been reported effectively replenished the plasma total antioxidant power by eighty-eight percent against free radicals [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Similarly, the oil of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa </italic>and thymoquinone administration markedly ameliorated cisplatin-induced alteration on carbohydrate biotransformation and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense system in the gastric mucosa [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Hence, the marked antioxidant activity of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> and thymoquinone might be a potential newer antioxidant agent and used as essential nutrients for life for health promotion and diseases prevention.
