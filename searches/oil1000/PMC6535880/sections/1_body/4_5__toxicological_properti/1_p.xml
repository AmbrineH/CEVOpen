<p class="p">The acute oral toxicity of active constituents of black cumin seed, TQ, lethal dose 50 (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) value has been reported to be 2.4 g per kg of body weight of Swiss albino mice, whereas the instant behavioral alteration at two and three g per kg of body weight of the composite was hypoactivity and trouble in breathing, while late toxicities comprising a substantial lessening in the virtual organ weight and glutathione distribution of the hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular system have been reported [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. Daily administration of aqueous extract (AqE) of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> to mice for six weeks led to death of one mouse after 2 weeks of treatment with 6.4 g/kg of AqE. On the other hand, 2 and 3 mice experienced death at 3rd and 5th weeks while they received 21 g/kg and 60 g/kg of the extract, respectively. Otherwise, no other deaths were recorded for the application of other doses used [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. In addition, the subchronic toxicity study in mice treated with 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg/day of TQ for 90 days resulted in no mortality or signs of toxicity but substantial decrement of fasting plasma glucose and also showed no change in toxicological significance in body organs and histological investigation [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. The toxicity of the fixed oil of black cumin in mice and rats was also examined and the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were found to be 28.8 ml/kg and 2.06 ml/kg when given by oral and intraperitoneal routes, respectively. Chronic toxicity was also studied in rats treated daily with an oral dose of 2 ml/kg for 12 weeks' black cumin oil, while alterations in vital liver enzyme levels and histopathological modifications (heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas) were not detected [
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. The minor and/or negligible toxicological effects and wider therapeutic margin of
 <italic class="italic"> N. sativa</italic> and its active constituents, thymoquinone, as evident by various scientific studies support its safe use for the long-term traditional food and medicinal purposes.
