<p class="p">Phytosterols are important part of human diet and are gaining greater interest due to their nutraceutical and medicinal benefits in lowering low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol level [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Phytosterols are also important as characteristic compounds for assessing the quality of vegetable oils and food labeling. The total sterols content of black cumin seed oil as estimated by different researchers was found to be between 18 and 42% of the unsaponified matter. The major sterols identified were 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and 5-avenasterol [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Tocopherols exhibited attractive scavenging potentials of free radicals which are believed to terminate lipids peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The total tocopherol contents of black seed oil reported in varied quantities from diverse sources ranged from 9.15 to 27.92 mg/100 g. Among the foremost tocopherols recognized in black cumin seeds, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-tocopherol and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-tocotrienol are well recognized [
