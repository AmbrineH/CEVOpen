 <italic class="italic">Understanding behavioral responses to alarm substance in fishes is significant because they represent a first step in understanding the neural and physiological mechanisms that mediate fear and anxiety in humans</italic>. The method we present in this manuscript allows for the development of a sustainable source of alarm substance for use in chemical characterization and bioassays without killing the research model. Our method for collecting epithelial cells is inexpensive, non-invasive, and allows for fast recovery of the experimental model. Additionally, cells can be collected from the same fish multiple times. We also demonstrate that our source of alarm substance significantly increases darting behavior in wild caught Creek Chub minnows (
