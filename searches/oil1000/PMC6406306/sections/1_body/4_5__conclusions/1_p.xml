<p class="p">The results of the present study suggest that the addition of increasing amounts of stevioside to the diet of goats increased DMI, and NDF and ADF digestibility. This study showed that dietary stevioside supplementation may promote higher feed intake of goats, which indicate a potential application of stevioside as a bio-sweetener in ruminant diets. Further studies are needed to investigate the influences of diet supplementation with stevioside on the performance of goats.</p>
