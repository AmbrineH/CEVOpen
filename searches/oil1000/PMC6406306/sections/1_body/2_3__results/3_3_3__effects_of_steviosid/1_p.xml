<p class="p">Apparent total tract digestibility of DM, OM, and CP were not affected (

 <xref rid="animals-09-00032-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). However, apparent digestibility of NDF and ADF quadratically increased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02 and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01), where NDF and ADF digestibilities increased from 0 to 400 mg/kg stevioside and then decreased from 400 to 800 mg/kg stevioside.
