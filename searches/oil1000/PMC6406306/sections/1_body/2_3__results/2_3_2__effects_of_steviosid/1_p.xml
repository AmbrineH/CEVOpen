<p class="p">The results showed that pH increased quadratically (

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N was not different among groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, total VFA concentration quadratically decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as stevioside concentration increased. The proportions of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate did not differ among stevioside levels (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). As a result, the acetate:propionate ratio was not affected (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) by the addition of stevioside. There was a quadratic response of stevioside on proportions of isobutyrate (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and isovalerate (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02).
