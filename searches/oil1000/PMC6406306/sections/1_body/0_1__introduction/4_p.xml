<p class="p">Studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of stevioside in the diets of non-ruminants including pigs [

 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Those studies mostly observed that inclusion of stevioside increases the feed intake of animals. In ruminants, there was only a study involving stevioside in which the effects of a formulated additive containing 50% of protected fat, 25% of yeast culture, 5% of choline, 7% of organic zinc, 6.5% of cinnamon, and 6.5% of stevioside (as an essential oil) on rumen and rectal temperature in Hanwoo steers were investigated [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is no information on the use of stevioside as a sweetener in ruminant diets. Herein, we hypothesized that stevioside could increase feed intake in ruminants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary stevioside inclusion in goats on feed intake and feeding behavior. Additionally, we investigated the possible effects of dietary inclusion of stevioside on rumen fermentation, digestibility, and blood serum metabolites of goats.
