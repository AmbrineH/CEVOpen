<p class="p">Feed intake directly affects the performance of domestic animals. Palatability of feed plays an important role in feed intake regulation, and the palatability of a feed can be defined as all the physical (appearance, texture, etc) and chemical (taste, smell, etc) characteristics of the feed that act on appetite [

 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] are added to the ruminant diets to improve the taste and smell, especially when feed is unpalatable. Taste of feed is one of the important factors that can influence palatability and feed consumption by animals. Taste is associated with chemical components that can be perceived by the mouth, nose, and brain of animals. Sweetener as a taste modifier is used to affect taste of feed to enhance the palatability. Sweet flavors are associated with natural and artificial sweetening agents. Some studies have reported that natural or artificial sweetener can increase feed intake and average daily gain when they are supplemented to ruminantsâ€™ diets [
