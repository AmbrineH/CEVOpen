<p class="p">The current study evaluated the effects of stevioside supplementation on intake, apparent digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood metabolite parameters. Although stevioside treatments did not affect mastication behavior, they increased total dry matter and forage intakes of goats. We speculated that stevioside could increase the palatability of rice straw by increasing the sweetness, and then promote goat eating more rice straw, which ultimately resulted in increased dietary intake. Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] reported that a feed additive containing 6.5% stevioside, which was used as an essential oil there, supplemented at a rate of 0.1% of diet, did not influence feed intake of steers. According to the additive formulation and steer feed intakes in the study of Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the supplementation amount of stevioside was calculated as about 65 mg/kg diet; however, the supplementation concentrations of stevioside are about 270 and 541 mg/kg diet in the current study. Because stevioside was only one component of the steer feed additive [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and its adding concentration was also far below those in our study, there is little comparability between this study and that of Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] in terms of the effects of stevioside on feed intake.
