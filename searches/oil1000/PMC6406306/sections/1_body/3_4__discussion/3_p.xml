<p class="p">In the present study, total tract apparent digestibilities of NDF and ADF were increased quadratically with the inclusion of stevioside. The inclusion of stevioside in the diets of goats caused a significant increase in forage and diet intakes, which means that the intakes of NDF and ADF would also increase accordingly. As forage intake increases, feed passage rate through the gastrointestinal tract would be faster and fiber digestibility usually decreases [
