<p class="p">The current study showed that dietary stevioside had an impact on ruminal pH, total VFA concentration, and isobutyrate and isovalerate proportions. Total VFA concentration responded quadratically, decreasing from 0 to 400 mg/kg stevioside inclusion and increasing thereafter. Corresponding to changes in total VFA concentration, ruminal pH responded quadratically, increasing from 0 to 400 mg/kg stevioside and then decreasing. Though the differences in ruminal pH between groups were statistically significant, the change in ruminal pH value between treatments was small (only 0.08) and the pH values of these three groups were within the normal range, which implies rumen fermentation function is normal. The inclusion of stevioside caused a quadratic response in total VFA concentration, and the proportions of isobutyrate and isovalerate, however had no effect on the proportions of acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate, and acetate:propionate ratio. Although the proportions of predominant VFA forms (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) did not differ across treatments, total VFA concentration responded to dietary stevioside inclusion, which possibly indicates stevioside had an effect, for example by affecting the yield of acid, on rumen fermentation in goats. Besides a sweetening property, there are several physiological effects of stevia and its extracts, including antimicrobial property [

 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which implies stevioside might influence the microbial population of the gastrointestinal tract of animals. However, under the supplementation levels of about 270 and 541 mg/kg diet in the current study, whether stevioside could affect ruminal fermentation by influencing rumen micro-organisms is unclear. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to explore the effects of stevioside on gastrointestinal microbes and fermentation in ruminants.
