<p class="p">The concentrate was given to each animal twice daily at 0830 and 1830 h. The amounts of concentrate for individual goats per feeding were 0.5% of their BW. Body weight was determined at the beginning and the end of each experimental period before feeding. The amounts of concentrate for individual goats were adjusted according to their BW at the beginning of each period. This concentrate at each feeding was always completely eaten by each goat during the entire experiment. The forage was rice straw chopped into approximately 5-cm pieces. The chopped rice straw was provided to goats twice (0800 and 1800 h) per day. The stevioside, which is the white powder extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Stevia rebaudiana</italic> leaves, was provided by Runde Biotechnology CO., LTD. (Qingdao, China). Samples of stevioside were analyzed in the beginning of the trial to determine the purity (97%) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Stevioside was dissolved in 125 mL of water and the water solution was then thoroughly mixed with 250 g chopped rice straw by hand before each feeding of rice straw. Chopped rice straws were fed for ad libitum intake to permit at least 10% refusals, and forage refusals from each goat were removed before the next feeding of chopped rice straw.
