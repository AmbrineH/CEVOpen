<p class="p">Nine male Xiangdong Black goats with an approximate age of 12 mo and 21.8 Â± 1.5 kg initial body weight (BW) were used in the study. In the production of Xiangdong Black goats, non-sire or non-breeding rams are fattened after castration. Referring to production practice of Xiangdong Black goats, all goats were castrated surgically before the trial and then allowed to recover for four weeks. Animals were penned individually in stainless metabolic cages, each cage with a concentrate and a forage trough. Cages were designed for separate collection of feces and urine. Animals had free access to fresh water throughout the entire experiment.</p>
