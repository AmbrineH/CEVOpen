Samples were ashed at 550 °C for 12 h in a muffle furnace, and organic matter (OM) content was determined as the difference between 100 and the percentage of ash. Ether extract (EE) were analyzed in a Soxhlet extractor (SOX416 Soxtherm, C. Gerhardt GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Königswinter, Germany) according to the instrumental manual. Crude protein (CP = N × 6.25) was determined by a Kjeldahl analysis. The concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were sequentially determined using a Fibretherm FT 12 Fiber Analyzer (C. Gerhardt GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Königswinter, Germany) according to the methodology supplied by the company, which is based on the methods described by Van Soest et al. [
