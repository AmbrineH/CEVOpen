<p class="p">On day 18, after the six-day feces sample collection, feeding behavior were recorded over a 24 h period [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The feeding behavior was evaluated by visual inspection of each animal performed by six trained examiners divided in pairs, who took turns at each 3 h shift. Nighttime observations were conducted using artificial lighting. The recorded activities were eating, ruminating, and resting. Time devoted to eating or rumination by the each animal is estimated by adding all “eating minutes” or “ruminating minutes”. Total time spent mastication was calculated as the sum of total time spent eating and ruminating.
