<p class="p">Chopped rice straw and concentrates were sampled for each period to determine DM concentration. Amounts of feed offered and refused by an individual animal at each feeding were recorded throughout the whole period. The forage refusals of each animal per feeding were sampled immediately after they were collected and weighed then dried at 65 Â°C for 48 h. The dried samples of forage refusals were stored for generating composite samples per animal in each period. Then, these composite samples were ground to pass a 1-mm sieve with a mill (FW-100, Yongguangming Ltd., Beijing, China) for subsequent DM analysis. Contents of DM of the samples were used to calculate daily intake of individual goats.</p>
