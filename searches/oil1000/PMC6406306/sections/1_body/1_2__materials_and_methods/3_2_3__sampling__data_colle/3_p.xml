<p class="p">From days 12 to 17, feces from all goats were collected daily in stainless steel containers with stainless steel gauze to determine total tract apparent digestibility of dietary nutrients. Total fecal output was mixed and weighed daily. A representative sample (10%) was taken and stored at −20 °C. The fecal samples were subsequently thawed, dried in an oven at 65 °C, and composited per animal and experimental period, and then ground through a 1-mm screen with a mill (FW-100, Yongguangming Ltd., Beijing, China) for chemical composition analyses. Apparent total tract digestibility was calculated by subtracting fecal output from intake, divided by intake of nutrients.</p>
