<p class="p">On days 19 and 20, rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 2.5, and 6 h after morning feeding via the mouth of goat using a plastic pipe and approximately 10 mL of ruminal fluid was extracted and discarded [

 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The first 10-mL sample was discarded to eliminate saliva contamination that would falsely elevate the pH level. Then, at least 50 mL of ruminal fluid was collected and placed into 50-mL propylene conical tubes (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The rumen fluid was first strained through four layers of cheesecloth and then used for analyses of pH and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations. The pH of filtered ruminal fluid was measured immediately after sampling by using a pH meter (FE20 FiveEasy Benchtop pH Meter, Mettler-Toledo, LLC, OH, USA), which was calibrated before each sampling time using standard buffers (pH 4.0 and 7.0). Samples of rumen fluid were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000×
