<p class="p">Our results show an increase in certain compounds due to the extraction method (by vacuum distillation) that led to an increase in biological activity; therefore, this method provides a useful alternative to obtaining fractions of essential oils. The biological activity is correlated with the amount of MO and SeH present. These compounds, even in low amounts, could work in synergy, and maintain biological activity.</p>
