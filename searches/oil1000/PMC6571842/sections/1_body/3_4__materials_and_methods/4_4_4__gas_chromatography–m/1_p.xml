<p class="p">The analysis of the Ooil, its fractions (F1–F4) and Unoil, was performed under the following conditions: GC–MS (6890/5973N), Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA). GC was conducted on a HP-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column. The GC conditions were as follows: injection temperature 250 °C; the oven temperature was controlled at 70 °C for 1 min with the heating rate from 10 °C/min to 200 °C for 2 min, and finally from 10°C/min to 300 °C for 5 min. Helium gas was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min, sample size at 1 μL. The parameters for MS analysis 5973N were with EI ion source, electron energy 70 eV, the temperature of quadrupoles 150 °C, temperature of interface 230 °C, m/z = 30–400 amu. Identification of compounds was carried out by comparing their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7 n.L library, considering a quality match &gt;85%. Additionally, the identification was carried out using the index of Kovats (IK) obtained and compared with the values published in literature (
