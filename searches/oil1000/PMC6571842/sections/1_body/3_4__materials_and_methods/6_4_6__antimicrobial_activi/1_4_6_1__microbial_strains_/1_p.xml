<p class="p">Three bacterial strains, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhi</italic> (ATCC 19430), 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 7644), were used in the study and kindly provided by the Laboratory of Sanitary Microbiology, FCB, UANL. The bacterial strains were stored at −80 °C in brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) with 20% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glycerol. The fungal species Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (provided by Tecnologico de Monterrey) was stored under the same conditions but in potato dextrose broth (PDB; Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) instead of BHI. Fresh cultures of microorganisms were subcultured in Mueller Hinton broth or agar (MHB and MHA; Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA). 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was cultivated on trypticase soy broth or agar (TSB, TSA; Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD, USA) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> on PDB or potato dextrose agar (PDA). Briefly, an aliquot (50 μL) was taken from a frozen culture and was added to a tube containing 5 mL of MHB, TSB or PDB, depending of each strain, and were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h (30 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>); After incubation, an aliquot (10 μL) of these fresh cultures was used for further assays.
