<p class="p">A preliminary antimicrobial activity of the Ooil, its fractions (F1–F4) and Unoil, was assessed against four pathogens, using the disk diffusion technique [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. An aliquot (100 μL) of fresh culture suspension (adjusted to 0.5 McFarland ≈ 108) was distributed homogeneously on MHA, TSB, or PDA plates. Filter paper disks (Whatman No. 1) of 6 mm in diameter were separately impregnated with 10 μL of each oregano oil fraction and placed on the agar surface. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial activity was determined by the absence of bacterial growth in the area surrounding the disk. The diameter of the inhibition zones was measured with a caliper. The tests for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> carried out in the same way mentioned above, but TSA and PDA were used respectively instead of MHA; 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was incubated at 30 °C. Duplicate analyses were performed at least three times. Disks impregnated with sterile distilled water and/or DMSO served as negative controls while Ooil (whole oil) served as positive control.
