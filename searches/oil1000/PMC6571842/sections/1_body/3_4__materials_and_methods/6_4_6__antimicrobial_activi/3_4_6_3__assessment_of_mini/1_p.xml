The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (30 °C for L. monocytogenes). After that, bacterial survival was determined by dropping 20 µl of each culture onto agar plates and incubated as described above. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of oregano fraction oil that showed no bacterial growth on agar plates. Analyses were conducted by triplicate at least three times. Controls and blank samples were incubated under the same conditions. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 2%
