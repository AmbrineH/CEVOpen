<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of the oils was measured using the ABTS radical and DPPH radical. Trolox (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E, showing a potent antioxidant activity, was used as a standard reference (positive control). The ABTS radical scavenging assay was determined following the method according to Torres-Alvarez [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], with some modifications, the blue-green ABTS radical cation chromophore (ABTS·+) was prepared by reacting ABTS stock solution (7 mmol) with potassium persulphate (2.45 mmol) and allowing the mixture to stand at room temperature in the dark for 16 h. The solution was diluted with ethanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02 at 734 nm in a Genesys 5 (spectronic) spectrophotometer. The DPPH radical scavenging assay was conducted according to Torres-Alvarez [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The DPPH solution was prepared with 3.9 mg of radical and 100 mL of ethanol, and the solution was measured to 517 nm in a spectrophotometer to obtain an absorbance of 1.000 ± 0.05. Aliquots of 10–300 μL of solution of each oil with ethanol were mixed with 2.7 mL of ABTS·+ solution. The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 7 min in dark conditions. The absorbance was recorded using a spectrophotometer at 734 nm. For the DPPH assay, different concentrations (200–600 μL) of each oil were added separately to 2.25-mL DPPH solution. The mixture was shaken and left at room temperature for 240 min in the dark. Thereafter, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm in a spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was calculated as a percentage of inhibition according to the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">%Inhibition = {[Ab − As/Ab] × 100},
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>where Ab represents the absorbance of the control (without test oil), and As represents the absorbance of the test oil. A calibration curve was determined for the Trolox standard for each radical (ABTS and DPPH) at concentrations in the range of 10–160 μmol. Triplicate analyses of each oil were made. The antioxidant activity values were expressed as mmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/mL of the evaluated oil. In addition, the antioxidant activity expressed as half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (mg/mL) was defined as the amount of antioxidant necessary to decrease the initial ABTS and DPPH concentration by 50% [
