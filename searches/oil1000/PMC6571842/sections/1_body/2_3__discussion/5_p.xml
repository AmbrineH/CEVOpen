<p class="p">Borgarello et al. (2015) obtained similar results when studying different conditions by molecular distillation, obtaining fractions and distillates, finding that the fractions showed an increase in the antioxidant activity while the distillates showed a decrease in this property, perhaps due to the presence of minor oxygenated compounds in synergy or antagonism [

For that reason, increasing the concentration of a particular molecule with high antioxidant potential in a fraction obtained from the essential oil should increase the antioxidant power in that fraction, compared with the antioxidant activity of the essential oil.
