<p class="p">α-thujene, α-pinene, myrcene, α-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, β-phellandrene, limonene, and γ-terpinene were found in greater proportion in F1 and F2, this means that are considered more volatile. This coincides with the report by Borgarello et al. and Olmedo et al. [
