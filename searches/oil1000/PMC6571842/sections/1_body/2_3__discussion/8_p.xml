<p class="p">Our results show a good antimicrobial activity (inhibition diameter between 1.0 and 2.4 cm), comparable, or better, than those obtained by other authors who indicated a moderate to good antibacterial activity of the oregano extract. It should be noted that our results are also comparable to those reported for gentamicin (1.8 to 2.2 cm) used as a standard antibacterial agent [
