<p class="p">F3, F4, Ooil, and Unoil worked as inhibitors against all the bacteria analyzed and all of them contain MO and SeH compounds. Within the mechanisms of action of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, it has been reported that the hydrophobicity of the molecules or even the position of the hydroxyl groups have an important role in the penetration through the membrane. F4 and Unoil contain major quantities of carvacrol and thymol; these two compounds have a prominent disintegrating effect on the outer membrane; this could explain the major antimicrobial activity exerted by these two fractions. Even though the Gram-positive bacteria generally are more sensitive than Gram-negative, the mechanism of action against them differ due to the different structures of the cell walls and the response could vary. Previous studies have demonstrated that some essential oils such as rosemary and oregano are active against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (Gram-negative) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> (Gram-positive) but less effective for 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. (Gram-negative) Additionally, it has been proven that different strains of the same bacteria can behave differently when exposed to the same essential oil or their components [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. There is some conflict between the results of some investigations. In some cases the antimicrobial activity of a single compound has been demonstrated (e.g., 
 <monospace class="monospace">γ-</monospace>terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], while other studies have concluded that there is no such activity [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Compounds such as carvacrol and thymol have been widely studied. MICs have been reported for: 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> (312,375 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (150,250 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (200,200 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (256,390 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], respectively. According to the results obtained in this study, and compared with those reported in the literature, Unoil and F4 continue to show greater antimicrobial activity in almost all cases. Even Ooil showed greater antimicrobial activity for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> compared with the individual compounds reported in the literature. This agrees with previous studies where it has been shown that individual compounds, in some cases, have little antimicrobial activity. Such is the case of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpinene, which have little antimicrobial activity when tested individually, but are capable of potentiating the effect of compounds such as carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In addition, there is a synergy between carvacrol and thymol, which show better activity when they are together [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that α-humulene has a good antimicrobial activity with MIC’s reported of 3.90 and 2.6 μg/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> respectively [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]; Unoil and F4 have greater amount of α-humulene than Ooil, which could explain the major antimicrobial activity of these two fractions compared to the others, where neither α-humulene, nor carvacrol and thymol. Although hypotheses of the action mechanisms of essential oils have been described, more research is needed to fully clarify the mode of action of the antimicrobial activity [
