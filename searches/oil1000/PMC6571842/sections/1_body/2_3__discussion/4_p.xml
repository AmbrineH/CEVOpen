<p class="p">On the other hand, the MO compounds (thymol and carvacrol), and SeH (
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene and α-humulene) were not detected in F1 and F2, while they were present in a larger proportion in F4 and Unoil, and in smaller concentration, in Ooil. According to the principal component analysis, these last components are correlated with the biological activity. In addition, it was found that Unoil and F4 had greater biological activity than Ooil in most cases due to the larger concentration of these last compounds and the smaller amounts of other volatile compounds, indicating a possible synergy between the remaining constituents of these fractions [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. F1 and F2 contained no SeH nor MO, which clearly are responsible for the biological activity; therefore, these two fractions had low or no activity. Other studies have confirmed that these compounds confer biological properties [
