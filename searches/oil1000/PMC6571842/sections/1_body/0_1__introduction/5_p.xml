<p class="p">Considering the demand for oregano oil in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, the focus of this work is the fractionation of oregano essential oil by fractional vacuum distillation at low pressure. The process will facilitate the physicochemical characterization and evaluation of the biological activity of each of the fractions obtained at different times. By means of the multivariate analysis of main components, the correlations of the different chemical compounds are established with the corresponding antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and these, in turn, with each of the fractions obtained.</p>
