 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01904-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the diagram of the fractions in a single factorial plane, where the coordinates agree with the graph of main components. In this way it can be observed that F4 and Unoil contain the compounds which can be attributed to the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, unlike the F1 and F2 fractions, that clearly are characterized as containing the volatile compounds. F3 stands out because it contains aromatic compounds, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, although the latter are smaller than F4 and Unoil. Given the location of the Ooil, in the center of all the fractions, this should be considered with a chemical composition and biological activities lower than the corresponding fractions derived from it.
