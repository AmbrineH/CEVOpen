<p class="p">After determining the components and biological activity of each oil, an analysis of main components was performed. The components used in this work, according to the extraction method of the analysis of main components, were component 1 and component 2. These two components account for 91% of the variation in the multivariate analysis (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01904-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the variation provided by the measured parameters can be explained with two groups: Group 1, that mainly groups together non-volatile compounds which strongly correlate with the determined biological activities; and Group 2, that groups volatile organic compounds which do not have a correlation with the biological activities evaluated in this work. In addition, as can be observed, the variables MO1 and MH8 have a strong correlation with the group of volatile organic compounds.
