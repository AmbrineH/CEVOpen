<p class="p">The diagram of the process of obtaining oregano essential oil (Ooil) through the steam entrainment method and the oil fractions through a fractional distillation system is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01904-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The first fraction started to distill at a temperature of 82 °C and the last fraction distilling at 140 °C, finally undistilled oil was obtained. At the end of the process, five fractions named Fraction 1 (F1), Fraction 2 (F2), Fraction 3 (F3), Fraction 4 (F4), and undistilled oil (Unoil) were obtained.
