<p class="p">The results of the evaluation of MIC are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. In these results, the same pattern was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, with Unoil and F4 showing the best antimicrobial activity. On the other hand, when tested against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, F3 and F4, showed less activity compared with Unoil and Ooil. In this particular case, it is important to consider the decrease of carvacrol in both fractions (F3, F4) compared to Unoil because it is the main component to which the antimicrobial activity is attributed. On the other hand, despite the Ooil containing lower amount of carvacrol than F4 it contains a great variety of components that can act synergistically [

These results varied respect to the disk diffusion assay, perhaps because the size of the inhibition zone can be influenced by chemical composition of the essential oil, rate of diffusion into the agar, and volatility which may have affected the MIC [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In addition, antimicrobial activity is not attributable to one specific mechanism, therefore could vary from one species to another, due to the physiological differences between them [
