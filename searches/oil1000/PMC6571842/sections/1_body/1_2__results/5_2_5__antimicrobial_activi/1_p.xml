<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity was evaluated through preliminary assays of disk diffusion test and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assessment. The antimicrobial activity was tested against pathogens of both food and clinical importance. Representative groups of Gram-positive bacteria (

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), Gram-negative (
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhi</italic>) and a fungal species (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. These results demonstrate antimicrobial activity for the Fractions 3, 4, and Unoil, with inhibition zones ranging from 1–4.5 cm. There was no significant difference between the activity presented by the F3 fraction and control (Ooil), while F1 and F2, did not show any antimicrobial activity. On the other hand, the Unoil and F4 showed the best activity in all cases compared with control (Ooil). This can be attributed to the presence of non-volatile compounds (MO2, MO3, SeH1, SeH2) that are found in greater quantities in Unoil and F4 compared with fractions 1 and 2, in which those compounds are absent and instead possess volatile compounds (MH). Previous studies have demonstrated that volatile compounds (MH) are unstable and when such compounds are removed, others of more interest, industrially or biologically, are enriched [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies recognize that carvacrol and γ-terpinene are responsible in considerable degree for the antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Both compounds are present in F3, while γ-terpinene is nearly twice as abundant as in Ooil (
