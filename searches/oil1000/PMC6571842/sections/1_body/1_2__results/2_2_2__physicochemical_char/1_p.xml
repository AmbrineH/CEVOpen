<p class="p">To determine differences in the physicochemical characteristics of each oil, analyses of brix degree, color, specific gravity and refractive index were performed. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the physicochemical characteristics of the Ooil, its fractions, and Unoil. Apart from the color, there are no great differences between the fractions, Unoil, and Ooil.
