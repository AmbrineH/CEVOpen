<p class="p">Each of the fractions obtained from the fractional distillation under vacuum were analyzed by GC-MS. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the profile of organic compounds found in the fractions analyzed, these are classified as monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH), monoterpenes oxygenated (MO) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (SeH). As shown, there is a clear difference in the type and quantities of the organic compounds present among the fractions, Unoil and Ooil. The amount of MO, SeH and MH varied between the fractions in ranges of 1.51–68.08, 3.31–25.12, and 1.91–97.75%, respectively.
