<p class="p">The compounds identified in the oregano essential oil are in a volatility range of 100–325 ° C and are classified as semivolatiles. The presence or absence of these compounds in the fractions is determined by the time and temperature range of the process according to the scheme of

It is worth noting the absence of oxidized compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, which indicates a self-protection of the oil to oxidation [
