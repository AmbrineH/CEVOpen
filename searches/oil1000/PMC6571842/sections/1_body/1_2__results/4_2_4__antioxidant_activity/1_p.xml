<p class="p">Several studies have analyzed the antioxidant activity of these compounds by various methods, such as 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), the oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC), etc. [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The results may depend on the method used, and for that reason it is important to use at least two methods. The antioxidant activity values obtained for F1–F4, Unoil and Ooil were evaluated by the methods of ABTS radical and DPPH radical. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The values are expressed as [μmol TE/g evaluated oil (EO)]. The values obtained by the ABTS method ranged from 10.76–177,016.33 μmol TE/g EO, while the DPPH method showed values between 2.91 and 22,129.54 μmol TE/g EO. The F4 fraction showed the highest concentration of equivalent Trolox, with 177,016.31 μmol TE/g EO in ABTS followed by Unoil and Ooil (150,310.58 and 61,500.67 μmol TE/g EO respectively). In contrast, using the DPPH method, Unoil showed the best activity with 22,129.52 μmol TE/g EO, followed by F4 and Ooil (6025.03 and 4177.52 μmol TE/g EO, respectively). F3 showed considerable less activity using ABTS, compared with DPPH, with 26,002.33 and 161.83 μmol TE/g EO, respectively. Finally, F1 and F2 showed the lowest activity for the two methods evaluated.
