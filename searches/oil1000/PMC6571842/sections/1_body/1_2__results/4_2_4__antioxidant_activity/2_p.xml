<p class="p">The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01904-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, where F3, F4 and Unoil did not show significant differences to inhibit 50% of ABTS and DPPH radicals compared with Ooil. F1 and F2 showed significant differences for DPPH (114,507 mg/mL and 103,563 mg/mL) and ABTS (106,621 mg/mL and 160,796 mg/mL). These two fractions showed the least inhibition potential.
