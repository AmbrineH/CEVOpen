Previous studies have demonstrated that the components that promise more biological activity benefits are thymol and carvacrol. According to the chemical profile, these two compounds are present in larger percentages (4 to 5 times) in the F4 and Unoil fractions, compared with Ooil, while they are absent in F1 and F2. In the case of F3, thymol is absent but carvacrol is present. This fraction (F3) presented low antioxidant activity compared with F4 and Unoil, but better than F1 and F2. These results can be attributed to the fact that antioxidant activity is correlated with the type and amount of compounds presented. Despite the lack of thymol and low amount of carvacrol in F3, its biological activity could be enhanced by synergistic effect with the other compounds present [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Other studies have established that the essential oregano oil has good antioxidant activity using DPPH and ABTS. The components mainly responsible for this activity are carvacrol and thymol (both oxygenated monoterpenes), attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds. It is important to consider that the potential antioxidant activity of oregano oil may also be due to a possible synergy between other oil compounds [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. F4 and Unoil showed greater antioxidant activity than F1, F2, F3, and even oregano essential oil. This greater activity could be explained, in part, by the chemical profile of F4 and Unoil, which have a higher content of compounds such as carvacrol and thymol, the latter compound even by as much as 50% as compared with other fractions. This trend was also observed by Olmedo et al. (2014), who investigated the antioxidant activity of distilled oregano oil and residues. They found that the distillates and residues, with higher phenolic content showed greater antioxidant activity. It is known that phenolics are hydrogen donors to other molecules, which increases their antioxidant activity [
