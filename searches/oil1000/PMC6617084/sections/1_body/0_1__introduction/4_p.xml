<p class="p">To further explore the application of NADESs as a green and friendly dilution matrix medium, volatile compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves were analyzed by the SHS-GC-MS method in this study. The NADESs was used as both the extraction and dilution media. Six choline chloride based NADESs were prepared. The key SHS-GC parameters were optimized. Based on the optimized conditions, the structures of volatile components in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves were illustrated. The results of this study verified the feasibility of NADESs as a headspace extraction and dilution matrix in the analysis of volatile components from plant materials, and also provided useful information for the development and application of 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> in foods and medicals.
