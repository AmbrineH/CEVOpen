<p class="p">Static headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SHS-GC-MS) is a powerful and efficient way to profile the composition of complex volatile components due to its effectiveness in simultaneous chromatographic separation and structural identification [

 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Compared to direct injection, SHS sampling is clean and convenient as a gas extraction technique for GC-MS analysis. Although SHS has been used as a mature technique for decades, the methodâ€™s optimization work has never been terminated. One of the important works is exploring the superior dilution matrix. Except for the traditionally used dilution matrix of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and water, many other high boiling solvents, such as paraffin and ionic liquids, have also been used as SHS matrix medium [
