<p class="p">On the other hand, the appropriate equilibrium time also played an important role for achieving the gasâ€“liquid balance. Similar to the above operation, the equilibrium time at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min were evaluated in NADES-2 containing 15% water with the other experiment conditions the same as that listed in
