<p class="p">The equilibrium time and temperature were the key operating parameters affecting the SHS efficiency. The equilibrium temperature often depends on the dilution matrix used in SHS. To obtain the optimized equilibrium temperature, different temperatures of 100, 110, 120, 130, and 140 째C were carried out in NADES-2 containing 15% water for SHS-GC-MS analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-08-00205" class="xref">Figure S1a</xref>, with the increase of the temperature, the number of peaks detected in the ICS samples increased. When the equilibrium temperature was raised to 130 째C, greater peak numbers with a better response were observed. Similar results were obtained at 140 째C, but the peak numbers were somewhat decreased. Although the high temperature was beneficial for increasing the peak response of the volatile compounds, the excessive high temperatures could result in the degradation of thermally unstable compounds. As a result, 130 째C was selected as the preferred equilibrium temperature.
