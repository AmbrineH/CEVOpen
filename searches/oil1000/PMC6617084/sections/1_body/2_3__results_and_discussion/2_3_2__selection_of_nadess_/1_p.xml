<p class="p">Six NADESs were prepared, including choline chloride-citric acid, in a 1:1 molar ratio (NADES-1), choline chloride-glucose in a 1:1 molar ratio (NADES-2), choline chloride-1, 4-butanediol in a 1:2 molar ratio (NADES-3), choline chloride-levulinic acid in a 1:2 molar ratio (NADES-4), choline chloride-fructose in a 1:1 molar ratio (NADES-5), and choline chloride-maltose (NADES-6). Transparent solutions were obtained and no precipitation were observed during storage at room temperature. All these NADESs were added to 15% water in a weight ratio before application for further analysis.</p>
