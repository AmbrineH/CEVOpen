<p class="p">To verify the feasibility of NADESs as an SHS dilution matrix, the comparison of the total ion chromatograms of ICS samples between the ICS essential oil, which was prepared by steam distillation, and the ICS powder in NADES-2 containing 15% water were preliminarily performed as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-08-00205" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>. These two samples were detected in the same experiment conditions except different injection methods were used. The ICS essential oil was detected by the direct GC-MS method while the ICS powder was put into a headspace vial with the addition of NADES-2 containing 15% water as the dilution matrix and determined by the SHS-GC-MS method. The results showed that the relatively higher responses with more components were detected from the latter than the former, especially the low boiling point components, which were probably lost by the extraction process of the essential oil. It was reported that NADESs can be used to dissolve cellulose and lignin which facilitate the release of compounds from plant tissues [
