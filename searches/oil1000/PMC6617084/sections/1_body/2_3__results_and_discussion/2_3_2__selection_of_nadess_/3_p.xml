<p class="p">However, for the six NADESs prepared in this study, they exhibited different analysis characteristics as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00205-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. It was found that three sesquiterpenes, including β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene, were the main volatile components in the 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves. The peak areas of these three main compounds and the number of peaks detected were used as one of the key parameters for further analysis of the optimal conditions. A few components were detected in both NADES-3 and NADES-4. More components were observed in NADES-1 and 2 than in NADES-5 and 6. Although a little bit more components were observed in NADES-1, the higher peak areas of the three main compounds were obtained in NADES-2, and NADES-2 was selected as the optimized dilution matrix for further investigation.
