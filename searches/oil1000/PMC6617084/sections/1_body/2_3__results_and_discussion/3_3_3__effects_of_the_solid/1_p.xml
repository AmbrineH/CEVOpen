<p class="p">The peak responses of compounds or the headspace efficiency were greatly affected by the concentration ratio between the analyte in the dilution matrix and the gas phase in the headspace vial [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It was reasonable that a large amount of dilution matrix would decrease the equilibrium concentration of the analyte in the gas phase of the headspace vial and hence decrease the headspace efficiency. To explore the suitable amount of NADESs used in headspace vials, different solid–liquid ratios (ratios of the ICS powder weight and the NADES volume) ranging from 1:5 to 1:50 were investigated. Since the peak numbers were similar, the peak areas of the three main components were used as the key parameters for comparison and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00205-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a. With an increasing of the solid–liquid ratios, the peak areas of three main components decreased. As a result, the solid-liquid ratio at 1:5 was preferred.
