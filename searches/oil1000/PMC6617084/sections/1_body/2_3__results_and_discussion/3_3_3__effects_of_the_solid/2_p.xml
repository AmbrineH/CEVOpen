<p class="p">Although NADES has been demonstrated to have many superiorities and has a wide application as a new type of solvent, its high viscosity makes its application somewhat inconvenient [

 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The viscosity of NADESs could be largely decreased by adding water. In this study, the NADES-2 with the addition of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% (wt%) water were evaluated for the SHS efficiency. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00205-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b showed that the peak areas of the three main components increased slightly by adding 10% to 15% of water. However, when the amount of water was over 15%, the peak areas decreased. It may be attributed to the fact that the hydrogen bonding network in NADES is weakened by adding a large amount of water [
