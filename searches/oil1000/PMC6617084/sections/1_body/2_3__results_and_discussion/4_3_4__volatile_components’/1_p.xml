 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves were tentatively illustrated by matching the mass spectra with the NIST14 Mass Spectral Library and the NIST MS Search 2.2 for the reference retention index. The mass spectra matching was affected by many factors, such as the reference spectral library, spectral similarity measurement, and weight factor [

 <xref rid="B40-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In addition, mass spectral matching cannot distinguish isomers from each other. For natural products, isomers were the common phenomena and showed very similar mass spectra. To differentiate these isomers, the retention index provides a better choice due to the different retention index of the isomers [
