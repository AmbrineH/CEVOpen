<p class="p">Terpenoids were the main volatile components in the

 <bold class="bold">67,</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">75</bold> were identified as terpenoids. Among them, the β-caryophyllene (compound 
 <bold class="bold">39</bold>), β-elemene (compound 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold>), and α-humulene (compound 
 <bold class="bold">45</bold>) were observed to be the main components. Most terpenoids have abundant pharmacological activities. They are used for analgesic and itching, and have antiseptic and bactericidal effects. β-Elemene is useful for killing tumor cells and conventional doses have no effect on normal cells [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. β-Caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] is widely used as a spice in cosmetics and food additives. Pharmacological studies showed that β-caryophyllene has local anesthetic, anti-inflammatory, insect repellent, anti-anxiety and anti-depression effects. β-Caryophyllene is also used in antitussive and expectorant drugs. Compound 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold> was used as an example to elucidate the identification work of these terpenoids. The mass spectrum of compound 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold> showed the molecular ion at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 204.2 and the fragment ions at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 189.2, 175.1, 161.1, 147.1, 133.1, 121.1, 107.1, 93.1, 81.1, 68.1, 55.1, 41.1, and 32.0, respectively. The mass spectral matching result showed that β-elemene had a high matching score of 97. The retention index of compound 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold> was 1389, which was similar to the reference retention index 1398 of β-elemene. As a result, compound 
 <bold class="bold">34</bold> was identified as β-elemene.
