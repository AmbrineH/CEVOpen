<p class="p">Compounds 
 <bold class="bold">1–13, 17–18, 21, 22, 25–30, 35, 38, 47, 66, 68, 73</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">77</bold> were identified as aliphatic compounds. The contents of aliphatic compounds were relatively low. Compound 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was used as an example to elucidate the identification work of these aromatics. The mass spectrum of compound 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> showed that the molecular ion at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 96.0 and the fragment ions were 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 87.0, 73.0, 67.0, 58.1, 51.0, 44.0, 39.0, and 32.0, respectively. The mass spectral matching result showed that 3-furaldehyde had a high matching score of 94. The retention index of compound 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was 829, which was similar to the reference retention index 832 of 3-furaldehyde. As a result, the compound 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was identified as 3-furaldehyde.
