<p class="p">In conclusion, the green solvent NADESs as both an extraction and dilution matrix were successfully applied to the volatile components analysis in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves by the SHS-GC-MS method. Different kinds of NADESs exhibited different SHS efficiencies for the various volatile components. For the volatile components in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves, the NADES composed of choline chloride and glucose with a 1:1 molar ratio containing 15% water showed the preferred results. With the optimized analysis conditions, a total of 77 volatiles in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves were tentatively identified and assigned by mass spectral matching with the standard mass spectral library and the retention index-assisted qualitative method. The main contents in 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> leaves were β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. Based on the results obtained in this study, NADESs were demonstrated to be the efficient green extraction and dilution matrix in the SHS-GC-MS method and could be directly used for volatile components analysis of plant materials without extra extraction work.
