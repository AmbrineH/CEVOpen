<p class="p">The SHS-GC-MS analysis was performed in an Agilent 7890B-5977A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with an Agilent 7697A Headspace auto-sampler (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). A J&amp;W capillary column HP-5 MS UI of 30 m × 0.250 mm with 0.25 μm film (Agilent Technologies Inc.) was used for the separation. The 
 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> samples in a 20 mL headspace vial were heated at an equilibrium temperature of 130 °C for 40 min, and the gas phase were injected into the GC-MS for analysis. The injection time was 1.0 min. A low shaker mode of the headspace vial was applied during sample heating.
