<p class="p">MS parameters were as follows: Data were acquired in the electron impact (EI) mode, using the full scan mode from 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 30 to 600 at 1562 amu/s. The ion source temperature and quadrupole temperature were 230 and 150 Â°C, respectively. The identification of volatile compounds was based on a comparison of their GC retention time and mass spectra with the retention index of n-alkane saturated alkanes and the reference spectra from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 2014). The values were the mean of three replicates of each sample. Data were analyzed by using Agilent MassHunter Analysis.
