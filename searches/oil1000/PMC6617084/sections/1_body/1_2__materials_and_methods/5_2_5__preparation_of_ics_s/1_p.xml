 <italic class="italic">ICS</italic> powder was accurately weighed and added into a 20 mL headspace vial by adding 5 mL NADES, mixed and sealed for SHS-GC-MS analysis. For analysis work, all the NADESs were added to 15% water in a weight ratio, respectively, except for the optimization experiments of the water content in NADESs. The solid–liquid ratio in the headspace vial was 1:5 (g:mL) for all the experiments except the optimization experiments of the solid–liquid ratio. The other experiment conditions were the same as that listed in
