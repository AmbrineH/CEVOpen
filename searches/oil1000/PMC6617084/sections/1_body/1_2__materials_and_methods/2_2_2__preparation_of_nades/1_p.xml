<p class="p">NADESs were prepared by heating method [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-08-00205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The HBAs with different HBDs in different molar ratios were mixed in a conical flask with a cover and magnetically stirred at 85 Â°C by a water bath until a homogeneous liquid formed. Standing at room temperature, NADES was completed if no solid precipitation occurred. The NADES-1,2,5 were composed of choline chloride and citric acid, glucose, and maltose with a 1:1 molar ratio. The NADES-3, 4 were composed of choline chloride and levulinic acid, 1,4-butanediol with 1:2 molar ratio. The NADES-6 was composed of choline chloride and fructose with a 2:1 molar ratio.
