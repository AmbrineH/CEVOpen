 <p> Phylogenetic relationship and structure of the FAD2 gene family in Fabaceae. ( A) The phylogenetic tree of FAD2s in Fabaceae. ( B) The Hisbox 2 in constitutive expression FAD2 genes. ( C) The Hisbox 2 in seed-specific expression FAD2 genes. ( D) The predicted spatial structure of partial GmaFAD2-1 with Y143. ( E) The predicted spatial structure of partial GmaFAD2-1 with I143. The tree was constructed with ML methods based on the amino acid (aa) sequences with the ZomFAD2 as outgroup. The seed-specific clade was marked in red. The diverged 143 site was marked in red triangles. </p>
