 <p> Phylogenetic tree of the FAD2 gene family in plants. The tree was constructed with Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods based on the amino acid (aa) sequences with VcaFAD2 and CreFAD2 as outgroup. Support value (&gt;50% in ML tree) and posterior probabilities (&gt;0.9 in the Bayesian tree) are shown on the respective branches. Gene names and identifiers are shown in Table S1. Different clades are marked in different colors. </p>
