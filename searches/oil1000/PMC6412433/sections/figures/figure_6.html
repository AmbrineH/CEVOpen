 <p> The conversion of oleic acid into linoleic acid in S. cerevisiae cells overexpressing the GmaFAD2 and PfrFAD2-1 genes through the site 143 mutation of GmaFAD2-1. The conversion ratios were calculated based on the results of GC shown in Figure S5 in File S3. The * means p &lt; 0.05 and the ** represents p &lt; 0.01. </p>
