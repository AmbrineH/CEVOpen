 <p> The conversion of oleic acid into linoleic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells overexpressing the seed-specific or high-expressed FAD2 genes in soybean ( GmaFAD2-1 and GmaFAD2-2), perilla ( PfrFAD2-1 and PfrFAD2-2), rice ( OsaFAD2-1), and spruce ( PabFAD2-1). The control represented the conversion ratio in yeast with the empty vector pYES2. The conversion ratios were calculated based on the results of Gas Chromatography (GC) in Figure S3 of File S3. The p-values are also presented in Figure S3 in File S3. </p>
