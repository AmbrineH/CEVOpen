 <p> The sequences of Hisboxes and the ancestral states of intron numbers in FAD2 genes. ( A) The three histidine boxes in FAD2s in plants. The site 143 in GmaFAD2-1 was marked with a red triangle in Hisbox2, and the sites 315 and 321 were marked in black triangles. ( B) The ancestral states reconstruction of intron numbers. Different clades of FAD2 genes were represented with triangles according to the Figure 2. The stars in different colors represent the ancestral states of intron numbers. </p>
