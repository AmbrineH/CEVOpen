<p class="p">In this study, the evolution and catalysis of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes were investigated. The evolution of FAD2 genes were basically conserved except in eudicots, in which the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes diverged into constitutive and seed-specific expression clades. Notably, biocatalysis of seed-specific or -abundant expression 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s in soybean, perilla, rice and spruce revealed their catalytic activity was strongly correlated with their total oil content in seeds. Additionally, it was found that the I and Y in the site 143 of GmaFAD2-1 were strictly conserved in the seed-specific and constitutive expression clades of Fabaceae, respectively. And further, the site-directed mutation of 143 demonstrated that the I and Y are vital to increasing and decreasing the activity of GmaFAD2s, which indicated that the site 143 might have been specifically evolved to the catalytic activity of FAD2s in some expression-diverged eudicots, especially in legumes.
