<p class="p">Regarding the activity of FAD2s, many studies have reported that the mutants of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes could influence the composition of OA and LA in seeds. For example, S117N mutation in GmaFAD2-1A [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], P137R and I143T mutations in GmaFAD2-1B [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and E106K and G303E mutations in BnFAD2-1 and BnFAD2-2 [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] could decline the activity of FAD2s and improve the OA content of seeds. Additionally, the insertion, deletion and suppression expression of FAD2s could also decrease the expression of FAD2s and therefore improve the OA content in seeds [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, the studies on the improvement of the activity of FAD2s have not been reported. In our study, it was revealed that site 143 of GmaFAD2-1 could affect the catalytic activity of GmaFAD2s, in which the I143 and Y143 could increase and decrease the catalytic activity of GmaFAD2s, respectively. It is noteworthy that site 143 strictly diverged into I and Y in the seed-specific and constitutive expression FAD2s in legumes, respectively. Moreover, the divergence between I and Y was not found in the undifferentiated species, such as perilla, and the corresponding mutation of Y138I in PfrFAD2-1 did not work. Therefore, the diverged 143 site might be specific evolved for the diverged species, especially in legumes. In addition, according to the predicted spatial structures of the Y143 and I143, the role of Y143 reducing the activity of GmaFAD2s might be because the benzene ring of Y in Hisbox2 influenced the structure of the catalytic center. However, in the undifferentiated PfrFAD2-1 the Y143 did not work. Thus, these results further indicate that there must be some other sites involved in regulating the catalytic activity of FAD2s. However, owing to the difficulty to determine the crystal structure of FAD2, the mechanism of how site 143 influences catalytic activity is unknown.
