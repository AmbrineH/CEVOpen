<p class="p">In this study, to investigate the relationship between FAD2 and the content of FAs and total oil in seeds, the evolution, biocatalysis, and site-directed mutation of FAD2s were analyzed in detail. The comprehensive evolutionary relationship of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes was reconstructed and their gene structures were also analyzed. Then, the catalytic activities of FAD2s in different seed plants were compared, and the site-directed mutation was also used to reveal their mechanism of catalytic activity.
