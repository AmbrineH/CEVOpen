<p class="p">Seeds of soybean (
 <italic class="italic">G. max</italic>) and spruce (
 <italic class="italic">P. abies</italic>), leaf of perilla (
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic>), and rice (
 <italic class="italic">O. sativa</italic>) were obtained in the farm of Fuyang (Hangzhou, China). The harvested tissues were immediately stored in liquid N2 and then stored at −80 °C until total RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and 1.5 mL RNase-free tubes (MCT-150-C) to ensure no RNA degradation. Then, the first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with approximately 5 μg RNA (100 μL reaction system) using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit cDNA Synthesis Kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes in soybean, spruce, perilla, and rice were cloned using PCR. All of the primers were in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Table S4</xref>. PCR amplification was performed with PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s procedure. The PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gel and purified with MiniBEST DNA Fragment Purification Kit Ver.4.0 (Takara Kusatsu, Japan). The purified products were cloned into the pEASY-T1 (Transgen, Beijing, China) vector.
