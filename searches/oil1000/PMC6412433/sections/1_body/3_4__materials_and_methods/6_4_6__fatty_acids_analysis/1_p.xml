<p class="p">The fatty acids were analyzed by GC and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) (Aligent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total lipids were extracted with 2 mL of 10% H

 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) methanol from cells at 100 °C for 1 h. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were extracted with 2 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution and 2 mL of n-hexane, which were mixed and extracted for 2 h. Then mixtures were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and n-hexane-dissolved FAMEs were carried out for GC analysis [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. FAMEs were analyzed using a 7890A GC instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped flame ionization detector (FID) with a 30 m × 0.320 mm (inner diameter) HP-INNOWax column (Agilent, USA), and oven temperature increases from 140 to 200 °C at 4 °C/min for 15 min. Injector port was maintained at 260 °C, and FID detector temperature was 280 °C. Mass conditions were ionization voltage: 70 eV; temperature: 150–230 °C at the rate of 4 °C/min; and full scan mode in the 50 to 550 m/z range [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The standard curves of OA and LA methyl ester were constructed. The conversion ratios of LA after catalyzing were calculated according to the responding standard curves of LA. All of the samples were analyzed in triplicate.
