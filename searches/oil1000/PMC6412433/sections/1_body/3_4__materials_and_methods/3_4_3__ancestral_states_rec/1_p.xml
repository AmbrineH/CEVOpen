<p class="p">To reveal the diversification process of the introns in 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes during evolution, the ancestral state reconstruction of the intron number was performed in Mesquite (
 <uri xlink:href="http://mesquiteproject.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mesquiteproject.org</uri>, version 3.51) [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The ML tree of the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes was used as input trees. The introns of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes contained four states: more than seven introns, four introns, one intron, and zero intron. The ancestral states at the ancestral nodes of each phylogenetic tree were traced by parsimony methods. Ancestral states were traced by both likelihood and parsimony methods in the “Trace Character History” of Mesquite. The results in the upper clades were mapped onto the phylogenetic tree.
