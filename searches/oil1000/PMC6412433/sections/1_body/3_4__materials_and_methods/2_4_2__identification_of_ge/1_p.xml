<p class="p">The introns and exons structures of the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes were analyzed based on the genome sequences and coding sequences. The protein motifs were analyzed in the MEME server (

 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Twenty motifs were searched and other parameters were defaulted. The motifs were shown in MEME were the most statistically significant (E-value &lt; 0.05) motifs first. The E-value of a motif is based on its log likelihood ratio, width, sites, and the size of the set. The promoters of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s (2000 bp before ATG) in our study were analyzed in PLANTCARE (
