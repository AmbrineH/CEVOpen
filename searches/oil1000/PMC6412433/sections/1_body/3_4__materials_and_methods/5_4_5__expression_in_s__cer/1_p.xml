<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> strain BY4741 and PYES2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) expression vectors were used to express recombinant proteins. The target sequences from plant materials were cloned into PYES2 vector using One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The recombinant vectors were transformed into the BY4741 strain using a lithium acetate method [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (SC-Ura). A single colony containing a positive construct was cultivated in 5 mL SC-u minimal media supplemented with 2% glucose. The cultures with 1% raffinose and 2% galactose were induced for 6 or more hours at 20 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Once the OD
