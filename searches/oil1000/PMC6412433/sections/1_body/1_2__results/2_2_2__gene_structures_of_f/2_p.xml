<p class="p">Secondly, to the intronâ€“exon structures, their numbers were noteworthy (

 <italic class="italic">VcaFAD2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CreFAD2</italic> contain seven and nine introns, respectively. Meanwhile, along the evolution of plants, the intron numbers reduced. In basal land plants, moss, 
 <italic class="italic">Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>, etc., there were no introns in the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes. However, in seed plants the introns emerged again, with numbers ranging from one to four. To further explore the evolutionary history of the intron numbers, the ancestral states of intron numbers were reconstructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00849-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B). The results showed that the ancestor of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes in plants contained many introns (more than seven), which disappeared in the ancestor of the basal land plants, and emerged again in the seed plants. The change of intron numbers might have led to the changes in transcriptional regulation.
