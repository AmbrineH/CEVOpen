<p class="p">Gene structures reflect expression divergence to some extents. To explore the divergence of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes, the protein motifs, intronâ€“exon structures, and promoter regions were analyzed detailed. Firstly, the protein motifs of FAD2s were predicted in Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) and twenty conserved motifs were identified (

Generally, the motif patterns of FAD2s were basically conserved, in which the three histidine boxes (Hisbox 1: HXCGHH, Hisbox 2: PXXXXXXXHXXHH and Hisbox 3: HXXXXXHXXHH) were strictly distributed to motif 3, motif 4, and motif 1, respectively (
