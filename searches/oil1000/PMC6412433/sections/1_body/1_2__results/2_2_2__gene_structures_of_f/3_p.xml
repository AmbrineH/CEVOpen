<p class="p">Promoters are also essential to gene expression. The promoters of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s involved in tissue expression and responses to stresses in the expression-diverged eudicots (such as 
 <italic class="italic">GmaFAD2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">VviFAD2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">PvuFAD2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MtrFAD2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">RcoFAD2</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">MdoFAD2</italic> genes) were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Table S3 in File S1</xref>). Due to the lack of the sequences of promoters, 
 <italic class="italic">MdoFAD2-1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MdoFAD2-2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MdoFAD2-4</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">MdoFAD2-6</italic> were not mentioned. Generally, 15 key elements related to the expression and stresses responses were involved (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Table S3 in File S1</xref>). The kinds and numbers of elements in each 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> were different, and no significant rules and differences were detected between constitutive and seed-specific expression 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s. The results indicate that both the promoters and introns may contribute to the expression divergence of 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2s</italic>.
