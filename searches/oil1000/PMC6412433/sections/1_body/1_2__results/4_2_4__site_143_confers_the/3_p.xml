<p class="p">To further study the function of site 143 to the undifferentiated FAD2s in expression, the PfrFAD2-1 was chosen as an example to study. The activity of PfrFAD2-1 and PfrFAD2-1Y138I was analyzed, and the result showed their conversion rates were consistent (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.14). Hence, the mutation between I and Y in the 143 site might not work in the undifferentiated FAD2s, which might be specific in the diverged FAD2s. The spatial structure of GmaFAD2-1 was also predicted using the SWISS model (
