<p class="p">The catalytic activity of FAD2 varies in different seed plants. To investigate the key active sites of FAD2s in different plants, site-directed mutation was implemented. In FAD2, three Hisboxes are essential to catalytic activity, and were strictly conserved in the FAD2s except for three sites: 143, 314, and 321 of GmaFAD2-1 in Hisbox 2 and Hisbox 3 (marked with triangles in

Nevertheless, the changes of site 314 and 321 were irregular, while site 143 of GmaFAD2-1 in Hisbox 2 is the most interesting. In this site, majority of amino acids are tyrosine (Y), while some of them are isoleucine (I) in the seed-specific expression clades or histidine (H) in the outgroup (marked with a red triangle in
