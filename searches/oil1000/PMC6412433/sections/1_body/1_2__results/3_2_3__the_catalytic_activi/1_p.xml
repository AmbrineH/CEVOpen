<p class="p">To characterize the activity of FAD2s through seed plant lineages, four represented species, i.e., soybean, perilla, rice and spruce, were chosen, according to the oil content in their seeds. The catalytic activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes, specific or abundantly expressed in seeds, was determined by expressing them in the yeast and calculating the conversion rate of LA (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Figures S3â€“S5 in File 3</xref>). In soybean and perilla, there were two 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> copies involved, respectively, but their activities were significantly different. In soybean, the catalytic activity of GmaFAD2-2 (36.70%,

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Figure S5A in File 3</xref>), which is consistent with the previous results that 
 <italic class="italic">GmaFAD2-2</italic> has a more significant role than 
 <italic class="italic">GmaFAD2-1</italic> in the synthesis of linoleic acid in seeds [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Figure S3B in File 3</xref>) is significantly higher than PfrFAD2-2 (34.27%, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Figure S3C in File 3</xref>) in perilla. However, in rice and spruce, only one 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> was highly expressed in seeds, and the activity of OsaFAD2-1 and PabFAD2-1 was 27.02 and 48.10% (
