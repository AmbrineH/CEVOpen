<p class="p">Given the major contribution of FAD2s to the biosynthesis of LA, the correlation between the catalytic activity of FAD2s in seeds and the content of various FAs was analyzed in soybean, rice, perilla and spruce (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Figure S3G in File S3</xref>). The result showed that the content of OA (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.217), LA (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.847), ALA (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.351), or LA and ALA (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.071) were not correlated with the activity of FAD2s. However, it is noteworthy that the activity of FAD2 has a significant positive correlation with the total oil content of seeds (R = 0.997, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002). These results indicated that the activity of FAD2 in seeds might be a predictor for the content of total oil.
