<p class="p">FAD2 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of FAs in plants, and their evolutionary history has also been reconstructed in some studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00849-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-00849" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In this study, 67 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> gene sequences from 28 representative species—including angiosperms (20), gymnosperms (2), basal land plants (4), and chlorophyta (2)—were used to reconstruct their phylogeny in all plant lineages (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00849" class="xref">Table S1 in Files S1 and S2</xref>). The genes in the chlorophyta were used as the outgroup for locating at the base (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00849-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In land plants, the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes have been duplicated in some extents with the copies from one to six. Nevertheless, most of the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s formed monophyletic clades in the phylogeny and were consistent with their taxonomic relationships during evolution, except for the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s in eudicots. The 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s in eudicots diverged into two clades: the seed-specific expression and the constitutive expression 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00849-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, not all of the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes in eudicots were divided into two clades. For example, in Arabidopsis, 
 <italic class="italic">B. napus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. usitatissimum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilegia coerulea</italic>, the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic> genes were not diverged and were grouped together. In the contrast, the 
 <italic class="italic">FAD2</italic>s in 
 <italic class="italic">G. max</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Malus domestica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">and Vitis vinifera</italic> diverged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00849-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The results indicated that the divergence has occurred in different plants.
