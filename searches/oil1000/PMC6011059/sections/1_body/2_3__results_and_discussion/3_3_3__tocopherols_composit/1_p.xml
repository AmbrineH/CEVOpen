<p class="p">The effect of roasting on tocopherols content is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The control oil exhibited a total tocopherols level of 977.9 mg/kg with 46.1, 875.5, and 56.3 mg/kg of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherol. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-tocopherol represented 89.5% of the total tocopherols of argan oil, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-tocopherol 4.7%, and 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherol 5.8%. These results are consistent with data from the literature and confirm the richness of argan oil in 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-tocopherol [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Roasting caused a significant decrease in tocopherols content. The lowest levels were recorded in the condition 175°C/10 min with values of 32.1, 604.1, and 44.9 mg/kg for 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-, and 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherol, respectively. The loss was about 69% for the three forms. This showed that the thermal sensitivity is comparable for the three isomers of tocopherols during argan almonds roasting. Our results also exhibited fluctuations of the tocopherols content with increasing temperature and time of roasting. Considering the effect of the roasting time, it appears that the content of the three forms of tocopherols was comparable at the roasting temperature of 100°C. On the other hand, the values were higher for the duration of 10 min when the roasting temperature was 125 and 150°C. Some studies carried out on pumpkin, rapeseed, and sesame seed oils recorded successive decreases and increases in the tocopherols content according to the increase of the roasting temperature and duration [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Other works reported either an increase or a decrease in the level of tocopherols as a function of the roasting temperature. As an example, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] noted an increase in tocopherols content in safflower oil with increasing roasting temperature, and Eitenmiller [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported a decrease in content of tocopherols with increasing temperature and roasting time for peanut oil. To explain these variations, two major hypotheses were adopted: (i) the decrease in tocopherols level would be due to their thermolability; (ii) the increase would result from a better extraction due to the destruction of the tocopherol-retaining cellular structures and rupture of their binding to membrane proteins and/or phospholipids [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The decrease in the tocopherols level following the almonds roasting constitutes a significant loss of the nutritional value of the edible argan oil, in particular for the high temperatures which are widely used during the artisanal extraction process. In order to preserve the nutritional properties and stability of the argan oil, it would be advisable to avoid high roasting temperatures. This will make it possible to minimize the destruction of tocopherols which are endowed with a high antioxidant power.
