 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The control oil showed a content of 0.198%. The values obtained at the roasting temperatures of 75, 100, and 125°C did not differ significantly from that of the control oil. They increased significantly after roasting at temperatures of 150 (20 and 30 min) and 175°C (10, 20, and 30 min). The values also increased with the roasting time (0.447 and 0.756%, respectively, after 20 and 30 min at 150°C, and at 0.503, 0.855, and 1.370%, respectively, after 10, 20, and 30 min at 175°C). These results are in agreement with previous works carried out on safflower, rice germ, argan, pumpkin, and mustard seeds reporting an increase in phospholipids content as a function of temperature and/or duration of roasting [
