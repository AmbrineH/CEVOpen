<p class="p">The studies on the effects of roasting on the chemical composition and the oxidative stability of argan oil are not numerous. In addition, the temperature used by the authors remains relatively low (110°C) [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] compared to works done on other oilseeds [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], but also with regard to the temperatures applied for the traditional extraction of argan oil intended for commerce or for a familiar use. Indeed, the extraction of argan oil is mainly done using the artisanal process, especially in rural areas of southern Morocco. Almonds from the argan tree are roasted over a wood fire using a stove. They are then ground using a rotary arm grinding stone and the resulting paste is crushed by hand. The addition of small amounts of warm water facilitates the extraction of the oil [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The argan oil obtained by this process is reputed to be poorly preserved [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Indeed, high roasting temperatures, contact with the metal, and the addition of water are all factors for initiating the oxidation of the oil. In this regard, Mathaüs et al. reported that the traditional oil was characterized by negative sensory attributes after 12 weeks of storage [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This result has been attributed in particular to the conditions of manual extraction practiced in the artisanal process. More recently, cooperatives producing argan oil use electric ovens for roasting and the extraction is carried out by press. This allowed an improvement in the quality of the oil compared to the artisanal process [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Mathaüs et al. also noted an improvement in the oxidative stability and sensory quality of oil extracted from roasted almonds at 110°C for 30 min [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. These results were explained by a better extraction of antioxidants and the formation of Maillard reaction products during roasting. In fact, for the same temperature (110°C), other authors reported a significant increase in phospholipids content [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] and a significant decrease in moisture [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. As for the content of FA and tocopherols, Harhar et al. did not report significant changes [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, the roasting time of 45 min (at 110°C) induced a reduction in the oxidative stability of the oil [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This allowed these authors to conclude that 110°C/30 min (temperature/time) represents an optimal roasting condition for preserving the nutritional and the organoleptic properties of argan oil.
