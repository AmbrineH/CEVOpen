<p class="p">The phospholipids content was estimated by measuring phosphorous according to AOCS recommended method Ca 12-5515 [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The method is based on ashing the oil sample in the presence of zinc oxide. The phosphorus is then determined by a spectrophotometric measurement as a blue phosphomolybdic acid complex (Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer). The phospholipids content is obtained by multiplying the phosphorus content by 25.
