<p class="p">It can be summarized that both variety and season of cultivation have a significant effect on (i) the content (extraction yield) and the (ii) qualitative as well as (iii) quantitative profile of basil essential oils. Chemotypes of the studied varieties were evaluated by quantification of four main basil essential oil constituents (i.e., eucalyptol, linalool, estragole, eugenol) and comparing the obtained results with data presented in the literature. According to these criteria, ‘Ohře’, ‘Lettuce Leaf’, ‘Purple Opaal’, and ‘Dark Green’ were identified as linalool chemotypes, which was in good agreement with the results by Beatovic et al. [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Although linalool is declared to be the dominant component of the oil derived from European basil varieties [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], ‘Mammolo Genovese’, ‘Mánes’, and ‘Red Rubin’, studied as pot cultures in our work, were identified rather as eucalyptol chemotypes. Anyway, a significant amount of linalool in ‘Mánes’, and 'Red Rubin' corresponded well with the general characteristic features of European basil varieties. In detailed analysis, mixed chemotypes (i.e., with similar concentrations of main quantified essential oil constituents) were found for ‘Lettuce Leaf’ (linalool:estragole, 1.0:0.9), ‘Dark Green’ (linalool:eucalyptol, 1.0:0.7), ‘Mammolo Genovese’ (eucalyptol:eugenol, 1.0:0.9), ‘Mánes’ (eucalyptol:linalool:eugenol, 1.0:0.6:0.4), and ‘Red Rubin’ (eucalyptol:linalool:eugenol, 1.0:0.6:0.7). Moreover, when considering also other compounds identified in the GC-MS profiles, all the studied varieties, except ‘Lettuce Leaf’, were methyl eugenol-rich with strong dependence of the eugenol:methyl eugenol ratio on seasonal changes (solar irradiation, temperature, relative humidity). Similarly to our results, Vani et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], based on GC analysis, confirmed the higher values of methyl eugenol in September and October. These findings suggested that biotransformation in the basil varieties can be effectively manipulated by controlling cultivation conditions. In this way, maximization/minimization of the amount of target component in essential oil can be provided effectively, not only by the selection of appropriate basil variety, but also by the selection of appropriate pot culture (season). For example, the production of important components of the basil essential oils such as eucalyptol, linalool, estragole, and eugenol was more or less pronouncedly enhanced by increasing solar irradiation and temperature while production of less-preferred methyl eugenol was decreased under these conditions.
