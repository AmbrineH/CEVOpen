<p class="p">Surprisingly, the new variety, ‘Mánes’, exhibited considerably higher extraction yield when compared to other examined basil varieties (‘Ohře’, ‘Lettuce Leaf’, ‘Purple Opaal’, ‘Dark Green’, ‘Mammolo Genovese’, and ‘Red Rubin’). Here, the extraction yield was enhanced two to five times depending on the compared variety. When considering the superior and stable (i.e., reproducible in inter-seasonal or inter-year measure) extraction yield and favorable essential oil profile of ‘Mánes’ towards the generally important essential oil components, this basil variety is very promising for use in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries.</p>
