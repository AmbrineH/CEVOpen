<p class="p">The identity and quantity of particular components of the basil essential oil were evaluated by the GC-MS analysis method, using gas chromatograph Trace GC equipped with MS detector Trace DSQ and DB-WAX (highly polar capillary column with 100% polyethylene glycol stationary phase) capillary column (circa 30 m of length with inner diameter of 0.25 mm and a 0.25 μm layer of the inner film). The measurement records started 3 min after the run beginning. Temperature of the GC column was kept at 40 °C for 3 min. Then, the temperature gradually increased with the gradients of 8 °C/min up to 60 °C, 5 °C/min up to 70 °C, and 4 °C/min up to 230 °C. The temperature of 230 °C was kept constant for 1 minute. Subsequent GC working conditions were as follows: carrier gas was He with a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, matrix solvent was n-hexane. MS working conditions were as follows: temperature of ion source was 200 °C, temperature MS transfer line was 200 °C, mass range was 20–300

Injection conditions were as follows: 10 μL injection syringe, injection volume 1 μL, injection temperature was 240 °C, regime of injection was “split”, split flow was 50 mL/min, split ratio was 100. The content of selected components of the essential oils was calculated from 3 parallel analyses and expressed in mg/mL.
