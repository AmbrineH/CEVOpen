<p class="p">The content of the basil essential oil in the aerial part of plant was determined at the Department of Vegetable Growing and Floriculture of the Mendel University in Brno by the method of steam distillation according to [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], without using xylene. The samples of plant material (dried leaf and stem tissue) were fragmented in a laboratory mill (ILABO MF 10 basic, with maximum size of grain 3.15 mm) immediately before the distillation. An amount of 30.0 g of the crushed drug was added in a 1000 mL flask; the content of distillation liquid (water) was 400 mL. The distillation was carried out at a rate of 2–3 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 2 h. The volume of isolated essential oil was measured in a proper calibrated tube. The extracted essential oils were stored in sealed vials at 4 °C in the refrigerator until GC-MS analysis. The content of essential oils in the plant material was calculated from 2 parallel distillations and expressed in mL·kg
