<p class="p">Particular components of basil essential oils, identified by means of Thermo Finnigan NIST 02 Libraries software, are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The data in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> illustrate the relative amounts of the individual components detected in the sample profiles (expressed as mean values and corresponding standard deviations obtained from three parallel measurements). The data indicate that the samples’ profiles (i.e., basil essential oil components and their relative amounts) are differing from each other depending not only on variety, but also on cultivation conditions. The new variety, ‘Mánes’, exhibited significant relative amounts of methyl eugenol and eugenol in the spring and summer periods while the majority of eugenol was transformed to methyl eugenol in the autumn period. On the other hand, in case of eucalyptol, β-linalool, and α-bergamotenen, it was the opposite. When considering changes in these periods (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01221-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), for example the decrease in solar irradiation and temperature and the increase in relative humidity during autumn period, these factors are supposed to be responsible for biotransformation processes leading to changes in the composition of basil essential oils. Analogically it was found out also for most of the other tested basil varieties. ‘Ohře’ exhibited significant relative amounts of eucalyptol, β-linalool, methyl eugenol, and δ-cadinene in the spring and summer periods while β-linalool and methyl eugenol dominated in autumn period. ‘Dark Green’ exhibited significant relative amounts of eucalyptol, β-linalool, α-bergamotenen, p-allylanisol, methyl eugenol, and eugenol in the spring and summer periods, while α-bergamotenen, p-allylanisol, and methyl eugenol dominated in autumn period. ‘Mammolo Genovese’ exhibited significant relative amounts of eucalyptol, α-bergamotenen, methyl eugenol, and eugenol in the spring and summer periods while α-bergamotenen and methyl eugenol dominated in the autumn period. In comparison with these varieties, ‘Lettuce Leaf’ exhibited significant relative amounts of eucalyptol, β-linalool, methyl eugenol, and δ-cadinene over all the seasons with higher or lower concentration variability (i.e., qualitative profile was relatively stable) while ‘Purple Opaal’ or ‘Red Rubin’ exhibited significant differences in qualitative and quantitative composition of major essential oil components such as eucalyptol, β-linalool, methyl eugenol, eugenol, and δ-cadinene or eucalyptol, α-bergamotenen, methyl eugenol, and eugenol in each season (i.e., qualitative profiles were relatively unstable and more depended on little seasonal changes). Based on the essential oil profiles and corresponding relative detection responses for particular essential oil components (the highest analytical signals), the ‘Red Rubin’, ‘Mammolo Genovese’, ‘Purple Opaal’, ‘Manes’, and ‘Dark Green’ varieties were identified as methyleugenol-rich, while ‘Ohře’ exhibited a variable chemotype depending on the season of cultivation (linalool/methyleugenol). ‘Lettuce Leaf’ was the sole sample with the estragole domination and it and ‘Dark Green’ were the only varieties containing detectable amounts of estragole.
