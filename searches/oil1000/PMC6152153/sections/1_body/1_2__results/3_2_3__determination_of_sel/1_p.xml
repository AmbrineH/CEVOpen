<p class="p">The essential oil components selected for the quantitative evaluation of the seven basil varieties were eugenol, Î²-linalool, eucalyptol, and estragole due to their general importance in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries. Statistical evaluation of the GC-MS method employed for the quantitation included parameters of calibration lines (linear range, determination coefficient, slope, interface), detection and quantitation limits (LOD and LOQ, respectively), and reproducibility of measurements (standard deviation). The resulting performance and calibration parameters are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The data indicated that the quantitation limits, linear ranges, and reproducibility of the measurements were acceptable for sensitive and highly reliable determination of the tested components in basil essential oils extracted from seven studied basil varieties.
