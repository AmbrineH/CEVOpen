<p class="p">Generally, the pot cultures 1 and 2 (covering the sunny season from half of March to half of July with higher temperature and lower relative humidity) exhibited significantly higher concentrations of the particular quantified essential oil components than pot culture 3 (covering darker season including September and October with lower temperature and higher relative humidity), see 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Here, methyl eugenol, which exhibited opposite behavior, was an exception (changes in solar irradiation, temperature, and relative humidity were supposed to be responsible for increased biotransformation of eugenol to less preferred methyl eugenol in darker season, see 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The concentrations of the quantified components in particular essential oils did not differ significantly when comparing pot cultures 1 and 2. From these observations it is clear that the controlled solar irradiation, temperature, and relative humidity are important factors for providing stable cultivation and, by that, production, or for enhancing production of eugenol, linalool, eucalyptol, and estragole as the key components of essential oils in basil varieties, or for minimizing production of less preferred/unwanted components (e.g., methyl eugenol). The new variety, ‘Mánes’, exhibited significant amounts of three essential oil components, namely eucalyptol, linalool, and eugenol, while estragole was not quantified, see concentration data in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. This pattern was more or less similar to other examined basil varieties with exception for ‘Lettuce leaf‘ and ‘Dark green‘ in which estragole could also be quantified. When considering superior extraction yield of ‘Mánes’, the produced quantity of these important essential oil components is comparable or even better than ‘Purple Opaal’, ‘Mammolo Genovese’, ‘Red Rubin’, ‘Ohře’ (with exception of linalool content), and ‘Lettuce Leaf’ and ‘Dark Green’ (both with exception of estragole content) varieties.
