 <xref rid="molecules-22-01221-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> illustrate concentrations of the selected components found in the tested essential oils. The concentrations are expressed as mean values and corresponding standard deviations obtained from three parallel measurements. The data indicate that the quantities of examined basil essential oil components differ from each other depending not only on variety but also on cultivation conditions.
