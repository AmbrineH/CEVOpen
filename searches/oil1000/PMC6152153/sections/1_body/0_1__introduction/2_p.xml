According to the geographical origin of basil varieties and on the basis of their major constituents, they are classified in four chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-22-01221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]: (1) European chemotype, the oil of which is characterized by high amounts of linalool (35–50%) and estragole (15–25%); (2) reunion chemotype (estragole basil) whose main essential oil component is estragole (80% or more); (3) tropical chemotype (cinnamon basil), the oil of which is dominated by methyl cinnamate, and (4) eugenol chemotype whose major oil component is eugenol.
