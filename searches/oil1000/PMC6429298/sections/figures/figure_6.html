 <p> Chemical structure of polysaccharide-based hydrogels. ( A) Agarose, composed of β-(1-4)-(3,6)-anhydro- l-galactose (left) and α-(1-3)- d-galactose (right). ( B) Hyaluronic acid (HA) composed of alternating residues of β- d-(1-3) glucuronic acid (left) and β- d-(1-4)- N-acetylglucosamine (right). ( C) Structure of cellulose derivatives. In hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), R is H or hydroxy ethyl group (–CH 2CH 2–OH). In carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (NaCMC), R is H or carboxymethyl groups (–CH 2–COOH). </p>
