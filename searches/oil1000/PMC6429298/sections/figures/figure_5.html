 <p> Chemical structure of monounsaturated monoacylglycerol lipids (MAGs). ( A) Shorthand representation of N.T MAG, where N (neck) is the number of carbon atoms in the acyl chain between the ester and cis-olefin bonds and T (tail) is the number of carbon atoms between the cis-olefin bond and the end of the chain. ( B) Chemical structure of short MAG lipid 9.7 MAG and 7.9 MAG, used in the SFX experiment in vacuum to avoid the Lc phase of 9.9 MAG. </p>
