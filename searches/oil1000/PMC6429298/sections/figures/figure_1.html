 <p> Schematic diagram of experimental geometry for serial crystallography using sample delivery medium. XFEL (X-ray free electron laser) or the synchrotron X-ray is focused using Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors. The injection stream of the delivery medium containing crystals is extruded from the sample injector into the X-ray interaction point (red circle). The single panel detector without a center hole is the required beam stopper. Diffraction data is recorded by the detector. </p>
