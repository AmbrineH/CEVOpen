  <p class="p">Crystal growth in delivery medium for serial crystallography. Example of crystallization of membrane protein in lipidic cubic phase (LCP). (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Monoolein (9.9 MAG) as a delivery medium and membrane protein solution is injected into each syringe. The ratio of monoolein and protein solution is 3:2. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Syringes containing the monoolein and protein solution are connected using a coupler. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Mixing of membrane protein and monoolein forms LCP. (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) Crystallization solution is added to the syringe containing the mixture of membrane protein in LCP. (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Crystal growth in LCP. After removing the precipitant, the LCP containing the crystals is transferred into the sample injector and is used to perform the serial crystallography (SX) experiment. This figure was drawn based on Reference [
