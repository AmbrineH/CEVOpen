 <p> Crystal growth in delivery medium for serial crystallography. Example of crystallization of membrane protein in lipidic cubic phase (LCP). ( A) Monoolein (9.9 MAG) as a delivery medium and membrane protein solution is injected into each syringe. The ratio of monoolein and protein solution is 3:2. ( B) Syringes containing the monoolein and protein solution are connected using a coupler. ( C) Mixing of membrane protein and monoolein forms LCP. ( D) Crystallization solution is added to the syringe containing the mixture of membrane protein in LCP. ( E) Crystal growth in LCP. After removing the precipitant, the LCP containing the crystals is transferred into the sample injector and is used to perform the serial crystallography (SX) experiment. This figure was drawn based on Reference [ 42]. A horizontal arrow indicates movement of the plunger. In vacuum, an additional titration step using short MAG is required (see text). </p>
