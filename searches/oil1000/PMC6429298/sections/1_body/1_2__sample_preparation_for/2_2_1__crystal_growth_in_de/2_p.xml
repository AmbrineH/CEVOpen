<p class="p">The advantage of the method of crystal growth in the delivery medium lies in its simple and convenient application to SX experiments. In addition, since this method has no mixing process between the crystal and the delivery medium, it results in little or no physical damage to the crystal sample when compared to other mixing methods. However, using this method, additional delivery optimization studies may be required depending on the property of the delivery material and the sample environment (e.g., LCP or agarose delivery medium in vacuum).</p>
