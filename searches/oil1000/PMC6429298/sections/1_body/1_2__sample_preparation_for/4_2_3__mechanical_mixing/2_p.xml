<p class="p">Compared to the manual mixing method, the mechanical mixing method using a syringe setup has the advantage of reduced sample loss and avoids the dehydration of the crystal sample. However, the crystal sample may be subjected to physical damage due to the use of a narrow coupler hole during the mixing process for the uniform distribution of crystals in the delivery medium.</p>
