<p class="p">The mechanical mixing method involves mixing the crystal suspension and the delivery medium physically using a syringe setup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). This mixing method was originally developed for the crystallization of membrane proteins in LCP [
 <xref rid="B67-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. This method was applied using delivery mediums including LCP (for soluble proteins) [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], agarose [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], F-127 [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], PEO [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], and PAM [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. For example, using agarose [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], the crystal suspension and the melted agarose were loaded into separate syringes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A). These two syringes were connected using a coupler (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>B), then mixed until the crystal suspension was uniformly distributed in the delivery medium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>C). This mixture was further transferred to the sample injector and used in the SFX experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>D). A similar procedure can also be applied for LCP (for soluble protein crystal) [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], F-127 [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and PEO [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. On the other hand, in the application of PAM, an additional step is required, in which the cross-linked PAM is disrupted to avoid the physical damage of crystal suspension during the syringe mixing by high strength PAM [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>].
