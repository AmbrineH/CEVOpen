<p class="p">In order to deliver crystal samples using a delivery medium for SX, the crystal samples must be embedded in the delivery medium. The following three methods for embedding the crystals in delivery medium have been reported so far: (i) crystal growth in delivery medium, (ii) manual mixing, and (iii) mechanical mixing (

When the crystal sample grows in a delivery medium that can be used as a delivery material, the SX experiment can be performed directly or after optimization for the stable and continuous injection of the sample from the sample injector. On the other hand, when crystallization is not available in the delivery medium, the crystallized sample is physically mixed with the delivery medium and transferred to the sample injector, after which the SX experiment is performed.
