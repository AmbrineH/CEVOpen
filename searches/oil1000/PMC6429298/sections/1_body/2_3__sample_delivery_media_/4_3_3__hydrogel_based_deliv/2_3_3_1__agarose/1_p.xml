<p class="p">Agarose is a polysaccharide derived from seaweed, composed of a basic repeat unit consisting of alternating 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose linked by α-(1→3) and β-(1→4) glycosidic bonds which undergo thermal crosslinking [

During the initial experiment, the crystal samples embedded in agarose were derived to an X-ray interaction point in a vacuum at room temperature. However, the agarose medium was dehydrated and formed an ice formation under vacuum conditions [

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) glycerol was selected, which formed a stable and continuous stream without ice-crystal diffraction. The agarose delivery medium can be used in an expansive temperature (4–30 °C). The phycocyanin (PC) crystals embedded in agarose were extruded from the LCP injector using a 50 µm-ID capillary into the X-ray interaction point at a flow rate of 160 nL/min. The room temperature structure of PC embedded in agarose was determined at a resolution of 2.5 Å using 0.3 mg of microcrystals. The diffuse X-ray background scattering of the agarose medium was observed in the region of 3.3 Å. The chemical compatibility of the agarose delivery medium for the crystallization of the precipitant demonstrates that the agarose injection stream was stable in 1 M NaCl, 1.25 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M NaCl, and &gt;30% PEG 400–8000, and organic precipitants such as 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Agarose can be used both in vacuum conditions and under ambient pressure. Stable stream conditions have been reported under vacuum conditions [
