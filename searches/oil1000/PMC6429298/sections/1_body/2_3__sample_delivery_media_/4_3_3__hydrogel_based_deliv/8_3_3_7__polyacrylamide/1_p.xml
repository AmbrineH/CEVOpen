 <xref rid="B83-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Cross-linked PAM forms a soft gel in the presence of water and exhibits stability at a wide pH range (pH 3–11) [

 <xref rid="B86-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Therefore, the crystal samples can be stored stably in PAM delivery materials. In the SFX experiment, the PAM solution was loaded into the syringe and then left to stand until it was thermally removed during the polymerization process [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. However, at a flow rate &lt; 400 nL/min, Debye–Scherrer rings were observed at ~4 Å and dehydration occurred as a result of using helium gas in the outer capillary of the injector [

The crystal structures of lysozyme and thermolysin derived in PAM were determined at 1.7 and 1.8 Å, respectively, using 0.5 mg lysozyme and 1 mg thermolysin. The diffuse scattering from PAM was observed near a resolution of 3.2 Å, and mostly consisted of solvent scattering. In terms of its chemical compatibility with crystallization precipitants, 10% (
