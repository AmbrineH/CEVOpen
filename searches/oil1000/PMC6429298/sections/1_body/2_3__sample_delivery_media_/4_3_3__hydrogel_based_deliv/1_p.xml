 <xref rid="B75-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. The hydrogel-based delivery media used in SX can be further divided into saccharides-based (agarose, HA, HEC, and NaCMC) and non-saccharide-based (F-127, PEO, and PAM) hydrogels. Saccharide-based delivery materials are considered potentially specific or non-specific interactors with sugar-related protein crystal samples.
