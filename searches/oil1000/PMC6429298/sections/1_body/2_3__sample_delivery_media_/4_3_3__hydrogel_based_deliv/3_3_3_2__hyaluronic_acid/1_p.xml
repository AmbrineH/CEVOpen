It is essential to mix the HA aqueous solution with the supernatant or crystal harvest solution before adding the crystal suspension, which avoids osmotic shock in the crystals when mixed with the medium [

While HA has the advantage of providing a stable stream, this delivery material is costly compared with other delivery media [
