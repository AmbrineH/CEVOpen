 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>C). At concentrations below 5%, HEC (MW ~250,000) was not continuously extruded from the injector, and extrusion was difficult at ~30% HEC. A final concentration of 10–20% HEC was adequate to carry out the SFX experiment [

A final concentration of 16%, 11%, 22%, 16%, and 16% HEC medium were manually mixed with lysozyme (1 × 1 × 1 μm), lysozyme (20 × 20 × 30 μm), taumatin (2 × 2 × 4 μm), protein K (Pr soaking, 4 × 4 × 4–5 × 5 × 7 μm), and proteinase K (native 8 × 8 × 8–12 × 12 × 12 μm) crystals using a spatula on a glass slide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The microcrystals embedded HEC in the micro-extrusion injector were kept at a temperature of approximately 20 °C. The temperature and humidity in the sample chamber were ~26 °C and &gt;50%, respectively. This delivery medium containing the crystals was delivered by sample injection at a flow rate of 0.38–0.75 μL/min. The crystal structure of the lysozyme and thaumatin delivered in HEC were determined at a resolution of 1.45 Å (and 1.8 Å for small crystals) and 1.55 Å, respectively. In this study, using HEC, de novo phasing in SFX by applying praseodymium-SAD (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion), single-isomorphous replacement (SIR), and SIR with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phasing were demonstrated and used to determine the crystal structure of proteinase K at a resolution of 1.5 Å. The HEC medium provides a slightly higher level of background scattering over a resolution range of ~3.5–2.5 Å [
