 <xref rid="B58-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. After removing air and dissolving the PEO, the crystal suspension was embedded in the PEO gel uniformly by mechanical mixing using a syringe setup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The phycocyanin (~20 μm), Flpp3 in LCP (~20 μm), and proteinase K (10–15 μm) crystals enclosed in PEO were delivered at an average flow rate of 182 nL/min (crystal velocity: 1550 μm/s), 155 nL/min (1315 μm/s), and 79 nL/min (675 μm/s), respectively. The room temperature crystal structures of phycocyanin, Flpp3, and proteinase K were determined at 3.1, 3.0, and 2.65 Å, respectively. Poly(ethylene oxide) showed diffuse scattering at a resolution of around 3.3 Å, which mostly consisted of water scattering. The sample preparation using PEO gel as the delivery medium was simple and straightforward and was highly stable at a wide range of temperatures, including the traditional crystallization temperatures of 4–30 °C [
