 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). When the untreated synthetic grease Super Lube was delivered using a 110-μm ID nozzle, the grease was extruded to a thickness of ~210 μm, which is similar to the outer dimmer (OD) of the nozzle [

Since a thicker delivery medium increases the level of background scattering, ground synthetic grease Super Lube is more useful in SFX experiments. Super Lube grease shows a stronger background scattering in a resolution range of ~4.8 Å of all the diffraction images [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The crystals in synthetic grease Super Lube were kept at approximately 20 °C, and the temperature and humidity of the sample chamber were ~26 °C and &gt;80%, respectively. Protein K (5–10 μm) and lysozyme (7–10 μm) crystals embedded in synthetic grease Super Lube were derived at a flow rate of 0.48 μL/min. The crystal structures of lysozyme and proteinase K embedded in synthetic grease Super Lube were both determined at a resolution of 2.3 Å [
