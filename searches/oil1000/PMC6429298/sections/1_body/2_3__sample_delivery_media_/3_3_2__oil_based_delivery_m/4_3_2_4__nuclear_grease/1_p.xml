<p class="p">In the SFX experiment, the salt-like impurities in the nuclease grease (Super Lube nuclear grade grease) were removed by filtration using a 10-μm mesh [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The nuclear grease matrix was extruded as a continuous stream with a diameter of ~100 μm through a 100-μm ID nozzle at a flow rate of 0.42 μL/min. The crystals in the nuclear grease were kept at approximately 20 °C in the injector, and the temperature and humidity of the sample chamber were ~26 °C and &gt;50%, respectively. The crystal structure of the lysozyme delivered in the nuclear grease was determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å, using 0.5 mg of protein. Nuclear grease has a lower level of background scattering than other grease matrices, but higher than LCP [
