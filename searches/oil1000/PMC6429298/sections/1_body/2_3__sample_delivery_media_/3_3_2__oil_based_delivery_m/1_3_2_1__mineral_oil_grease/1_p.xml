 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The mixture sample was derived using a syringe in a helium chamber [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The sample holder was exposed to a cooled helium gas stream and the microcrystals embedded in the grease were maintained at a temperature of 19.5–21.7 °C. The temperature and humidity in the sample chamber were 21.3–23.6 °C and 2–9%, respectively. A grease stream containing the lysozyme (crystal size: 7–10 µm in maximum length), glucose isomerase (10–30 µm), thaumatin (10–30 µm), and FABP3 (10–20 µm) crystals were extruded from a syringe injector using a 110 µm-ID (inner diameter) needle at a flow rate of 0.46–0.48 µL/min [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The crystal structures of lysozyme, glucose isomerase, thaumatin, and FABP3 were determined to be 2.0 Å, 2.0 Å, 2.0 Å, and 1.6 Å, respectively, using &lt;1 mg of sample for all proteins [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The X-ray diffraction ring pattern and background diffraction from grease were observed at the ~14 Å and 4–5 Å regions, respectively [
