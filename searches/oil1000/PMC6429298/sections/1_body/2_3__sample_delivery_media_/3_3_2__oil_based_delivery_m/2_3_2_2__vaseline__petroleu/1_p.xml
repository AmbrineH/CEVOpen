 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The mixture was delivered using a HVE (high viscosity extrusion) sample injector [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The flow speed of the Vaseline was in the range of 50 m/s to several mm/s, and the flow rate was 4–300 nL/min when a 40 μm-ID capillary was used [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Vaseline generated Debye–Scherrer rings at 4.2 and 3.77 Å spacing, and additional weak rings at higher resolutions [

 <xref rid="B53-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Vaseline can form thinner streams during injection extrusion than LCP. Moreover, it is much silkier than LCP and is useful for embedding fragile crystals [
