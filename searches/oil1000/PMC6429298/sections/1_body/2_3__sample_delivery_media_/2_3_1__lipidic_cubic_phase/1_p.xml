<p class="p">Lipidic cubic phase (LCP) is a membrane-mimicking gel-like matrix for membrane protein crystallization in a lipidic environment [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Monoacylglycerols (MAGs) represent the most widely used lipid class for crystallization of membrane proteins by the LCP method [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Monoacylglycerols contain a glycerol head group and a hydrocarbon tail with a cis double bond (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01094-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Most MAG lipids have very similar temperature-composition phase behavior [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Monoolein (9.9 MAG) is the most successful lipid used for LCP crystallization [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], although other MAGs have also been reported to be useful [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Although LCP using monoolein is useful for membrane protein crystallization, the LCP is cooled to the equilibrium phase transition temperature (~18 °C) by evaporation in vacuum, followed by the layering of a part of the sample into the lamellar crystalline phase (Lc). These patches of the Lc phase produce strong and sharp powder diffraction rings when exposed to an X-ray beam, which increase background scattering and may lead to damage of sensitive detectors [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. This problem can be overcome by the addition of shorter chain lipids (9.7 MAG or 7.9 MAG) for lower phase transition temperatures. In contrast, LCP extrusion is performed at ambient pressure without the addition of shorter chain lipids [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The LCP microextrusion injector delivers a stable injection stream of LCP containing the crystal samples at a very slow flow rate of 0.001–0.3 μL/min, which varies depending on the sample composition, nozzle diameter, and pressure [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. During the initial experiments, several G protein-coupled receptors, such as β
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> adrenergic receptor, adenosine A
 <sub class="sub">2A</sub> receptor, smoothened receptor (SMO), glucagon receptor, and serotonin 2B (5-HT2B) receptor, in LCP were stably delivered using the LCP injector with a flow rate of 170 nL/min [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Full data collection was performed using &lt;0.5 mg of DgKA, SMO, and 5-HT2B [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The LCP shows the diffuse scattering and/or Debye–Scherrer rings at 4–5 Å. LCP provides a stable stream for most crystallization conditions; however, in some precipitants, the LCP phase can be transferred to the lamellar, hexagonal, or sponge phases [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and is not compatible with high concentrations of ammonium sulfate [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. LCP, on the other hand, is also used for delivering soluble protein crystals for reducing sample consumption [
