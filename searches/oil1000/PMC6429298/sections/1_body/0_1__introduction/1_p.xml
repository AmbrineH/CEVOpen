<p class="p">The field of structural biology using synchrotron radiation has provided an understanding of the functional molecular mechanisms of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This has provided structural insights into the development of drug design for disease-related targets and the creation of improved enzyme activity for industry-applicable enzymes through rational engineering [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Despite this breakthrough technology, X-ray crystallography has several technical limitations, including radiation damage [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. For example, a crystal sample is continuously exposed to X-rays during the full data collection at room temperature. During this process, 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-shell photoionization and Auger decay in atoms occurs in the molecules, followed by electron cascade occurring by electron-impact ionization [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thereafter, various radical reactions, with energies ranging between a few and several tens of electron volts, affect the molecules that differ in their timescales and temperature-dependence [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In particular, radiation damage can affect characteristics including redox processes, free radical generation, and chemical bond breakage, which represent irreversible changes in the electron density map [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Moreover, it can also affect the conformational changes of the molecules or crystal lattices [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. As a result, radiation damage not only reduces the X-ray diffraction intensity of the crystal sample, but can also provide an electron density that often contains less reliable structural information. In order to minimize radiation damage, cryo-crystallography techniques are widely applied and dramatically reduce radiation damage [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, this technique still involves radiation damage, as well as a cryogenic structure that may be biologically less reliable than the room temperature structure [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In particular, room-temperature structure determination is important for the elucidation of protein dynamics, demonstrating an accurate conformational flexibility that is crucial for understanding molecular function [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Moreover, room-temperature crystallography allows for time-resolved studies of protein dynamics and enzyme catalysis [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Therefore, macromolecule structure determination using a synchrotron X-ray source is experimentally limited for the collection of data with radiation damage in low temperature environments.
