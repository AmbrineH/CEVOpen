<p class="p">In order to conduct SFX or SMX studies using a delivery medium, it is important to understand the characteristics of the developed delivery medium and its applications in SX. This review describes the method of crystal sample mixing using the delivery medium reported so far and summarizes the content applied to SX for each delivery medium. In addition, the criteria for the selection of delivery materials and the preparation of injection experiments, as well as the requirements for the development of delivery medium, are discussed here.</p>
