<p class="p">In the first high-resolution SFX experiment, lysozyme crystals were delivered by a liquid jet sample injector with a gas dynamic virtual nozzle (GDVN) to an X-ray interaction point [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and was used to successfully determine the crystal structure of lysozymes at 1.9 Å resolution [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, the minimum flow rate and linear velocity of the GDVN-based injector was 10 μL/min and 10 m/s, respectively, which is too fast for XFELs, with a pulse repetition rate of less than 120 Hz [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Only one of tens of thousands of crystal samples will be hit by the X-ray pulse, and the rest of the sample will therefore be wasted [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. As a result, the determination of the SFX structure using a liquid jet generally requires tens to hundreds of milligrams of protein [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Therefore, SFX studies using liquid jet injectors at low X-ray repetition rates are challenging due to the large amounts of crystal sample consumption. To overcome this issue, other sample delivery methods, such as electrospinning [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], acoustic injectors for drop-on-demand [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], or fixed-target scanning [

 <xref rid="B50-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], have been developed to deliver crystal samples serially to X-ray interaction points in SX experiments [
