<p class="p">Next, the selected delivery medium can vary in viscosity depending on the crystallization solution, which is related to the stability of the stream delivered from the injector. A preliminary study of the viscosity of the delivery material for crystal solutions is essential for the efficient use of beamtime at XFELs or synchrotrons. Agarose [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] have been studied through chemical compatibility tests for precipitants in crystallization solution. This information can be used as a guide for selecting the delivery medium in further research. In contrast, in the case of other delivery media, chemical compatibility with various precipitants in the crystallization solution was not fully performed or not described in detail. Additional chemical compatibility studies on the crystallization solution would be required to provide information on the delivery material selection. As in previous studies of chemical compatibility in NaCMC [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-01094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], the delivery medium containing crystals can be manually ejected from a syringe and the stability of the delivery medium stream can then be easily evaluated. When an unstable stream is ejected due to the lower viscosity of the delivery medium, the viscosity and stable stream of delivery medium can be optimized by adding another viscous material, thereby changing the concentration of the delivery medium itself or of the material affecting the degree of viscosity in the crystallization solution. The most efficient preliminary study of sample delivery involves determining the optimal conditions of stable and continuous stream for sample delivery using the sample injector under the experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, vacuum or ambient pressure, etc.) that will be used in the SX experiment.
