<p class="p">Although a variety of delivery media have been developed and applied, it may not be possible to use the reported delivery media due to the occurrence of chemical reactions between the specific protein sample and the delivery medium or due to the physical damage made to the crystals during the mixing process. Therefore, further development of delivery materials is continuously required in order to improve the possibilities of carrying out SX research. In order to develop new delivery mediums for SX, the following should be considered: (i) the delivery material should be able to store the crystal sample for a long period of time in a stable manner; (ii) the delivery material should maintain a stable and continuous stream at low flow rates from the sample injector; (iii) injection stream characterization should be performed through chemical compatibility experiments for the crystallization solution; (iv) the injection stream should be available in a thin ID nozzle; (v) the background scattering generated from the delivery medium should be low. In particular, a very stable and continuous injection stream is required to provide reliable results when conducting time-resolved SFX (TR-SFX). In addition, low background scattering from the delivery medium and a stable stream with a thin ID nozzle to minimize background scattering are important and will contribute significantly to measuring weak anomalous signals for de novo phasing [

In TR-SFX using delivery media, on the other hand, the delivery medium should not be deformed by the pump source (e.g., laser, chemical reagent). This may have a temporary physical and chemical effect on the crystal sample and may result in a problematic structure due to an unwanted and unexpected source. Although a variety of delivery materials have been developed to date, until now, there have been no studies on the physical and chemical changes of the delivery materials by the pump source in pump-probe experiments. The effects of pump source on the delivery materials used in future TR-SFX experiment should also be studied.
