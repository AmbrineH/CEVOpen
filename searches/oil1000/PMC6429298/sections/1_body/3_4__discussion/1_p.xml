<p class="p">In this review, the experimental preparation and application of delivery media for SX experiments were described. The delivery media dramatically reduced the consumption of crystal samples by lowering the flow rate from the sample injector using the properties of highly viscous materials. In SFX experiments using delivery materials, all the crystal structures were determined using less than 1 mg of protein. This low amount of protein consumption facilitates the SFX research approach and provides an opportunity to develop new research. Although the reported delivery media were demonstrated to be success for SX applications, the optimization of sample delivery media for stable injection is required according to the experimental conditions of each facility (X-ray source, temperature, vacuum or ambient pressure, humidity). Moreover, when conducting SX studies using a delivery medium, preliminary studies are essential to ensure the stability between the crystal sample and the delivery medium, as well as a stable injection stream of the delivery medium containing the crystals from the sample injector. The following criteria should be taken into account when selecting a delivery material: (i) the delivery material should not undergo any chemical reaction with the sample crystals; (ii) the viscosity of the delivery medium for a stable flow rate should not be affected by the crystallization solution; (iii) the delivery medium should not damage the crystal during sample mixing; (iv) under vacuum conditions, when the cryoprotectant solution is added to the delivery medium to prevent dehydration by cooled evaporation, the crystal sample should not be affected. After selecting the delivery medium to be used for the SX experiment, whether the crystal sample is stable without chemical reaction when mixed with the delivery medium and whether the crystal sample is damaged according to the physical mixing method should be confirmed. To confirm the stability of the crystals in the selected delivery medium, high-resolution microscopy can be used to determine whether the crystal morphology has changed or dissolved. Second order non-linear imaging of chiral crystals (SONICC), including second harmonic generation (SHG) and ultraviolet two-photon excited fluorescence (UV-TPEF) can also be used to easily visualize the protein crystal sample in the delivery medium [

The most accurate evaluation of the stability of the crystals in the delivery medium involves measuring the diffraction intensity by exposing the crystals to X-rays after long-term incubation in the delivery medium and then comparing them to the diffraction intensity of the native crystals. This experiment can be performed using X-rays from a synchrotron or home source.
