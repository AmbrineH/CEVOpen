<p class="p">Phytosterols, constituting a major portion of the unsaponifiable fraction of oils, are encouraged to include in the human diet as their ability to lower blood cholesterol and possess anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-ulcerative, and antitumoral activities [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> showed the compositions and contents of phytosterols in five different kinds of rapeseed oils during the whole refining process. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>, β-sitosterol was the most abundant phytosterol in all kinds of rapeseed oils, followed by campesterol and brassicasterol. The content of phytosterol in the crude oil samples were from 4518.30–5529.05 μg/g. It has underwent a remarkable decrease after refining, ranging from 3685.75–4512.20μg/g. In this study, the loss rate of brassicasterol, campesterol, β-sitosterol and total phytosterols content of five different kinds of rapeseed oils were similar at the same refining step. Furthermore, the loss rate of neutralization and deodorization were much higher than that of degumming and bleaching for any kind of phytosterol of all oils. The range of loss rate of total phytosterols content of all oils during the degumming, neutralization, bleaching and deodorization were from 0.87 to 3.01%, 7.3 to 9.23%, 1.18 to 2.75% and 8.27 to 9.97%, respectively. A significant reduction in the phytosterols content of all oils during neutralization could be a result of micelle formation (free sterols and soap). In addition, the significant reduction in the phytosterols content of all oils during deodorization may be due to sterols esterification promoted by the deodorization temperature and a reduction in the free sterol content caused by distillation. The reduction of total and individual sterols in rapeseed oils after complete refining process were approximately 5–70% [
