<p class="p">The decrease of α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, δ-tocopherol and total tocopherols in different rapeseed oil varieties during the neutralization were from 6.21 to 10.01%, 8.71 to 14.52%, 13.70 to 29.12%, and 9.31 to 12.94%, respectively. The reduction might be due to the instability of tocols in the presence of air and alkali. Previous research [

This was probably owing to different varieties of vegetable oil.
