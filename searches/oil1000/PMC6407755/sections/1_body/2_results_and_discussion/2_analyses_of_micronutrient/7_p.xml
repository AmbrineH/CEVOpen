<p class="p">ORAC assays are often used for comparison to determine the antioxidant capacity of rapeseed oils at various stages of technological process [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The ORAC of five different kinds of crude rapeseed oils were from 99.29 to 134.45 Î¼mol TE /100g oil. The range of the loss rate of ORAC of all oils during neutralization (46.93 to 52.94%) was the highest, followed by the bleaching (19.93 to 31.25%), deodorization (12.84 to 34.74%) and degumming (0.81 to 5.09%). The reduction of ORAC during neutralization, bleaching and deodorization may be due to the removal of antioxidants [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], such as phytosterols, tocopherols, polyphenols and carotenoid. The loss of these antioxidants can have a strong negative influence on the oxidative stability of the oil.
