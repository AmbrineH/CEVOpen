 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> showed total and individual tocopherol contents of different rapeseed oil varieties at each step of refining process. The results have shown that γ-tocopherol is the most abundant tocopherol with the concentration from 217.39 μg/g (Fengyou 5103) to 291.32 μg/g (Zhongyou 6766) in crude oils, followed by α-tocopherol, from 89.26 μg/g (Zhongyou 6766) to 125.18μg/g (Fengyou 5103) A significant gradual degradation in tocopherol content was observed during each step of refining process, which was consistent with previous studies [
