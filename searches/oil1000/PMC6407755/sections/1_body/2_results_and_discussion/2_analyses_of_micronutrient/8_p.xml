 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> showed that deodorized temperature had affected percentage content of trans-linoleic and trans-linolenic significantly in all kinds of rapeseed oils. We found that there was no trans-linoleic generated at 190°C and 210 °C and no trans-linolenic generated as well at 190°C for each variety of deodorized rapeseed oil. Percentage content of trans fatty acid of deodorized oil of Douyou 8 was higher than that of other four kinds of rapeseed oils which might be due to variety difference of rapeseed oils. In addition, trans-linolenic had the faster growth rate than trans-linoleic acid with the increasing temperature, could be attributed to linolenic containing more carbon double bonds than linoleic, resulting in the much higher possibility of isomerization. Furthermore, the high deodorized temperature (250°C and 270°C) induced the percentage content of trans fatty acid increased much higher than that of low deodorization temperature (190°C, 210°C and 230°C) which indicated that isomerization of double bonds can be promoted under high temperature.
