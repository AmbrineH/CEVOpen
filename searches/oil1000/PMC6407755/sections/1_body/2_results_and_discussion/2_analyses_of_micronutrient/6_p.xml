 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> showed the β-carotene content of five different kinds of rapeseed oils at each refining step. The content of β-carotene of 5 different kinds of crude rapeseed oils was from 5.16 to 7.76 mg/kg oil. In this study, the loss rate of bleaching and deodorization were much higher than degumming and neutralization. β-carotene decreased from 77.05 to 88.91% due to adsorption of bleaching earth. Previous research reported greatest losses of β-carotene were observed when degummed rapeseed oil was bleached with 0.89% w/w acid activated bleaching clay, which caused decrease of β-carotene content by 73% [

Deodorization decreased β-carotene from 46.41 to 68.44%, which might be attributed to degradation during high temperature deodorization process. The different loss rate of all oils during deodorization could be owing to the difference of varieties of rapeseed oils.
