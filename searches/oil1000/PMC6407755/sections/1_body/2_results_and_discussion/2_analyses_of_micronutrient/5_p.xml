<p class="p">The role of polyphenols in inhibiting the decomposition of hydroperoxides is critical to maintaining food quality by reducing rancidity caused by aldehyde formation [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. We found that there was a remarkable decrease (4.83–6.19 to 1.35–2.45 mg GAE/100 g oil) after the whole refining process in the TPC of five different kinds of rapeseed oils, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. The range of loss of TPC of all oils during neutralization was from 47.93 to 61.19%, which was much higher than degumming (3.21 to 6.61%), bleaching (2.90 to 19.01%) and deodorization (4.81 to 16.62%). This was consistent with previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] in which phenolic compounds would be generally removed from oil after chemical neutralization. Additionally the marked decrease observed in the TPC contents after the neutralization was mainly due to more decrease in the contents of the free fatty acids and oxidized triglyceride monomers than that of the other polar compounds, resulting in the loss of phenolic substances [
