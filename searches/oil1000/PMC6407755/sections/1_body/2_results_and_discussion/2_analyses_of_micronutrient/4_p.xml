<p class="p">During the bleaching, the range of the loss rate of total tocopherols content of different rapeseed oil varieties was between 21.21 and 27.41%. This reduction could be attributed to the possible adsorption on bleaching clay. Previous research [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] reported bleaching could result in the decrease of about 17.4% of tocopherol content in rapeseed oil process. The loss rate of total tocopherols content of different rapeseed oil varieties (between 32.82 and 42.16%) was found the most during the deodorization, likely owing to the thermal degradation at high temperature or by chemical reaction during deodorization. Previous study reported the greatest losses of total tocopherol content in oils could be induced by physical refining (deodorization), amounting approximately to 20.2–27.1% [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and the deodorization step would cause 7–90% losses of tocopherols in rapeseed oils [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In previous study when the deodorizing operation was performed at 260°C, loss rate of tocopherol was up to 40–50% [
