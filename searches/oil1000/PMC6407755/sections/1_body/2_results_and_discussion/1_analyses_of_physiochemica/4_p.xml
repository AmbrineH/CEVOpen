<p class="p">Color is one of the physicochemical properties that represents the level of oil refining, which can affect consumer choice at somewhat. Carotenoids and chlorophyll are the main color pigments in vegetable oils. Oxidation of these compounds or reaction of oxidized triglycerides with carotenoids could cause oil darkening [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, the lightness increased from 90.35–91.58 to 99.54–102.19, the redness decreased from 2.77–5.48 to 2.46–4.93 and yellowness decreased from 126.49–133.93 to 6.95–18.25 in the whole refining process. However, the yellowness of oils of Huyou 4 (18.25) and Zhongshang 11 (15.69) after deodorization were higher than that of other 3 kinds oils (9.16–6.95). This could be attributed to the different varieties of seeds. Bleaching is the most important step for removing color because of activated bleaching earth [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In current research, the color of all oils could be removed completely after deodorization, probably owing to degradation of highly unsaturated carotenoids during deodorization.
