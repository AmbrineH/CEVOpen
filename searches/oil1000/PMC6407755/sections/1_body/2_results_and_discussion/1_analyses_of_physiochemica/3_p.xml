 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> showed the whole refining process decreased the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV of five different kinds of crude rapeseed oils significantly (2.57–1.71, before refining; 1.78–0.99, after refining). It was noteworthy that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV of five kinds of crude rapeseed oils were significantly reduced during degumming step (from 2.57–1.71 to 1.98–1.13), whereas neutralization and bleaching step led to significant increase of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV of all kinds of rapeseed oils (from 1.98–1.13 to 2.76–1.98), which could be owing to decomposition of the hydroperoxides and formation of secondary oxidation products, such as aldehydes and ketones because of catalytic properties of acid-activated bleaching earth.
