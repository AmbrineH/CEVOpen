 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. The AV of five different kinds of crude rapeseed oils were from 2.15 to 3.59 mg KOH/g and decreased significantly after neutralization, ranging from 0.29 to 0.45 mg KOH/g. The AVs significantly decreased after neutralization, probably due to the adding of NaOH that led to the formation of sodium soaps in oil [

 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, the slight increase (0.29–0.45 to 0.39–0.60 mg KOH/g) of the AV of five different kinds of neutralized rapeseed oils during bleaching was observed probably due to the ester hydrolysis caused by the bleaching earth. Then, the deodorization decreased the AV of all kinds of rapeseed oils again. According to previous study, this decrease was due to the volatilization of FFA as deodorization was a process of vacuum-steam distillation [
