 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212879.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>, degumming-neutralization increased the PV significantly, while bleaching and deodorization decreased the PV of all kinds of rapeseed oils significantly. The increase of PV of all kinds of crude rapeseed oils (3.57–5.40 to 5.11–6.83 mmol/kg) during degumming-neutralization could be attributed to the generation of the primary oxidation products caused by lipoxygenases, air, heat, moisture, and light activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Furthermore, a significant decrease of PV of bleaching oils in varieties (5.11–6.83 to 3.17–5.01 mmol/kg) after neutralization can be attributed to the absorbance and catalysis of peroxide compounds by bleaching earth. Finally, deodorization significantly decreased the PV of all kinds of bleached rapeseed oils, which might be attributed to the volatilization and further decomposition of peroxides caused by the high temperature. Previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] indicated that the PV of oils was closely related to the operational parameters of deodorization, such as temperature, heating time, and steam rate.
