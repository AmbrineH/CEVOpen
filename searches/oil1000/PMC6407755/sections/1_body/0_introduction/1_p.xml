<p class="p">Rapeseed oil is a major source of vegetable oil in the world. Its production is estimated at 27.71 million metric tons, the third just behind palm and soybean oil, supporting the 2018 official data of United States Department of Agriculture. Rapeseed oil contains around 1.5–6% palmitic acid, around 0.5–3.1% stearic acid, around 28% oleic acid, around 11–23% linoleic acid, and around 5–13% linolenic acid. It is characterized by the ideal content of polyunsaturated fatty acid due to the ratio (2:1) of linoleic acid (n-6) and linolenic acid (n-3) fatty acid. On the other hand, the rapeseed oil contains many active biological compounds such as phytosterols, tocopherol, phenolic compounds, β-carotene [
