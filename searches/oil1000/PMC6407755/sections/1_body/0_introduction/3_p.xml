<p class="p">In the last decades, many researchers have focused on the evaluation of influence of different compositional parameters on quality and stability of vegetable oils. For instance, Klara Kraljic´ explored changes in phenolic compounds during specific refining process of rapeseed oil [

 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Jia Wei optimized refining method for the most suitable temperatures to retain several essential fatty acids and bioactive compounds in the tea seed oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Although many researchers have investigated the physicochemical properties of rapeseed oil, there is still a lack of information on the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability as it relates to different rapeseed varieties during refining process.
