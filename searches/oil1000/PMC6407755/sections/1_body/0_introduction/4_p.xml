<p class="p">The need for a more comprehensive study for the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of rapeseed varieties available in the marketplace is crucial. Thus, the first objective of this work was to investigate the physicochemical properties of five different kinds of rapeseed oils during different stages of traditional refining process; secondly, the study aims to broaden knowledge and provide helpful data for the future optimization of the traditional oil refining process without affecting the desirable compounds.</p>
