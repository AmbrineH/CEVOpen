<p class="p">Phosphatides, free fatty acids, odiferous volatiles, colourant, waxes and metal compounds, which are undesirable materials in crude rapeseed oil products, have adverse effects on physicochemical properties, sensory characteristics, and storage stability of the rapeseed oil. Towards this, the crude rapeseed oil needs refining treatments to remove undesirable ingredients and produce higher quality oils [

 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Traditional rapeseed oil refining processes generally involve four successive operations: neutralization, degumming, bleaching and deodorization. Although the traditional chemical refining processes are useful to remove the majority of these unwanted components and could achieve the desired color and a mild taste, micronutrients such as tocopherol, phytosterols, β-carotene and phenolic compounds will have at somewhat loss during the refining process, and antioxidant activity of oil will change as well. Moreover the oxidation of lipid and its associated substances, lipid degradation products, toxic and harmful substances will exist in the oil products during the refining process and then affect the quality and function of products [
