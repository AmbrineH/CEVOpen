<p class="p">The ORAC assay was performed according to previous procedure [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], with minor modifications. The reaction was performed in 75 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the final assay volume was 200 μL. Briefly, 20 μL of the sample (Methanol extraction of oil) and 120 μL of a 70 nM fluorescein solution (final concentration of 0.96 μM) were placed in 96-well plates. The mixture was held at 37 °C for 20 min. Next, 20 μL of 119 mM AAPH was added to each well. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a SpectraMax M2e microplate reader at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 538 nm for 35 cycles at 5 min intervals. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using SoftMax Pro software (version 5.4.1) from which the blank was then subtracted to obtain the net AUC. The linear regression equation for the net AUC versus the concentration of RAP was calculated. The final ORAC values were expressed as μmol TE (Trolox equivalent)/100g oil.
