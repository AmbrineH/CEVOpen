<p class="p">The content of phytosterol was analyzed according to previous procedure with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. A 200 mg of rapeseed oil was mixed with 4mL potassium hydroxide ethanol solution (2mol/L) and shaken in a water bath at 90°C for 1h for saponification. When samples were cooled down to room temperature, 5 mL of n-hexane and 1 mL of deionized water were added and mixed vigoursly to extract the unsaponifiable matter. The supernatant was pooled again by the same procedure. Extraction solution was blown dry by nitrogen. 200 μL BSTFA-TMCS(99:1) was added into sample, and then the sample was shaken in a water bath at 99°C for 20min for derivatization. At last the sample was diluted to 2 mL by adding n-hexane for detection. Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (Agilent Technologies 7890B-7000C, USA), equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies). The split ratio was 30:1. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The temperatures of injector, transfer line, ion source, and quadrupole mass filter were set at 270, 280, 230, and 150°C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 180°Cto 280°C at 10°C/min and held for 15 min. The solvent delay time was 3 min. The electron ionization voltage was 70 eV and the ion scan range was 50–500 amu. The concentration of each phytosterol was expressed as μg/g oil.
