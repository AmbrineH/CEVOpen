<p class="p">To isolate and quantify β-carotene, we used the procedure described by Gimeno [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], and made some modifications. 200 mg of rapeseed oil and 4 mL potassium hydroxide ethanol solution (2mol/L) were accurately added into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Then the centrifuge tube was shaken at 80°C for 1h for saponification. After the samples cooled down, 5 mL of n-hexane and 1 mL of deionized water were added to 50mL centrifuge tube to extract the unsaponifiable matter (spiral shock for 2 min and then centrifuged to obtain the supernatant). The organic phases obtained were evaporated to the dry fraction using a rotavaporat at 40 °C. The residue was brought to dryness with nitrogen and then re-dissolved in methanol. In this process, the chromatographic injection must be performed as fast as possible to avoid the oxidation and decomposition of the β-carotene. The β-carotene content of the samples was expressed as mg/ 100g oil.
