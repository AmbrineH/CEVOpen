<p class="p">Content of tocopherols was measured according to a previous procedure [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, 0.2g of each samples were dissolved into 5 mL methanol. After centrifugation for 10 min and the supernatant (10 μL) was injected into the HPLC system (Agilent Technologies1260, USA) equipped with a ultraviolet detector on a C18 column (250mm×4.6mm, i.d., 5μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies). A mixture of acetonitrile-water (90:10 v/v) at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min (isocratically) was used as a mobile phase. Absorbance was measured at λ
 <sub class="sub">292</sub> nm. Different tocopherol species were identified by comparing their retention times to those of α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherol mixed standard. An external standard method was employed for quantification and the content was expressed as μg/g oil.
