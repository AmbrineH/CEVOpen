<p class="p">Fatty acid composition was determined using the method in a previous study with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="pone.0212879.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. A 50 mg of oil was dissolved in 2 mL of 3M methanolic potassium hydroxide. The mixture was then vigorously vibrated for 180s and placed into a water bath at 50°C for 30min. After conversion of fatty acid methyl ester was completed, 5 mL hexane was added into mixture. The mixture was vigorously vibrated for 180s and allowed to stand for 5min for the upper layer to become clear. The supernatant was purified using a 0.22-μm filter and then analyzed on an Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (Agilent Technologies 7890B-7000C, USA), equipped with a HP-innowax column (30m× 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies) with a split ratio of 10:1. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. The temperatures of injector, transfer line, ion source, and quadrupole mass filter were set at 260, 280, 200, and 150°C, respectively. The oven temperature program of the DB-5 column was held at 140°C for 5 min and was then increased to 240°C at a rate of 4°C/min, where it was held for 30 min. The solvent delay time was 5 min. The electron ionization voltage was 70 eV and the ion scan range was 50–550 amu. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were analyzed in GC-MS for identification of different components.
