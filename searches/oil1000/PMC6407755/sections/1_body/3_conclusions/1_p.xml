<p class="p">Considering comprehensively, the neutralization stage and the deodorization stage have the greatest influence on the micronutrients and antioxidant activity of rapeseed oil, followed by the bleaching stage, and the least affected is the degumming stage. A similar trend was observed for the AV, PV and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV changes of the oils in varieties during refining process, which indicates that there was no significant difference between these chemical properties of rapeseed oil in varieties. Content of phytosterols, tocopherols, TPC, Î²-carotene and ORAC did not show clear trends for any of the different rapeseed oil varieties, either. This study provides a scientific basis for the necessity of moderate refining of rapeseed oil in actual industrial production.
