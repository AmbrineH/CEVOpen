<p class="p">Methylation of polyfunctional compounds in oil samples was carried out using the method of Lelacheur et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] with slight modification. Briefly, 0.25 µL of 14% BF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/MeOH was added to each 0.1 mL oil sample in 22 mL glass vials (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and heated for a minimum of 1 h at 70 °C. Tubes were then allowed to cool for approximately 20 min. When tubes reached ambient temperature, 3.0 mL of double distilled water (DDW) and 3.0 mL of n-hexane were added to each tube followed by vortex-mixing for 15 s. After centrifugation at 3200× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 4 min, the upper n-hexane layer was quantitatively transferred to a 15 mL plastic tube. Each sample was extracted thrice using the above-mentioned procedure. The supernatant fractions were hereafter flushed with nitrogen for ~5 min and dry residues stored in a low-temperature chamber “VTK 201 V” (Holod-MSK, Moscow, Russia) at −18 ± 1 °C until analysis, a maximum of two weeks. Directly prior to GC/MS analysis, a 0.1 g of each oil sample (FAMEs) was reconstituted with 1 mL of pyridine.
