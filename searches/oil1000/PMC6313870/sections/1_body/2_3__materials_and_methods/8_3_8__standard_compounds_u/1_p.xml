<p class="p">Methyl heptadecanoic acid for FAMEs, Î³-linoleic acid for FFAs and glycidyl fatty acid esters, 1-octadecanol for aliphatic alcohols, dodecanal for aldehydes, n-tetracosane for alkanes, and ergosterol for phytosterols and triterpenes. Least squares regression analysis was implemented, using the peak area ratios against increasing standard concentrations to obtain calibration linearity (y = ax + b, where b is gradient of the slope and a is intercept point at
