 <xref rid="B52-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Crab and dessert apple pomace oils (0.1 g) were diluted in 2-propanol to a volume of 10 mL and filtered through an MS
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> nylon syringe filter with 0.22 µm pore size (Membrane Solutions, Plano, TX, USA) into 1.5 mL glass vials and immediately analyzed using the HPLC system. The chromatographic separation was carried out using the Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a pump (LC-10ADvp), a degasser (DGU-14A), a low-pressure gradient unit (FCV-10ALvp), a system controller (SCL-10Avp), an auto injector (SIL-10AF), a column oven (CTO-10ASvp), a fluorescence detector (RF-10AXL) and a Luna PFP column (3 µm, 150 × 4.6 mm) with a guard column (4 mm × 3 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The analysis was done using the following conditions: mobile phase methanol:water (93:7;
