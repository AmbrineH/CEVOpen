<p class="p">Prior to analysis, the microorganism colonies were suspended in Mueller Hilton broth (MHB, Ref. 4017412, Biolife, Milano, Italy) and the suspension was adjusted using the DEN-1B McFarland Tube Densitometer (Grant Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom), to the final turbidity of 0.5 McFarland units which corresponds to 10

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The negative control consisted of DMSO, MHB, and test cultures. For the broth microdilution test, 100 µL of each bacterial suspension in broth medium was added in each well already containing 100 µL of two-fold serially diluted plant extract. The final volume in each well was 300 µL. Viability of the bacterial cell was visualized using 30 μL/well of 0.01% resazurin aqueous solution. The plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The MIC values were identified as the lowest concentration in which no viable bacterial were observed.
