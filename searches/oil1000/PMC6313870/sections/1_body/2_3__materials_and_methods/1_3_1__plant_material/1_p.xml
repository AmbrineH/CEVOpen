 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-07-00090" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). Dessert apples of cv. “Gita” (as a reference for comparison) were harvested in Institute of Horticulture (Dobele, Latvia), GPS location: N: 56°36′35.0″; E: 23°17′58.7″ on 13 September 2017 (starch-iodine test—4.8 points from total 10). The ripening stage of “Gita” fruit was assessed using a starch-iodine test [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], while crab apples were harvested at ~121 days after full bloom. The apple trees were cultivated in soils, varying from haplic luvisol (super eutric) to luvisol (hypereutric), while the soil texture, varying from poorly podzolic sandy loam to loamy soil. The integrated growing system and a planting distance of 3 m × 4 m for crab apple trees and 5 m × 3 m for “Gita” apple trees, without irrigation system was used. Grass was mowed several times (~6) during the growing season and the rows were treated with herbicides in the initial part of the vegetation season. Cultivar “Gita” apple trees were grafted on the rootstock B9 and grown in the orchard according to the integrated system using the same conditions. Crab apple fruit were picked from 10 randomly selected eight-year-old trees, while “Gita” fruit were picked from 10 randomly selected seven-year-old trees. About 0.7 ± 0.1 kg of each crab and 1.5 kg of dessert apple fruit were harvested (between 11:00 and 15:00 local time) and transported immediately (within 1 h) to the laboratory of the Institute of Horticulture. All apple fruit were carefully mixed, frozen in a freezer “PORKKA BF 710” (Porkka, Lahti, Finland) at –25 ± 1 °C. Frozen fruits were packed in polypropylene bags (1–1.5 kg in each) and stored in a low-temperature chamber “VTK 201 V” (Holod-MSK, Moscow, Russia) at −18 ± 1 °C until analysis, a maximum of 10 weeks. The juice from apple fruit was obtained (after frozen fruit were thawed to ambient temperature −22 ± 1 °C) using a Voran 60 K basket press at a pressure of 300 bars (Voran Maschinen GmbH, Pichl bei Wels, Austria). Pomace (consisting of stems, seeds, flesh, skin) after juice pressing were gradually freeze-dried using a FreeZone freeze-dry system (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) at −51 ± 1 °C under vacuum of 0.055–0.065 mbar for 20 h, further milled (0.5 mm particle size) using a variable speed rotor mill Pulverisette 14 (Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). The moisture content of samples was measured gravimetrically at 103 ± 2 °C using the method of Ruiz [

Samples intended for the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), free fatty acids (FFAs) and phytosterols were packed into Mylar bags (foil Mylar zip-lock bags, thickness 3 mm, New York, NY, USA), frozen (−18 °C) and delivered directly to the laboratory of the University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia.
