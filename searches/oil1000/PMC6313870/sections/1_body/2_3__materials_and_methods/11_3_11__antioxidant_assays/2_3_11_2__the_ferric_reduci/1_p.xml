<p class="p">Free reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was determined using the method of Radenkovs et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The FRAP reagent was prepared daily from 300 mL sodium acetate buffer (0.3 mol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; pH 3.6), 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of HCl and FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (20 mmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The three solutions were mixed together at the ratio of 10:1:1 (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) or double distilled water (DDW) for blanks (100 µL) were mixed with FRAP reagent (3.6 mL). The change in absorbance from red to blue was followed at 593 nm after 10 min. A Trolox calibration curve was done between 0.1 and 1.0 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The absorbance results were converted using a calibration curve of the standard and expressed as mmol Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity per mL
