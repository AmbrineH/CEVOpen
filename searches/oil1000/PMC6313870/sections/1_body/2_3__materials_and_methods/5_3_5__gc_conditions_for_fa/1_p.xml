<p class="p">The analysis of FAMEs was carried out on a Clarus 580 system PerkinElmer, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a quadrupole analyzer Clarus SQ 8 C mass-selective detector (Waltham, MA, USA). All analyses of FAMEs were done using Omegawax 250 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) column with a stationary phase of intermediate polarity (30 m × 0.25 mm, sorbent thickness—0.25 μm). The injector temperature has been set to +280 °C; automatic injection using an autosampler, injection volume 0.5 μL; split ration 4:1. The initial oven temperature was maintained at 75 °C for 2 min, then raised to 150 °C (rate of 20 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), then increased to 270 °C (rate of 4 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Helium (ultra-high purity 5.0 grade—99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at the initial flow rate of 2.0 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and then held constant at 1.0 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with the split ratio 4:1. The total separation time was 35.75 min.
