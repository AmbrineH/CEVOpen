<p class="p">After silylation using the method of Lelacheur et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], oils were analyzed using the above-mentioned GC system. All analyses of the silylated derivatives were done using an Elite-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. and film thickness of 0.25 μm, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The injector temperature was set to +290 °C; automatic injection using an autosampler, injection volume 1.0 μL; split ratio 4:1. The initial oven temperature was maintained at 75 °C for 2 min, then raised to 130 °C (rate of 20 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and after at a rate of 4 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> increased to 310 °C, followed by an isothermal operation for 5 min. Helium (ultra-high purity 5.0 grade—99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at the initial flow rate of 2.0 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 0.5 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and then followed by a constant flow at 1.0 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The total separation time was 54.75 min.
