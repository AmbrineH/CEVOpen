<p class="p">Soxhlet extraction was done using the method of Abdolshahi et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] with slight modification. Triplicate samples about of 10 g of freeze-dried and finely ground pomace were accurately weighted in extraction thimbles (Whatman single thickness, 33 × 94 mm). Further, the thimbles placed inside the extraction chambers and submitted to a Soxhlet extraction using the system B-811 (BÜCHI Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland), which is fully automated. The samples were extracted using 100 mL of petroleum ether for 3 h. Sufficient heat (Soxhlet warm extraction at 70 °C) was used to give about 10 cycles of solvent per h. At the end of the extraction, oil samples were dried to release the solvent from oil extracts (using the above-mentioned Soxhlet system), further Soxhlet beakers were placed in a desiccator to cool and weighted to determine the yield of crude oil. Oil samples were transferred to 15 mL plastic tubes (Sarstedt AG &amp; Co. KG, Nümbrecht, Germany) and stored at −18 ± 1 °C until analysis, a maximum of two weeks.
