<p class="p">Dessert apple fruits as well as their by-products have been studied in terms of their chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], along with their positive health effects [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, rather little is known concerning the lipophilic composition of crab apples. Crab apples, also known as wild apples, belong to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Malus</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Rosaceae</italic> family) and are currently used not only for ornamental purposes, but also are one of the most important source of seeds with an increased concentration of all four homologs of tocopherol (α, β, γ and δ) [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], and hydrophilic antioxidant substances for the food and cosmetic industries [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Food industries have been increasingly focused on developing high-quality food products with increased functionality, therefore crab apples have gained an increasing interest in the last decades [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Crab apples are used in the preparation of jellies, jams, beverages, and wines [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Dadwal et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] found that extracts obtained from either pulp or seeds of Himalayan crab apple fruits (
 <italic class="italic">M. baccata</italic>) not only contained moderate concentrations of polyphenols (phloretin and phloridzin), but also fatty acid molecules such as palmitic acid, ethyl palmitate, methyl petroselinate and linolein, which are well recognized for medicinal uses [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Moreover, Górnaś et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported that the apple seeds recovered from dessert and crab apple are a promising source of oils, which also contain phytosterols, mainly β-sitosterol.
