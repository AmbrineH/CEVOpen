<p class="p">In contrast to our data, some reports have shown significantly better susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to antimicrobial agents recovered from different plant extracts, however these utilized different inoculum concentrations (in particular 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. It was proposed previously that increasing the inoculum concentration from 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> to ≥ 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> may cause a reduction in bactericidal activity of all the antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The results of this approach show that the growth of pathogenic bacteria probably was influenced by the chemical composition of pomace oils, particularly linoleic and oleic acids [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which were found to be dominant representatives of pomace oils from

 <italic class="italic">Malus</italic> spp. is highly recommended.
