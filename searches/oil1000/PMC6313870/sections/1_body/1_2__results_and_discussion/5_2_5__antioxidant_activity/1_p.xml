<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of tested oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Malus</italic> apple fruit was studied by radical scavenging capacity using the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> method, while the ascertainment of total antioxidant capacity was done using the FRAP method. The DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> radical scavenging capacity of the apple pomace oils shows values ranging between 0.5 and 2.4 mmol TAEC mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, with 
 <italic class="italic">M.</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">soulardii</italic> having higher values, while crab apple 
 <italic class="italic">M.</italic> cv. “Ola” having the lowest. Comparable results were reported by Prescha et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] where flax (
 <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic>) and rose hip (
 <italic class="italic">Rosa rugosa</italic>) oils were characterized as the strongest contributors to antioxidant activity using the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> radicals. The results of scavenging capacity assay using the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> radicals did not show correlation between the total bound FAs (FAMEs) (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.2191) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00090-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A), Ts (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.0086) or carotenoids (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.2306) in apple pomace oils. In addition, a strong negative correlation was found between FFAs (silyl derivatives) and DPPH (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.7206), while a moderate positive correlation was found between FFAs and DPPH values (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.6581). The opposite results were obtained in a study by Tuberoso et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], where the correlation between the total content of Ts in different commercial oils and scavenging of the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> radical was R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.7000. The data from FRAP assay were significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and no correlation was found with the DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>. The results showed that the oil recovered from 
 <italic class="italic">M.</italic> cv. “Ola” is more active compared with other oils. Generally, the only positive and strong correlation (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.8732) was found between the bound FAs and FRAP (
