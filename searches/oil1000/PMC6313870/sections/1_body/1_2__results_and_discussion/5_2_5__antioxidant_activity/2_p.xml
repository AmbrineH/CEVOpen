<p class="p">The results of this study show that the different constituents, as well as testing systems, may affect the capacity of oils to quench different radicals. A similar result was reported previously by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], pointing out that some compounds, which have ABTS radicals scavenging activity, do not show DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup> activity. Moreover, Radenkovs et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] proposed that radical scavenging (DPPH
 <sup class="sup">•</sup>) with each compound is an independent process, the overall success of which depends predominantly on the chemical structure of a particular biologically active compound, rather than on the concentration.
