<p class="p">Eleven biologically active compounds, five phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, isofucosterol, and ∆7-avenasterol) and six triterpenes (squalene, α-amyrin, lupeol, 24-methylenecycloartanol, uvaol, and ursolic aldehyde), were successfully identified and quantified in the tested pomace oils. β-Sitosterol was the prevalent compound found in all tested pomace oils with a percentage distribution of 10.3–94.5%. The second dominant compound was campesterol, where the percentage distribution varied in the range 0.1–4.6%. With regard to the

However, a minor difference in phytosterols profiles and ratios may be due to the different solvents used for the extraction of phytochemicals, as well as environmental factors and agricultural practices applied during the growing season.
