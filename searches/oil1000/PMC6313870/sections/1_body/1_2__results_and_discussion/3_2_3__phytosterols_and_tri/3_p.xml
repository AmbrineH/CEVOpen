<p class="p">Among the analyzed triterpenes, lupeol and uvaol were found to be dominant compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">M.</italic> crab apples, varying in the range of 0.1–66.3% and 0.2–68.9%, respectively. Recent reports indicate the presence of dietary lupeol as a constituent of vegetables and fruit including 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica oleracea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic> spp. 
 <italic class="italic">Cucumis sativus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, and of fruits such as 
 <italic class="italic">Olea</italic> spp. 
 <italic class="italic">Ficus carica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Mangifera indica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fragaria</italic> spp. and

 <xref rid="B26-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The recent finding revealed that lupeol with no toxicity is a therapeutic and chemopreventive agent for the treatment of inflammation and cancer [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The same statement was proved by Siddique and Saleem [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], pointing out that lupeol is pharmacologically effective in treating various diseases under preclinical settings regardless of the type of administration. The results of this study suggest that the crab apple pomace oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Malus</italic> spp., especially 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. Berzukroga dzeltenais and 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. cv. “Ola” to be considered as a good source of lupeol which could be incorporated as ingredients in making of high-value functional food products with many of physiological and biochemical effects.
