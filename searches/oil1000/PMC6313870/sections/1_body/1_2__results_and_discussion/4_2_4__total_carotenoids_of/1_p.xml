<p class="p">While carotenoids are assumed to be present in dessert and crab apple, lemon, grape, mango, melon, and seed oils [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], there have been no reports on quantification specifically of crab apple pomace oils consisting of stems, seeds, flesh, and skin. The results show that the content of carotenoids was found higher in oil recovered from the pomace of yellow crab apple Berzukroga dzeltenais, while the lowest in oil extracted from the pomace of “Bernu prieks” apple, where the concentrations were 14.5 and 5.1 mg mL

 <xref rid="B36-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and significantly higher than reported in quince and sunflower seed oils by Fromm et al. [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], mean dietary intake required for beta-carotene to benefit from the preventive health potential are estimated to be 2–4 mg/day, thus showing that between ~0.2178 and ~0.4356 mg per day of crab apple pomace oil would ensure the necessary recommended daily dose amount of beta-carotene.
