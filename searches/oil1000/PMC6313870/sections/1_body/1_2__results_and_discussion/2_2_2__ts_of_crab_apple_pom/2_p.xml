<p class="p">The first in vivo model assessing the antineoplastic activity of Ts has shown that δ-tocopherol to be the most active homolog compared with α- or γ-T in inhibiting tumor growth, perhaps through trapping reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and inducing apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The authors noted that the seed oils obtained from dessert apple seed oils were characterized by higher contents of Ts (19.1–37.9 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> oil) when compared to seed oils recovered from crab apples (13.0–20.3 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The average ratios of calculated amounts of Ts in crab and dessert apple seed oils were as follows:

Moreover, the results of this study might be useful for cosmetics companies specializing in the development/production of natural skin-care products.
