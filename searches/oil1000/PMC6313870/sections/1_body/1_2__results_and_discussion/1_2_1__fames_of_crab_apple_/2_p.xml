<p class="p">Seventeen FAs in the form of methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified and quantified, among which the dominance of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly linoleic acid (from 43.0 to 57.8%), followed by oleic acid (19.4–25.5%), was found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-07-00090-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Among the saturated fatty acids, representatives such as palmitic acid (8.7–13.0%) were prevalent among the crab apple oils. Furthermore, similar concentrations of FAs were found in commercial pumpkin and soybean oils [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-07-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], where the concentration of linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acid among the FAs amounted to 47.1%, 34.1%, and 10.7% and 50.8%, 24.6%, and 10.2% of the total FAs, respectively. In addition, a similar distribution of FAs, in particular unsaturated fatty acids recovered from apple by-products, which represented ~90% of the total fatty acids has been previously reported [
