Considering the content of oxygenated fatty acids in oils, 9,10-dihydroxystearate was the only representative, and found in small amounts (&lt;0.1% total lipids). This low amount may be due to the relatively high content of Ts responsible for protecting the oil against oxidation [

Among the aliphatic alcohols, nonacosan-10-ol was the dominant compound identified in all tested pomace oils, varying in the range of 78.8–90.0%.
