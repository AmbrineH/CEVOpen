<p class="p">On the basis of our results, we can conclude that seasonal fluctuations periodically impact on the production of the constituents in medicinal plants, and also likely influence their therapeutic efficiency. Our study reveals that 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> plants show a rhythmic increase in oil production throughout the growing season and decline towards the winter. Hence, late summer can be the best time for collecting 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> plants. The present study reveals the presence of bioactive compounds, the antioxidant activity, and the free radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic>. Thus, this study supports the use of 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> against various ailments. More bioactive compounds present in EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. calamus</italic> may warrant further characterisation.
