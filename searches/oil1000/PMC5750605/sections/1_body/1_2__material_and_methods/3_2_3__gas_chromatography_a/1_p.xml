<p class="p">GC and GC/MS analyses of all the oils were performed on a Thermo Fischer GC apparatus using an DB5-5MS fused-silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) equipped with a flame ionization (FID) detector. GC/MS analysis of the different essential oil samples were performed using a GC MS-QP 2010, in the following conditions. Column DB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness; J&amp;W Scientific, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA); carrier gas: helium, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injection temperature: 250 °C; oven temperature programme: initial temperature 80 °C, isothermal for 2 min, RAMP 7 °C/min, final temperature 280 °C, and isothermal for 10 °C/min. Ionization mode: EI (70 eV), mass range: 40–6500 amu. The compounds were identified with the help of NIST-MS, FFNSC Wiley Library, and comparing the data with literature reports and GC retention indices [
