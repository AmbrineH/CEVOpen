 <xref rid="B35-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Briefly, the tested samples (5–25 μL/mL) were added to 5 mL of a 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH. Finally, the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. Ascorbic acid was used as the standard antioxidant. Inhibition of free radical by DPPH in percent (IC %) was calculated using the equation. IC% = (A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = the absorbance value of the control sample, A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> = the absorbance value of the test sample, and IC = inhibitory concentration. The radical scavenging activities of essential oils were discussed in terms of their IC
