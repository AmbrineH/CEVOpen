<p class="p">The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of essential oils might be due to different altitudes, environmental conditions, and the developmental stage/season of the plant materials, which is in agreement with results reported earlier [

 <xref rid="B42-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In terms of class composition, the monoterpenoids in ACLEO from all three accessions in four different seasons ranged from 0.2 to 15.7%, mainly represented by limonene,

Similarly, in ACREO the monoterpenoids ranged from 0.1 to 9.5%, and sesquiterpenoids from 0.6 to 9.4%, while phenyl propanoids ranged from 60.8 to 82.4% in three accessions for the four seasons. The essential oil composition of rhizomes from our laboratory has already been reported. The essential oil was found to possess significant antibacterial and antihelmintic activity [

 <xref rid="B44-medicines-04-00081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] have also reported acoramone and phenylpropane derivatives like

The components reported earlier were also identified, besides some other constituents, but in different quantities. Seasonal along with altitudinal variation in both rhizomes (ACREO) and the aerial part (ACLEO) are reported here for the first time, demonstrating the qualitative and quantitative diversity of constituents in the essential oils of
