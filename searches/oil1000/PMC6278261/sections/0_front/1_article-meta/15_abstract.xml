 <p class="p">The effect of the addition of ionic liquids (ILs) during the hydrodistillation of 
  <italic class="italic">Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt. (nutmeg) essential oil was studied. The essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">M. fragrans</italic> is characterized by the presence of terpenes, terpenoids, and of phenylpropanoids, such as methyl eugenol and safrole, that are regarded as genotoxic and carcinogenic. The aim of the work was to determine the best ionic liquid to improve the yield of the extraction of 
  <italic class="italic">M. fragrans</italic> essential oil and decrease the extraction of toxic phenylpropanoids. Six ILs, namely 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride (
  <bold class="bold">1</bold>), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate (
  <bold class="bold">2</bold>), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride (
  <bold class="bold">3</bold>), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate (
  <bold class="bold">4</bold>), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (
  <bold class="bold">5</bold>), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate (
  <bold class="bold">6</bold>), were prepared by previously reported, innovative methods and then tested. An experimental design was used to optimize the extraction yield and to decrease the phenylpropanoids percentage using the synthesized ILs. The influence of the molarity of ILs was also studied. MODDE 12 software established 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as the best co-solvent for the hydrodistillation of 
  <italic class="italic">M. fragrans</italic> essential oil.
