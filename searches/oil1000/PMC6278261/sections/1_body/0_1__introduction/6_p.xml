<p class="p">The aims of the present study were (i) to evaluate the suitability of ILs as co-solvents for the extraction of 
 <italic class="italic">Myristica fragrans</italic> EO, (ii) to study the effect of IL’s structure on the yield and composition of the EO extraction, and (iii) to optimize IL’s hydrodistillation using a design of experiment (DoE) approach.
