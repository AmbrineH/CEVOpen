 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In a 250 mL round bottom flask, 21 mL of 1-methyl imidazole (0.263 mol) and 33.4 mL of trimethylphosphate (0.289 mol) were added. The mixture was stirred under heating (100 °C) for 24 h; then, it was washed with Et
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O after cooling to remove residual TMP. The product 1,3-dimethylimidazoium dimethylphosphate was obtained in 95% yield (55.5 g).
