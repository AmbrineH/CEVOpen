 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In a 250 mL round bottom flask immersed in an ice bath, 10 g of 1-methylimidazole was placed, and 10 mL of HCl (37% aqueous solution) was slowly added. After 20 min, the solvent was evaporated to yield the desired ionic liquid, 1-methylimidazolium chloride, to be used in the following step without further purification. In a Q-tube reactor, 3.0 g of 1-methylimidazolium chloride and 2.28 g of dimethyl carbonate (DMC; 0.025 mmol) were placed, and the mixture was heated at 170 °C for two hours to yield the desired product, 1,3-dimethyl imidazolium chloride
