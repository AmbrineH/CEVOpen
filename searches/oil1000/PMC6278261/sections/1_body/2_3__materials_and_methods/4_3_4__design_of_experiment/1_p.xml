<p class="p">The MODDE v.12 software for Design of Experiments (DOE) and Optimization software (Sartorius Stedim, Malmo, Sweden) was used to optimise the extraction conditions. Three independent variables (factors), namely nature of the cation, nature of the anion, ratio ILs:water (molarity), at two levels and three replicates at the center point were studied. The two response variables studied were extraction yield and phenylpropanoids percentage in the oil. Eighteen experiments (N) were designed by the software. All the experiments were randomly performed with two replicates. To obtain the optimal conditions the model was fitted with PLS (Partial Least Squares) analysis.</p>
