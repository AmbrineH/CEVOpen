<p class="p">In the present work, we studied the influence of different MIM-based ILs on the extraction yield and composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fragrans</italic> EO. The optimum conditions for IL-assisted extraction were studied using a DoE (design of experiment) approach. Under the optimized conditions (extraction with water–IL 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> 0.5 M), an increase in the total yield (from 0.86% to 1.33%) was observed; furthermore, a reduction of 35% of the toxic phenylpropanoids was observed. Water–IL 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> extraction mixture was recovered and reused for three additional times, making this procedure even more convenient.
