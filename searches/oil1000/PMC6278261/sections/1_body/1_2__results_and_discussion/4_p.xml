<p class="p">To study the influence of ILs on the composition of the hydrodistilled EO, a traditional hydrodistillation of nutmeg was first performed using a 1:10 ratio of plant material and water and two, three, and four hours of distillation time. Using this procedure, we obtained an EO with a 0.86, 0.87, and 0.87% yield, respectively. As the yield of the extraction did not improve when the extraction time was extended, we decided to choose two hours as the extraction time. The essential oil obtained with these conditions was characterized by a high amount of phenylpropanoids (74.32%), of which 57.91% was constituted by myristicin and 2.90% by safrole. Since it has been described in literature that a presence of an inorganic salt in the extraction water could enhance the efficiency of the hydrodistillation process [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], we also used a 0.5 M solution of NaCl as reference electrolyte solution. The related yield was actually an intermediate value (0.98%) between that obtained using only water and those obtained using ILs. Neverthless, the composition of EO did not show a decrease in the percentage of phenylpropanoids (
