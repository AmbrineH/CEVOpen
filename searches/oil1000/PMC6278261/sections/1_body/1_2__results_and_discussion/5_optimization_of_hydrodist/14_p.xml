<p class="p">In order to further improve the new protocol for the extraction of nutmeg EO with a low content of phenylpropanoids, the possibility of recycling and reusing the IL was exploited. The waterâ€“IL 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> suspension used in a first extraction run was then collected after the removal of the organic matrix and reused three times. The yields and compositions of EO were analyzed for each run as reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02817-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, and no noticeable change in yield or in the amount of phenylpropanoids was detected; therefore, recycling of the extraction mixture is possible for at least three times.
