<p class="p">A plausible explanation for the selective hydrodistillation of monoterpenes over phenylpropanoid components when a water–ILs mixture is used as a solvent could be found in the π–π stacking interaction between the MIM-based ionic liquids and the aromatic moiety of phenylpropanoids. It has been reported in literature [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] that ionic liquids with a 1,3-dimethyl-imidazolium cation could form clathrates in the presence of aromatic molecules; therefore, we can reasonably assume that an interaction occurs in solution between the ILs and the phenylpropanoid molecules that prevents, at least to some extent, their evaporation and recovery in the essential oil.
