<p class="p">The efficient extraction of plant metabolites from plant tissues is affected by several factors: the solvent, plant:solvent ratio, time of extraction, temperature, and the choice of the best extraction conditions, which can be a long and tedious process. Therefore, we felt the need for a design-based extraction to minimize the number of runs required to understand the factors affecting the process.</p>
