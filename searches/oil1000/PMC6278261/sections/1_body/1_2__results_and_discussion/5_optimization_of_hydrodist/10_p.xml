 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05): nature of cation (all), quadratic term of cation [1,3-diMIM] × anion dimethylphosphate and [1,3-diMIM] × chloride, cation [1-EtOH-3-MIM] × anion dimethylphosphate, and [1-EtOH-3-MIM] × chloride. For the yield, eleven terms had significant results: cations [1,3-diMIM] and [1-But-3-MIM], both anions, ionic liquid molarity (IL), and quadratic terms [1,3-diMIM] × anion dimethylphosphate, [1,3-diMIM] × chloride, [1-But-3-MIM] × IL, [1-EtOH-3-MIM] × IL, dimethylphosphate × IL, and chloride × IL.
