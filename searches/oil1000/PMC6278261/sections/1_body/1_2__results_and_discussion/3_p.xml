<p class="p">The synthesis of ILs 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was performed either by using procedures used in previous literature or by modifying those protocols in order to obtain better results either in terms of yields or of sustainability. All ILs were synthesized starting from the common precursor 1-methylimidazole (MIM). 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium chloride 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> was prepared by a two-step procedure that first involved the synthesis of intermediate 1-methylimidazolium chloride after treatment of 1-methylimidazole with aqueous hydrochloric acid, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methylation with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in a Q-tube apparatus (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-23-02817-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, path a). 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> was synthesized by direct N-methylation of 1-methyimidazole with trimethylphosphate (TMP) by heating at 100 °C for 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-23-02817-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, path b). 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> was synthesized from 1-methylimidazole and 2-chloroethanol under microwaves (MW) irradiation using an improved procedure from methods reported in literature, allowing us to employ almost stoichiometric ratios of reagents instead of an over-stoichiometric amount of the alkylating agent. This procedure resulted in excellent yield and an easier work-up. 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> was instead obtained by ion exchange of IL 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold> in the presence of TMP under MW irradiation (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-23-02817-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, path c). 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold> was obtained by the reaction of MIM with 4-chlorobutane under MW irradiation for 15 min, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold> was synthesized through ion exchange with TMP under conventional heating (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-23-02817-sch001" class="xref">Scheme 1</xref>, path d).
