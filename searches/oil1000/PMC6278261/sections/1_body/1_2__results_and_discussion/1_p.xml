<p class="p">Nutmeg EO shows different percentages of alkenyl benzenes. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) regarded safrole, methyleugenole, and estragole as toxic compounds due to their carcinogenic activity [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]; for this reason, any extraction condition that allows a diminished percentage of these compounds in the EO has to be regarded as valuable. On the other hand, there is evidence suggesting that many phenylpropenes are cytotoxic against several cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], but most of the reports were not on clinical studies. These discrepancies could be ascribed to the formation of toxic metabolites in vivo [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-02817" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>].
