<p class="p">Over recent years, there has been significant progress in research on the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids. We know more and more of their sources and we understand better the importance of their chemical structure and the form of supplementation. People consume omega-3 fatty acids mainly with fish, and to a lesser extent with cereal products and meat. Some of them, however, do not appear in the abovementioned products, or their presence is unexplored. In addition, the content of individual acids in plants depends on the place of their occurrence, and in animals on the type of diet. Despite the high availability of seafood, which is rich in many omega-3 acids, the authors recognize the need to constantly search for new sources of omega-3 fatty acids due to the risk of excessive exposure to mercury methyl and other toxic compounds present in fishing areas. In addition, some acids, such as coniferonic or juniperonic acid, occur mainly in plants that are not widely used in consumption, or are even poisonous, but can be used in the pharmaceutical industry and medicinal chemistry. This is important because of the many reasons for finding omega-3 fatty acids and their derivatives, valuable active substances that may be important in the development of new drugs and therapeutic regimens. Opinions about the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids are divided. Some believe that phospholipid-bound acids are absorbed better, as well as more intensely incorporated into tissues than those associated in triglyceride form, due to the specificity of blood transport and better accessibility of beta-oxidation pathways. Others, however, are of the opinion that factors unrelated to the type of chemical binding play a key role, and the fat content in food is decisive. In addition, promising effects seem to result from the use of special lipophilic systems and nano(micro)emulsions. However, the type of emulsifier used should be taken into account, as some influence the expression of the gene involved in the transport of fatty acids in enterocytes in various ways. Fatty acids affect each otherâ€™s metabolism in the body, which is of dietary importance. Several times higher consumption of omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids is recommended by most researchers. Omega-3 fatty acids, like all fatty acids, are highly susceptible to oxidation. There are methods that disrupt this process and may be used in the production of supplements, but the significance of the process itself for bioavailability is unclear. </p>
