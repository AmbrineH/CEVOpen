<p class="p">We assumed all fatty acids with a double bond at the ω−3 carbon atom to be omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids show 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> isomerism with its extension to 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> configuration [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. We can speak of geometrical isomerism in the case of omega-3 fatty acids because two carbon atoms with sp2 hybridization connected by a double bond are linked to a hydrogen atom and group of atoms each. In order to determine the type of geometrical isomerism, at the beginning we choose the two most important substituents—one on the left, the second on the right of the double bond. In fatty acids, we have only one group (of atoms) on each side, because the two remaining binding sites occupies a hydrogen atom. In the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-isomer these two groups are located on the same side of the reference plane (the plane passing through the atoms connected by a double bond and perpendicular to the plane in which these atoms and atoms directly associated with them are situated); in the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-isomer they are in contrary positions [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> system is a bit more detailed. The mutual placement of the substituents is described by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rule. The most important is the substituent whose atom directly connecting to the rest of the molecule (directly with the atom forming the double bond) has a higher atomic number (in the case of isotopes, a higher atomic mass). If in this position, in the substituents (on the right or left side of the double bond), there are identical atoms, then (to choose a substituent of greater importance) we take into account subsequent atoms, always choosing atoms with the highest atomic number. If a given atom is connected by multiple bonds, the bond should be replaced by the number of single bonds appropriate for its multiplicity—each atom present at a multiple binding must after transformation have a corresponding number of single bonds (C=C = 2 × C-C). The “
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>” configuration (from entgegen, German for “opposite”) means that two groups of higher CIP priority (one on the left, the second on the right from the double bond) are on opposite sides of the double bond (in the synperiplanar position). If those groups are on the same side of the double bond (in antyperiplanar position), configuration is defined as “
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>” (from zusammen, German for “together”) [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. For simplicity, according to many authors, we used the terms “
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">Z”</italic> as well as “
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">E”</italic> interchangeably. The 
 <italic class="italic">cis-trans</italic> isomerism of fatty acids seems to play a particularly important role in shaping their chemical and biological activity, a good example of which are the various properties of conjugated fatty acid isomers [
