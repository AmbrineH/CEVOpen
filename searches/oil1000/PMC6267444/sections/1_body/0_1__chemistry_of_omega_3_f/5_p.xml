<p class="p">The most important, but small, group of fatty acids for humans are essential fatty acids (EFAs), which are necessary to maintain homeostasis, cannot be synthesized, or rather cannot be synthesized sufficiently by the organism, and must be supplied with food [

 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The significance of fatty acids in the animal diet was discussed by Osborne and Mendel [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] in 1920. In 1929 Burr and Burr [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] proved in their experiments on rats the ‘essential’ nature of some fatty acids. Some authors consider all PUFAs to be essential fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and determine linoleic acid (LA) and 
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-linolenic acid (ALA) as the most important [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], calling them “parent essential fatty acids” [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Others considered only arachidonic and linoleic acids as essential fatty acids because of their importance for the body’s growth and for maintaining the integrity of the skin [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The mammalian literature indicates 23 acids as essential, while the aquatic literature quotes only two EFAs—EPA and DHA. Considering the importance of ARA, we can take ARA, DHA and EPA as the most important long-chain PUFAs in mammals and fish [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Some animals can synthesize them using LA and ALA as precursors [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, those precursors must be available in sufficient quantities [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Gurr and Harwood [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] detailed “essential nutrients” in contrast to “essential metabolites”. In the light of this assumption, “essential nutrients” are precursors of “essential metabolites” and cannot be synthesized by organisms for which they are “essential”. Notwithstanding, “essential” is a relative term—human and rats can synthesize LA and ALA from 16:2
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and 16:3
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 contained in green vegetables, i.e., in microalgae, in conditions of defined substrate availability [

 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Considering that there is insufficient data showing that any individual PUFA is absolutely necessary during life, Cunnane divided essential fatty acids into ‘conditionally indispensable’ and ‘conditionally dispensable’ [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
