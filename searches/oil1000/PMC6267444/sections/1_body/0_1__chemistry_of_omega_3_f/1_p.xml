<p class="p">Omega-3 fatty acids, called 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 fatty acids or ω−3 fatty acids (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 FAs), are a heterogeneous group of fatty acids with a double bond between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the methyl end (from the ω−1 carbon atom). In general, we distinguish among them monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs; one double bond in carbon chain) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; more than one double bond in carbon chain). Conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) are a subset of PUFAs with at least one pair of conjugated double bonds [

We also mention some examples of modified omega-3 fatty acids like hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), oxo fatty acids (keto fatty acids) and hydroperoxy fatty acid. Among the hydroxy fatty acids, we distinguish saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, consisting of a long unbranched carbon chain with a carboxyl group at one end and one or more hydroxy groups. Oxo or keto fatty acids are fatty acids having both a carboxy group and a ketonic or aldehydic group in the molecule. Hydroperoxy fatty acids, in turn, carry at least one hydroperoxy group (-OOH) in the molecule. Some authors find the terms long-chain (LC) 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFAs and omega-3 fatty acids identical in meaning [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], which can be misleading because “omega-3 fatty acids” is a broader term.
