<p class="p">Al-Taan et al. [
 <xref rid="B195-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>] conducted a study on 20 patients awaiting the surgical removal of colorectal metastases from liver cancer. These individuals had normal liver function tests and plasma lipid levels within the reference range. The aim of the study was to assess the content of fatty acids in plasma phosphatidylcholine and erythrocytes during and after intravenous infusion of oil emulsion. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the main phospholipid that can be found in the circulation (blood) and erythrocyte (membrane) during and shortly after intravenous infusion of the oil emulsion. Parenteral administration of DHA and EPA lipid emulsion allowed a rapid and significant increase in their blood levels (EPA/DHA in plasma PC and EPA in erythrocytes). However, EPA levels returned to their initial values fiveâ€“12 days after the end of the infusion. Not only Al-Taan, but also Browning [

The fact of a relatively short infusion of oil emulsion is also significant.
