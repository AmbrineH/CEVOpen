<p class="p">The self-microemulsifying delivery system (SMEDS) contains LC 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 FA-EE and a number of compounds that are emulsified in the stomach without the need for a high-fat meal [
 <xref rid="B196-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>]. It has been known for many years that emulsified omega-3 acids are characterized by equally good bioavailability in poor and high fat environments [
 <xref rid="B196-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B201-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>]. Qin analysis [
 <xref rid="B196-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>] indicates that the absorption of DHA + EPA EE contained in SMEDS preparations is 6 times higher than DHA + EPA EE alone. To confirm the effectiveness of SMEDS technology, long-term studies are needed to analyze the embedding process of the above-mentioned fatty acids in the structure of cell membranes, especially erythrocytes.
