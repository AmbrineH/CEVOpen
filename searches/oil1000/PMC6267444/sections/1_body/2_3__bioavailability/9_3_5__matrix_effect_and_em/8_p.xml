<p class="p">A very common method of the incorporation of nanoemulsion into food is its transformation, most often into the form of powder, using microencapsulation [
 <xref rid="B204-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. Microencapsulation stabilizes the oil mixture, protects it against oxidation, and eliminates the phase difference often present when mixed with food [

Emulsification (pre-emulsification) increases the absorption of LC PUFAs, including DHA, EPA, and ALA, but does not have the effect on the absorption of fatty acids having shorter chain length and fewer unsaturated bonds [
