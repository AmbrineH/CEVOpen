<p class="p">The bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids varies depending on the type of chemical binding (lipid structure), and can be ranked as follows: PL &gt; rTG &gt; TG &gt; FFA &gt; EE [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>,
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>,
 <xref rid="B179-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>,
 <xref rid="B182-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>,
 <xref rid="B183-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>]. Both EE and rTG are not natural components of dietary oils, but they are created in the process of their chemical modification, which is called transesterification. As a result, highly concentrated oils containing up to 90% of EPA and DHA can be obtained [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. The hierarchical order presented above does not, however, reflect reality to the extent that some authors would like it to. In their trial Kohler et al. [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] proved that the bioavailability of EPA and DHA in the form of phospholipids does not have to be greater than the bioavailability of these acids in the form of triglycerides—the bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill meal was comparable to their bioavailability in fish oil, despite a slightly higher total fat content in krill meal. Yurko-Mauro et al. [
 <xref rid="B184-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>] achieved similar results—krill oil containing almost 44% of phospholipids showed bioavailability similar to the bioavailability of fish oil, both in the form of triglycerides and ethyl esters. This indicates the (great) share of non-chemical binding (and total fat content) factors in shaping the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B169-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>,
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>,
 <xref rid="B185-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>]. One explanation may be the observation of Nordoy, Reference [
 <xref rid="B186-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>], who noticed similarly good absorption of omega-3 fatty acids (including EPA and DHA) in the form of TG and EE if they are administered as a component of fish oil in equivalent amounts. Both krill oil, and to a lesser extent, krill meal and fish oil, which are rich in fat.
