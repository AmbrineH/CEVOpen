<p class="p">The omega-3 index is defined as the proportion of the sum of EPA and DHA content in the total fatty acid content in the erythrocyte (erythrocyte membrane), and is expressed as a percentage [

 <xref rid="B179-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>]) due to the long lifetime of erythrocytes and their high number in the blood. Plasma content of EPA and DHA, as well as many other fatty acids, weakly correlates or does not correlate at all with the levels of these acids in the erythrocyte membrane [
