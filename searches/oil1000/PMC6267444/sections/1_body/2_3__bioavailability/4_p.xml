<p class="p">In rTG, LC PUFAs take up not mainly the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position (which takes place in natural TG), but can also (simultaneously) be bound in the position of 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 or 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 with equal paradigmicity. rTG particles frequently contain two LC PUFAs—then the probability of binding EPA and DHA in the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 or 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 position is higher than in the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. According to Schuchardt, [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>] binding of LC omega-3 PUFA to glycerol in the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1/3 position facilitates the lipase hydrolysis of the bond, thus increasing bioavailability. According to Dyerberg, [
 <xref rid="B173-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>] the presence of MAG and DAG in rTG mixtures increases the absorption of LC PUFAs in the intestine due to the easier formation of micelles. Bandarra [
 <xref rid="B174-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>], in turn, based on the results of his research on hamsters, proves that the location of DHA in the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position increases the absorption of this acid in the intestine and its incorporation into tissues. However, a certain limitation of Bandarra’s study is that the author used a commercially available fish oil, which is known only to be rich in DHA with an unspecified binding site with the glycerol backbone—we do not know what part of DHA is associated in positions other than 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2.
