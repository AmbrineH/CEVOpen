<p class="p">Linoleic acid (LA), which is omega-6 fatty acid, competes with ALA for enzymes converting 
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-linolenic acid to EPA, DPA, and DHA. LA is (similarly to arachidonic acid), inter alia, the precursor of eicozanoids, while DHA, DPA, and EPA can be transformed into anti-inflammatory agents. [

 <xref rid="B209-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>]. Changes in the supply of omega-6 PUFAs affect the plasma concentration of omega-3 fatty acids. This applies to both non-esterified omega-3 fatty acids and those associated with phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters. Taha et al. [
 <xref rid="B209-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>] showed that reducing the supply of omega-6 PUFAs for 12 weeks increases the concentration of omega-3 PUFAs in the plasma. In addition, the simultaneous increase in the supply of omega-3 PUFAs for a dozen weeks further elevates the concentration of these acids in the plasma and lowers the level of arachidonic acid. An important interaction of omega-6 PUFAs with omega-3 PUFAs is the production of non-native thromboxanes and leukotrienes [
 <xref rid="B170-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>]. This probably results, among others, from the substrate competition for the catalytic center of desaturases and elongases, and the reduction of arachidonic acid production with a sufficiently high supply of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFAs.
