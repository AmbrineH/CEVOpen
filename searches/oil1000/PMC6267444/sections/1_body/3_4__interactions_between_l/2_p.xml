<p class="p">Based on Wood’s critical analysis, [
 <xref rid="B185-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>], it can be concluded that an increase in EPA level and also in a certain degree of DHA can probably be achieved by reducing the supply of linoleic acid and/or increasing the intake of 
 <italic class="italic">alpha</italic>-linolenic acid, although the extent of the change is small. It is suggested to maintain the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 consumption in the range from 1/5 to 1/10, and ideally, as in Japanese society, from 1/2 to 1/4 [

 <xref rid="B211-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>]. Meanwhile, the diets of Western societies are characterized by a clear advantage of the supply of omega-6 fatty acids and the ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 shaping in the range of 15/1 to 16.7/1 [

The discussion about the preferred ratio of consumption of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids has been going on for many years and still has not produced convincing results. Researchers are wondering about the legitimacy of returning to an “ancestral diet”, which is attributed to the balanced consumption of both groups of fatty acids at the level of 1:1 [

 <xref rid="B216-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>]. Attention is also paid to certain health benefits that may result from a strictly defined omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, as exemplified by the postulated beneficial effect of the 4:1 ratio on the functioning of the nervous system or reduction of tumor cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer who they were nourishing themselves, keeping the ratio 2.5:1 in the diet [

The above authors indicate the desirability of consuming up to four times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 and this value depends on the disease under consideration. Regardless of the symptoms or lack thereof, most researchers postulated not exceeded intakes omega6/omega-3 at 10 [

In light of eating habits of the societies of many highly developed countries, a certain compromise seems to be current recommendations for the consumption of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, which shape the omega-6/omega-3 index in the range from 7:1 to 11:1 [
