<p class="p">Kohler et al. [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] studied the bioavailability of DHA and EPA added in the form of ethyl esters to sausages with similar ALA content. Both the Omega-3 index and the percentage of EPA and DHA in erythrocytes increased significantly more in the verum group than in the control (placebo) group, in which they remained almost unchanged. The content of DPA similarly increased in both groups. The absence of a significant increase in EPA and DHA in the control group, despite ALA supplementation in both groups, is not surprising, as ALA is converted to EPA and DHA to a very small extent [

 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. The difference in the increase in EPA, DHA and DPA levels in the control group may be due to the different conversion efficiency of ALA to the above-mentioned acids, although this is not the only reason, because these acids may also be converted into each other. Interestingly, the ALA level increased slightly in the control group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.038), while in the treatment group it decreased slightly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.141). Despite the small difference in these ALA levels and the lack of statistical significance of ALA decrease in the treatment group, the explanation of large differences in ALA levels after supplementation between individual participants requires careful research on the metabolic interactions of individual omega-3 fatty acids.
