 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-Hexadeca-7,10,13-trienoic acid (roughanic acid) occurs in many plants and in fish oils, but usually in small amounts. As a result of reactions catalyzed by lipoxygenases, this is converted to oxygenated metabolites such as 7-, 8-, 10-, 11-, 13-, 14-hydroperoxides, and bis-allylic 9-hydroperoxide. However, hydroxy derivatives of roughanic acid are also present in plants rich in alpha-linolenic acid and not roughanic acid, including soybean and pea seedlings [
