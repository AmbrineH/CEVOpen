<p class="p">In the years 2003–2008 people in the US consumed, with food, on average 0.17 g/day (median intake 0.11 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA and EPA equivalents (5% from conversion of ALA, 33% from conversion of SDA)), i.e., lower than the recommended 0.5 g/day. Among people consuming omega-3 fatty acids in the group below or at the 15th percentile of omega−3 FAs total consumption, the most important source of omega-3 acids were cereal products (36%), while in the group above or at the 85th percentile, the dominant source was fish (fish and mixtures; 71%—in contrast to the low-intake group, where the fish consumption was 1%). In both groups, the intake of seeds and nuts was low, and vegetables were consumed at 9% and 2%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-10-01662" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. This is due to the fact that the food of many fish are algae rich in EPA and DHA, and other organisms consuming algae, like fish or marine invertebrates [

Marine invertebrates are also an important and basic source of omega-3 PUFAs due to their ability to synthesize some of them de novo, for example, oyster
