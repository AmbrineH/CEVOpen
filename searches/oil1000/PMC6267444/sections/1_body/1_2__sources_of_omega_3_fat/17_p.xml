<p class="p">There are numerous modifications of omega-3 fatty acids, and many of them play the role of hormones or compounds produced in stressful situations in plants. We only mention a few examples that occur in dietary sources. The most important seem to be the previously mentioned 2-hydroxylinolenic acid and two hydroxy acids occurring in plants of the genus
