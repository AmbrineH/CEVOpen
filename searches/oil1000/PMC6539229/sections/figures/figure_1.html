 <p> Inhibitory effect of Nepeta asterotricha n-butanol extract (NABE) on nitrite levels in the cell medium of J774A.1 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/mL) for 24 h. NABE, at the concentration range of 10–100 μg/mL, were added to the cell media 30 min before LPS stimulus. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of three experiments (in triplicates). # p &lt; 0.001 vs control (ctrl); *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. LPS alone. </p>
