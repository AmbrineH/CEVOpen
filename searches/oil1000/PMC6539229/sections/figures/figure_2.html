 <p> ( A) Inhibitory effect of Nepeta asterotricha n-butanolic extract (NABE) on inflammatory cytokines levels [i.e., IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α] in the cell medium of J774A.1 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/mL) for 24 h. NABE, used at the concentration of 100 μg/mL, were added to the cell media 30 min before LPS stimulus. ( B) Representative images of each array (untreated, treated with LPS and LPS+ NABE). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of three experiments (in triplicates). # p &lt; 0.001 vs control; * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 and *** p &lt; 0.001 vs LPS alone. </p>
