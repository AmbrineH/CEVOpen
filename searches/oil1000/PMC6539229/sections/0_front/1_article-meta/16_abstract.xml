 <p class="p">The 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanolic extract, from an Iranian specimen of 
  <italic class="italic">Nepeta asterotricha</italic> Rech. f. (NABE), displayed anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated J774A.1 macrophages, which reduced nitrites and cytokines production. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of four iridoid glycosides, including a new one known as nepetamoside (
  <bold class="bold">1</bold>), one hexenyl-diglycoside, and some polyphenol and flavonoid components. None of the isolated iridoid components displayed significant effects on nitrites formation in an in vitro LPS-induced model of inflammation, thus suggesting that the plant anti-inflammatory effect is probably due to a synergistic action among its constituents.
