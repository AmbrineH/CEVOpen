<p class="p">So far, the phytochemical study of the extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> species has mainly been devoted to the analysis of the volatile constituents in the essential oil [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Although the chemical composition of the volatile oils has been found to be influenced by external factors such as climatic and ecological conditions, plant organ and vegetative cycle stage, there were roughly two different chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> spp., the first one containing nepetalactone diastereoisomers as main constituents, whereas the second one contains 1,8-cineole (eucaliptol) as the predominant component. The chemical composition of the essential oils from root, leaf and aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta asterotricha</italic> Rech. f. has been investigated and 1,8-cineole and nepetalactone have been identified as the major oil components of the leaf/aerial and root, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Moreover, biological studies revealed that the essential oil possesses antimicrobial and antifungal activities.
