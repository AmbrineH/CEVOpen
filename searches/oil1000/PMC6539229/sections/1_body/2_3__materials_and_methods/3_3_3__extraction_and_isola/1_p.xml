<p class="p">The aerial parts of the plant (230 g) were extracted with methanol (3 × 1 L) at room temperature and the crude methanolic extract was subjected to a modified Kupchan’s partitioning procedure as follows. The methanol extract was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O containing 10% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and partitioned against n-hexane (3.5 g). The water content (% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) of the MeOH extract was adjusted to 30% and partitioned against CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (18.7 g). The aqueous phase was concentrated to remove MeOH and then extracted with n-BuOH (9.2 g). An aliquot of n-BuOH extract (2.4 g) was submitted to droplet counter-current chromatography (DCCC) with n-BuOH/Me
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (3:1:5) in descending mode (the upper phase was the stationary phase). The obtained fractions were monitored by TLC on Silica gel plates with n-BuOH/AcOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (12:3:5) and CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (80:18:2) as eluents. Twelve fractions were obtained and purified by HPLC on a Nucleodur 100-5 C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm i.d × 250 mm) using MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (4:6) as eluent. An aliquot of fraction 7 (50 mg), containing exclusively nepetamoside (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), was purified in HPLC to give 17 mg of pure compound 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> (t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> = 14.2 min). Fraction 9 (30.1 mg) afforded 3.8 mg of nepetaracemoside B (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>) (t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> = 6.5 min) and 4.2 mg of (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-β-apiofuranosyl-(1″→6′)-β-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucopyranoside (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>) (t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> = 26 min), fraction 10 (270 mg) contained exclusively nepetonic acid (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>) (62 mg; t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> = 30 min) and fraction 11 (548 mg) afforded 23.4 mg of 1,5,9-epi-deoxyloganic acid (
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) (t
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> = 24 min).
