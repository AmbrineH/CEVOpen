<p class="p">NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Inova 400 and 500 NMR spectrometers (Palo Alto, CA, USA) (
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H at 400 and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C at 100, 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H at 500 MHz and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C at 125 MHz, respectively), equipped with a SUN microsystem ultra 5 hardware. Coupling constants (
 <italic class="italic">J</italic> values) are reported in Hertz (Hz), and chemical shifts (δ) in ppm, referred to CHD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>OD (δ
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> 3.31 and δ
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> 49.0). Spin multiplicities are given as s (singlet), br s (broad singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet) or m (multiplet). Through-space 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H connectivities were obtained using a ROESY experiment with mixing times of 150, 200 and 250 ms.
