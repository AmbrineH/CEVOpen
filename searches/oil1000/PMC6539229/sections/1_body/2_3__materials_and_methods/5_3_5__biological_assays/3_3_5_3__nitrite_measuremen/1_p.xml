<p class="p">The effect of NABE on the nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed by measuring nitrites, stable metabolites of NO, in macrophages medium via a colorimetric assay, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. J774A.1 macrophages (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells per well seeded in a 24-well plate) were incubated with NABE (10–100 µg/mL) for 30 min and subsequently with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. Then, the cell supernatant was collected and incubated with 100 µL of Griess reagent (0.2% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 2% sulphanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid) at room temperature for 10 min in order to allowed the formation of a colored azo dye. The absorbance was read at 550 nm. Serial-diluted sodium nitrite (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used to generate a standard curve. The data were expressed as µM of nitrite. Each sample was determined in triplicate.
