<p class="p">In order to confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of NABE, we also measured the levels of proinflammatory and antinflammatory secreted cytokine proteins in LPS-stimulated macrophages by using the Proteome Profiler Mouse Cytokine Array Kit, Panel A (R&amp;D system, Space import export Srl, Milan, Italy) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, J774A.1 macrophages were incubated with NABE at concentration of 100 µg/mL for 30 min and subsequently with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. Successively, cell supernatants were incubated with Mouse Cytokine Detection Antibody Cocktail for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the samples were incubated with a membrane containing 40 different anti-cytokine antibodies printed in duplicate at 4 °C overnight on a rocking platform shaker. The unbound proteins were removed and the membranes were washed three times with a washing buffer. The Streptavidin-HRP solution was then added to the membranes on a rocking platform shaker for 30 min. After being washed three times, the protein spots were visualized using the chemiluminescence detection reagents supplied in the Array Kits (R&amp;D system, Space import export Srl, Milan, Italy). The intensity score of each duplicated array spot was measured with software ImageQuant Capture (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy) and analyzed using Quantity One Software version 4.6.3 (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).</p>
