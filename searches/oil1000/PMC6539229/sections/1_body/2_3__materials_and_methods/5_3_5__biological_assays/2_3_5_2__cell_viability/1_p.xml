<p class="p">Cell viability was evaluated by measuring the incorporation of neutral red (NR), a weak cationic dye, in lysosomes (NR assay). Briefly, J774A.1 macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per well and were allowed to adhere for 24 h. Then, cells were treated with the Nepeta asterotricha n-butanolic extract (NABE, 10–100 µg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, macrophages were incubated with NR dye solution (50 μg/mL in medium) for 3 h at 37 °C and then lysed with 1% acetic acid. The absorbance was read at 532 nm (iMarkTM microplate reader, Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). All experiments were performed in triplicate (including 8 replicates for each treatment).
