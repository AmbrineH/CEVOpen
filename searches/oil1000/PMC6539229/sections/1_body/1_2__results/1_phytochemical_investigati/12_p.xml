<p class="p">Several studies reported the determination of flavonoids and phenolic acids profile [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] of aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> species although in most cases the identification of the individual components was mainly performed by HPLC analysis. In particular, a comprehensive study on 38 species of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], including 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta asterotricha</italic>, analyzed some common features in the composition of flavonoids. Our analysis gave results similar to those reported for the same species, with 8-hydroxycirsimaritin (
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>), which represents a chemotaxonomic marker of the 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> genus as a major flavonoid component.
