<p class="p">The anti-inflammatory effects of rosmarinic acid (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>) and apigenin (
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>) (the main components found in NABE) have been extensively demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Therefore, it has been presumed that the anti-inflammatory effect of NABE could be due to the presence of these compounds. However, the amount of these compounds found in NABE is too low to exert anti-inflammatory effects, therefore, it is believed that the overall effect of NABE on nitrites and cytokines productions is probably due to a synergistic action of all components (found in NABE) rather than due to a single compound.
