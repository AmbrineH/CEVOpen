<p class="p">Macrophages, a heterogenous population of innate immune cells, are the key actors in the inflammation pathogenesis, by playing a crucial role in host defence and by controlling tissue-specific signals [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Their activation, mainly by LPS, is associated with the transcription of genes that encode for the production of inflammation-related mediators such as nitric oxide and cytokines [e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β)] [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of NABE, its fractions and isolated compounds in J774A.1 macrophages stimulated by LPS. Treatment of J774A.1 macrophages with the inflammatory agent LPS (1 μg/mL for 24 h) caused a significant increase in nitrite (the stable form of nitric oxide) levels which was significantly reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, by a pre-treatment with NABE at the concentration of 10–100 μg/mL, 30 min before LPS addition (

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Of note, in macrophages not treated with LPS, NABE did not modify, 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>, basal nitrite levels (data not shown). NABE, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μg/mL, did not affect the cell vitality after 24 h of exposure, thus suggesting an absence of cytotoxic effects at these concentrations. (Control 100 ± 2.5; NABE 10 µg/mL 99.8 ± 3.2; NABE 30 µg/mL 99.6 ± 3.3; NABE 100 µg/mL 98.9 ± 3.8. Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, each performed in octuplicate). By contrast, NABE at a concentration of 300 µg/mL induced a significant inhibition of macrophages viability (Control 100 ± 2.5; NABE 300 µg/mL 86.8 ± 2.3; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, each performed in octuplicate). DMSO 20% was used as a positive control and significantly reduced cell viability (Control 100 ± 2.5; DMSO 20% 20.8 ± 1.2; *** 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, each performed in octuplicate). The anti-inflammatory effect of NABE was corroborated by quantification of a cytokines panel as assessed by a Proteome Profiler Mouse Cytokine Array Kit that is a membrane-based sandwich immunoassay. By using this assay, we measured, at the same time, the levels of 40 pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory secreted cytokine proteins in LPS-stimulated J774. According to literature [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], LPS (1 µg/mL) determined a significant increase of several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in macrophages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01684-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Among the screened cytokines, NABE (100 μg/mL) significantly decreased the production of these key pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages stimulated by LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01684-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). However, NABE (100 μg/mL) did not affect the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) (data not shown).
