<p class="p">By analogy with previous literature data [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], we envisioned an enantiomeric configuration in the aglycone portion of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, with respect to penstemonoside. This presumption was confirmed by consistent evidence. First, the specific rotation values of the iridoid glycosides with “classic” (1
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>, 5
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>, 9
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>) stereostructure were reported as invariably negative, whereas the iridoid glycosides from plants of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> genus with a distinctive enantiomeric (1
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>, 5
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>, 9
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>) stereostructure displayed positive optical rotation values. The positive value of specific rotation of compound 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> was in agreement with a (1
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>,5
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>,9
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>) stereostructure. Analogously, the CD spectrum of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> displayed a positive Cotton effect, as reported for iridoids from 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Moreover, the enzymatic hydrolysis of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> led to a C-1 epimeric mixture of aglycones, whose 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR data were superimposable to those reported for the aglycone of penstemonoside [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01684" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>].
