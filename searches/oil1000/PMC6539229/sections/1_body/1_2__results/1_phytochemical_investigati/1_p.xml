<p class="p">Air-dried leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta asterotricha</italic> were ground and extracted with MeOH. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure yielded a crude extract which was subjected to solvent partitioning using a Kupchanâ€™s modified procedure to obtain four different fractions (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-BuOH). Among the fractions, the 
 <italic class="italic">Nepeta asterotricha n</italic>-BuOH extract (NABE, 9.2 g) showed anti-inflammatory activity in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated J774A.1 macrophages.
