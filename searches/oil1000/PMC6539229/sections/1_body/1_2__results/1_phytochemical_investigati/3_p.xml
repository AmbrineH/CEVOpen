<p class="p">In order to identify the substance/s responsible for the NABE anti-inflammatory effect, an aliquot of NABE (2.4 g) was fractionated by DCCC to afford 12 fractions. Among the fractions, fractions 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (100 µg/mL) were able to significantly reduce the formation of nitrites induced by LPS (Control 5.6 ± 0.06; LPS 25.9 ± 0.31
