<p class="p">Inflammation and oxidative stress are essential to maintain homeostasis and provide, among others, protection to pathogens or tissue damage. However, under certain conditions, these mechanisms are also involved in chronic low-grade inflammatory processes, which, even in the absence of immediate clinical symptoms, present risk factors for many diseases [

The second situation is characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived eicosanoids, as well as cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Pro-inflammatory macrophages play important roles in these situations, contributing to various co-morbidities [
