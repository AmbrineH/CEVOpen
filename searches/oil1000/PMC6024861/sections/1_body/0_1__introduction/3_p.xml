 <italic class="italic">Citrus myrtifolia</italic> Raf., commonly known as chinotto or myrtle leaved orange, is a widely diffused ornamental plant belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Rutaceae</italic> family and is considered as a mutation of sour orange (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> L.) [

 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The plant is native to China and has been cultivated for centuries in France and Italy, especially in Liguria, Calabria, and Sicily where the fruits are used in the confectionery industry. Next to this, the juice from unripe fruits is used as an ingredient of soft drinks and liqueurs [

 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], there appear to be no documented studies on the potential anti-inflammatory properties of chinotto. Moreover, although the composition of different parts of the chinotto plant has been reported [

 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], the effect of fruit maturation on the essential oil profile and on potential differences in bioactivity seems to be neglected thus far. These starting points prompted us to investigate the in vitro anti-inflammatory and radical scavenging potential of essential oils from the peels of chinotto and to evaluate the effects of maturation on the bioactivity and on the composition of volatile compounds.
