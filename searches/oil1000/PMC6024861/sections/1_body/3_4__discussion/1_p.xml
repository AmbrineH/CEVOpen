<p class="p">Nitric oxide (NO) is the free radical product of the oxidative deamination of 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-arginine, which is catalysed by nitric oxide synthases (NOS). At low concentrations, NO plays a role as a signalling molecule in various physiological processes. During inflammation, the inducible isoform of the enzyme (iNOS or NOS2) is up-regulated and this produces large amounts of NO, acting as a key mediator in several inflammatory disorders [

 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Under these conditions, the expression of iNOS is known to be predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Our results showed that the essential oil from half ripe fruits (CEO2) of chinotto (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus myrtifolia</italic> Raf.) could reduce NO levels in a concentration-dependent way. Moreover, CEO2 elicited a suppression of iNOS mRNA, indicating that the inhibition of NO release is, at least partly, mediated at a transcriptional level. Additionally, we found that CEO2 was also able to suppress the expression of other pro-inflammatory genes, including those encoding for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). It has been reported by us and others that the inhibition of COX-2-mediated eicosanoid production plays a major role in the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, including NO [

 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The upregulated COX-2 enzyme catalyses the reaction of arachidonic acid yielding prostaglandins, which function in inflammatory and pro-analgesic processes. Because of its pivotal role, COX-2 represents an important therapeutic target in many inflammatory disorders [

 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. However, many COX-2 inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs) cause gastrointestinal side effects, and plant-derived alternatives targeting COX-2 are currently considered a promising strategy [

 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-1β and IL-6, are expressed at high levels under inflammatory conditions [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In particular, IL-1β is an inducible cytokine that is, generally, not produced by healthy cells and it is implicated in pain, inflammation, and autoimmune conditions. Results from 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies using IL-1β knock-out mice highlight the crucial role of IL-1β in mediating NF-κB activity and COX-2 transcription in response to systemic inflammation [

 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In line with our findings, inhibitory effects of some essential oils, including those from thyme (
