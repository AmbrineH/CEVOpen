<p class="p">In conclusion, in the present study, we show that, for the first time, similar to bergamot (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus bergamia</italic> Risso), extracts from chinotto (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus myrtifolia</italic> Raf.) also possess potent in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. In contrast to bergamot, which only grows in restricted areas due to its relatively poor ability to adapt, chinotto has been shown to easily adapt to different environmental conditions and, as such, might be of higher economical interest. Interestingly, the level of bioactivity was found to greatly depend on ripening stage of the fruit, since only the essential oil from half ripe fruits (CEO2) effectively reduced NO levels and gene-expression of the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, CEO2 exhibited high radical scavenging activity against two commonly used non-biological radicals (DPPH• and ABTS•
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). Limonene, linalool, linalyl acetate, and γ-terpinene were identified as the main components in CEO2 and our data suggest additive and/or synergistic effects of these compounds. Our findings warrant further studies to explore the potential of chinotto to improve human health and, when positive, to guide selection of most optimal mixtures. To this end, an important issue would be to study the oral bioavailability of the components. Only limited data are available, suggesting that limonene is absorbed from the GI tract, but data on linalool, linalyl acetate, and γ-terpinene appear to be lacking. In view of this, combination effects may also occur.
