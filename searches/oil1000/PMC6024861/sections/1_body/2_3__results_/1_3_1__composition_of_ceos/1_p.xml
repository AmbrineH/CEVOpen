 <xref rid="nutrients-10-00783-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Twelve compounds were identified and quantified in green, half ripe, and ripe fruit essential oils, representing 96.7%, 95.9%, and 97.5% of the total detected constituents, respectively. Limonene, linalool, and linalyl acetate were identified as the main components in all the oils, while Î³-terpinene was found in CEO2 and CEO3 (3.7% and 0.4%, respectively). The sum of these four monoterpenes accounted for 94.0%, 93.0%, and 93.5% of the total constituents in the three CEOs, respectively. In particular, limonene was found to be the most abundant compound in CEO2 and CEO3 (54.3 and 48.7%, respectively). Linalool content reached its highest concentration in CEO3 (32.4%), while linalyl acetate was found to be the most abundant compound in CEO1 (47.5%) and its amount decreased significantly upon ripening.
