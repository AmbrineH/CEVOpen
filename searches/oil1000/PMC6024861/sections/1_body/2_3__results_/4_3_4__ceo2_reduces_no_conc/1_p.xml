<p class="p">Chinotto essential oils were analysed for their capacity to reduce NO production by RAW264,7 macrophages stimulated by 0.5 µg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NO concentrations measured as nitrite were strongly induced after stimulation with LPS for 48 h. Essential oil from half ripe fruits (CEO2) reduced the level of NO in a concentration-dependent way. In particular, CEO2 was found to be already effective at 10 µg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while an inhibition of &gt;50% was found at 100 µg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In contrast, CEO1 and CEO3 were ineffective in the concentration range investigated (
