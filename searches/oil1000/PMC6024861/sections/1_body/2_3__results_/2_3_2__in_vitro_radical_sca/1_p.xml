<p class="p">The radical scavenging activity of CEOs was evaluated against the two most commonly used stable radicals (DPPH• and ABTS•
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-10-00783-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, DPPH• scavenging activity of CEOs increased with ripening. In particular, CEO2 and CEO3 (7.8 and 8.1 µmol of TE/g of CEO, respectively) were significantly more active than CEO1 (6.1 µmol of TE/g of CEO). An opposite trend was observed for the ABTS assay, where CEO1 and CEO2 had higher scavenging activity (11.1 and 10.8 µmol of TE/g of CEO, respectively) than CEO3 (9.4 µmol of TE/g of CEO).
