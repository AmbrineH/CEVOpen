<p class="p">All experiments were performed in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Data from all experiments using RAW264.7 macrophages are presented as a percentage of the LPS-treated controls (set at 100%). Data from radical scavenging assays are expressed as µmol of Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g of CEO. All data are reported as means ± standard deviation. Statistical differences between treatments were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test.
