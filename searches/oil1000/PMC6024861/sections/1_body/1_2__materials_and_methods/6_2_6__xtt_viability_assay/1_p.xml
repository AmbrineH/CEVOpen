<p class="p">Effects of CEOs on cell viability were analysed using an XTT Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Applied Science, Almere, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, the tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay was performed, evaluating the cells’ capability in metabolising XTT to formazan as an estimation of cell viability. Conditions were considered toxic if metabolic activity leading to formazan was diminished by ≥20%. As a positive control, cells were treated with Triton X100, yielding total cell lysis. </p>
