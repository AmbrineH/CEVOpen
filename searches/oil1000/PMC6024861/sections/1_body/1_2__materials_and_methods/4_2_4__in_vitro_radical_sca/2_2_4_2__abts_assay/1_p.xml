<p class="p">The ABTS assay was conducted according to an established protocol [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], with slight modifications. ABTS radical cation (ABTS•
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) was produced by reacting ABTS solution (7 mM) with potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) and allowing the mixture to stand in the dark at room temperature for 16 h before use. The ABTS•
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> solution was diluted with ethanol and the resulting solution had an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.05 (at 734 nm). 100 μL of the CEOs (10 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were added to 2 mL of ABTS•
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> solution and the resulting mixture was kept in the dark and under stirring for 5 min before absorbance at 734 nm was measured. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Trolox was used as the reference compound to build a calibration curve and the results are expressed as µmol of Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g of CEO.
