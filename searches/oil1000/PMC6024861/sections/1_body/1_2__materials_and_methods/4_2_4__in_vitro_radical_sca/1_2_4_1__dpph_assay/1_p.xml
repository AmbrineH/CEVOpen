<p class="p">The free radical scavenging capacities of the oils were determined by DPPH assay according to a previously used protocol [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In particular, 100 μL of CEOs (10 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> MeOH) were mixed with 100 μL of the DPPH• methanol solution (1 mM) and the final volume adjusted to 3 mL by the addition of the necessary amount of MeOH. Next, the mixtures were shaken vigorously and incubated in the dark at room temperature. The colorimetric decrease in absorbance of each sample was measured at 517 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (model V-550, Jasco Europe) after 30 min when a plateau was reached. The negative control was a DPPH solution obtained by diluting 100 μL of the DPPH standard solution with MeOH to give a final volume of 3 mL. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Trolox, a known antioxidant, has been used as reference compound to build a calibration curve and the results are expressed as µmol of Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g of CEO.
