<p class="p">Chinotto fruits were collected in Calabria (southern Italy) in three different periods (early October, late October, late November) during Autumn 2012. A voucher specimen (accession no. CLU26013) of the plant was deposited in the Erbarium CLA at the Botanical Garden of the University of Calabria (Rende, Italy). Chinotto essential oils (CEOs) were obtained according to a previously reported extraction method [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-00783" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Briefly, the rinds of the peels were squeezed to break the utricles and release the oil, which was collected by extraction with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. The solutions were then dried over Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and concentrated under a stream of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Extracts were classified as CEO1, CEO2, or CEO3 based on the ripening stage of the fruits used (green, half ripe, and ripe, respectively). Specifically, unripe fruits were green and half ripe were yellow-green, whereas ripe fruits were fully orange. The diameter was about 4–6 cm in all the cases. The essential oils were stored under N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at −20 °C in brown bottles until analyses.
