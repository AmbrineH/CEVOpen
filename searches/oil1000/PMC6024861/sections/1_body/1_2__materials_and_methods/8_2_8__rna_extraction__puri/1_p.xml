<p class="p">After incubating for 24 h, medium was removed and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands). RNA (1 μg/sample) was reversely transcribed, yielding cDNA using Promega reverse transcription system (Leiden, The Netherlands). cDNA was amplified by PCR by means of platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR green (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) using an iCycler system (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). The following primer pairs were used for amplification of iNOS: 5′-GTTCTCAGCCCAACAATACAAGA-3′ (forward) e 5′-GTGGACGGGTCGATGTCAC-3′ (reverse); COX-2: 5′-GGAGAGACTATCAAGATAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGGTCAGTAGACTTTTACA-3′ (reverse); IL-1β: 5′-TGCAGAGTTCCCCAACTGGTACATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGCTGCCTAATGTCCCCTTGAATC-3′ (reverse). IL-6: 5′-TACTCGGCAAACCTAGTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGTCCCAACATTCATATTGTCAGT-3′ (reverse); MCP-1: 5′-CCCAATGAGTAGGCTGGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTGGACCCATTCCTTCTTG-3′ (reverse). Samples were analysed in duplicate, and mRNA expression levels of the different genes were normalised to RPS27A2. Primer pairs for RPS27A2 were 5′-GGTTGAACCCTCGGACACTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCATCTTCCAGCTGCTTAC-3′ (reverse).</p>
