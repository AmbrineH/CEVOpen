<p class="p">The composition of CEOs was analysed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) without any derivatisation. Before GC analysis, CEOS were diluted 10 mg in 1 mL chloroform. Analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu GC-2010 system equipped with an AOC-20i auto sampler, split/split less injector, and a FID detector (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). Experimental conditions were as follows: The column was a fused-silica capillary column (SLB
 <sup class="sup">™</sup>-5 ms, Supelco, Milan, Italy) coated with 5% diphenyl −95% dimethyl siloxane (30 m × 0.25 mm id × 0.25 μm d
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>); the oven temperature increased from 50 up to 250 °C, with a rate of 3.0 °C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; and the injection volume was 1.0 μL in the split mode (30:1). Helium was used as carrier gas at 30.1 cm s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of linear velocity (
 <italic class="italic">u</italic>), with an inlet pressure of 99.8 kPa. The detector temperature was set at 280 °C. The hydrogen flow rate was 50.0 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; the air flow rate was 400 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; and the make-up flow rate (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/Air) was 50 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their retention times with those of authentic standards available in our laboratory. The quantification of each compound identified in CEOs was performed using the peak area normalization and the results were expressed as the means of three experiments.
