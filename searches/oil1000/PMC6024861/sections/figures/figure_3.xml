   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and, after overnight incubation, were treated for 24 h with LPS (0.5 μg mL
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and with (or without) different concentrations of CEO2. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, yielding cDNA prior to quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression fold increase normalized to RPS27A2 is presented as percentages, and LPS stimulation (without CEO2) was fixed at 100%, and represents the mean of three separate experiments (each done in duplicate) ± standard deviation. Mean value was statistically different from control (*
