 <p> Effect of chinotto essential oils at different ripening stages [CEO1 (green), CEO2 (half ripe), and CEO3 (ripe)] on nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10 5 cells mL −1 and, after overnight incubation, were treated with LPS (0.5 μg mL −1) and with (or without) increasing concentrations of CEOs for 48h. The supernatants of the cells were analysed for nitrite production by the Griess method. Data are presented as percentages and LPS control (without CEOs) was fixed at 100%. The average absolute nitrite value for the LPS control was approximately 40 μM. Values represent the mean of three independent experiments (each done in duplicate) ± standard deviation. Mean value was statistically different from control (* p &lt; 0.05, and ** p &lt; 0.01). </p>
