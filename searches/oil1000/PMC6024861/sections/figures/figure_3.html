 <p> Effect of CEO2 on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COX2 ( a), iNOS ( b), IL-1β ( c), IL-6 ( d), MCP-1 ( e) gene expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells mL −1 and, after overnight incubation, were treated for 24 h with LPS (0.5 μg mL −1) and with (or without) different concentrations of CEO2. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, yielding cDNA prior to quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression fold increase normalized to RPS27A2 is presented as percentages, and LPS stimulation (without CEO2) was fixed at 100%, and represents the mean of three separate experiments (each done in duplicate) ± standard deviation. Mean value was statistically different from control (* p &lt; 0.05, and ** p &lt; 0.01). </p>
