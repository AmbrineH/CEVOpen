 <p> Effect of chinotto essential oils at different ripening stages [CEO1 (green), CEO2 (half ripe), and CEO3 (ripe)] on the cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10 5 cells mL −1 and, after overnight incubation, were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 μg mL −1) and with (or without) increasing concentrations of CEOs for 48 h. Data are presented as percentages and LPS control (without CEOs) was fixed at 100% (black bar). The white bar represents the positive control, corresponding to untreated cells upon addition of Triton X100. The means of three separate experiments (each done in duplicate) ± standard deviation are reported. Mean value was statistically different from control (** p &lt; 0.01). </p>
