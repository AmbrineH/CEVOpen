 <p> Schematic diagram showing the anti-inflammatory regulation by phytoncide essential oil on lung inflammation. LPS stimulated NF-κB and inflammatory mediator activation in WI38 cell inflammation. Phytoncide essential oil inhibited the LPS-induced inflammation in WI38 cells and enhanced the lung alveolar capacity in Sprague-Dawley rats, indicating its therapeutic potency for lung inflammatory diseases. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; p-p65, phosphorylated p65; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2. </p>
