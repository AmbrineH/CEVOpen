 <p> NF-κB inhibition by essential oil treatment of LPS-inflamed WI38 fibroblast cells. Representative images of cellular localization and immuno-blot analysis in WI38 cells. (A) Confocal images showed p-p65 or NF-κB translocation to the nucleus following LPS stimulation compared with untreated cells, whereas the phytoncide essential oil pre-treated group showed suppressed NF-κB activation and reversion of its location to the cytosol (magnification, ×20). (B) Western blot results show the protein expression of total p65, NF-κB and IκB-α in whole cells, with a reduction in p65 and IκB-α on LPS stimulation and a subsequent increase in the phytoncide essential oil co-treated group of WI38 cells. Data represented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate independent experiments. **P&lt;0.01, compared with the LPS-stimulated group. β-actin was used as internal control. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; p-p65, phosphorylated p65. </p>
