  <p class="p">Suppression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated WI38 fibroblast cells by essential oil treatment. WI38 cells were pre-treated with 1-10 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml concentrations of phytoncide essential oil for 1 h followed by 5 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml LPS treatment for 24 h. The effect of phytoncide essential oil on the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediator protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 were observed by immuno-blotting. Densitometric analyses showed the suppressed expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins compared with the LPS (positive control) group of WI38 cells. Data represented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate independent experiments. 
   <sup class="sup">*</sup>P&lt;0.05,
