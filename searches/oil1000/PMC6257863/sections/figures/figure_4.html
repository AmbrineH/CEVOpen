 <p> Suppression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated WI38 fibroblast cells by essential oil treatment. WI38 cells were pre-treated with 1-10 µg/ml concentrations of phytoncide essential oil for 1 h followed by 5 µg/ml LPS treatment for 24 h. The effect of phytoncide essential oil on the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediator protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 were observed by immuno-blotting. Densitometric analyses showed the suppressed expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins compared with the LPS (positive control) group of WI38 cells. Data represented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ***P&lt;0.001 compared with the positive control group; #P&lt;0.05 and ###P&lt;0.01, compared with the negative control (un-treated) group. β-actin was used as internal control. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. </p>
