 <p> Cell compatibility and anti-stimulatory effect of essential oil on LPS-induced WI38 fibroblast cell inflammation. (A) Morphological observation of WI38 fibroblast cells treated with various concentrations (1-50 µg/ml) of essential oil on cell compatibility. (B) Morphological observations of WI38 fibroblast cells show the inflammatory effects of LPS stimulation (1-10 µg/ml) compared with untreated cells. (C) Morphological observation of inflammation reduction in the 1 h pre-essential oil treated group in 5 µg/ml LPS-stimulated WI38 cells at 24 h. Cell viability observations showed that essential oil treatment in the LPS-stimulated groups significantly suppressed inflammation compared with that in the positive control or LPS stimulation-induced cells (magnification, ×10). Black arrows indicate the morphological changes in fibroblast cells induced by LPS stimulation. Data represented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate independent experiments. ***P&lt;0.01, compared with the subsequent control group; ^P&lt;0.05 and ^^P&lt;0.01, compared with the LPS-stimulated group. LPS, lipopolysaccharide. </p>
