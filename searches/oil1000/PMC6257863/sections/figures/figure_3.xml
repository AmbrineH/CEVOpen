  <p class="p">Cell compatibility and anti-stimulatory effect of essential oil on LPS-induced WI38 fibroblast cell inflammation. (A) Morphological observation of WI38 fibroblast cells treated with various concentrations (1-50 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml) of essential oil on cell compatibility. (B) Morphological observations of WI38 fibroblast cells show the inflammatory effects of LPS stimulation (1-10 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml) compared with untreated cells. (C) Morphological observation of inflammation reduction in the 1 h pre-essential oil treated group in 5 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml LPS-stimulated WI38 cells at 24 h. Cell viability observations showed that essential oil treatment in the LPS-stimulated groups significantly suppressed inflammation compared with that in the positive control or LPS stimulation-induced cells (magnification, ×10). Black arrows indicate the morphological changes in fibroblast cells induced by LPS stimulation. Data represented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate independent experiments.
