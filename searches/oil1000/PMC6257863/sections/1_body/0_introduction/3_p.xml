In chronic lung diseases, the number and phenotypes of fibroblasts cells are altered as they are able to modulate the immune response, however, any impairment in immune regulation involves the disruption of controlling activity and leads to inflammation and damage (
 <xref rid="b6-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Previous studies have implicated fibroblasts as cells which contribute to disease persistence and define anatomical location. Therefore, fibroblasts are an attractive therapeutic target as they assist in orchestrating the infiltration of inflammatory agents (
