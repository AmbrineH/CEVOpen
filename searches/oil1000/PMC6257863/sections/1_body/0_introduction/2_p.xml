<p class="p">Lung inflammation is usually caused by pathogens or by exposure to toxins, pollutants, irritants, and allergens. Acute lung inflammation includes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome; whereas chronic inflammation includes asthma and COPD (

 <xref rid="b3-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). The respiratory system comes into direct contact with a low level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present as a contaminant in airborne particles. Exposure to LPS results in several characteristics of lung inflammation, including the upregulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation and airway epithelial barrier permeability with increasing levels of albumin, myeloperoxidase activity and infiltration of neutrophils (

Therefore, a better understanding of the pathogens or stress associated with lung inflammation and potential targets for treatment which can maintain lung homeostasis, is always dependent on the characteristics of cells or tissue involvement.
