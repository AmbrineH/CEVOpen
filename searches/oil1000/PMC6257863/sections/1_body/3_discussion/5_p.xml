<p class="p">The redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-κB, is an important participant in a broad spectrum of inflammatory networks that regulate cytokine activity in airway pathology (
 <xref rid="b39-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Prominent transcription factors in airway disease include NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), glucocorticoid receptors and nuclear factor of activated T cells (
 <xref rid="b40-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). Inflammatory target proteins, including MMP-9, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, COX-2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2, are associated with airway and lung inflammation in response to various stimuli (
 <xref rid="b41-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>). Therapeutics that target the NF-κB family can inhibit its translocation during inflammation in a process termed 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-repression and can protect against the condition of pulmonary and airway obstruction-associated inflammation (

 <xref rid="b39-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Several studies have described the therapeutic implications on lung diseases and its pathogenesis by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway through microRNA-194 in infantile pneumonia (
 <xref rid="b42-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>), and curcumin and resveratrol combination in MRC-5 cells for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (
 <xref rid="b28-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). The suppression of NF-κB in inflammatory diseases by natural compounds derived from plants have been reported for inflammatory diseases by inhibiting its downstream targets viz., and inflammatory mediators iNOS, COX-2 and PGE2 (

 <xref rid="b47-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). The utilization of natural compounds as a potential treatment method in inflammatory airway diseases, for reversion to the healthy condition of cells or tissues, is a prime target of investigation. Therefore, the present study supports that terpenes in essential oil from the
