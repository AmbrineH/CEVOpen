<p class="p">Inflammation is a protective response to noxious stimuli that occurs unavoidably at a cost to normal tissue function, mainly depending on the type of cells and molecular mediators involved, and are classified as acute vs. chronic and local vs. systemic (

The characteristic features of several chronic inflammatory diseases are their persistence and predilection for certain sites. The prevalence of any disease is due to the lack of therapeutic targets which have no side effects during treatment. The mechanism underlying the development of inflammation and pathological pain in disease is associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, chemo-kines, adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases, followed by a decrease in anti-inflammatory interleukin secretion, the production of COX-2 and iNOS and activation of the NF-κB/Rel transcription family pathways (
