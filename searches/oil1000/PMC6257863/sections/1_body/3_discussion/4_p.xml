<p class="p">Inflammatory mediators, including eicosanoids, are biosynthesized by COX and lipoxygenase enzymes, in which the eicosanoid-generating enzyme, COX-2 has been found to be essential for the production of prostaglandins in inflammatory diseases (

 <xref rid="b36-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). The up-regulation of COX-2 leads to inflammatory cytokine release, which can further dictate the extent and type of inflammatory response from immune and non-immune cells. In chronic lung inflammation, pro-fibrotic and immunoregulatory Th2 cytokines are important in disease exaggeration (

The role of iNOS protein in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced airway inflammation and lung fibrosis further explains the function of this protein in defining the context of acute or chronic inflammatory response in disease exaggeration (
