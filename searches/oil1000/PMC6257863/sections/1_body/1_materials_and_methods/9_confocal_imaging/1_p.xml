<p class="p">Briefly, the cells were seeded on 15 mm microscope cover glass (Paul Marienfeld GmbH &amp; Co., KG, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) at a density of 5×10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates and grown overnight, followed by pre-treatment with essential oil and LPS stimulation for 24 h. For antibody labeling, the cells were first fixed with 37% formaldehyde and 95% ethanol (1:4) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by washing with 1X PBS three times (5 min/wash) and blocking with 1% BSA (Bioshop, Canada, Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada)/1X PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were probed overnight with a 1:100 ratio of diluted antibody (p-p65) at 4°C. Following washing with 1X PBS four times (7-10 min/wash), the cells were blocked with 1:250 diluted anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 594 conjugate Red at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed with 1X PBS and mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting solution on slides purchased from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA, USA) and were designated for confocal image analysis. All confocal images were captured with a ×20 oil objective (numerical aperture 3.5) lenses of Olympus Fluoview FV1000. FV10-ASW 3.1 viewer software (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to extract the images.
