<p class="p">The xenograft lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The tissues were then embedded with paraffin. The embedded paraffin was removed from the samples with 100% xylazine and dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol (95, 90, 80, and 70%). The tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin for 3 min and placed on 0.3% acid alcohol for differentiation. The samples were rinsed with Scottâ€™s tap water prior to exposure to eosin solution for 3 min. Following staining with hematoxylin and eosin, tissue samples were dried and protected with a cover slide. The samples were then observed under a light microscope.</p>
