<p class="p">Briefly, the WI38 cells, which had been pre-treated with 1-10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml phytoncide essential oil for 1 h prior to 5 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml of LPS for 24 h, were lysed overnight with RIPA lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, protease inhibitor and EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The extracted proteins were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to remove debris. The proteins were resolved using 10-12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto a poly-vinylidene difluoridemembrane (Immunobilon-P, 0.45 mm; EMD Millipore) using the TE 77 Semi-Dry transfer unit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chalfont, UK). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween-20 (TBS-T, pH 7.4) or 1X phospho blocking solution (TransLab Biosciences, Daejeon, Korea) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were probed with a 1: 1,000 dilutions for the primary antibodies viz., iNOS, p65, p-p65, IκB-α and 1:250 for COX-2 at 4°C for overnight. The membranes were washed five times with TBS-T, and were then incubated with diluted enzyme-linked secondary antibodies at 1:1,000 for anti-rabbit, 1:2,000 for anti-goat and 1:3,000 for anti-mouse at room temperature for 3 h. The membranes were then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit and western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). ImageJ software v.1.51u (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify each protein band, followed by densitometry reading performed following normalization with the expression of β-actin.
