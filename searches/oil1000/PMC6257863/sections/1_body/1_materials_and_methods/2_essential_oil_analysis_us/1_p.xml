<p class="p">A GC/MS QP 2010 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a CBP5 fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>m film thickness; Shimadzu Corporation) was used for the analysis of the leaf essential oil constituents. The oven temperature was maintained at 40°C for 5 min, and then increased by 3°C/min to 220°C and increased again by 10°C/min to 280°C and held for 5 min. The injector temperature was 300°C and the interface temperature was 230°C with the EI mode at 70 eV. He gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and the split ratio was 1:30. The MS scan range was m/z 35-500. Identification of the oil components was based on comparisons of relative retention indices calculated from a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons ranging between C7 and C30 and from the NIST11 database (
