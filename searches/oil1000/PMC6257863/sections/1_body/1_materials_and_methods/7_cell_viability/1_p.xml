<p class="p">To assess WI38 cell compatibility, the cells were seeded at a density of 6×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates and treated with various concentrations of phytoncide essential oil (1-50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml) and LPS (1-10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml) followed by incubated at 37°C for 24 h. An MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. Following treatment, MTT solution (5 mg/ml in 1X PBS) was added followed by incubation for 3 h at 37°C in the dark. The formazan crystals formed were solubilized by incubating cells with 500 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l of DMSO. Cell absorbance was read by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at 540 nm. Cell proliferation was quantified as a percentage compared with the positive control and negative control group accordingly, which was set at 100%.
