 <italic class="italic">C. obtusa</italic>) leaves (&lt;1 cm in length) were kindly provided by Napoli Co., Ltd. (Tonyoung, South Korea) in May 2017. The leaves (~600 g) were placed in a 2 l round-bottom flask with 1.2 l de-ionized water and a Clevenger-type apparatus was then attached to collect the essential oil. Following 11 h of steam distillation, the volume of essential oil was measured, and the oil was then transferred to a 15 ml vial and weighed. The oil yield was calculated according to the following equation: Essential oil (w/w%) = (weight of essential oil/weight of hinoki leaves) x 100.
