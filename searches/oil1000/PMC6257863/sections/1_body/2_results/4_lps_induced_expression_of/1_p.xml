<p class="p">In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of phytoncide essential oil, western blot analysis was performed. The experimental results of the western blot analysis determined that 5 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml LPS markedly increased the expression of iNOS and COX-2 at 24 h duration in the WI38 fibroblast cells compared with the untreated control group of WI38 cells. Pre-treatment of the WI38 cells with 1-10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml phytoncide essential oil for 1 h led to a significant decrease in the expression of iNOS in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in the LPS-stimulated cells at 24 h. Furthermore, phytoncide essential oil significantly suppressed the production of COX-2 in the LPS-stimulated WI38 cells at 5 and 10
