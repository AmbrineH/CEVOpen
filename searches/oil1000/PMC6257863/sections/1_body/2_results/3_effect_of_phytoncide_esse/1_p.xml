<p class="p">The effect of phytoncide from hinoki leaf extracted essential oil on the viability of WI38 cells was measured at doses ranging between 1 and 50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml and of LPS concentrations ranging between 1 and 10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml using an MTT assay following incubation of the cells for 24 h (
 <xref rid="f3-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). It was observed that cell viability was not affected until a 10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml dose of phytoncide essential oil and significant cell growth inhibition (47%) was observed at the 50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml dose. LPS stimulation led to changes in cell morphology at 5 and 10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml concentrations, compared with the subsequent control. The selected concentrations of phytoncide essential oil were 1-10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml based on the cell compatibility comparing with control; the LPS stimulatory dose was selected as 5 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml based on the morphological changes. It was observed that the normal fibroblast morphology of cells was altered, exhibiting swelling and pseudopodia formation in the LPS-stimulated cells. Furthermore, it was observed that pre-treatment with 1-10 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml concentrations of phytoncide essential oil significantly reduced the stimulated swelling and pseudopodia formation induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="f3-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>). Therefore, these data indicate that the morphological observation of WI38 fibroblast cell inflammation by LPS can be suppressed by the terpenes of essential oil from
