<p class="p">To evaluate the effect of phytoncide essential oil on rats via olfactory stimulation, the lungs were removed followed by subsequent fixing and staining. In order to investigate the histopathological changes in the phytoncide essential oil-administered or inhalation model, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed. It was observed that xenograft lung tissues in the test group showed more alveoli in the lungs than the control group (

No significant difference between the control and test group was found when comparing the thickness of the interstitial space layer, with the exception ofin the nucleus. There was no exudate found inside the alveolar layer. An increase of spontaneous volume and a decrease in alveolar dead space were observed. In addition, no toxic interstitial pneumonia or inflammation was observed in the test group rats, confirming that there was no microbial infection in the lungs. This observation indicates that the airway inhalation of phytoncide essential oil by Sprague-Dawley rats did not cause any microbial infection or inflammation over the course duration of phytoncide administration. Instead, there was an enhancement in the breathing capacity of the lungs.
