<p class="p">NF-κB is activated at sites of inflammatory disease. To confirm the anti-inflammatory role of phytoncide essential oil in WI38 cells, the expression of inflammatory proteins were detected and evaluated. The phosphorylation of NF-κB or translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus of the WI38 inflamed cells were observed via immunofluorescence. The confocal imaging results indicated that the LPS-treated cells exhibited a marked increase of p-p65 in the nucleus, compared with the untreated or negative control cells. The co-treated groups showed complete suppression of the expression of p-p65 in the nucleus of WI38 cells pre-treated with 5 and 10

Furthermore, the protein expression of the total form of p65 decreased in the LPS-stimulated group was significantly increased in the phytoncide essential oil co-treated groups, and NF-κB inhibitor or inactivated IκB-α protein also decreased following LPS-stimulation and increased in the phytoncide essential oil pre-treated group in the total cell lysate (
