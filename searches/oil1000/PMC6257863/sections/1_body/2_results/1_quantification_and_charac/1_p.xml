<p class="p">Steam distillation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. obtusa</italic> leaves produced a light yellow-colored oil with a yield of 1.59% (w/w) based on green leaf. The GC/MS analyzed peaks revealed &gt;24 components in the total ion chromatogram, as shown in 
 <xref rid="f1-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. A total of 23 compounds (
 <xref rid="tI-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table I</xref>) were identified from the leaf oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. obtusa</italic>. Among the leaf oil compounds, monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes were predominant (59.23%), followed by sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.65%). Among the monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes, sabinene (10.42%) and Î±-terpinyl acetate (18.89%) were the major compounds, with oxygenated sesquiterpenes carrying elemol (17.45%) as the main compound including sub major compounds listed in 
 <xref rid="tII-ijmm-43-01-0393" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table II</xref>. The compounds were identified with reference to previous studies (
