<p class="p">Alkanes represent between 70% to 80% of the wax cuticle constitution, which is indispensable to prevent uncontrolled water loss [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Therefore, their role in abiotic stresses such as salinity stress is crucial [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The well-reported presence of these compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. donax</italic> can be a sign of their adaptation to high salinity environments. Consequently, more studies must be conducted in order to completely characterize the presence of alkanes in other halophytic species. Some of the compounds included in this class are biologically active; for instance, tetradecane (

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], hexadecane (

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], heptadecane (

 <bold class="bold">10</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] and eicosane (
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] exhibited antimicrobial activities. In addition, nonacosane (
 <bold class="bold">20</bold>) seems to inhibit human gastric cancer cells BGC823 at 5 µM after 72 hours [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. It was also found that hentriacontane (
 <bold class="bold">22</bold>) significantly reduced all the parameters of inflammation in the conducted experiments at all the tested concentrations: 10 μM, 5 μM and 1 μM (in vitro) and 5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg (in vivo) [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. This emphasis the urge for more studies to understand alkanes’ role in salinity stress, but also the establishment of the alkane profiles of other Poaceaespecies.
