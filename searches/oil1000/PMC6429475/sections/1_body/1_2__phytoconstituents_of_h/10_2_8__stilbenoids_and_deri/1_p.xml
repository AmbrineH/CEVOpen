<p class="p">According to the literature, 13 stilbenoids and derivatives (
 <bold class="bold">272</bold>â€“
 <bold class="bold">284</bold>) were described solely in the alcohol extract of C. dactylon [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. These compounds are known for a wide spectrum of biological activities such as neuroprotection, cancer prevention, anti-obesity, anti-platelet aggregation, depigmentation, anti-diabetes and anti-atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. For instance, pallidol (
 <bold class="bold">278</bold>) has the ability to inhibit both cell growth in human cancer cells (HCT-116, HT29 and Caco-2 cell lines) [
 <xref rid="B152-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>] and the activity of protein kinase C [
 <xref rid="B153-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>], while parthenostilbenin A (
 <bold class="bold">279</bold>) and B (
 <bold class="bold">280</bold>) are able to inhibit lipid peroxidation (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 20.35 and 18.68, respectively) in rat liver homogenate [
 <xref rid="B154-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Stilbenoids are normally found in tea, berries and wine at high concentrations [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>] and their beneficial effects have been associated with antioxidant activity and thus, they have been considered of high nutraceutical value [
 <xref rid="B155-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of these compounds in the extracts of C. dactylon is considerably interesting.
