 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01067" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). The species with greater variety were 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. aquatica</italic> with five compounds each. Protocatechuic acid (
 <bold class="bold">94</bold>), only reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Z. aquatica</italic>, has been widely studied for its biological activities. A full review on this aspect was performed by Kakkar and co-workers (2014), emphasizing its antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antiaging, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects [
