<p class="p">In addition to the classes discussed above, other compounds belonging to miscellaneous chemical families were reported in halophytes from the Poaceae. Among these, two cyanogenic glucosides were described (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01067" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). These compounds are toxic due to hydrogen cyanide release upon enzymatic breakdown and are present in more than 2650 plant species, including edible plants. Hydrogen cyanide derived from cyanogenic glucosides can lead to cell death through cytochrome oxidase blocking and ATP production arrestment. Symptoms of cyanogen poisoning include vomiting, nausea, dizziness, weakness, and occasionally death [
