<p class="p">Concluding, all fatty acids have important roles in human physiology [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Halophytic grasses seem to be rich in these compounds, especially 
 <italic class="italic">A. donax</italic>, since 21 fatty acids were reported in its extracts. This data supports the use of this species for alimentation purposes as well as a new source of bioactive molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. The requirement of fatty acids for resistance to salt stress could enhance the production of these compounds, making halophytic grasses a remarkable source of them. Nonetheless, more studies need to be conducted in order to fully comprehend the presence of this class of compounds in halophytes.
