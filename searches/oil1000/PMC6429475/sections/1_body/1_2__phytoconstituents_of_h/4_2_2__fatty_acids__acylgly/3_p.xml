<p class="p">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contribute greatly to the resistance to photoinhibition of halophyte species, with their concentration increased in membrane lipids, which enhances the tolerance of photosystem II to salt stress [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. This could explain the wide distribution of these compounds among halophytic grasses (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01067-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). PUFAs are also gaining attention of the scientific community due to their broad pharmacological properties [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. An important aspect of these compounds is the direct link between dietary PUFAsâ€™ content and lower blood cholesterol levels [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], which is observed for instance with linolenic acid (

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. In addition, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoporosis, anticarcinogenic, neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties of linolenic acid have also been studied [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. At the same time, linoleic acid (
 <bold class="bold">50</bold>), another polyunsaturated fatty acid, is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotriene, a fact recognized over the last century [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Several studies have also reported its antimicrobial [
