 <bold class="bold">226</bold>) (only described in 
 <italic class="italic">Z. aquatica</italic>) proved their value as an anti-fatigue agent, by inducing structural and metabolic changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles, ultimately leading to endurance capacity (dietary administered, 1 mg/kg dose) [
 <xref rid="B134-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. This compound also possesses the ability to stimulate myocardial angiogenesis through rising protein levels and activation of canonical angiogenesis pathway (dietary administered, 1 mg/kg dose) [
 <xref rid="B135-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. Kaempferol (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>: 0.5 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>], anti-inflammatory (oral administered, 15.8 mg/kg/day dose) [
 <xref rid="B140-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>], antihypertensive (dietary administered, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg doses) [
 <xref rid="B141-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>] and hypolipidemic activities [
 <xref rid="B142-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. The same activities are also recognized in quercetin (
 <bold class="bold">238</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B143-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>,

 <bold class="bold">241</bold>) has a vast array of health benefits and pharmacological activities which includes antinociceptive, antarthritic, anti-diabetic, hypercholesteraemic, antiplatelet aggregation and antiasthmatic activities. A recent and complete review on this aspect, led by Ganeshpurkar and Saluja, (2017), is available [
 <xref rid="B145-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. These inherent properties of flavonoids categorize them as a class of beneficial compounds that have health-promoting and disease-preventing effects.
