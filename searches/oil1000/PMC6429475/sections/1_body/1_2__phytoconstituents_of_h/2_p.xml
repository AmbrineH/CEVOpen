<p class="p">Studies have reported the presence of alkanes and alkenes, fatty acids and acylglycerols, cinnamic acids, benzoic acids, short chain carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, amino acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenoids, tocopherols, flavonoids as well as other polyphenols, alkaloids, stilbenoids and derivatives and other miscellaneous compounds (

 <italic class="italic">C. dactylon</italic> has 11 classes, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">S. spontaneum</italic> with 8, 
 <italic class="italic">A. donax</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic> with 7, and 
 <italic class="italic">I. cylindrica</italic> with 6, the remaining species have between 1 and 4 classes of compounds reported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01067-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). This puts in evidence the lack of research in some of the species discussed in this review. For instance, in 
 <italic class="italic">P. clandestinum</italic>, only 4 compounds were described although distributed in 2 classes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01067" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). In spite of this, the phytochemical investigations have revealed that many compounds are highly bioactive. The complete description and distribution of the compounds reported in each species are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01067" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. Some chemical families such as alcohols, aldehydes and ketonesare not going to be explored in the text due to its lack of relevance from a medicinal and/or nutritional point of view. Others, such as tocopherols and alkaloids, will not be explored due to the low number of compounds described in halophytes from the Poaceae.
