<p class="p">The Poaceae is a large family of monocotyledonous plants, commonly recognized as grasses, representing the most important group of crops [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. This family encompasses several noteworthy cultivated species such as 
 <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Oryza sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Zea mays</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Hordeum vulgare</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. It comprises of 7500 species [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] distributed worldwide and with a wide spectrum of climatic adaptations. Remarkably, grasses also show extreme ranges in salinity tolerance, from salt sensitive (glycophytic) to extremely tolerant (halophytic) [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">Poa annua</italic> L. is highly sensitive, 
 <italic class="italic">Paspalum dilatatum</italic> Poir. is moderately salt tolerant and 
 <italic class="italic">Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers. is completely tolerant (true halophyte) [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. A completely salt tolerant species is defined by the ability to complete a life cycle in a salt concentration of at least 200 mM of NaCl [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Nowadays, 1560 species from 550 genera and 117 families [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] are known to have salt-tolerance, among these the Poaceae family includes 65 genera and 148 species [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] of halophytes.
