<p class="p">Halophytes can keep and acquire water, protect cells from the damage caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and maintain ion homeostasis in salty stressed environments through a variety of adaptations [

 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In this vein, they can be crucial for the prevention of a variety of diseases as, for instance, cancer, chronic inflammation, and cardiovascular disorders when introduced in the human diet [
