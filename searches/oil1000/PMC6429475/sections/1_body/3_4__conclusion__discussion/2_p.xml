<p class="p">Regarding the biological activities, the extracts and essential oils of halophytic grasses exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities; nonetheless, the effects of the isolated compounds were not greatly explored in these species. In addition to this gap, the activity studies were only performed in 10% of the total diversity of halophytic grasses, which puts in evidence the lack of knowledge regarding these species. Furthermore, some halophytes from Poaceae with remarkable activities such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. colona</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. indica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">D. aegyptium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. australis</italic> have no information available regarding their chemical composition, which is essential to establish the modes of action. A link between the compounds reported in the 
 <italic class="italic">taxa</italic> and their activity, when available, was made. Nonetheless, in some cases, few compounds were reported in the polar fraction, which was the most studied among all cases. Additionally, the activity of the extracts normally occurs due to the synergetic interaction of different compounds. At last, no study regarding the toxicity of the extracts as well as the mechanism of action responsible for the effect was performed. It is also important to highlight that, in some cases, the methods used to assess the activity of the extracts were not the best suited. For instance, in several cases, the method used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the extracts was disk diffusion. Nonetheless, this presents many disadvantages: using volatile compounds could lead to reduced zones of inhibition and poorly soluble compounds do not diffuse uniformly through the agar matrix [
