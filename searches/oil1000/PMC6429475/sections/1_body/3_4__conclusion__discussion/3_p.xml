<p class="p">Concluding, the findings in the reviewed papers highlighted the great potential of halophytes from Poaceae as sources of bioactive molecules as well as biological properties and an opportunity for development of value-added products for nutraceuticals and food applications. In addition to the health benefits that this species might bring, it also secures the future of modern agriculture due to increased soil salinity. Nonetheless, halophytic grasses are yet to be explored since these investigations were only conducted in few 
 <italic class="italic">taxa</italic>. Furthermore, several gaps in our understanding of its application still exist. The biological properties revealed in the different extracts need to be complemented with research into clinical application. Although no serious marked effects have been reported in these species, further toxicity and safety evaluation of the extracts and chemical compounds isolated from the species should be carried out.
