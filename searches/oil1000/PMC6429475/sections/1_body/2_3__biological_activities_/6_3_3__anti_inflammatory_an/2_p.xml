<p class="p">The ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic> rhizome showed anti-inflammatory activities due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [
 <xref rid="B176-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. Compounds typical extracted by polar solvents, such as ethyl acetate, with anti-inflammatory activities were not reported in 
 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic>, with the exception of cholest-22-ene-21-ol; hence, it is not possible to infer a secure relationship between the known chemical composition and the reported activity.
