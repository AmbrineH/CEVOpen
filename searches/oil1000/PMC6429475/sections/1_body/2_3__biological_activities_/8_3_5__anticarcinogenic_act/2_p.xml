<p class="p">The methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">D. bipinnata</italic> roots displayed dose-dependent anticarcinogenic activity (between 25–400 µg/mL) against human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa), human laryngeal epithelial carcinoma cells (HEp-2), and mouse embryo fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) [

 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic> alcohol and successive extracts of both aerial and root parts were active against lung (A-549), intestinal (CACO), colon (HCT-116), cervical (Hela), hepatocellular (HepG-2) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines with IC
