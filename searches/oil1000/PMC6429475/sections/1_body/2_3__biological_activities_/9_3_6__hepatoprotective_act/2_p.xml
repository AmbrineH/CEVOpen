 <italic class="italic">D. bipinnata</italic> has proven to be hepatoprotective since its polyphenolic fraction was able to combat hepatoxicity in rats. This fraction is thought to protect the liver by free radical scavenging activity, ultimately leading to lipid peroxidation prevention at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day [
 <xref rid="B212-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. Once again, the active principles are not known and the components of this polyphenolic fraction were not identified [
 <xref rid="B212-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. The methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">E. colona</italic> also showed dose-dependent hepaprotective activity until 200 µg/mL in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells [
 <xref rid="B213-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. Similarly, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic class="italic">E. indica</italic> showed hepatoprotective effects against hepatoxicity in rats with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 2350 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B214-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. Rehman and co-workers (2017) demonstrated the hepatoprotective activity of methanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">I. cylindrical</italic>, which was confirmed by the normalization of plasma markers after treatment with this extract [
 <xref rid="B215-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>]. Little information is known about the polar chemical composition of this species and therefore, no correlation between the phytoconstituents and the activity can be performed.
