<p class="p">The ethanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">D. aegyptium</italic> revealed antifertility activity, evident through reduced sperm count after treatment as well as reduced weight of reproductive organs and serum hormonal levels [
 <xref rid="B216-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>]. The compound(s) responsible for this activity are not known [
