 <italic class="italic">C. ciliaris</italic> has been traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal disorders [
 <xref rid="B176-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>] and this practice has been confirmed by pharmacological studies proving their spasmolytic and antidiarrheal activities. Its ethanol extract showed dose-dependent protective effects against diarrhea and gastrointestinal motility (100 and 200 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], which may be due to blockage of Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> channels. In addition, this plant extract showed antiemetic activity (75, 100 and 150 mg/kg), which might be related to the presence of flavonoids, tannins, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">D. bipinnata</italic>’s ethanol extract displayed similar results; however, the active principles are still unknown [
 <xref rid="B177-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Moreover, its hydroalcoholic extract, at doses of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, showed laxative and diuretic effects. The acute toxicity (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, median lethal dose) of 
 <italic class="italic">D. bipinnata</italic>’s ethanol and hydroalcoholic extracts was assessed as 2000 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B177-ijms-20-01067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Several flavonoids known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have been described in these species; nonetheless, the mechanisms of action, as well as the active principles, are still unknown [
