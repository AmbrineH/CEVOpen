<p id="p0115" class="p">To examine in more detail the results of the experiments conducted at 160°C, the product distribution at a similar conversion level of about 50%–60% was analyzed (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Two critical ratios of products' groups were considered. The ratio Σ(4–7)/Σ(2,3) was used to define the selectivity to monocyclic products produced by the cleavage of the C–O ether bond. The ratio Σ(5,7)/Σ(4,6) indicates the selectivity to HDO after ether bond cleavage, which reflects the ability of the catalyst to execute the following reaction sequence: phenol → cyclohexanol → cyclohexene → cyclohexane. Evolution of the product selectivity with time at 160°C is given in
