 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows that diphenyl ether was converted into three main products: cyclohexyl phenyl ether (22%–25%), cyclohexanol (29%–36%), and cyclohexane (27%–38%). Small quantities of dicyclohexyl ether, phenol, and benzene were also found in the reaction mixture (individual selectivity values lower than 11%). Σ(4–7)/Σ(2,3) ratio higher than 1 was observed for all the Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts. This observation indicates the formation of monocyclic products to prevail over the partial or full saturation of diphenyl ether. The latter renders the bicyclic products 2 and 3, respectively. With the rise in Ni content in Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts (from 5 to 25 wt %), a gradual reduction in the Σ(4–7)/Σ(2,3) ratio (from 2.57 to 2.03) was observed. Taking the results from the experiment carried out in the presence of 25 wt % Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst into account, the reduction in the Σ(4–7)/Σ(2,3) ratio is related to the accumulation of dicyclohexyl ether in the reaction mixture. As previously reported, dialkyl ethers are not prone to undergo hydrogenolysis in the presence of Ni catalysts under relatively mild reaction conditions (
