<p id="p0135" class="p">According to the results from 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, 10%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts present the best balance between HDO extent and selectivity to monocyclic deoxygenated products. These catalysts were thus chosen for the conversion of diphenyl ether carried out at 200°C. 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows the monitoring of the reaction mixture components over time. For both experiments, full conversion was achieved at 180 min. Cyclohexane was the main product obtained, with selectivity values of 81% and 88% for the 10%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O catalysts, respectively. These results confirm that the dehydration of cyclohexanol is encouraged at 200°C. At 180 min, the HDO extent and DOD were both greater for 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> (HDO extent: 91%; DOD: 85%) than for the 10%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst (HDO extent: 82%; DOD: 72%). Based on these results, 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst was considered as the most efficient. Thus the 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst was selected for the recycling experiments and studies on the conversion of lignin oil.
