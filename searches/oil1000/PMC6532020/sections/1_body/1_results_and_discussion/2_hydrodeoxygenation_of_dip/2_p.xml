<p id="p0100" class="p">To investigate the different catalyst functionalities, the hydrotreating of diphenyl ether was carried out at two temperatures, 160°C and 200°C. These two conditions were chosen because dehydration of alcohols has significant enthalpic barriers for the formation of carbocations (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), meaning that relatively high temperatures are required for the alcohol dehydration. By this choice, the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation extents can be better discerned in the experiments carried out at 160°C, whereas the performance for the full HDO of diphenyl ether is better addressed by the experiments performed at 200°C.
