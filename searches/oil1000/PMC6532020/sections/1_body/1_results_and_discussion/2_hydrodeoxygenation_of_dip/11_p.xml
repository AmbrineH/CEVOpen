 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows that the catalyst presents a sustained performance, still producing a 91% yield of cyclohexane after five reaction runs. A slight decrease in the cyclohexane selectivity is, however, observed from the second to fourth reaction runs, with the formation of cyclohexanol and dicyclohexyl ether (around 4%–5% each) from the third cycle on. These results translate into a slight decrease in both HDO extent (from 100% to 92%) and DOD (from 100% to 94%) throughout the recycling experiments.
