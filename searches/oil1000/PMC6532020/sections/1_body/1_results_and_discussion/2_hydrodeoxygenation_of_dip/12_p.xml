 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows the ATR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the fresh catalysts and spent samples after five reaction runs. The data indicates that the population of Brønsted acid sites dramatically decreased after five successive reuses of the catalyst. This means that even though water is generated during the reaction, no regeneration of Brønsted acidity takes place in the process. In this context, the accumulation of cyclohexanol appears to be related to a decrease in the population of Brønsted acid sites. On the other hand, Lewis acidity is preserved, which explains the sustained high selectivity to cyclohexane at 200°C, demonstrating that Nb

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> Lewis acid sites are stable under the reaction conditions. Moreover, a modest decrease in BET surface area was observed (fresh catalyst: 180 m

Also, no significant change in the Ni average crystallite size occurred after five reaction runs (fresh catalyst: 14 nm versus spent catalyst: 15 nm). Finally, the comparison of STEM-HAADF images (
