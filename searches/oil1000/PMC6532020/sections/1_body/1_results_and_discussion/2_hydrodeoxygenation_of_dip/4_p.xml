 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> by evaluating the HDO extent achieved by the reaction network as a function of time for the conversion of diphenyl ether at 160°C. As expected, an increase in HDO extent with time for all tested catalysts was observed. By analyzing the results obtained at 180 min (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>B), the HDO extent increased linearly from 28% to 46% with the rise in the Ni content (from 5 to 25 wt %). On the other hand, as expected at this temperature, low DOD was obtained for all catalysts at 180 min, with a decrease being in general noticed with the increase in Ni content, owing to the decline in the Brønsted acidity, as previously discussed. In these experiments, conversions of diphenyl ether in the range of 55%–98% at 180 min were achieved (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>B). A blank test and a catalytic run with the pure Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> were also carried out (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). By stark contrast, in these control experiments, only very low conversion of diphenyl ether (8% and 15%, respectively) was achieved at 180 min, with no selectivity to a specific product. Furthermore, to verify whether there is a contribution of the leached species to the reactions, the catalyst 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> was contacted with the solvent under the same conditions of the reaction. After this, the catalyst was separated from the liquid product, and then diphenyl ether and the internal standard were added to the reaction media for reaction run. The results were similar to those of the blank reaction, confirming that the catalytic process is exclusively taking place on the catalyst surface.
