 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts was evaluated for the conversion of diphenyl ether as a model reaction. The cleavage of diphenyl ether serves as a model reaction for the breakdown of 4-O-5 ether linkages occurring in lignins. Owing to its high bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE: 330 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), the 4-O-5 linkages are resistant against cleavage via non-catalytic thermal processes, compared with α-O-4 and β-O-4 ether linkages occurring both in native and technical lignins (BDE: 215 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for α-O-4 in phenylcoumaran subunits, and 290–305 kJ mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for β-O-4 in lignin's aryl alkyl ether-bonding motifs) (

Therefore, the ability of a Ni catalyst for hydrogenolysis can be evaluated with little contribution of thermolysis to the overall reaction results. In this instance, diphenyl ether is also a useful model compound for another reason. It allows for the evaluation of the activity of the Ni phase toward hydrogenation of phenol and benzene, the intermediates formed by the hydrogenolysis of diphenyl ether. In the presence of acid sites, the intermediate mixture is ultimately funneled to cyclohexane, as schematically represented by the reaction network presented in
