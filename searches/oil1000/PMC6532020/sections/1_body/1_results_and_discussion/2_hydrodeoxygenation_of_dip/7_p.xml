<p id="p0125" class="p">The results in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> also shows a rise in the selectivity to cyclohexanol (from 6% to 11%) for the experiment carried out in the presence of 25 wt % Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst. This outcome agrees with the decrease in Brønsted acidity at a high Ni content supported on Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, as verified by ATR-IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the reduced Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) and model reaction experiments (dehydration of cyclohexanol, 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the increase in Ni loading on Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> has implications for both the accumulation of dicyclohexyl ether (i.e., raises the likelihood of full saturation of diphenyl ether to dicyclohexyl ether) and of cyclohexanol (i.e., lessens the extent of dehydration of cyclohexanol).
