<p id="p0130" class="p">The product distributions in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> show similar values of selectivity to cyclohexanol and cyclohexane, revealing that Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> plays a marginal role in the HDO extent at 160°C. Under these conditions, low DOD values (5%–12%) were achieved. The catalyst's ability to dehydrate cyclohexanol significantly reduces with the rise in Ni content, as indicated by the decrease in the Σ(5,7)/Σ(4,6) ratio from 1.40 to 0.81. The decrease in the dehydration capability is correlated with the decrease in the number of Brønsted acid sites with the increase in Ni content, as discussed in the previous section.
