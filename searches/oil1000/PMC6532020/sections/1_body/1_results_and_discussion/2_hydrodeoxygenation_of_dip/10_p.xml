<p id="p0140" class="p">The catalytic performance after five reaction cycles was investigated for the HDO of diphenyl ether at 200°C for 240 min using the 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst. Again, diphenyl ether serves as a model compound because, when targeting the full HDO of lignin streams, the accumulation of cyclohexanol (derived from hydrogenation of phenol) indicates a decay of the initial acidic properties of a bifunctional catalyst. After each reaction run, the catalyst was washed with solvent and reused in the following reaction run.
