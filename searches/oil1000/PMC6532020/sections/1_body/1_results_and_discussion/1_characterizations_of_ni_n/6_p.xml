 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalysts (after the reduction procedure), attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine (Py) were collected (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). We chose to assess the nature of acid sites by ATR technique because of the dark color of the activated Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, which hinders FTIR transmission experiments (as those performed on the Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> support). Pyridine adsorbed on the materials exhibits infrared (IR) bands at around 1,446 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1,606 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. These bands are related to the Py coordinated to Lewis acid sites. In addition, the IR spectra show bands at 1,639 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1,540 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which are assigned to the formation of the pyridinium ion (PyH
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) on Brønsted acid sites (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parry, 1963</xref>). An IR band of adsorbed Py common to both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites is also visible at 1,489 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. These observations indicate that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites are present in the Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods. From the relative intensities of Py adsorbed on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, it can be inferred that the Brønsted acidity decreases as the Ni loading increases, as indicated by the reduction in the intensities of the bands at 1,639 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1,540 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This finding is explained by the ion exchange of Brønsted acid sites by the positively charged Ni species. However, in the 25%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst, the support still presents some residual Brønsted acidity. Notably, the Lewis acidity (bands at around 1,606 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1,446 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) appears to be mostly preserved even at such a high loading of Ni on Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods.
