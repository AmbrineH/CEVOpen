 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> precursors (catalysts before reduction) are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The TPR profiles of Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> precursors exhibit two reduction events. The first occurs at around 335°C. This event is assigned to the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0). The reduction temperature of the Ni(II) species supported on Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods is much lower than that of bulk NiO (450°C) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Graça et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the range of Ni reduction temperatures between 320°C and 345°C is in line with previous studies on Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> materials containing high nickel loadings (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Janković et al., 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, and contrary to what has been previously observed by other research groups (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chary et al., 2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wojcieszak et al., 2006</xref>), no shift of the Ni reduction peak to higher temperatures with an increase in Ni loading was observed. As will be presented later, in the 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> material, the Ni nanoparticles are embedded in a nest formed by Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods (
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>). Thereby, such an entanglement of metal phase and oxidic support may result in few (but strong) connecting points between these phases so that an effect of the increase in the Ni loading on the reduction temperature of NiO species is not apparently observed. However, in the second reduction (at about 800°C), which is related to the partial reduction of Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> to NbO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wojcieszak et al., 2006</xref>), the temperature required for the reduction of Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> progressively decreases (from 870°C to 816°C) with increasing Ni content (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). This observation indicates that there is an interaction between Ni and NbO
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> phases in which the hydrogen spillover appears to be more prevalent for the samples containing higher Ni loadings.
