Hence, to further assess the effect of Ni loading on the acidic properties of the catalysts, cyclohexanol dehydration was carried out at 200°C. As will be presented in the next section, this reaction is key to produce cyclohexane from the conversion of diphenyl ether, as well as to obtain cycloalkanes from lignin.
