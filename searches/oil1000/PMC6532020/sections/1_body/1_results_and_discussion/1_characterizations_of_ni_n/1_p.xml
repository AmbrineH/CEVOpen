 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ko and Weissman, 1990</xref>). Notably, a high-intensity signal is observed at 22.8°, which is associated with (001) reflection of TT-Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>. In addition, a low-intensity and broad signal related to the (100) plane appears at 28.0°. As next confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) imaging, a preferred growth of TT-Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> along the (001) direction creates the preferential orientation feature in the XRD pattern, indicating the formation of TT-Nb

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ali et al., 2017</xref>). For the Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> materials, the XRD patterns demonstrated that the structural features of the TT-Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> phase were preserved after the reduction procedure. Hence, for simplicity, when referring to the materials produced in this study, the TT-Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> phase will be denoted as “Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>” henceforth. As expected, Ni(111) and Ni (200) reflections are observed at 44.6° and 52.1°. These reflections become more intense and sharper with an increase in Ni content from 5 to 25 wt %. Considering the Ni(111) reflection, the average Ni crystallite sizes estimated by the Scherrer equation grow from 7 to 15 nm with the rise in Ni content from 5 to 25 wt % (
