 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>, the sum of compounds visible by the GC technique corresponds to approximately half of the content of species occurring in the liquid products. To expand our analysis toward the heavy species, GPC was performed on the hydrotreated liquid products and residue fractions soluble in methanol. Noteworthy, when applied to product mixtures obtained from lignin, direct information regarding the content of species cannot be retrieved from an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) detector (in this study, a photodiode array [PDA] detector), as the detector response is not universal. Furthermore, in samples containing aliphatic hydrocarbons, these compounds will be invisible to the UV-vis detector. Despite these limitations, the GPC technique coupled with UV-vis spectroscopy provides useful information on the apparent distribution of
