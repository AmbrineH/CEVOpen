<p id="p0170" class="p">In the catalytic experiments, an 89% conversion of lignin in the first reaction run was achieved. For the liquid product obtained from the first reaction run, a substantial increase in the H/C ratio from 1.51 ± 0.01, for the lignin oil, to 1.80 ± 0.01 was achieved. In parallel, the O/C molar ratio decreased from 0.46 ± 0.01 to 0.006 ± 0.004 for the liquid product. These results demonstrate the extensive removal of oxygen and incorporation of hydrogen in the liquid product. In the subsequent catalyst reuse, the net conversion of lignin oil slightly decreased from 89% to 85%, for both the second and third reaction runs (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). For the liquid products, H/C ratios of 1.76 ± 0.01 and 1.75 ± 0.03 for the second and third reaction runs, respectively, were obtained. These values are slightly lower than those of the liquid products from the first reaction run (H/C:1.80 ± 0.01). On the other hand, O/C ratios substantially increased from 0.006 ± 0.004, for the first reaction run, to 0.14 ± 0.01 and 0.16 ± 0.01, for the second and third reactions runs, respectively. For the residue fraction soluble in MeOH, which corresponds to ca. 10% of the lignin-derived residues, the H/C ratio decreased from 1.73 ± 0.01 (first reaction run) to 1.62 ± 0.01 and 1.62 ± 0.06, for the second and third reaction runs, respectively. In parallel, O/C ratios rose from 0.29 ± 0.04 (first reaction run) to 0.33 ± 0.01 and 0.36 ± 0.01 for the second and third reaction runs, respectively. Altogether, the O/C and H/C ratios found for the liquid products and residues indicate that the catalyst's hydrogenation activity deteriorated to an extent lesser than that of the deoxygenation ability.
