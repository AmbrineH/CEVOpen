<p id="p0175" class="p">To gain an in-depth insight into the composition of the volatile fraction of the liquid products, GC-FID/MS analysis was carried out (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>). In the volatile fraction of the lignin oil (corresponding to 28% at an injector temperature of 300°C), the main components were

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-dihydrolignols caused the elimination of γ-OH group, rendering 4-propylguaiacol and 4-propylsyringol. Other products from the cracking of the propyl side chain were formed (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst, the primary volatile products were cycloalkanes (47%) and cyclohexanols (2%). Half of the cycloalkanes' fraction content corresponded to bicyclic aliphatic compounds. In the catalyst recycling, the content of cycloalkanes in the liquid product significantly decreased from 47%, for the fresh catalyst, to 8% and 5%, for the second and third reaction runs, respectively. As a result, the dominant species in the liquid products became cyclohexanols (31%–35%). The high content of monophenolic species (18–19%) reveals that the catalyst's hydrogenation ability was also impaired after the first use of the catalyst. However, the catalyst hydrogenation ability was affected to an extent lesser than that for the dehydration of cyclohexanol intermediates.
