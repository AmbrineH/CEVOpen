<p id="p0195" class="p">To gain further information about the chemical nature of the UV-absorbing species, the spectral data collected by the PDA detector in the GPC analysis was examined in detail (
 <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 16</xref>). In the samples from the first reaction run, a key feature distinguishing the PDA images is the presence of species absorbing at wavelengths higher than 300 nm for the residue fraction soluble in methanol (indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 16</xref> by a yellow-coded dotted line). In lignin chemistry, this spectral feature is often related to the presence of quinone methide intermediates, stilbene species, and other conjugated unsaturated species associated with lignin condensation processes (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmidt, 2010</xref>). Overall these observations suggest that, in the presence of the fresh 15%Ni/Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst, the condensation of lignin species could not entirely be suppressed by the reductive processes, as the former process appears to take place at a rate faster than the latter. Interestingly, similar PDA images are found for both liquid products and the residues soluble in methanol from the second and third reaction runs. These images show no strong absorption spot at wavelengths higher than 300 nm. Altogether, these observations support the hypothesis that Lewis acid sites of Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> play a role in the condensation of lignin species. As these sites become largely blocked in the first reaction run, the condensation of lignin species should occur to a lesser extent in the subsequent reaction runs. This hypothesis appears to be plausible also considering that the weight of lignin residue accumulated with the catalyst plateaued after the second reaction run (
