 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 12</xref> summarizes in a van Krevelen diagram the results obtained from the control experiment and catalyst recycling in the hydrotreating of lignin oil. In the absence of the catalyst, a 68% conversion of the lignin oil was achieved by thermal processes (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), increasing the H/C ratio from 1.51 ± 0.01, for the lignin oil, to 1.74 ± 0.02 for the liquid fraction. Conversely, the O/C ratio decreased from 0.46 ± 0.01, for the lignin oil, to 0.23 ± 0.01 for the produced liquid fraction. This decrease in O/C ratio is associated with the elimination of the γ-OH group of
