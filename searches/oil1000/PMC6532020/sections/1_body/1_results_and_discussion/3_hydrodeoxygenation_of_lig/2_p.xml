<p id="p0160" class="p">Throughout the catalyst recycling experiment, which processed in total ca. 6.0 g of lignin oil, the amount of lignin-derived residue increased from ca. 0.23 g (first run) to 0.30–0.31 g (second or third run, 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Logically, the accumulation of the lignin-derived residue impedes the precise determination of the initial quantity of substrate present in the second and third reaction runs, as it is not possible to discern whether a part of the lignin-derived residue was also consumed throughout the recycling experiment and replaced with a fresh, more oxygenated carbonaceous residue derived from the fresh substrate. Further exploration of the data listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, that is, the determination of weight ratio of liquid-product-to-residue, should be carried out with caution. A mass ratio of liquid-product-to-residue is only meaningful if both liquid product and residue present similar values of O/C and H/C ratios, which is not the case when the catalyst loses part of its performance in the recycling experiments.
