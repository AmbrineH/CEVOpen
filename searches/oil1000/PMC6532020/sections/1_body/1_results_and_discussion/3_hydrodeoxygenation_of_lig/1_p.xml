 <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst in the conversion of lignin oil, lignin oil was subjected to hydrotreatment under an H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressure of 7 MPa (measured at room temperature) at 300°C for 16 h. We chose to increase the reaction temperature from 200°C (as for the model compound experiments) to 300°C to encourage extensive HDO of lignin oil to cycloalkanes, leading to full conversion of lignin into products soluble in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-pentane (reaction solvent), thus avoiding the accumulation of lignin residues throughout the catalyst recycling experiments (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang and Rinaldi, 2012</xref>). However, even under harsh conditions, an appreciable amount of a residue insoluble in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-pentane or even methanol (a good solvent for lignin oil species) was formed and, thus, accumulated with the catalyst. Thereby, in this study, the “conversion of lignin oil” is estimated as a “net conversion,” which takes into account the weight of residue insoluble in either 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-pentane or methanol formed in each reaction run (in conjunction with the initial weight of fresh catalyst) and the amount of lignin oil added in each reaction run. For the catalyst recycling experiments, the spent catalyst was washed with methanol to extract soluble residue species. The spent catalyst containing lignin-derived residues insoluble in methanol was then recovered by filtration and dried at 40°C in a vacuum oven. The liquid products and the fraction of lignin residues soluble in methanol were characterized by elemental analysis, gas chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detector (FID)/mass spectrometry (MS), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
