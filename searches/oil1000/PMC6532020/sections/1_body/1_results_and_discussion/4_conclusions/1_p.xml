    <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
    <sub class="sub">5</sub>, the incorporation of the Ni phase reduces the population of Brønsted acid sites. However, the population of Lewis acid sites remained almost unaltered. The dehydration of cyclohexanol over Brønsted acid sites takes place at temperatures lower than those required for the reaction catalyzed by Lewis acid sites. By employing the hydrotreating of diphenyl ether to cyclohexane as a model reaction, it was possible to find a compromise between hydrogenation and dehydration catalyst's capabilities, thus taking the benefit from the catalyst Lewis acidity for the hydrotreatment. The 15%Ni/Nb
    <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
    <sub class="sub">5</sub> catalyst showed sustained results in the recycling experiments. As a result of the high stability of the water-resistant Lewis acid sites, a 91% yield of cyclohexane could be achieved even after five reaction runs.

   <p id="p0215" class="p">In the current literature on lignin hydroprocessing, little attention has been given to the fact that the acid sites, needed for the dehydration of cyclohexanol species, can also catalyze the condensation of lignin oligomeric species. In this study, we demonstrated that lignin condensation occurs even under reductive conditions and when beginning the process with passivated streams from the lignin-first biorefining based on reductive processes.</p>

    <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Samec, 2018</xref>). Confronting those results with the current ones, it is concluded that the control of the surface acidity is mandatory for the success of lignin oil hydrotreating. Further research is required to define the type of acidity and a threshold of acidity required for the hydrotreating of lignin while not encouraging acid-catalyzed condensation processes on the lignin oligomeric species. Surprisingly, such a research line has not been receiving much attention from the community. Indeed, often studied model compounds (e.g., diphenyl ether, benzyl phenyl ether, (alkyl)guaiacols, and several others) cannot undergo condensation reactions. Therefore, the crucial role of lignin condensation in hydrotreating processes cannot be mimicked by the current set of model compounds employed in this research field. This fact clearly limits the translation of technologies designed for the HDO of model compounds to the hydrotreating of real-world lignin streams.

   <p id="p0230" class="p">The balance of dehydration and hydrogenation abilities of a heterogeneous catalyst becomes a very complicated issue when considering the significant impact of lignin condensation throughout the hydrotreating process. Considering this, a tentative solution could be the utilization of two solid catalysts, one for hydrogenation and another one for dehydration, so that the balance of these specific tasks could be then more easily adjusted by the weight ratio of each catalyst component in the mixture of catalysts. This idea has been already exploited with success (
    <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang and Rinaldi, 2013</xref>). However, the conversion of a batch reaction process to a continuous flow process based on a mixture of catalysts constitutes a challenging task. A more practical approach appears to be the combination of flow-through reactors operating in series but at different temperatures. This approach could circumvent catalyst deactivation by the formation of coke via lignin condensation, by gradually saturating the lignin stream under conditions of gradual increase in process severity. A similar approach was demonstrated to be very fruitful for the hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil in the presence of Ni-Cu catalysts (
