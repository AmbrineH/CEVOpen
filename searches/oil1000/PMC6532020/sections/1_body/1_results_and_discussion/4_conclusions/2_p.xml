<p id="p0235" class="p">In a broader context, this work provides substantial evidence that the use of model reactions has severe limitations for the design of catalysts for the hydroprocessing of lignin streams. Accordingly, the catalyst screening carried out on real-world lignin streams is a more productive enterprise to pursue, regardless of the complexity of the product mixtures obtained. In this quest, the evaluation of H/C and O/C ratios as the response variables (either for the catalyst discovery or in recycling experiments) constitutes a strategy effective in the simplification of characterization procedures applied to the lignin products. Such a strategy should become a gold standard in the high-throughput screening catalysts for the hydroprocessing of lignin streams to produce drop-in lignin biofuels, as it allows for the direct comparison of catalyst performance without the need of scrutinizing the lignin product compositions at an early stage of technology-readiness levels (TRL), thus contributing to accelerating catalyst discovery.</p>
