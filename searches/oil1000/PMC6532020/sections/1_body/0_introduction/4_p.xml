 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods have not yet been explored in the chemistry of lignin hydrotreating. Therefore, this knowledge gap brought us to the study of nickel supported on hydrothermally stable TT-Nb

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods as a potential catalyst for HDO of lignin streams. As about 80% of the primary interunit linkages of lignin are ether bonds (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>), and a considerable number of other oxygenated functionalities are present in lignin-derived phenolics, a highly stable and highly acidic niobia could well hold the key to produce efficient catalysts for lignin-to-liquid fuels, owing to an expected synergism between metal phase and support toward lignin depolymerization and acid-catalyzed deoxygenation of intermediates formed throughout the HDO course (
