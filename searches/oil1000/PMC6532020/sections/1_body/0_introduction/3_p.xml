<p id="p0040" class="p">In an approach for lignin-to-liquid fuels, one of the challenges is to design inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability under process conditions. Since the hydrotreating of lignin streams releases water, the solid catalyst must be stable in the presence of water under high-severity conditions. Commercial niobia (Nb
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>⋅xH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) is a bulk amorphous material that lacks stability under hydrothermal conditions, thus losing surface area and leading to the sintering of supported metallic particles (

 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, various synthesis methods have been a subject of research in producing highly stable nanostructured materials (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanoparticles with no defined shape can be obtained by precipitation and sol-gel synthesis methods followed by calcination. These routes have extensively been studied in the preparation of the Nb

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> crystallization under low-severity solvothermal conditions constitutes another progress in this field. This synthetic route produces single TT-Nb

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods employs oleic acid and trioctylamine as structure-directing agents in the solvothermal synthesis. Especially for catalytic applications, the use of such structure-directing agents surfactants in the synthesis of Nb

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> presents disadvantages owing to their high costs, low volume of material production limitation, and the need to remove the agents via calcination, which may modify the morphology, particle size, and surface chemistry of Nb
