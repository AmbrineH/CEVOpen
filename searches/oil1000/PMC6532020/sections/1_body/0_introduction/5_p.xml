 <sub class="sub">5</sub> nanorods for the hydrotreating of a model compound (diphenyl ether) and lignin oil produced by a lignin-first biorefining process based on H-transfer reductive processes, the so-called catalytic upstream biorefining (CUB), which is also denoted as ‘
 <italic class="italic">reductive catalytic fractionation</italic>’ (RCF) by several research groups. CUB constitutes a class of methods for deconstruction of lignocellulose that renders high-quality pulps together with depolymerized and passivated lignin streams (
