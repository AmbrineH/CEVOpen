<p class="p">The different amounts of glucose resulted in a different yield of 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> cells. The counting chamber measurements performed on the glucose suspensions showed an increase in total cell concentration in the first days of incubation. The suspensions with an initial amount of 1% glucose had a final median of 1.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells/ml (95% confidence interval = [1.2 × 10

 <sup class="sup">8</sup>]) that included the total cell concentration at days 4, 5, and 6. The measurements of the 0.2% glucose suspensions showed already a similar total cell concentrations from day 1 onwards (days 1, 1.5, 4, 5, and 6), resulting in a median final total cell concentration of 1.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cells/ml (95% confidence interval = [1.7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>; 2.1 × 10
