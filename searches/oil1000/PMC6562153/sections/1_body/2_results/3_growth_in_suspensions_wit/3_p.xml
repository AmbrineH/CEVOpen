<p class="p">The median total cell concentration of the stand linseed oil suspensions after the extra oil supply at day 6 (Time ≥7 days) was significantly higher than the median concentration just before the extra oil supply (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013). The median CFU concentrations of the stand linseed oil suspensions after the extra oil supply (Time ≥7 days) were also significantly higher than before (at days 5 and 6). In contrast, the median total cell concentration of the raw linseed oil and olive oil suspension (set B) measurements at day 5 and the median total cell concentration of the measurements after the extra oil supply (at days 7, 8, and 12) were significantly similar (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.727, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.576), while the median CFU concentrations just before and after the extra oil supply significantly differed. In the case of the olive oil suspensions, the median CFU concentration after the extra oil (2.8 × 10 CFU/ml; Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) was even lower than the median CFU concentration before the extra oil (3.2 × 10 CFU/ml, 95% confidence interval = [3.3 × 10
