<p class="p">Staining of the cultivated cells with Nile red revealed the presence of fatty acids inside the cells of suspensions that initially contained 1% vegetable oil (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In suspensions with olive and raw linseed oil, red colored round shaped dots were observed at each selected time point during the first 8 days of incubation (starting at day 1). In suspensions supplemented with stand linseed oil, red dots inside the cells were recognized after 2 days of incubation. In suspensions with glucose as carbon source or without carbon intracellular, red dots were absent. Red colored halos were present around cells of each type of suspension.
