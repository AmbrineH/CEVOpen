<p class="p">The median of the CFU concentrations measured at days 3, 8, and 14 (Figure

 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In contrast, the median of the CFU concentrations of the 1% oil suspensions was significantly different compared to the median of the corresponding total cell concentrations (
