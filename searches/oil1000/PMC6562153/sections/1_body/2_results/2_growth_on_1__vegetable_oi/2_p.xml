<p class="p">The counting chamber measurements performed on the suspensions with 1% vegetable oil showed an increase in total cell concentration in the first few days of incubation (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This could not be observed in the CFU data, because CFU concentrations in the first few days were not measured (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The median final total cell and CFU concentrations of the different media are listed in Supporting Information Table
