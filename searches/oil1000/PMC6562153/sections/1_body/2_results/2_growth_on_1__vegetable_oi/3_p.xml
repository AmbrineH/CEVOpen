<p class="p">The median final total cell concentration and the median final CFU concentration of the raw linseed oil and olive oil suspensions both differed significantly from the no‐carbon suspensions (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The median final total cell concentration of the raw linseed oil suspensions was similar compared to the median cell concentrations of the olive oil suspensions (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.85). However, the median CFU concentration of the olive oil suspensions during incubation (Time &gt;0 days) was significantly higher than the median CFU concentration of the raw linseed oil suspensions (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The measurement at day 8 of the raw linseed oil suspensions (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) was significantly lower compared to the concentration at days 3 and 14 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
