<p class="p">Each suspension contained 98–99 v/v % MM and 1 v/v % 
 <italic class="italic">Aureobasidium</italic> inoculum. The total cell concentration in a suspension at the start of cultivation was between 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> and 10 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/ml. The type and amount of the carbon‐based nutrient used varied (Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The different carbon‐based nutrients tested were as follows: raw linseed oil (Vereenigde Oliefabrieken; iodine value 183 and 0.81% free fatty acids), stand linseed oil (Vliegenthart, viscosity P45), olive oil (Carbonel, extra vierge, iodine value 82 and 0.34% free fatty acids), and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc> (+) glucose (Merck, anhydrous for biochemistry). Most tested media contained the concentration of 1 w/v % (10 g/L), further referred to in this paper as 1% (Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, glucose was used with an initial concentration of 0.2 w/v % (2 g/L) and raw linseed oil with an initial concentration of 0.02 w/v %, further referred to in this paper as 0.2% and 0.02%, respectively. Suspensions with initially 1% vegetable oil and an extra oil supply during incubation had a second oil addition (1 w/v %) at day 6. In order to apply an oil addition that allows detectable population growth before nutrient depletion, the raw linseed oil suspensions with an initial concentration of 0.02% had a second oil addition at day 8 of 0.2%.
