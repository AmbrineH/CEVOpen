 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> cells cultivated in the shake flasks of sample set B and D. A 1 mg/ml stock solution of Nile red (9‐diethylamino‐5H‐benzo[alpha]phenoxazine‐5‐one, Sigma‐Aldrich) in acetone was prepared. 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> samples were obtained from glucose suspensions and suspensions with initially 1% raw linseed oil, 1% stand linseed oil, and 1% olive oil at least three times in the first 8 days of incubation (at days 1, 5, and 8 or at days 1, 2, 5, and 6). Cells were washed twice with 10 mmol/l ACES (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 80, pH 6–8 and resuspended in 0.1 ml ACES‐buffer with 0.02% Tween (Van Leeuwen, Golovina, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The Nile red solution (1 μl) was added and incubated for a minimum of 5 min at room temperature. Microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope, a Zeiss Plan NeoFluar 40×/0.75 objective, and a red 510–560 (FT 580, LP 590) filter.
