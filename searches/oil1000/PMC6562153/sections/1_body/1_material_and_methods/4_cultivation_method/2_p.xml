<p class="p">Each type of growth media was tested at least in one sample set, containing three replicates each, to enable analyses of the spread of the growth data. Multiple samples sets of the raw linseed oil containing media were tested in order analyze the reproducibility: Two samples sets of the initial 1% raw linseed oil suspensions that obtain a second oil addition (media 3) and two samples sets of the raw linseed oil suspensions starting with 0.02% raw linseed oil (media 9; Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Minimal media without an additional carbon source were used as control media: three times a set of three shake flasks suspensions with minimal media were tested. Incubation sets, each containing sample sets of one to four types of growth media (Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), were tested at different time points. Suspension volumes below 80 ml were incubated in baffled shake flasks (BELLCO 500 ml) with rotary shaking at 200 rpm, aiming at a uniform distribution of media components, oxygen, and cells. Suspensions were incubated at 25°C for at least eight, up to 28 days.
