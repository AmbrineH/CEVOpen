<p class="p">A cell count method was used to measure the total number of cells during cultivation, and a colony‐forming unit (CFU) count method was used to estimate the number of viable cells. Total cell counts were made of all suspensions. They were performed at the start of each experiment and at least four times during incubation. CFU counts were made of the 1% oil suspensions and their corresponding control suspensions without carbon at three different incubation times. CFU counts were made seven times during incubation for each type of 1% oil suspensions with a second oil feed. To obtain a biomass sample, cultivation at 200 rpm at 25°C was temporarily stopped. Each time up to 1.1 ml suspension was aseptically removed from a flask, directly after it was vigorously vortexed. A Bürker‐Türk counting chamber with a depth of 0.01 mm (Marienfeld) was used to count cells. In the case of the CFU count method, 1 ml of a decimal dilution series up to 10

Malt extract agar supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (MEA p/s) was used in duplicate for the 1% raw linseed oil CFU counts and in triplicate for 1% oil suspensions that obtained an additional oil supplement during incubation. MEA p/s was prepared according to Samson, Hoekstra, and Frisvad (
