<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> isolate CBS 140241, obtained from the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Centre, was used for all growth experiments. This isolate originates from oil‐treated wood in the initial stage of biofinish formation (Van Nieuwenhuijzen, Houbraken, et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). An 
 <italic class="italic">Aureobasidium</italic> inoculum was made with young hyaline yeast‐like cells. At first, biomass was obtained of the edge of an 8‐ to 18‐day‐old
