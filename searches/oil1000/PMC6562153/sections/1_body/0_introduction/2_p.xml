<p class="p">Timber situated outdoors and above ground is susceptible to discoloration caused by dark wood staining fungi. Dark staining of untreated wood is common, but also of coated and/or modified wood (De Windt, Bulcke, Wuijtens, Coppens, &amp; Acker,

 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Remarkably, some wood species impregnated with these oils have shown to form a beneficial homogenous kind of fungal‐based staining called biofinish (Sailer, Nieuwenhuijzen, &amp; Knol, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, after outdoor exposure of wood samples impregnated with stand linseed oil and untreated wood, none of the stained wood surfaces could meet the degree of surface coverage and pigmentation criteria of a biofinish. Currently, natural biofinish formation is exploited to manufacture and apply a sustainable wood protection system with decorative and self‐repairing abilities (Xyhlo Biofinish,
