<p class="p">The first aim of the study is to determine which of the vegetable oils that have been used to generate natural biofinishes provide carbon and energy for the growth of the biofinish‐inhabiting 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic>. The second aim is to determine the effect of the oil type and the amount of oil on the cell yield of 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> when cultivated with a vegetable oil as a sole carbon‐based nutrient. Raw linseed oil, olive oil, stand linseed oil, and the commonly used nutrient glucose were tested as sole carbon‐based nutrient in a shake flask test setup. Different amounts of carbon‐based nutrients were tested, including second oil additions during incubation, in order to gain insight in oil‐dependent growth. This way, a start was made to understand the effects of the use of different vegetable oils on natural biofinish formation of oil‐treated wood.
