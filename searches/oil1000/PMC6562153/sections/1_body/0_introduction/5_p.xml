<p class="p">The linseed and olive oils used to explore natural biofinish formation are complex substrates. Raw linseed oil and olive oil mainly contain triglycerides, but also contain small quantities of mono‐/diglycerides, phosphatides, triterpenes, fat‐soluble vitamins, carotenes, and chlorophylls (Karleskind, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). The triglycerides are derived from glycerol (C3 alcohol with three hydroxyl groups) and C16 and/or C18 fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of vegetable oils varies, especially between oil types (Karleskind, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>; Schuster, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Vegetable oils, including linseed and olive oil, are prone to autoxidation and photo‐oxidation (Juita, Dlugogorski, Kennedy, &amp; Mackie, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Psomiadou &amp; Tsimidou, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002b</xref>). Raw linseed oil is highly reactive due to the high number of conjugated polyunsaturated fatty acids, including linoleic acid (Stenberg, Svensson, &amp; Johansson, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Subsequent to oxidation processes the amount of double bonds in the oil will decrease, while cross‐links are formed between fatty acids of different triglycerides (Sailer, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Van den Berg, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Due to this process, a solid film of linseed oil can be formed in the presence of air (Lazzari &amp; Chiantore, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Olive oil mainly contains oleic acid and does not form a solid or highly viscous material upon exposure to air (Rheineck &amp; Austin, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1968</xref>). Stand linseed oil is made of raw linseed oil. It is produced by heating raw linseed oil to about 300°C for a few days, generally in the absence of oxygen (Juita et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Van den Berg, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The chemical reactions during this process include cross‐linking of triglycerides and isomerization of double bonds (Colombini, Modugno, &amp; Ribechini, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Van den Berg, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Zovi, Lecamp, Loutelier‐Bourhis, Lange, &amp; Bunel, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The final chemical composition of stand linseed oil is hard to measure. To which extent stand linseed oil, but also raw linseed oil and olive oil may be used as carbon and energy source by
