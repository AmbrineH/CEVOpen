<p class="p">In the case of the 0.02% raw linseed oil suspensions, a second increase in total cell concentration occurred after a second oil addition. This suggests that the first stationary phase is caused by a limitation in the amount of raw linseed oil available. It is unclear if the second stationary phase (final total cell concentration) is induced by the lack of raw linseed oil, by the lack of another essential nutrient or the accumulation of toxic compounds.</p>
