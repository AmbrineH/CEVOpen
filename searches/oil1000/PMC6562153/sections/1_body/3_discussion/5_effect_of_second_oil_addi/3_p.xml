<p class="p">In contrast to the suspension with initially 1% olive and raw linseed oil and a second oil supply, two stationary phases were observed in the total cell and CFU data of the stand linseed oil suspensions. The first stationary phase is assumed to be caused by a shortage of a consumable carbon and energy source, as both the cell and CFU concentration showed a further increase after the second oil supply. Probably the second stationary phase is caused by a limiting growth factor, other than the amount of oil available.</p>
