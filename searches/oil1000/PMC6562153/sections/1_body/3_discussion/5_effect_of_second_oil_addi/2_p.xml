<p class="p">Not all second oil additions showed an effect on the 
 <italic class="italic">A.Â melanogenum</italic> cell yield. In the case of the suspension with initially 1% olive and raw linseed oil and a second oil supply, a second oil increase in the total cell concentration was absent. This suggests that the oil present in the 1% oil suspensions is not a limiting growth factor. The significant increase after the second oil addition in CFU concentration of the initially 1% raw linseed oil suspensions lowers the credibility of this assumption, but the significant decrease in CFU concentration of the olive oil suspensions after the second oil supply indicates that the CFU method might not be very accurate.
