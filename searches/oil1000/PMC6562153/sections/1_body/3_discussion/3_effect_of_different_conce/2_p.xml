<p class="p">Fungal growth requires an organic carbon‐based nutrient together with several other elements such as water, nitrogen, and trace metals (Deacon,

 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Glucose is a commonly used carbon and energy source (Griffin, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). The glucose suspensions in this study showed fungal population growth and could be related to the amount of glucose used. In the tested oil suspensions, vegetable oils were the only carbon‐based nutrients present in the media. The median final concentration of the 1% glucose suspensions was similar to the 1% raw linseed oil suspensions (set A). This raises the question if the same mechanism, namely providing utilizable sources of carbon and energy, plays a role.
