<p class="p">The suspensions without a carbon‐based nutrient showed a mean total cell concentration during incubation in the same order of magnitude as the concentration at the start of the test. No gradual increase nor decrease of the total cell concentration in time was observed for the no‐carbon suspension of set B and set E. However, looking at the results of the no‐carbon suspension set A (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), a significant increase in total cell concentration appeared in the first 14 days of incubation. The CFU concentration data of this suspension set also showed an increase in time (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This increase could be either caused by measuring errors or it indicates that cell production has occurred. Fungal cell division or sporulation in media, where carbon‐based nutrients appear to be absent, has been mentioned in other studies (Parkinson, Wainwright, &amp; Killham, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>; Segers, Laarhoven, Wösten, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wainwright, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, it should be noted that it is unknown and, with respect to the general requirements for fungal growth, unlikely that cell production in media without carbon‐based nutrients is related to an increase in biomass of the fungal population.
