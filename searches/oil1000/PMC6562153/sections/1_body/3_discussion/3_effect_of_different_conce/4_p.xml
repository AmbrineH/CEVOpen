<p class="p">The different initial oil concentrations used had an effect on the fungal growth. The oil suspensions with 1% and 0.02% oil all showed an increase in total cells concentration, followed by a stationary phase (Figures 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). A stationary phase is generally caused by the lack of an essential nutrient or the accumulation of toxic compounds (Mazzoleni et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The median total cell concentration of the measurements performed on the oil suspensions related to the initial oil amount of 1% was at least 10
 <sup class="sup">8Â </sup>cells/ml in the stationary phase. These cell densities are within the range of yeast cell densities that can be grown under typical experimental conditions (Bath, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The initial amount of 0.02% raw linseed oil clearly resulted in a lower median stationary total cell concentration than when an initial amount of 1% oil was used. It shows that the final level of total cell concentrations depends on the concentration of oil used.
