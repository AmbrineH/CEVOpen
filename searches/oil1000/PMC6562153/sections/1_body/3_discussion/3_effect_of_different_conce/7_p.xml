<p class="p">The demonstration of oil‐related population growth and accumulation of fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> cells indicates that the tested olive oil, raw linseed oil, and stand linseed oil provide a carbon and energy for the growth of the biofinish‐inhabiting fungus in shake flak cultivation. The finding of oil‐related 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> growth when using raw linseed or olive oil as carbon‐based nutrient is in line with the findings of Peeters et al. (
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Although the methods to demonstrate growth differed, it indicates that various types of raw linseed oil or olive oil are suitable sources of carbon and energy for 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic>. To our knowledge, stand linseed oil has not been tested as carbon and energy source for 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> before. Therefore, the conclusion that stand linseed oil provides carbon and energy for 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> is restricted to the specific stand linseed oil that was used in this study.
