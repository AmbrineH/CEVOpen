<p class="p">The accumulation of fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> cells of the oil containing suspensions (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) indicates the uptake of fatty acids derived from oil present in the growth medium. First of all, it is likely that 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> has a fatty acid uptake and transport mechanism like other well studied fungal species, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">A. nidulans</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Candida neoformans</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. cerevisiae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> (Black &amp; DiRusso, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Dulermo, Gamboa‐Meléndez, Ledesma‐Amaro, Thévenieau, &amp; Nicaud, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Kretschmer, Wang, &amp; Kronstad, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Secondly, free fatty acids are present in the surroundings of the cells. Not only a low amount of FFA is present in vegetable oils, but likely the 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> cells will actively increase the amount of FFA in the oil suspensions. As mentioned before, 
 <italic class="italic">Aureobasidium</italic> is known to produce lipases, which may stimulate the breakdown of triglycerides in an oil containing suspension into FFA. Thirdly, the production of intracellular oil without the use of any extracellular oil from the media is unlikely. Several 
 <italic class="italic">Aureobasidium</italic> strains are known to produce intracellular oil when grown in an oil‐free medium (Manitchotpisit, Price, Leathers, &amp; Punnapayak, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wang, Li, Xin, Liu, &amp; Chi, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the study of Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), the production of intracellular lipids in an 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> strain is related to the amount of carbon‐based nutrient that is present in the medium. In this study, the 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> strain (CBS 140241) showed small intracellular lipid particles in the cells that were cultivated with oil, but it did not show intracellular fatty acid accumulation during cultivation in the oil‐free media (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Theoretically, the presence of extracellular oil might stimulate cells to produce intracellular lipids, but it seems unlikely that 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> can supply itself with carbon‐based nutrients that enable growth of cells and the production of intracellular fatty acid without the use of carbon‐based nutrients that were supplied to the medium.
