<p class="p">The median CFU concentrations of the oil suspensions were lower than the corresponding total cell concentrations. This difference can be attributed to the fact that total cell counts include dead cells and viable cells, while CFU counts only reveal the colony‚Äêforming ability of viable cells. In addition, the CFU counts are an estimate of the viable cells, because some CFU will represent a budding cell or agglomerated singles cells and not a well separated single cells (Sutton, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Manual CFU counts and total cell counts are both known for their high inherent error (Prescott,

 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). These methods are subjected to variety of random error including, sampling, dilution, and technician counting errors (Prescott,
