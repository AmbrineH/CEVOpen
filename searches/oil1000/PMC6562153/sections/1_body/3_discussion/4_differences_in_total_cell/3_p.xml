<p class="p">More distinct fluctuations were observed in the CFU concentrations along the time line of the incubated oil suspensions than in the corresponding total cell concentrations (Figures 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For example, the raw linseed oil suspension of set A showed a drop of CFU concentration at day 8, which significantly differed from the other data points (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In addition, the stand linseed oil suspension showed a lower median CFU concentration at day 5 than at day 2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), while the corresponding total cell counts had a similar concentration at these two time points (Figure 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These fluctuations in CFU concentration can be attributed to an actual fluctuation in viable cells, but are more likely related to the high measuring error of this method.
