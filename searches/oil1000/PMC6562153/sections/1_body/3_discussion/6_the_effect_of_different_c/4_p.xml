<p class="p">The total cell and CFU results indicated that in the case of an equal initial oil concentration, stand linseed oil provides less carbon and energy for 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> growth than olive and raw linseed oil. The stand linseed oil suspensions revealed a lower median final total cell and CFU concentration than the raw linseed and olive oil suspensions of set B (Figures 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). This could be explained by the degree of cross‐linked molecules. Stand linseed oil has a higher degree of cross‐linked triglycerides than raw linseed and olive oil (Zovi et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and cross‐linking can influence the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> on oil (Peeters et al., 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The lipases produced by 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> might be unable to act on big molecules of cross‐linked triglycerides. Other enzymes not produced by 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> are probably needed as well to breakdown the big molecules present in stand linseed.
