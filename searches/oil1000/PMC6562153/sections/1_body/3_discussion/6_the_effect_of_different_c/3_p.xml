<p class="p">The absence of a clear difference in cell growth between the use of olive and raw linseed oil in 1% oil suspensions might be explained by the absence of information on the initial growth behavior and the high amount of oil in the tested media. At first, the absence of a clear difference in the total cell yield of the 1% olive and raw linseed oil suspensions is surprising. For one thing, fungi are known to grow differently due to the use of different carbon sources (Sati &amp; Bisht,

 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> suspensions are suspected to free different amounts of potentially utilizable fatty acids and glycerol compounds when using different oil types, because substrate‐specific activities of fungal lipases are common (Avelar et al.,

However, comparing the final total cell concentration (stationary phase) of suspensions that are cultivated in conditions where the limiting growth factor is something other than the carbon‐based nutrient is probably not the best method to find differences between oil types. Parameters that can be obtained from the initial growth phase when sufficient data points are present, such as maximal growth rate, are more likely to be different in this type of growth conditions (Naher, Radziah, Halimi, Shamsuddin, &amp; Razi,
