<p class="p">A clear effect between the use of olive and raw linseed oil on the total cell yield in 1% oil suspensions is absent. The use of 1% raw linseed oil and olive oil as sole carbon‐based nutrient revealed similar final total cell concentrations. This conclusion is based on the results of the 1% raw linseed suspensions of set A and of the 1% oil suspensions with a second oil addition of set B (Figures

 <xref rid="mbo3764-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). It is unclear if the use of 1% raw linseed oil and olive oil as sole carbon‐based nutrient revealed similar final viable cell concentration. The median CFU concentration of all data points measured in the raw linseed oil suspensions with 1% oil at the start of the test was significantly different compared with the olive oil suspensions. However, this measured difference might be explained by the inaccuracy of the selected method. In the 1% oil suspensions (media 1, 2), the median CFU concentration of the raw linseed oil suspensions is significantly lower than the olive oil suspensions due to a drop in CFU concentration at day 8. In contrast, the initially 1% oil suspensions with a second oil addition show a higher median CFU concentration of measurements performed before the second oil addition for the raw linseed oil suspensions than for the olive oil suspensions. Again, the difference is due to a drop in CFU concentration at a single time point (day 6).
