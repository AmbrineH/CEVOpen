<p class="p">In this study, the final or stationary growth phase of different types of oil suspension is compared. It provides information on the use of vegetable as carbon and energy for the growth of the biofinish‐inhabiting fungus 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic>. It also shows effects of the oil type and the amount of oil on the cell yield of 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic>. Increasing the number of measurements performed on the oil suspensions in the first few days of incubation may allow the use of biological growth curves (Zwietering, Jongenburger, Rombouts, &amp; Van 't Riet, 
 <xref rid="mbo3764-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). This can provide a scientific backing for the data points that are included in a stationary growth phase. Also, variables, such as lag time, maximal growth rate, and moment of maximal growth, could provide additional information on the effect of the oil type and the amount of oil on the cell yield of 
 <italic class="italic">A. melanogenum</italic> when cultivated with a vegetable oil as a sole carbon‐based nutrient.
