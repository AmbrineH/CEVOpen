 <p> Colony‚Äêforming unit concentrations of Aureobasidium melanogenum (isolate CBS 140241) in liquid media with raw linseed oil, olive oil, or stand linseed oil as sole carbon source during shake flask cultivation (set C). The initial amount of oil was 1% (w/v). At day 6, a second amount of oil (approx. 1% w/v) was added. MEA plates were used to grow the fungal colonies. Each data point represents the average of three suspensions. Error bars denote the SD. For some points, the error bars were shorter than the height of the symbol </p>
