 <p> The development of Aureobasidium melanogenum cell concentrations in time of suspensions with 0.02% initial raw linseed oil and a second carbon source addition of 0.2 w/v % at day 8 (set E). The suspensions without carbon had no oil addition at day 8. Each data point represents the average of concentrations measured in three suspensions. Error bars denote the SD. For some points, the error bars were shorter than the height of the symbol </p>
