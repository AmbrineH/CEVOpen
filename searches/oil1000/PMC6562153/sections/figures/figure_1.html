 <p> Total cell concentrations of Aureobasidium melanogenum (isolate CBS 140241) in cultures of liquid media with 1% raw linseed oil, 1% olive oil, or without an additional carbon‚Äêbased nutrient during shake flask cultivation (set A). The amount of vegetable oil tested was 1% (w/v). A counting chamber was used to determine the cell concentrations. Each data point represents the average of three suspensions. Error bars denote the SD. For some points, the error bars were shorter than the height of the symbol </p>
