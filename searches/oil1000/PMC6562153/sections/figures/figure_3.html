 <p> Total cell concentrations of Aureobasidium melanogenum (isolate CBS 140241) in liquid media with raw linseed oil, olive oil, or stand linseed oil as sole carbon source during shake flask cultivation up to 12Â days. The initial amount of oil was 1% (w/v). At day 6, a second amount of oil (approx. 1% w/v) was added. A counting chamber was used to determine the cell concentrations. Each data point represents the average of three suspensions. Error bars denote the SD. For some points, the error bars were shorter than the height of the symbol </p>
