<p class="p">An Aldrich Mini Diazald apparatus was used for the production of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in ether. Briefly, 2.5 g of KOH was dissolved in 4 mL of deionized H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and then placed in the reaction vessel, followed by the addition of 5 mL of EtOH. A separatory funnel containing 2.5 g of diazald dissolved in 22.5 mL of ether was placed above the reaction vessel. The reaction vessel was warmed to 68 °C using a H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O bath, followed by the drop wise addition of the diazald soln. over a period of 40 min. The receiving flask and condenser cold finger were cooled using a dry ice/acetone bath. The co-distilled CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in ether soln. was stored in sealed vials at −20 °C until needed.
