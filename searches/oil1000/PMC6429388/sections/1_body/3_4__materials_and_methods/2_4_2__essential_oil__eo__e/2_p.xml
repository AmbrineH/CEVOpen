<p class="p">The beginning of the distillation in each replicate was noted when the first droplet of EO dropped from the condenser into the collecting unit of the apparatus. The EO fractions were captured at different timeframes: 0–5; 5–10; 10–20; 20–40; 40–80; 80–160; 160–240; and, 0–240 non-stop control for 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> and 0–3; 3–5; 5–10; 10–20; 20–40; 40–80; and, 0–80 min non-stop control for 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>. These timeframes were established based on preliminary experiments. The eluted oil fractions were captured without interrupting the hydrodistillation process, resulting in EO fractions that represented the eluted oil constituents within these timeframes. The oil was transferred in 2-mL vials and placed in a freezer. Later, the oil was separated from water and measured on an analytical scale and kept in a freezer again until the oil was analyzed. Here, we report the oil content (yield) based on weight.
