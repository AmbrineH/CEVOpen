<p class="p">The EO of the leaves was extracted via hydrodistillation in 2-L distillation units (Laborbio Ltd. Sofia, Bulgaria, laborbio.com) at the Research Institute for Roses and Medicinal Plants in Kazanluk, Bulgaria. Each extraction was performed in three replicates. Research has shown that the juniper EO may continue to elute even after 10â€“14 h of steam distillation [

Samples of 100 g of dried leaves plus 1.2 L of water were placed in a kitchen food processor (blender) and ground for 48 s immediately prior to the extraction. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that grinding juniper leaves in water greatly reduces the time and energy necessary for the EO extraction, and also eliminates EO losses due to the potential rapid volatilization during the grinding process.
