<p class="p">Plant material of 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus excelsa</italic> Bieb., 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus sabina</italic> L., and 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus virginiana</italic> L. (branches not thicker than 10 mm with leaves) was collected in the autumn of 2017 from natural populations (of the 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>) in Bulgaria. The collected biomass samples were immediately transferred and then dried in an aerated shady place for a month until a constant weight, before oil was isolated. The leaves were carefully separated from branches in order to avoid EO losses. Therefore, in this study, only the leaves of the three junipers were distilled for EO extraction. The collection of juniper biomass samples was made from the following habitats: 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> biomass samples were collected from the natural habitat near the town of Kresna, Bulgaria, along the road at 41°046′00.1″N; 23°08′55.5″E. The 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> biomass samples were collected along the road from the town of Blagoevgrad to Simitli, Bulgaria, collected at 41° 51′17.57″N, 23° 07′48.72″E. It was assumed that the specific 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> tree was either an escapee or planted as ornamental in that area. The 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> biomass samples were collected from natural habitat near Beli Iskar, Bulgaria, at 42°15′46″.3″N, 23° 32′26″.7″E. The voucher specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> Bieb., 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> L., and 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> L. (small branches with needles) were deposited at the Herbarium of the Agricultural University, Plovdiv, Bulgaria (SOA) [
