<p class="p">Compounds were quantified by performing area percentage calculations based on the total combined FID area. For example, the area for each reported peak was divided by the total integrated area from the FID chromatogram from all reported peaks and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a percentage. The percentage of a peak is a percentage relative to all other constituents that were integrated in the FID chromatogram. </p>
