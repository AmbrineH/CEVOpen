<p class="p">The constituents were identified and quantified in juniper essential oil and distillation fractions. Oil samples were analyzed by GC-MS-FID on an Agilent 7890A GC system (Santa Clara, CA, USA) that was equipped with a Agilent 5975C inert XL MSD with triple axis detector and an Agilent 7693 autosampler. DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, with a film thickness of 0.25 μm) was used and operated using the following conditions: injector temperature, 240 °C; column temperature, 60–240 at 3 °C/min, and then held at 240 °C for 5 min; carrier gas, He; injection volume, 1 μL (split ratio 25:1); the FID temperature was 300 °C. Post-column splitting was performed so that 50% of sample proceeds to FID and 50% to mass spectrometry (MS) detection. The MS mass range was from
