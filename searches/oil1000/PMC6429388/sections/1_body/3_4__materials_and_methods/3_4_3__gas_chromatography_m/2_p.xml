<p class="p">Kovat analysis identified the compounds limonene, safrole, methyl eugenol, caryophyllene, α-pinene, cedrol, sabinene, β-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and methyl eugenol in oil samples [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], comparison of retention times and mass spectra with authentic standards, and a comparison of mass spectra with those that were reported in the NIST mass spectra database. Standards of R-(+)-limonene, safrole, methyl eugenol, caryophyllene, α-pinene, cedrol, sabinene, β-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and methyl eugenol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Compounds pregeijerene B, α-thujene, δ-cadinene, elemol, and elemicin were identified in oil samples by Kovat analysis and a comparison of mass spectra with those that were reported in the NIST mass spectra database and/or comparison of mass spectra with those reported by Adams et. al., 2007 [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Citronellic acid methyl ester was identified by a comparison of mass spectra with those that were reported in the NIST mass spectra database and by a comparison of retention time and mass spectra data with an authentic standard that was synthesized in our laboratory. Citronellic acid methyl ester was produced by methylation of (S)-(−)-citronellic acid (Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) using diazomethane.
