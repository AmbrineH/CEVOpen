<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>, the most appropriate regression model that describes the relationship between DT and EO content, concentrations of safrole, methyl eugenol, Î´-cadinene, elemol, and elemicin was a third order polynomial (Equation (1)), the model that describes the relationship between DT and the concentration of limonene was Asymptotic (convex) (Equation (2)), whereas the model that describes the relationship between DT and the concentrations of caryophyllene was Power (convex) (Equation (3)). There was no relationship between DT and pregeijerene B.
