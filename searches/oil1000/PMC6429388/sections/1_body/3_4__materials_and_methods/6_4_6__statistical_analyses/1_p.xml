<p class="p">The effect of distillation time (DT) on EO content and the concentration of constituents were determined for each of three juniper species (
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>) in Bulgaria using a one-way analysis of variance. For 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>, the constituents were limonene, pregeijerene B, safrole, methyl eugenol, caryophyllene, δ-cadinene, elemol, and elemicin. For 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>, the constituents were α-pinene, limonene, and cedrol. For 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>, the constituents were α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, citronellic acid methyl ester, and methyl eugenol. For each species, the effect of DT on ORAC value (uM Trolox Equiv/per g oil) was also determined.
