<p class="p">While the third-order polynomial model (Equation (1)) is linear, the other three models (Asymptotic, Power, and Michaelisâ€“Menten) are nonlinear and their parameters were estimated iteratively using the NLIN Procedure of SAS [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], and the fitted models met all the adequacy requirements of nonlinear models [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The figures, as well as the third-order polynomial model, fits were prepared using Minitab 18 software (Minitab, State College, PA, USA).
