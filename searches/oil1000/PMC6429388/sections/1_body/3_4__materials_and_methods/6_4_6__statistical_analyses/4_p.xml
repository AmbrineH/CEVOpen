<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>, the most appropriate regression model that describes the relationship between DT and EO content, as well as the concentration of limonene, was Power (convex) (Equation (3)), whereas the model that describes the relationship between DT and the concentration of cedrol was Michaelis–Menten (Equation (4)). There was no relationship between DT and the concentration of α-pinene.
