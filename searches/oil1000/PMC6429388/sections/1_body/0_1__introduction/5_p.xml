<p class="p">Generally, the industrial extraction of most EOs uses large amounts of expensive solvents (

Future research should focus on improving the traditional steam and hydrodistillation processes and in the development of Green Extraction techniques. Green Extraction, which is a part of Green Chemistry, was defined as the extraction processes that will reduce energy consumption, allow the use of alternative solvents and renewable natural products, and ensure a safe and high-quality extract/product [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Our study investigated the EO fractions that were eluted at different distillation timeframe using water (as solvent) and low energy (following grinding of the plant material in water). The results from this study may contribute to the time and energy saving of EO extraction from the three juniper species, and help to obtain EO with desired composition. We hypothesized that capturing the EO segments during specific timeframes will generate EO fractions with different composition and antioxidant capacity. Therefore, in this study, the oil fractions that were eluted at different hydrodistillation timeframes and non-stop controls were compared for chemical profile and antioxidant capacity among each other within a species. The EO of each species (
