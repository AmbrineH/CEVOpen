 <italic class="italic">Juniperus</italic> is one of the main genera of the Cupressaceae family. Some of the species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> L. (eastern redcedar, red cedar juniper), is widely distributed indigenous species in the eastern parts of the United States and Canada, while others, such as 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> Bieb (Greek juniper, tree juniper) and 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> L. (savin, Cossack juniper), occupy specific and rather limited environments. 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> prefers the Mediterranean climate and it is distributed across the Eastern Mediterranean, mainly in Northeastern Greece, Southern Bulgaria, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Lebanon, and the Caucasus Mountains [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> has a very limited, fragmented distribution range in southern and northern Europe, Crimea, Caucasus, Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Asia Minor, which is most probably due to its low reproductive potential.
