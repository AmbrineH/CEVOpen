<p class="p">This is the first report on 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> EO fractions that were generated in different timeframes following a grinding of the material to significantly speed up the extraction. Overall, the results confirmed the hypothesis of this study that capturing the EO segments during specific timeframes will generate EO fractions with different composition and antioxidant capacity (ORAC values).
