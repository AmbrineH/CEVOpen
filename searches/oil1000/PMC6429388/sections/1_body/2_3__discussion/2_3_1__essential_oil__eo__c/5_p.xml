 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> oil with 32% α-pinene, 4.4% limonene, and 13% cedrol when compared to this study, where most of the oil was eluted in the first 5 min. In this study, cedrol in the 5–10 min fraction was already 31%. Similarly, sabinine, a major constituent of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>, also eluted at a significantly higher concentration in the first 3 min than in the subsequent DT. Differences may be attributed to grinding of the plant material prior to the EO extraction in this study. The results from this study can be used to specify the optimum distillation time and to avoid the unnecessarily long DT (if the material is ground prior to the EO extraction). 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> EO with high concentrations of α-pinene and limonene and low concentration of cedrol can be obtained in the first 5 min DT. Conversely, if greater than 50% cedrol is desirable, then this can be achieved by removing the first 5 min eluted fraction. Cedrol is a well-known and widely used aromatic ingredient in various consumer products, as in perfumery and cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, cleaners and detergents [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], due to its mild woody cedarwood-like sweet aroma with a sandalwood note. In addition, cedrol has shown a preventive effect against chemo-therapy induced alopecia in mice [
