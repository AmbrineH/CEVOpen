<p class="p">The EO yield (content) of the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> at different DT frames that were used in this study was higher than the 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> EO yield that was reported by Gawde et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], who recovered 0.17% of EO after 90 min of steam distillation, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> EO yield in this study was 1.12% (in the control). Therefore, this study revealed that the grinding of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> leaves in water prior to extraction with subsequent hydrodistillation for 240 min can recover &gt; six fold of EO as compared to the 90 min steam distillation without grinding, as in the study by Gawde et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In the study of Cantrell et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], the 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> ‘Grey Owl’ and 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> ‘Canaertii’ the EO yield was 0.5–0.65% and 0.04–0.3%, respectively, demonstrating the range of EO yield in this species.
