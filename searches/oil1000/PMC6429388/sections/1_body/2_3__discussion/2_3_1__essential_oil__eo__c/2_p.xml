<p class="p">The specific composition of the EO fractions that were eluted at different hydrodistillation timeframes can be attributed to the different boiling points of the respective EO constituents [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The EOs are complex products and they include a number of constituents with different molecular weights and diverse temperature separation points. In the initial minutes of the distillation, the most volatile EO constituents, such as monoterpenes, are eluted. Limonene (monoterpene) and caryophyllene (sesquiterpenes) eluted at early DT due to their low boiling points (limonene at 176 °C and caryophyllene at 116 °C), whereas elemol increased in late timeframe fractions due to its high boiling point (290 °C).
