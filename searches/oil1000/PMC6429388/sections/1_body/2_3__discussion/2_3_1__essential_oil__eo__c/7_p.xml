<p class="p">In a study with male and female plants 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> leaves, Asili et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] reported sabinene (22 and 24%), α-pinene (15 and 6%), and myrcene (7 and 8%), respectively. Fournier et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], in a study of 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> cultivars and wild type, reported 24% sabinene in the wild type, and 18%, 18%, and 41% in three 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> cultivars. In the same study, sabinyl acetate was 45.5% in the EO of the wild type, and 53%, 19%, and 38% in the three 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> cultivars, respectively. The authors commented that sabinene in previous studies varied from 26 to 42% of the oil. However, the data that was provided seemed to be from a single rep and it was lacking statistical analyses. Apparently, the 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> chemical composition and the concentration of sabinene widely vary, which suggests the presence of chemotypes. We anticipate more research on 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> accessions and the identification of various chemotypes. From practical perspective, high sabinene (80%) low methyl eugenol 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> EO fraction can be obtained if the oil is sampled in the first 3 min of the distillation process. In a recent ruling, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] removed six synthetic flavoring substances, including methyl eugenol, from the food additives list, because experiments with high intake doses may cause cancer in laboratory animals. Although this ruling did not affect “natural flavors” counterparts that were extracted from plants, we expect the industry to diminish/reduce the use of methyl eugenol and/or reduce its concentration in food products. Therefore, we anticipate increased market demand for EO with reduced methyl eugenol content.
