<p class="p">In this study, the major chemical families of 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> control oil included monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH, such as 35.6% α-pinene and 30.6% limonene) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OS, 33.8% cedrol). The concentration of α-pinene in this study was within the range for 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> EO that was reported by Sanjani et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], however, the concentration of limonene in the same report was only 1.5–2.1%, and no cedrol was reported, which is difficult to explain. Unlu et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], reported α-pinene (55.5%), α-cedrol (7.7%), sabinene (3.5%), and verbenone (2.4%) as the main constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> galbuli EO.
