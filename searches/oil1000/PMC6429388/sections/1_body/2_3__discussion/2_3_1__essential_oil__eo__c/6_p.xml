<p class="p">In this study, sabinene was the main 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> EO constituent and it belongs to the monoterpenes group. The control 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> oil had 61% sabinene. This study demonstrated that a high sabinene EO fraction (80% sabinene) could be obtained in the first 0–3 min hydrodistillation time, following a grinding of plant material in water. The concentration of sabinene in this study was higher than the values reported in the literature, whereas the concentration of the other monoterpene constituents, such as α-thujene, α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, and the phenylpropanoids citronellic acid ME and methyl eugenol, were generally lower.
