<p class="p">The concentration of limonene that was collected at the first 5 min in this study was 2.4 and 16.6 times greater than that reported by Dunford et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and Gawde et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] from Oklahoma and Mississippi, USA, respectively. The former authors had used hydrodistillation for 6 h, while the latter researchers had used steam distillation for 1.5 h. In addition to the extraction methods implied, the ecotype of plant affects the composition of EO [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. However, it is evident from this study that the highest concentrations of the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> leaves (limonene and safrole) can be collected with minimal time and energy with this method of prior grinding of the material in water. Limonene, safrole, and elemol were the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> in this study, and the overall oil profile was similar to some of the 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> oils in the samples that were collected from 49 locations in the United States [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, the 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> oil in this study would not fit any of the 10 chemotypes that were identified by the latter authors. Therefore, we could classify 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> that was used in this study as another chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginana</italic>, namely limonene-safrole-elemol chemotype.
