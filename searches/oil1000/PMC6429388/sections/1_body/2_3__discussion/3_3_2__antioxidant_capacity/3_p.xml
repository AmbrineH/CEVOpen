<p class="p">Overall, in this study, the higher in vitro antioxidant capacity was exhibited by the 3–10 min oil fraction in 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> and by the 5–10 min oil fraction in 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>. In 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>, monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene) and sesquiterpenes (α-thujene, sabinene) predominated in this fraction. In 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic>, limonene and caryophyllene phenylpropene (safrole), branched unsaturated hydrocarbons (Pregeijerene), predominated in this time fraction. Cantrell et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] reported a difference in 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity on EO of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana,</italic> due to differences in chemotypes. The antioxidant capacity of the EO may also change with the change in the ratio of various volatile and non-volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Zheljazkov et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] found the relation of composition of EO with the in vitro antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic>; and, Emami et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] also observed variation in the antioxidant capacity of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> with the methods of the antioxidant assays employed. Our study revealed that in vitro antioxidant capacity depends on the specific composition of the oil fraction that was captured in distinct timeframe, and hence support our hypothesis. However, the results from the in vitro antioxidant capacity of EO fractions may only be indicative of differences in some kind of activity between the fractions, and it must not be correlated to any potential health effects of a specific EO fraction.
