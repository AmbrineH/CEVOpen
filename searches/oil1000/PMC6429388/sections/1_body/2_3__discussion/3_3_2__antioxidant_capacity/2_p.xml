<p class="p">Generally, the in vitro antioxidant potential of the EO depends on its composition and it is determined by the interaction between its constituents [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. It is known that phenols and secondary metabolites with conjugated double bonds usually exhibit significant in vitro antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Secondary metabolites with conjugated double bonds also include monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the EO. However, it is impossible to model the specific contribution of each EO constituent towards the overall in vitro antioxidant capacity of a given fraction. Further experiments would be needed to assess the observed in vitro antioxidant capacity of individual EO constituents, because, in many cases, there is synergy between the various EO constituents with respect to their bioactivity [
