<p class="p">Essential oils have been reported to possess anticancer, antinociceptive, antiphlogistic, antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties [

Studies that seek to reveal the antioxidant potential of natural products, including EO, are numerous, although the in vitro antioxidant activity assays have a number of drawbacks and do not allow for a comparison of the results [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Furthermore, it is now clear that the term ‘antioxidant’ is primarily a marketing tool. The results from in vitro antioxidant capacity assays have little if any relevance to the complexity of the interactions of EO in biological systems. The higher antioxidant capacity of some natural products that were observed in vitro cannot be readily correlated to a potential positive health effect on humans, leading some scientists to suggest the banning of these types of assays [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-00986" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], and some scientific journals to declare that they would no longer review manuscripts describing in vitro antioxidant measurements [
