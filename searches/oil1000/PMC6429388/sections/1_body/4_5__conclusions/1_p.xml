<p class="p">This experiment enabled to model the elution of various EO constituents and to pinpoint the oil fractions of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana, J. excelsa,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> with the specific oil composition and the EO with the highest in vitro antioxidant capacity at different distillation timeframes. The study demonstrated that, by manipulating DT and capturing fractions at specific time points, one can capture the desired composition of EO with less time and energy. The results of this study could be a significant finding for the pharmaceutical, aromatic, and other industries that use the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana, J. excelsa,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic>.
