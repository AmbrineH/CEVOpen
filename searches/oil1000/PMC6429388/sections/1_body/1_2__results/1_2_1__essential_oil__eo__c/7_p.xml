The concentration of α-pinene was highest at the first 5 min fraction (34%) and in the control (36%), and lowest at 10-20 min elution timeframe fraction (11%); however, there was no consistent trend in EO composition changes with progressing timeframes (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Limonene eluted early in the distillation process, and therefore its concentration was higher in the fractions that were collected earlier than in the 80–160 min or in the 160–240 min fractions (

 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> EO constituents, with cedrol acting as the main one in this group. Cedrol started eluting after 5 min in the distillation process, and therefore its concentration was the lowest in the 0–5 min fraction (4.9%). The concentration of cedrol increased by at least six-folds from 5–10 min DT (30.6%) onward when compared to 0–5 min DT (4.9%). The concentration of cedrol (53%) was the highest in the 40–80 min oil fraction (
