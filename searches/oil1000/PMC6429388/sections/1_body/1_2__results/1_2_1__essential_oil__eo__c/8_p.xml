 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> were selected to be different from those of 
 <italic class="italic">J. virginiana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">J. excelsa</italic> in this study based on preliminary studies. The main chemical group of 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> EO was the monoterpenes (hydrocarbons and оxygenated) (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). A significant portion of the monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH, 90.5%) in 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> was eluted very early in the distillation process that constituted the 0–3 min fraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). As the name suggests, sabinene was the major constituent of the MH in 
 <italic class="italic">J. sabina</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Sabinene was eluted early in the distillation process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00986-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, the concentration of sabinine was greater in the 0–3 min fraction (80%) and it decreased in the fractions that were collected later in the distillation process (26.6%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Similarly, the 0–3 min fraction had higher concentrations of α-pinene, β-pinene, α-thujene, and limonene when compared to fractions that were collected at the late elution timeframes (after 3 min) (
