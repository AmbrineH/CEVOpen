 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). During the first 5 min of the distillation, about 43% of the monoterpenes (e.g. limonene) were eluted. The quantity of the monoterpenes elution gradually decreased as the distillation time increased, and it reached the bottom (15.6%) at 240 min. Limonene concentration at the 0–5 min timeframe was 177% higher than that eluted at 160–240 min timeframe fraction.
