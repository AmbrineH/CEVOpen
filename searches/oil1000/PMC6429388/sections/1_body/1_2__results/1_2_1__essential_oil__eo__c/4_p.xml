<p class="p">Sesquiterpenes (ST, monocyclic oxygenated, bicyclic) were the third chemical group of

 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The elution of EO constituents that belonged to sesquiterpenes increased with the DT and it was the highest (35.4%) in the 160–240 min oil fraction. The concentration of elemol (33.8%) was the highest in this 160–240 min oil fraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The elution of caryophyllene was the greatest in the initial 5 min oil fraction and diminished in the subsequent DT fractions (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00986-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PCH) (δ-cadinene) was identified in small quantities; its concentration increased from 1.01% in the 5 min fraction to 3.03% in 40–80 min fraction and then dropped again to 2.16% in the 160–240 min fraction (
