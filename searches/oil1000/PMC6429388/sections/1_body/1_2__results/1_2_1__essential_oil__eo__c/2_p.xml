Overall, the elution of EO constituents that belonged to phenylpropene increased with DT and reached highest concentrations (49.8%), in the 20-40 min fraction, and decreased afterward. The concentration of safrole (37%) was also the highest in the 20–40 min fraction, the concentration of methyl eugenol was the highest in the 40–80 min fraction (11.85%–13.97%), and the concentration of elemicin was highest in the 80–160 min fraction (4.2%) (
