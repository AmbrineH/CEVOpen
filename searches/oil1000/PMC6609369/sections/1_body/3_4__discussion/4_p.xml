<p class="p">PM increased the growth and yield of turmeric in this study compared with the control. This was due to high concentration of nutrients in PM and also due to its low C: N ratio [7.35], which, in turn, would increase OM decomposition and subsequent nutrient release. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] also reported that turmeric responded well to PM application. The increase in the growth and yield of turmeric as a result of the application of NPK fertilizer was due to the fact that the soil of the experimental site lacked essential nutrients responsible for growth and yield of turmeric [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] reported response of turmeric to NPK 15-15-15. This response was due to nitrogen in NPK fertilizer promoting leaf growth and required to form proteins and chlorophyll, while P contributes to root development, energy transfer reactions, and cell division and multiplication and K contributes to stem development, cell division, formation and translocation of carbohydrates, and mainly tuber/rhizome development in roots.
