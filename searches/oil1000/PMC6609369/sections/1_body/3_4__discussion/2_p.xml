<p class="p">Mg fertilizer alone increased N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents of the soil significantly compared with the control. Soil analysis prior to the start of the experiment showed that the soil was deficient of Mg. It has commonly been reported that sandy soils are frequently deficient of Mg [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], whereas fine textured soils (clay) generally contain adequate Mg as Mg is located in clay minerals and associated with cation exchange sites on clay surfaces. The increase in N concentration as a result of Mg fertilizer could be adduced to the fact that Mg seems to enhance N availability in soil and utilization by crops [
