<p class="p">Mg fertilizer (applied alone or in combination with PM or NPK fertilizer) increased mineral and vitamin contents of turmeric rhizomes. This can be related to improved soil chemical properties associated with Mg treatments which, in turn, may have resulted in increased metabolic activity. Mg fertilizer also increased N absorbed by the turmeric plants and resulting in an increase in the number of leaves and photosynthetic activity and enhancing physiological processes leading to higher assimilate production which also resulted in an increase in mineral composition in the rhizomes.</p>
