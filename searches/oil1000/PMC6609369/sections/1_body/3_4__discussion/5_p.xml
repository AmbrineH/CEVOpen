<p class="p">Results show significant or higher yields of turmeric where Mg fertilizer is added with PM (PM + Mg) or NPK (NPK + Mg) compared with PM or NPK alone. These results were expected because Mg is known to be a constituent of chlorophyll accounting for about 2.7% of the chlorophyll molecule. It is also a cofactor, an enzyme activator in reaction associated with ATP formation, phosphorylation reaction, and subsequent transfer of phosphate [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, Mg is involved in simultaneously controlling processes responsible for photosynthesis, assimilate production, and partitioning among plant parts [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Mg supply was also reported to enhance N uptake by plants [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Mg application has also been reported to increase the translocation of assimilate from source to sink organs which increases root growth [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The increase in root growth as a result of Mg fertilizer application may aid in the absorption of N and other nutrients in the soil, thereby enhancing growth and rhizome yield of turmeric. [
