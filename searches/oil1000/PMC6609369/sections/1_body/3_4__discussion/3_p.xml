<p class="p">Compared with other treatments, NPK + Mg significantly increased soil N, P, and K concentrations. This was due to high quantities of these elements in NPK fertilizer compared with poultry manure. PM + Mg increased OM, Ca, Mg, and pH compared with NPK fertilizer because the organic materials in PM decomposed to release OM and other nutrients. The ability of PM to increase pH could be due to the presence of base cations contained in the PM [
