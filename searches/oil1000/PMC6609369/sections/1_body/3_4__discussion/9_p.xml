<p class="p">In this experiment, PM alone or applied with Mg fertilizer (PM + Mg) increased Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, and vitamins contents of turmeric rhizome compared with NPK fertilizer alone or in combination with Mg fertilizer (NPK + Mg). This might be due to differences in the chemical composition of PM compared to NPK fertilizer and its positive effect on soil ecology and plant metabolism [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. NPK fertilizer contains only N, P, and K, whereas PM contains both macro- and micronutrients. It therefore seems reasonable that the amount and type of mineral nutrients present in the soil will dictate the quantity and quality of nutrients absorbed by the plant. For example, plants grown under organic agricultural conditions are reported to have higher micronutrient contents than conventionally grown plants [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Furthermore, because some chemical reactions in cells involve micronutrients, either directly or indirectly [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] could explain why PM exhibited higher vitamin C content compared with NPK fertilizer [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The increased mineral and vitamin contents of turmeric rhizomes as a result of application of NPK + Mg and PM + Mg compared with NPK or PM alone can be adduced to increase soil chemical properties as a result of the Mg fertilizer addition which led to greater metabolic activities and hence higher minerals and vitamins in the NPK + Mg and PM + Mg plots compared with their sole forms.
