<p class="p">Response of sole Mg fertilizer in combination with organic and inorganic fertilizer to crops especially turmeric is scarce in the literature. Therefore, this study was to determine the effect of Mg fertilizer alone and in combination with organic (PM) and inorganic (NPK 15-15-15) fertilizers on soil chemical properties, growth, rhizome yield, and quality. In this experiment, we hypothesized that soil chemical properties and turmeric growth and yield will react differently to sole NPK fertilizer, PM, Mg fertilizer, and the combinations of Mg fertilizer with either NPK fertilizer or PM. Experiments were conducted to validate these working hypotheses to determine which combinations of Mg fertilizer would have the greatest effect.</p>
