<p class="p">Ten randomly selected turmeric plants were used for the determination of growth parameter (plant height, number of leaves, and tillers) after 150 days of turmeric growth when the turmeric would have developed full canopy formation. Plant height was taken by measuring from the ground level to the tallest leaf apex using a ruler. The numbers of leaves were counted. At harvesting (8 months after planting), individual plants were uprooted using hoe. The numbers of rhizomes were counted and the fresh rhizome weights of turmeric were recorded using a top loading balance.</p>
