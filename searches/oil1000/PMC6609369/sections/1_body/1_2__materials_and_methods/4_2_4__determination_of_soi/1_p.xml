<p class="p">Before experimentation in 2017, soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected from 10 randomly selected locations within the experimental site and mixed together to represent a composite soil sample. The soil sample was later air-dried sieved using a 2 mm sieve and analyzed for particle size, organic C, pH, total N, available P, exchangeable K, Ca, Mg, and pH (water). At the end of each year, soil samples were also collected on each experimental plot and the chemical properties were analyzed. Particle size analysis was determined using the hydrometer method [
