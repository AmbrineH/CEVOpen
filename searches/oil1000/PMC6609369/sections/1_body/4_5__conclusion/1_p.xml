<p class="p">This study shows that PM, NPK, and Mg fertilizers alone or combinations increased soil chemical properties, growth, yield, and mineral and vitamin contents of turmeric rhizomes compared with the control. For this experiment, NPK + Mg increased growth and yield of turmeric compared with other treatments. The NPK + Mg treatment increased the yield of turmeric compared with NPK alone, likely due to the complementary effect of NPK and Mg fertilizers. The PM + Mg fertilizer treatment significantly improved mineral and vitamins contents compared with the other treatments. Therefore, for those that desire turmeric rhizomes for their nutritive value, PM + Mg is recommended. For those that want quantity, NPK + Mg is recommended.</p>
