<p class="p">Although PM alone and PM with Mg fertilizer (PM + Mg) increased pH, OM, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents of the soil compared with the control, their application only resulted in significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) for Mg (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). NPK alone and NPK with Mg fertilizer (NPK + Mg) significantly increased N, P, K, and Mg concentrations of the soil compared with the control. Their application however did not significantly increase (p &lt; 0.05) pH, OM, and Ca concentration compared with the control. NPK +Mg fertilizer increased soil Mg concentration significantly compared with NPK alone. Mg alone significantly increased N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentrations of the soil compared with the control whereas the values of pH and OM were not significantly different. Compared with other treatments, NPK + Mg significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased N, P, and K concentrations of the soil. When compared with other treatments, PM + Mg significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased soil pH, OM, Ca, and Mg concentrations.
