<p class="p">Averaged over the two years, all amendments increased plant height, number of leaves, number of tillers, number of rhizomes, and turmeric rhizome yield compared with the control (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). PM + Mg significantly increased growth and yield parameters except plant height compared to PM alone. Using the two-year average, PM + Mg increased turmeric yield by 7.8% compared with PM alone. NPK + Mg significantly increased growth and yield of turmeric compared to the other treatments. On average, NPK + Mg increased rhizome yield of turmeric by 13.6% and 10.6% compared with PM + Mg and NPK fertilizer alone, respectively. Similarly, Mg fertilizer alone increased the yield of turmeric by 10.8% compared with the control.
