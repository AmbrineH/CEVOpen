 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, respectively, show the initial soil physical and chemical properties of the site used before experimentation and the chemical analysis of the PM, NPK, and MgO fertilizers used for the study. The soil was sandy loam, acidic, and low in OM, N, P, Ca, and Mg but adequate in K [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The poultry manure has both macro- and microelements. NPK fertilizer has high values of N, P, and K while MgO has high Mg content compared with other amendments.
