 <p class="p">For soil fertility maintenance, secondary nutrient such as Magnesium (Mg) is always being neglected. However, its role is critical in the growth, yield, and quality of crops. Therefore, two field experiments were initiated in 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the response of soil chemical properties, performance, and qualities of turmeric (
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> L.) to Mg fertilizer alone and in combination with poultry manure (PM) and NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer (NPK). The treatments applied were the following: (i) PM alone at 8 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, (ii) NPK alone at 200 kg ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, (iii) Mg fertilizer alone (in form of MgO) at 20 kg ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, (iv) PM at 8 t ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with MgO at 20 kg ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (PM + Mg), (v) NPK at 200 kg ha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with MgO at 20kgha
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (NPK + Mg), and (vi) control (no amendment of any kind). PM, NPK, and Mg fertilizers alone or NPK + Mg and PM + Mg increased soil chemical properties, performance (plant height, number of leaves, number of tillers, number of rhizomes, and fresh rhizome weight), and minerals and vitamins C and A contents of turmeric rhizome compared with the control. By averaging 2017 and 2018, Mg fertilizer alone increased the yield of turmeric by 10.8% compared with the control. For this experiment, NPK + Mg increased growth and yield of turmeric compared with other treatments. Also, averaging 2017 and 2018, NPK + Mg increased rhizome yield of turmeric by 13.6% and 10.6% compared with PM + Mg and NPK alone, respectively. Similarly, PM + Mg significantly improved mineral and vitamins contents compared with other treatments. Therefore, for those that desire turmeric rhizome for its nutritive value, PM + Mg is recommended. For those that want quantity, NPK + Mg is recommended.
