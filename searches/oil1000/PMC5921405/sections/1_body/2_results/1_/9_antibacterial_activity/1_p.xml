<p class="p">The main constituents of MEO as shown by current results were 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, linalool, α-terpineol, nonadecane, linalyl acetate, and β-phellandrene. The potent antibacterial activity of EOs has mostly been related to oxygenated terpenes, such as 1,8-cineole, linalool and α-terpineol. Randrianarivelo, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. demonstrated that potent antibacterial activity of MEO can be related to 1,8-cineole and linalool components (
