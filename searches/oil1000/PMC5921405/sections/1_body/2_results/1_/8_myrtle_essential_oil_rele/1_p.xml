<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, the release profiles were biphasic. MEO solutions yielded a release percentage of about 38% after 1.5 h through PTFE filter membrane pore size 0.2 Î¼m whereas the niosomal formulation F6 demonstrated only 21% drug release after 1.5 h. The active constituents released from the nMEO did not reach the plateau after 4 h.
