<p class="p">The initial rapid phase may have wide implications for desorption of drug from the surface of niosomes. Also, the second phase is likely to be associated with the entrapped drug being released from the formulation which is a time-consuming process. Being a stabilizing agent, Chol slowed down release of active constituent. Furthermore, the amount of drug released is related to the EE%, whose high amounts led to less drug release (
