<p class="p">Alteration of bacterial cell membrane permeability, adsorption of vesicles, or the potential fusion to bacterial cell were considered as mechanisms capable of increasing antibacterial activity or decreasing bacterial resistance in nisin/EDTA nanoniosomes. Niosome encapsulation of nisin/EDTA could be gradually released in the medium, hence resulting in longer and higher antibacterial activity during the time (
