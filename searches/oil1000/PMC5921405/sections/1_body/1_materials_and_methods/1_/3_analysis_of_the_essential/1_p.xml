<p class="p">The composition of the volatile constituents of MEO was determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses, which was performed via a GC/MS-QP5050 equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (40 m × 1.8 mm (internal diameter)), film thickness: 0.18 μm) and a QP5050 mass selective detector. In order to detect GC/MS, an electron ionizations system with ionization energy of 70 eV was adopted. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injector and detector line temperature were set at 260 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Moreover, column temperature was initially kept at 60 °C for 5 min, after which it was gradually increased to 260 °C at a 5 °C/min rate. One μL diluted samples were injected manually and the split ratio was equaled 1/40.</p>
