<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> release study was performed for F6 formulation, using static vertical diffusion Franz cells with an effective diffusion area of 1.5 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and a receptor phase volume of 15 mL (Ashke-shisheh Co., Iran). The PTFE filter membrane pore size 0.22 μm was soaked in ethanol 50% for 24 h before the experiments. The membrane was fixed between donor and receptor compartments. The receptor compartment was filled with 50% ethanol 98° and 50% distilled water, then it was continuously stirred and thermostated at 37 ± 1 °C throughout the experiment. The donor compartment was filled with 1 mL nMEO. Total MEO solution and empty niosomal formulation were used as the control group. One mL sample was withdrawn at fixed time intervals from receptor compartment and replaced with an equal volume of fresh acceptor phase to ensure sink conditions. The permeated drug concentrations were measured by GC/MS analyses.
