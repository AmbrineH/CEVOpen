<p class="p">The fatty acid profile results of the TM oil used in this experiment were dominated by oleic and linoleic acids. These results are consistent with other studies, e.g., Tzompa-Sosa et al. [

 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], Sosa and Fogliano [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and Kiero≈Ñczyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Comparing TM oil with the other fat sources used in this experiment (i.e., poultry fat and palm oil) showed that TM oil had the lowest values of SFAs, whereas palm oil had the highest. UFAs were highest in TM oil and poultry fat and lowest in palm oil. These findings are in agreement with the study conducted by Sosa and Fogliano [
