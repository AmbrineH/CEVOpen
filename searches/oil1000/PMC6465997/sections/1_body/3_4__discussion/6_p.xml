<p class="p">The two most common PUFAs are linoleic and Î±-linolenic acids, which act as the primary precursors of n-6 PUFAs [

 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Both fatty acids were significantly enhanced by TM oil supplementation. As mentioned above, TM oil has the highest content of LNA, followed by poultry fat. The LNA content of poultry meat can be improved by supplementing the diet with feed rich in LNA [

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) was found to be higher in the breast meat of chickens who ate a diet supplemented with TM oil in the present study. Such fatty acids are important for human health, including brain function and vision. In general, TM oil supplementation in the broiler chicken diet improved the lipid profile of breast meat.
