<p class="p">From a physiological point of view, the liver is a vital organ due to its commitment to fat metabolism. Insect oil used in the present study reduced the mass of the liver compared with palm oil and poultry fat. Furthermore, the concentration of triglycerides and total cholesterol in the liver was also lowered by TM oil supplementation in comparison with the other treatments. According to Santoso et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], the reduction in hepatic triglycerides is known to be beneficial for chickens and consumers, as the liver is considered to be an edible chicken organ among many consumers worldwide [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. It is well known that PUFAs inhibit hepatic lipogenesis, which is the process by which acetyl-CoA is converted to triglycerides [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In our study, TM oil had the highest amount of PUFAs. Therefore, the low concentration of hepatic triglycerides could be related to the PUFA content in the diet. Fat sources added to broiler chicken diets can change the concentrations of triglycerides in blood [

 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Serum triglyceride concentrations were reduced more significantly in birds fed TM oil compared with those fed palm oil and poultry fat. A low concentration of serum triglyceride has been observed in chickens after the replacement of dietary SFAs by PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Generally, fats high in SFAs increase the levels of triglyceride in the blood [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. According to the obtained results, TM oil had the lowest concentration of SFAs and the highest concentration of PUFAs compared with palm oil and poultry fat.
