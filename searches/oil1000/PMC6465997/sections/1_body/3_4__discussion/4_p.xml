<p class="p">The liver is classified as a by-product in the poultry industry and is consumed on a large scale worldwide [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Currently, consumers are more concerned about what they eat, especially regarding nutritional aspects. Some of the most important nutritional aspects are the lipid content and FA profile. It is well documented that the lipid contents and fatty acid profiles of broiler chicken meat and livers can be altered by the feed intake of the birds [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Changes in FA profiles, especially decreased SFAs and increased PUFAs, would alleviate criticism by improving nutritional value and would play a key role in improving quality [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Our results show that the liver FA profile was affected by the dietary intake of the birds, which is in line with other findings. TM oil supplementation significantly reduced the SFA content, increased the UFA content and, in particular, increased the PUFA content. In addition, TM oil supplementation enhanced the ratio of PUFAs to SFAs, which has a beneficial effect on the nutritional value of the liver. The same findings were reported by Kierończyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], who showed that SFAs were decreased and UFAs were increased by use of the oil of both insect species (
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. morio</italic>) in comparison with soybean oil. According to Sim and Qi [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], the synthesis of SFAs can be considerably inhibited in the liver during the digestion of unsaturated fats compared with that of saturated fats. Our results showed that TM oil had the highest amount of PUFAs and the lowest amount of SFAs, which could explain the decreased content of SFAs caused by TM oil supplementation. Furthermore, in our findings, MUFAs were significantly reduced by TM oil supplementation, which could be explained by the increases in PUFA concentrations that suppress the synthesis of MUFAs. According to Pinchasov and Nir [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], PUFAs can inhibit the synthesis of MUFAs through the inhibition of 9-desaturase enzyme complex activity, which is the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of SFAs to MUFAs. Long-chain n-3 fatty acids are well known for their health benefits to humans and animals, such as lowering circulating cholesterol concentrations and reducing the risk of heart disease [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Notably, TM oil supplementation significantly increased the n-3 and n-3 PUFA concentrations in the liver in comparison with palm oil and poultry fat supplementation. Furthermore, the n6/n3 ratio was lowest as a result of the TM oil treatment. These findings are in disagreement with the findings of Kierończyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], in which decreasing n-3 and n-3 PUFA contents and increasing values of the n-6/n-3 ratio were observed. In a healthy diet, the atherogenic index and the thrombogenic index are recommended to be low [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. TM oil supplementation reduced both indexes in comparison with palm oil and poultry fat supplementation. The same findings were reported by Kierończyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the fat content in the liver tissue was affected by dietary fat, and it was significantly reduced by TM oil supplementation. This factor is considered to be a positive change as chicken liver is commonly consumed worldwide. Villaverde et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] reported that increasing the dietary PUFA/SFA ratio can decrease fat deposition in various tissues. Of our dietary fat treatments, TM oil supplementation had the highest level of PUFAs/SFAs, which could explain the low liver fat content in the TM oil-treated group. These findings suggest that the fatty acid composition in the liver tissue was enhanced by the supplementation of TM oil in the broiler chicken diet.
