 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> oil as a dietary fat source for broiler chickens was evaluated for its effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and liver tissue and breast muscle fatty acid profiles. No adverse impacts on growth performance or nutrient digestibility were observed. Moreover, the TM oil used in this experiment showed promising results by decreasing the fat content in the liver tissue, as well as hepatic triglycerides and total cholesterol. Generally, TM oil supplementation improved the fatty acid profile of the liver tissue and the breast muscle. Therefore, the results of the current study suggest that fat sourced from 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larvae may be an alternative to palm oil in broiler chicken nutrition.
