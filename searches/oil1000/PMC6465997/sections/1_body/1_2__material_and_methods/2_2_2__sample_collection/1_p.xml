<p class="p">The birds were weighed at days 7, 14, 21 and 30. The body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) were measured, and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated for days 7–14, 14–21, 21–30 and 7–30. At the end of the experiment (day 30), the birds were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Then, 12 birds per treatment were randomly selected, and blood samples were collected after decapitation. Serum was obtained by centrifugation (Micro 220R, Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 1000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> at 8 °C for 10 min and stored at 
 <italic class="italic">−</italic>20 °C until analysis. The following blood parameters were determined: non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) content, glucose, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCh), total protein (TP), albumin and insulin. The crop, jejunum and ceca were emptied by gentle pressure; digesta were collected for pH measurements. The contents of the ileum between the Meckel’s diverticulum and the ileo–cecal–colonic junction were collected for apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and crude fat, as well as apparent metabolizable energy corrected to zero nitrogen balance (AME
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>). The duodenal content was collected into sterile plastic bags and stored at −80 °C for pancreatic enzyme analysis. Immediately after slaughter, breast muscle and liver tissue were cut, directly packed in flexi grip bags and put onto dry ice to await further analyses.
