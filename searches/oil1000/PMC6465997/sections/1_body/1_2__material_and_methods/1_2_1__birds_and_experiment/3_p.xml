 <xref rid="animals-09-00116-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. All birds had ad libitum access to water and feed for the whole period of the experiment. The basal diet was designed according to Tancharoenrat et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and formulated on a maize and soybean meal base to meet or exceed the daily nutrient requirements of broiler chickens. Then, 5% poultry fat, palm oil or 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil was added to the basal diet. A total of 3 experimental treatments were used and were designed as follows: poultry fat (PF)—5% poultry fat added to the basal diet; palm oil (PO)—5% palm oil added to the basal diet; and 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil (TM)—5% 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> oil added to the basal diet. The diets were formulated and produced in a pellet form and crumbled at the Piast Pasze factory (Lewkowiec, Poland) according to the international organization for standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 procedures. The birds were fed one type of diet from the start to the end of the experiment (days 7–30 of age); the diets differed only in the source of fat. No additives were added to the diets. Throughout the entire experiment, 0.3% titanium dioxide (TiO
