<p class="p">The nutrient content of the diets and digesta were analysed according to the association of official analytical chemists (AOAC) [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] using the 934.01, 984.13 and 920.39 methods for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and crude fat (CF), respectively. TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> analysis was determined according to Myers et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and the concentration was estimated as described by Short et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Gross energy (GE) was analysed using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (KL 12 Mn, Precyzja-Bit PPHU Sp. z o.o., Bydgoszcz, Poland) standardised with benzoic acid.
