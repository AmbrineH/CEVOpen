<p class="p">Lipids from the liver and breast tissues were saponified according to the procedure described by Głogowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Briefly, the tissues were homogenised and treated with a mixture of 1 mL 2 M KOH in water and 1 mL 1 M KOH in methanol. The samples were vortexed and heated to 95 °C for 10 min, cooled at room temperature for 10 min and sonicated for 10 min. The mixture was protected from the light and kept overnight in a screw-capped Teflon-stoppered tube under nitrogen at 23 °C. Afterwards, 1.5 mL of water was added to the mixture, and the obtained solution was acidified by 4 M HCl to a pH below 2. The extraction procedure was repeated 4 times using diethyl ether. The extracted FAs were esterified using 0.5 M NaOH in methanol and subsequently converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) using methanol boron trifluoride (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany).
