<p class="p">FAME in the PF, PO and TM oil, as well as in the breast muscle and liver tissues, were determined by gas chromatography according to Cieślak et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Briefly, a gas chromatograph (GC Bruker 456-GC, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a capillary column (100 m fused-silica, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness; Chrompack CP7420, Agilent HP) and a flame ionisation detector was injected with 1 μL of sample into the column. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. FAs were determined based on their retention times and were expressed as the proportion of the sum of identified FAs (g/100 g FA). Peaks were identified by comparing retention times with appropriate fatty acid methyl ester standards (37 FAME Mix, Supelco, Poole, UK) using Galaxie Work Station 10.1 (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA). The atherogenic index [
