<p class="p">Insect fat (
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil) was obtained from a commercial source (HiProMine S.A., Robakowo, Poland), while poultry fat and palm oil were purchased from a different commercial source (Piast Pasze Sp. z o.o., Lewkowiec, Poland). The fatty acid composition and profile of the abovementioned fats are presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00116-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Dietary insect fat was extracted using supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> according to Jackowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Briefly, before the extraction, materials were air dried in an oven (SLN 240, POL-EKO Aparatura, Wodzisław Śląski, Poland) for 24 h at 50 °C. Then, an extraction was performed at a pressure of 300 bar and a temperature of 40 °C. For extract collection, a two-separator system was used. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow was adjusted to 110.4 kg/h. Commercial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (99% purity, Zakłady Azotowe, Puławy, Poland) was used for the extraction.
