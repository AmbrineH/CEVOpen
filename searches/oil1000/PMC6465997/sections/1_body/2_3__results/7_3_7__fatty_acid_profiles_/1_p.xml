<p class="p">The effect of the dietary treatments on the fat content and the FA profiles of the liver are summarised in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00116-t010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 10</xref> and 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00116-t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref>. The liver tissue of the chickens fed a diet supplemented with TM oil showed the lowest values of SFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004) and the highest values of UFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004). In addition, TM oil supplementation significantly decreased MUFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and increased PUFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in comparison with the PF and PO treatments. Moreover, n-6 fatty acids (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and n-3 fatty acids (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were increased significantly by TM oil supplementation. Simultaneously, the ratio of n-6/n-3 was significantly lowered (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013) by TM oil supplementation in comparison with the other treatments. The liver tissue of the chickens fed the diet supplemented with TM oil had a higher PUFA/SFA ratio (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). MCFAs were significantly decreased and LCFAs were increased by TM oil supplementation (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Thrombogenic and atherogenic indexes were also significantly lowered by TM oil supplementation in comparison with the PF- and PO-supplemented groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
