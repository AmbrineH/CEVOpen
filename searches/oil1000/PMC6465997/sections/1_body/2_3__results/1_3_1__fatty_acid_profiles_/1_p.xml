<p class="p">The fatty acid profiles of the fat sources used in the present study are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00116-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Unsaturated fatty acids (both MUFAs and PUFAs) were dominant in 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil and poultry fat. In contrast, the highest concentration of SFAs was present in palm oil. The most dominant UFAs were oleic and linoleic in all fat sources. Compared with palm oil and poultry fat, 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil had the highest concentration of PUFAs and MUFAs and the lowest medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). In addition, the SFA value was the lowest in TM oil (21.6%), followed by PF (29.92%) and PO (44.98%), respectively.
