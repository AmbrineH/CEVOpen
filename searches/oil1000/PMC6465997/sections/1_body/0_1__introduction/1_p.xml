<p class="p">The cost and the demand to increase the energy value of feed diets to meet the requirements of fast-growing birds have become a subject of interest for nutritionists. The supplementation of dietary fats is one of the preferred methods to achieve this purpose [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Various fat sources have been introduced in poultry nutrition, such as rendering by-products (e.g., lard, tallow and poultry fat) and vegetable oils (e.g., soybean, maize, palm, colza, linseed, rapeseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed and pumpkin seed) [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Recently, insects have been proposed as a sufficient, sustainable and alternative source of fat and protein for poultry [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. With an acceptable amount of fat, insects may replace other fat sources without any adverse effects on growth performance, the lipid fatty acid compositions of liver and breast muscle tissue, intestinal morphology or histological features [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The abovementioned studies highlighted the use of three insect species, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> (mealworm), 
 <italic class="italic">Zophobas morio</italic> (super worm) and 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> (black soldier fly, BSF), for a total or partial replacement of soybean oil. Palm oil (PO), which comes from the fruit of the 
 <italic class="italic">Elaeis guineensis</italic> tree, is the second most common vegetable oil produced globally following soybean oil. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), its worldwide production was estimated to be 70.37 million metric tons in 2017/2018 [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Tan Choon-Hui et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] showed that the major saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in PO were palmitic (43.7%) and stearic (4.5%) acids, and the main unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) were oleic (40.2%) and linoleic (9.6%) acids. PO is widely used in human and animal nutrition [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. According to Skřivan et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], palm oil is a common supplement in poultry diets. However, due to the negative impact on the environment, i.e., deforestation, extinction of endangered species and loss of biodiversity, as well as nutritional issues (high ratio of saturated fatty acids), consumers are looking for an alternative energy source [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. One solution could be the use of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larvae, which are a source of protein (451–603 g/kg of DM), as well as fat (250–431 g/kg of dry matter content) [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The fatty acid (FA) profile of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> is dominated by oleic and linoleic acids [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Almost all insects can biosynthesize palmitic, stearic and oleic acids. In addition, the profile and content of FAs in insects depend on various parameters, such as diet, species, environment and life stage [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In the available literature, there are no data concerning the replacement of palm oil and poultry fat (PF) with insect oil in broiler chicken diets. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> oil (TM oil) as a total replacement for palm oil and poultry fat in broiler chicken diets on their growth performance, nutrient digestibility, pancreatic enzyme activity, various blood parameters and lipid fatty acid compositions of liver and breast muscle tissues.
