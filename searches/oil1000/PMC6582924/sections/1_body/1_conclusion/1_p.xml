<p class="p">Ruminant production is increasing rapidly for providing good quality meat, milk, and their products to the large population in the earth. Methane production is also rising proportionally that contribute negatively to global warming as a greenhouse gas. Therefore, we should give more concentration on sustainable methane mitigation strategy which could be achievable through a cumulative approach. There are several methane mitigation strategies such as animal intervention, diet selection, dietary feed additives, probiotics, defaunation, supplementation of fats, oils, organic acids, plant secondary metabolites, etc. however, sustainable mitigation strategies are not established yet. We should give more emphasis on biological regulation of methane mitigation through searching of suitable candidates of direct feed microbials. Accurate measurement of methane is also highly needed to make the mitigation approach successful.</p>
