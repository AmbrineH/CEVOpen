<p class="p">Enzyme feed additives having fibrolytic activities are used to enhancing fibre digestibility [
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>], feed conversion efficiency [
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>], and milk production [
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>–
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>] of dairy cows. A reduction in the enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was reported by Arriola et al. [
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">163</xref>] where a fibrolytic enzyme additive was supplemented with a lactating cows’ diet (52% dietary forage). Conversely, some other studies revealed that exogenous fibrolytic enzyme additive increased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> yield and altered rumen methanogen community composition, without affecting overall density of methanogens [
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>,
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. Recently, Biswas et al. reported that dietary supplementation of lysozyme enzyme may improve rumen fermentation and reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission in an 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> trial [
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">168</xref>]. Therefore, more 
 <italic class="italic">in-vivo</italic> study is needed before use of enzymes for methane mitigation strategy.
