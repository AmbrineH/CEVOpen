<p class="p">Defaunation, the removal of protozoa from the rumen, is often linked with an increased microbial protein supply and enhancement of animal productivity. Though protozoa generate a relatively large volume of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and formate, and the methanogenic bacteria attach to the surface of ciliated protozoa [
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>], defaunation is effective to decline CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission. Morgavi et al. [
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>] revealed that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission reduced by 20% over a period of 2 years in defaunated sheep. Due to unclear reason, partial defaunation is not effectively reduce CH

 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. So far, a variety of techniques have been tested for defaunation experimentally, but none is used routinely due to itsâ€™ toxicity problems to the rest of the rumen microbiome as well as the host animals [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It has been also reported that immunization or vaccination of sheep with entodinial or mixed protozoal antigens reduced protozoal populations, and produced Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against rumen protozoa [
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>]. Recently, plant secondary metabolites have been used as potential defaunating agents. Moreover, defaunation technology needs more valuation before use widely and still has a big scope to do more research.
