<p class="p">The rumen microbiome including a wide variety of microorganisms, viz. bacteria, archaea, ciliated protozoa, fungi, and viruses, stay in a symbiotic relationship in a strict anaerobic condition within the rumen [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The protozoa can comprise up to 50% of the microbial biomass in rumen [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. While, the fungi were estimated at around 8% of the total biomass [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] but may reach 20% in sheep [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The archaea include only 0.3%–4% [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and the bacteria cover the remainder, characteristically the largest component of the rumen microbial biomass [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This rumen microbiome plays a significant role in feed fermentation within the rumen and produces different volatile fatty acids (VFAs), CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. These VFAs are essential for energy metabolism and protein synthesis of the ruminant host [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Among the diverse rumen microbiomes, only a few of these have been successfully characterized earlier based on culture-techniques. Recently, the application of multi-omics techniques such as metagenomics by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or high-throughput sequencing [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], metatranscriptomics [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], metaproteomics [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and metabolomics [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] have been increased greatly [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>].
