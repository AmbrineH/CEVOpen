<p class="p">Methanogenesis is a process of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in the rumen where H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reduced the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with the help of methanogenic archaea [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production is the main way for H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> clearance from fermentation [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. There are two main pathways of methanogenesis in the rumen, carried out by archaea, are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The hydrogenotrophic pathway converts H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> by the bacteria, protozoa, and fungi [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It is usually implicit that formate can be used by most abundant ruminal archaea that equivalent to H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>+CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, so formate is included in the hydrogenotrophic category [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Methylotrophic pathway is an another pathway of methanogenesis, which use methyl groups such as those present in methylamines and methanol as substrate [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The methanogens species have classified into 28 genera and 113 species, but it can be expected to occur many more in nature [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. From rumen, only a few methanogens have been so far isolated based on culture techniques such as 
 <italic class="italic">Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Methanobrevibacter millerae, Methanobrevibacter olleyae, Methanobacterium formicicum, Methanobacterium bryantii, Methnaomicrobium mobile, Methanoculleus olentangyi, Methanobrevibacter smithii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Methanosarcina</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Lately, multi-omics techniques are using to understand greenhouse gas emission from ruminant production [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>].
