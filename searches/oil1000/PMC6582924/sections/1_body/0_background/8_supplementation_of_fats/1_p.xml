<p class="p">The hydrogen and carbon dioxide or formate are the major substrates for methanogens [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. And, some microorganisms in the rumen use hydrogen to hydrogenate the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids. Hence, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production is hampered due to the addition of unsaturated fatty acids to the diet [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Traditionally addition of fat in the diet has been used in order to increase dietary energy content to meet the energy demand of high-producing dairy cows. Very recent, energy supplementation in a ruminantâ€™s diet is changed from carbohydrate to fat, which contributes to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mitigation. The mechanism of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction by fat is due to decreasing organic matter fermentation, fiber digestibility, and thus the methanogenic pathway as well as by the direct inhibition of methanogens in the rumen via the hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Several other studies also revealed that dietary fat supplementation has potential effects on the reduction of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from ruminants [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The unsaturated fatty acids act as an H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sink within the rumen through dehydrogenation and reduction occurs with the highest rate [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. It was also reported that supplementation of fat often reduces carbohydrate fermentation due to the toxic effects of fat on cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa, whereas starch fermentation was not affected [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Therefore, fat reduces CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from ruminants.
