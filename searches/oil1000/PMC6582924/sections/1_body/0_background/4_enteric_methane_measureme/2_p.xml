 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission can be gained by housing animals in RC, which then allow measurement of total methane emission directly. Reynolds et al. [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and Cammell et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] described the details of RC and measurements of methane emission. For the measurements of gaseous emissions, two open-circuit RC was used (internal volume approximately 21 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), with airlocks permitting access for faecal and urine collection [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. An integrative sample of ambient and RC exhaust air was analyzed at 4-min intervals, and there was a switch to calibration gases (oxygen-free nitrogen and nitrogen carrier with 20.5%, 3000 ppm, and 200 ppm oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, respectively) every 4 h to provide gas analyses with variation coefficients of 5% or less. This technique is relatively expensive, and are troublesome for the animal to behave normally like a natural that occurs within grassland environments.
