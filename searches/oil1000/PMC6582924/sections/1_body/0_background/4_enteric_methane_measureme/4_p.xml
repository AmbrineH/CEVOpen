<p class="p">In 2010, C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, South Dakota, USA has introduced the commercial GreenFeed (GF) system as a static short-term measurement device that measures CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from distinct cattle and uses head position sensors in combination with decision rules to assess the validity of measures obtained [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Depending on the experimental design, this GF system can be installed both conditions either grazing field or inside the farm. The animal remaining free to move about and voluntarily enters into the hood where a feed supplement is dropped. The measurements of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission by the GF system can be done typically over a short period (3–7 minutes), several times within a day, over several days. The GF system estimated CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission using sensors that identified the animal and its head position within a sampling hood, air flow, and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in exhaust air. A radio frequency identification (RFID) reader recognized the animal’s ear tag and GF sampling was activated when the animal’s head was in the correct position within the hood. Satisfactory animal head position resulted in the dispensing of feed pellets which influenced the animal to maintain a suitable head position for accurate measurements. Only one cattle can visit one GF unit at a time point and a ‘visit’ is defined as a visit that results in a methane measurement. The system is automatically programmed using C-Lock Inc. software to control the timing of feed availability for each animal and thus, encourage animals to allocate their voluntary GF visitation, and measure CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission over a 24 h period. Each GF unit can be used for several animals, with manufacturer recommendations of 15–20 animals/unit when grazing and 20–25 animals/unit if housed in free stalls. Cattle are voluntarily participating to visit the GF unit if they adapt once.
