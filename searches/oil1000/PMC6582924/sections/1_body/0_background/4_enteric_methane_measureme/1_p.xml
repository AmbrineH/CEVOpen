<p class="p">Accurate estimation of enteric methane production from animals is the key to take initiative for the setting up of mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategy often was unsuccessful due to wrong measurement of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. A number of enteric methane measuring techniques have been developed. However, respiration chamber (RC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>) tracer technique, and the automated head-chamber system (AHCS) (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, South Dakota, USA) were used successfully and widely in various experiments focusing dairy or beef cattle in several environmental conditions [
