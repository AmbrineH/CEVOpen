<p class="p">Tannins (condensed and hydrolysable tannin) also have the potentials to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from ruminants. Tannins exert their effects by directly inhibiting methanogens as well as indirectly decreasing H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production as a consequence decreased fiber digestion and the number of protozoa in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. Tannins extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Lotus pedunculatus</italic> showed inhibitory effects on pure cultures of methanogens [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. Likewise, inhibition of methanogens in the rumen of goats supplementing tannins as feed additives was reported by Puchala et al. [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. However, the inconsistent result was found in the case of condensed tannins [
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Recently, forages with higher levels of tannins, such as clover and other legumes, including trefoil, vetch, sulla and chicory are considering as mitigating agent [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. For instance, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was reduced (up to 55%) while ruminants were fed tannin-rich forages [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Tannins may exert a similar mechanism like bactericidal or bacteriostatic and inhibit the growth or activity of rumen methanogens and protozoa [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>].
