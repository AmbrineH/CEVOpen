<p class="p">Botanical extract or plants secondary metabolites (PSM), viz. saponins, tannins, flavonoids, organosulphur compounds, and essential oils, have potential anti-microbial effects against several types of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. Several PSMs have been so far identified as a potential agent to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by methanogens in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Depending on the type, sources, molecular weight, doses, and diet types, the methane reductive capability of PSMs varies significantly. For instance, Joch et al. [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>] examined 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> methane abetment properties of nine (09) concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol, 8-hydroxyquinoline, bornyl acetate, camphor, thymoquinone, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, and thymol. They reported all compounds tested validated as CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reducing agent however effective concentrations varied among individual PSMs. Recently, some see weeds also have potential effects on methane abatement [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] however, need more researches in this regard.
