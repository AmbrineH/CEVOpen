<p class="p">Saponins (triterpenoid saponin, tea saponin, methanol extract saponin) are the potential additives which cause a significant reduction of protozoa population in the rumen, as a result, methane production is reduced [
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Saponins also contribute rumen fermentation, enhance rumen bacterial populations, and ruminant productivity [

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Saponins from different sources show various results. Application of Quillaja saponin at 1.2 g/L decreased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro,</italic> but not at 0.6 g/L [
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. The ivy fruit saponin decreased CH4 production by 40% [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>] and saponins from 
 <italic class="italic">Saponaria officinalis</italic> reduced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and abundance of both methanogens and protozoa 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. However, the opposite result was found in other 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> studies, where Quillaja saponins at 0.6 g/L did not reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production or abundance of methanogen [
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. Similarly, Tea saponins (30 g/day) also did not reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from steers or methanogens abundance [
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. Though, the effects of saponins on methanogenesis and methanogen abundance are greatly inconstant among different studies, still needed to study more.
