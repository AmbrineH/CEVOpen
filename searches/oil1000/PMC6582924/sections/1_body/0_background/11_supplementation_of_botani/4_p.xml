<p class="p">Essential oils, another plant secondary metabolites, are volatile components [

 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. It contains the chemical constituents and functional groups such as terpenoids, phenolic and phenols, having potential antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>], which inhibit the growth and existence of greatest number of microorganisms in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. Due to their lipophilic nature, they have a very high affinity to microbial cell membranes, and at the same time, their functional groups interact with the microbial cell membrane [
