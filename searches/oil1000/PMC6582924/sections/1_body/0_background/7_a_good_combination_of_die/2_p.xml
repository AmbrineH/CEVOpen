<p class="p">High-quality forage, especially young plants, can mitigate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by shifting the fermentation pathway as this forage contains lower amounts of NDF and higher easily fermentable carbohydrates, leading to a higher digestibility and passage rate [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. On the other hand, more mature forage encourages a higher CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> yield mainly owing to an increased C: N ratio, which subsequently decreases the digestibility in ruminants [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission can also vary depending on types of forage due to the variation of their chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Methane production also significantly affected by the processing and preservation of forages [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] such as, chopping or pelleting of forages require less degradation in the rumen due to their smaller particles size as a consequent reduction of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission per kg of DMI [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Likewise, ensiling of forages, partially fermented, can reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from ruminants [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>].
