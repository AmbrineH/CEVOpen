<p class="p">For increasing the production especially in the high producing dairy cattle higher energy supplementation is needed. Only forage is not sufficient to provide the nutrient for these high yielding cattle. So, concentrates must be supplemented with forages with a higher density of nutrients and less fiber. These concentrates contain fewer cell walls and readily fermentable carbohydrates (starch and sugar) and contribute to the production of propionic acid however reducing CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It was observed in one study that 80% and 90% concentrate supplementation decreased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, while no noticeable effect was found at 35% or 60% concentrate supplementation [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Another study showed that a diet containing 90% concentrate produced extremely low CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> which represented a loss of only 2%â€“3% of the gross energy intake [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Conversely, a diet with high-concentrate contains low in structural fiber and influence to develop sub-acute or acute acidosis. Therefore, dietary manipulation such as feeding a good combination of F:C ration would be effective with respect to mitigating methane emission without hampering their productivity.
