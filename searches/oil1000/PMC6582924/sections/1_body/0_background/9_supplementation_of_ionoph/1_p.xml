<p class="p">Ionophores are antimicrobial compounds, for example, monensin, lasalocid and salinomycin, are typically used in beef and dairy cattle production to improve feed efficiency and animal performance [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. They reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from ruminants significantly. It was reported that monensin supplementation for lactating cows reduced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. For instance, a 25.6% reduction in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was recorded with supplementation of monensin to Brahman steers without a reduction in daily gain [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Monensin upsurges the acetate and propionate ratio in rumen fermentation through the increasing reducing equivalents which contribute propionate formation in ruminant [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Other studies showed that a high dose of monensin reduces CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production (g/d) by 4%â€“10% in dairy and beef cattle [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Likewise, another report revealed a 30% reduction of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission in beef cattle fed monensin at 33 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. Ionophores also hampers survival of protozoa as a consequence the reduction and subsequent recovery of protozoal numbers in the rumen help to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> decline up to 30% [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. However, the inhibitory effects of ionophores on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production may not persist over time, and several microbes already adapted to ionophores [
