<p class="p">Methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), one of the three main greenhouse gases (GHG) besides of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), have a global warming potential of 28-fold than that of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Agricultural sector is considered to contribute the biggest methane emission, which calculated around 50.6% from anthropogenic methane [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Within agriculture, the livestock sector contributes approximately 18% of the global anthropogenic GHG emission [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Among livestock, ruminant contributes about 81% of GHG [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] due to massive methanogenesis by rumen microbes, which produce 90% of total CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from ruminants [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Globally, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions of dairy and beef cattle denote 30% and 35% of the livestock sectorsâ€™ emissions. However, buffalos and small ruminants are lower contributors, demonstrating 8.7% and 6.7% of sector emissions, respectively [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in ruminants represents a gross energy loss from 2% to 14% of gross energy consumption [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, reduction of methane emission in animal conserves an energy and enhances productivity.
