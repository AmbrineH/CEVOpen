<p class="p">Methane production is not consistent for all animal types and breeds [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Olijhoek et al. [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] reported that methane production per kilogram of dry matter intake (DMI) was lower in Holsteins in comparison to Jerseys (30.7 vs. 32.6 L/kg of DMI in case of High RFI and low concentrate group, 21.4 vs. 28.2 in High RFI and high concentrate group, 32.4 vs. 32.5 in Low RFI and high concentrate group and 24.5 vs. 27.9 in Low RFI and low concentrate group). It was also reported that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from different animals under the same feeding trial reveals significant variation among animals [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Pinares-Patino et al. [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] conducted an experiment on grazing sheep where some animals show as high and low CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emitters on the basis of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> output per unit of feed intake [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Some other researches have established that ruminants with low residual feed intake (RFI) emit less CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> than the animals with high RFI [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Likewise, Hegarty et al. [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] stated that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was lower in low RFI Angus steers than in steers having high RFI (142 vs. 192g CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>/day). There was a positive genetic correlation between RFI and predicted methane emission (PME; g/d) which indicated that the cows having lower RFI have lower PME (estimates ranging from 0.18 to 0.84) [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Though the cause is not clear, it might be due to differences in methanogen populations among animals [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. It is proposing that rumen microbial community varies among animals or breeds depending on individual genetic variations that greatly influence CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Therefore, the selection of low methane producer might be a possible and sustainable way to mitigate methane emission.
