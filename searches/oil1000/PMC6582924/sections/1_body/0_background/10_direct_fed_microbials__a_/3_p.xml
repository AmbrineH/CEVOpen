Rumen microbes hastily reduce the nitrate to nitrite, however the reduction rate of nitrite to ammonia is slower. This can cause nitrite accumulation in the rumen [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>] and methemoglobinemia in blood. Methemoglobinemia declines the bloodâ€™s capacity to transport oxygen to tissues, resulting in low performances or even death of animal in severe cases [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. The use of nitrate and/or nitrite-reducing bacteria as probiotic is one of the potential solution to avoid this toxicity [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. The bacteria having the ability to reduce nitrate, nitrite or both compounds are already existing in the rumen, but their concentration is lower than that of their counterpart methanogens [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. The main nitrate-reducing bacteria in the rumen are

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. So, it may be beneficial to increase the number and/or the activity of nitrate- and/or nitrite reducing bacteria in the rumen to decrease methanogenesis. Addition of nitrate in the diet increased the number of nitrate reducing bacteria (

 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>] but this is may be insufficient to compete with methanogenesis. Thus, giving nitrate and/or nitrite-reducing bacteria as probiotics along with nitrate may progress the nitrate reduction process and subsequently avoid nitrite toxicity. Along with nitrate,
