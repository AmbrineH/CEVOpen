<p class="p">Modification of rumen ecosystem through direct-fed microbials (DFM) or probiotics, is one of the most possible approach to reduce methane production in rumen. Probiotics such as bacterial species including 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Megasphaera elsdeniiand Prevotella bryantii</italic> and yeast (
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), are used to improve rumen fermentation and feed efficiency [

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] which could also reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from ruminants. Several pieces of research so far have been conducted earlier in order to mitigate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from ruminant with the supplementation of dietary probiotics. Jeyanathan et al. [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] summarized the several rumen biochemical pathways that could be modulated by direct feed microbials to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from ruminants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The production of VFAs such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids are mainly depends on the diet offered to the animal. Ruminants produce comparatively more propionate, fed a concentrate-based diet than those fed a high forage diet, which produces more acetate.
