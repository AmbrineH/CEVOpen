<p class="p">The ability of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to compete with methanogens is largely determined by the introduction of sulphate into the rumen. In anaerobic environments, where sulphate is unlimited, SRB compete with methanogens for common substrates such as H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, formate and acetate. The population of SRB in the rumen is low (10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL) and largely from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfotomaculum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Recently, another SRB belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacterium</italic> was isolated from buffalo [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. Only few studies were conducted on effect of sulphate supplementation alone in rumen methanogenesis [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>] due to their toxic end product hydrogen sulfide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S). Therefore, the sulphate reduction, owing to decrease methanogenesis, may be facilitated by SRB only when sulphate is added as a feed additive. For example, a reduction in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was recorded in an 
 <italic class="italic">in-vitro</italic> experiment using 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacterium</italic> sp., as a probiotic with a high sulphate diet where CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production at 72h was reduced from 2.66 to 1.64 mmol/g digested dry matter (DM) without H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S accumulation [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>].
