<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are defined as volatile secondary metabolites of plants that give the plant a distinctive smell, taste, or both. EOs are produced by more than 17,500 species of plants from many angiosperm families, e.g.,

 <italic class="italic">Rutaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Myrtaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiberaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Asteraceae</italic>, but only about 300 of them are commercialized [

 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP). They are produced and stored in complex secretory structures, such as glands, secretory cavities, and resin conduits, and are present as drops of liquid in the leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, bark, and roots of plants. Despite containing two or three main components at a level of 20â€“70%, EOs are very complex mixtures of mainly terpenes, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. They may also contain many other compounds, such as fatty acids, oxides, and sulfur derivatives [
