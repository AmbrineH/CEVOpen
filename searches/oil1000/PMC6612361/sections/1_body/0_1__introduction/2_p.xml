<p class="p">EOs are usually obtained as a result of hydrodistillation, steam distillation, dry distillation, or the mechanical cold pressing of plants. At the laboratory scale, the classical method is based on the use of the Clevenger steam distillation apparatus, discovered in 1928. Due to several disadvantages (i.e., placement of valve, fragility), this apparatus was modified by Jakub Deryng in 1951 [

At the laboratory scale, modern methods also include processes supported by microwaves and extraction in supercritical fluids. EOs can also be isolated using fermentation, crushing, extraction, or hydrolysis. However, depending on the chosen method, the chemical composition of the obtained EO can unfortunately be different.
