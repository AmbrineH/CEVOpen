<p class="p">The composition of thyme EO is well known and described. The main components of thyme EO are thymol (36–55%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (15–28%). It should be noted that the thymol was first isolated in 1719 by Neuman. The compound is characterized by strong bactericidal, fungal, and anti-parasitic properties, with relatively low toxicity to humans and animals. The percentage of other compounds should be in the following ranges: γ-terpinene (5–10%), linalool (4–6.5%), carvacrol (1–4%), β-myrcene (1–3%), terpin-4-ol (0.2–4.0%) [

In addition, there are also monoterpene hydrocarbons, such as α-tujen, α-pinene, α-terpinen, camphor myrcen, as well as oxygen derivatives of monoterpenes, 1.8-cineol, linalool, terpin-4-ol, and γ-terpinol, camphor and borneol. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons have also been identified, which include α-humulene, α-kopene, kubeben, α-gurjunen, germacren D, α- and γ-muurolen, and γ and δ-cadinene [
