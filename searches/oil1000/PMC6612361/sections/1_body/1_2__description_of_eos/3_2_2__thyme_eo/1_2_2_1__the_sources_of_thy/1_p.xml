<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic>, consisting of over 400 species, belongs to the 
 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> family. Thyme grows as a shrub with a stumpy, raised stem, on which small, longitudinal leaves and two-lobed pink-violet, light-violet, or white flowers in pairs glow. Oblong, brown splines are obstructions This plant has a height of 10â€“40 cm. EO is found in glandular hairs on leaves and flowers [

 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L. in the production of terpenes is noteworthy, since 6 chemotypes of this species were found [

 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L.; 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> Loefl (Spanish thyme, white thyme), or mixtures of both species. The highest level of EO production usually occurs during the flowering period of the plant [
