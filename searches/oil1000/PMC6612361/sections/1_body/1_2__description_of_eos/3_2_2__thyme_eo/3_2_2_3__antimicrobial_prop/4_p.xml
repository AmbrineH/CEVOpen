<p class="p">On the other hand, thyme EO rich in γ-terpinene (68.415%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-thymol (24.721%) completely inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic> Fg 06–17 at a concentration of 0.06% [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, again the antifungal activity of thyme EO is mainly attributed to the presence of thymol, which may, due to its low polarity, interfere with the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, changing its fluidity and permeability. Other mechanisms of action are based on cell wall damage and changes in fungal morphology. Thyme EO inhibited aflatoxin production, caused the cytoplasmic spill of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>, and was responsible for degenerative changes in its hyphae, which even led to complete disappearance of conidia [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. It also influenced the morphology and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Thyme EO showed a synergistic effect in combination with cinnamon and rosemary EOs on 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</italic> ATCC12481 and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic>. The mean lesion diameter of the pears treated with the cinnamon-rosemary-thyme EOs combination (78, 1250, 39 μg/mL, respectively) was 6 mm and 8 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>, respectively, after 10 days at 25 °C [
