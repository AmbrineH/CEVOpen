<p class="p">Thyme EO showed antiviral activity, as it was active against 
 <italic class="italic">Herpes simplex</italic> (HSV1, DNA virus) with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 11 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This EO also displayed 100% inhibitory activity in the liquid phase at 3.1 µL/mL concentration against influenza virus A1/Denver/1/57 (H1N1) with 30 min exposure [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, the most important effect of thyme EO relates to bacteria. Particularly high bacteriostatic activity against the majority of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is demonstrated by the thymol chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L. EO, which has been described in many reviews [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This activity is due to the high content of thymol and carvacrol, which due to the acidic nature of the hydroxyl group, can form hydrogen bonds with the active site of many enzymes. In 2017, Schött [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] described the activity of thyme EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. This bacteria is responsible for the development of dental caries but may also cause infective endocarditis. The EO from 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> was more active than EO from 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic>. Only thymol chemotype was active.
