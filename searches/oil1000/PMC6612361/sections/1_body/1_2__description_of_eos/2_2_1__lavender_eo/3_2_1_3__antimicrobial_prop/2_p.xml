 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Researchers have found that antimicrobial activity of this EO is a result of the synergistic action of major and minor components of the essential oil. In turn, using commercial 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> Mill. EO (Pollena Aroma, Warsaw), it was shown that the non-sporulating Gram-negative bacteria from the 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family (MBC = 1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were more sensitive to essential oil than Gram-positive
