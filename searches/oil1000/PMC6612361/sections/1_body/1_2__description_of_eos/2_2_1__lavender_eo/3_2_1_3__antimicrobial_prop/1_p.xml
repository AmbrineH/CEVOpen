<p class="p">Lavender EO showed antiviral activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]; it has shown antibacterial activity to a much greater extent. In dermatology, lavender EO can be used to treat ulcers, burns, and scarring that are difficult to cure. An extensive review of the properties of many different oils, including lavender EO, in relation to the pathogens responsible for dermatological diseases is detailed in Orchard et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. It is worth noting that the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> Mill. has a strong antiseptic effect against antibiotic-resistant strains, e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) resistant to methicillin or vancomycin-resistant strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus</italic> sp. (VRE) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Lavender EO is also active against the strain of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> J53 R1 resistant to piperacillin. Essential oil caused the strain’s sensitivity to this antibiotic by altering the permeability of the outer membrane, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence. The activity of lavender EO against 24 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> was also tested (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 2.5–5.0 μL/mL). In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> L120 resistant to chloramphenicol, the MIC was 1.3 μL/mL [
