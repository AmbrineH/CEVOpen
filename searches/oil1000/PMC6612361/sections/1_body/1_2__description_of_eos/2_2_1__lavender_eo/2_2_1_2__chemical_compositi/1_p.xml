<p class="p">Lavender EO is a colorless or pale yellow liquid with a characteristic odor. The chemical composition is well known, with detailed data specified in the European Pharmacopoeia 9, Polish Pharmacopoeia VIII, and PNISO (Polish ISO standard) 3515: 2004. Lavender EO is obtained after distillation with water vapor of fresh or dried tips of blooming plants. The main components are 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> enantiomers of linalool (20–45%) and linalyl acetate (25 to 46%). The high content of these ingredients determines the quality of the oil. The content of other ingredients should be in the following ranges: limonene (&gt;1.0%), eucalyptol (&lt;2.5%), camphor (&gt;1.2%), terpin-4-ol (0.1–6.0) %), lawandulol (&lt;0.1%), lavandulyl acetate (&lt;0.2%), and α-terpineol (&gt;2.0%). Due to the incalculable influence on the scent, lavender oil should not contain too much ocymen, cineole, camphor, or terpin-4-ol [
