<p class="p">In another study carried out by Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], it was pointed out that the cinnamon leaf EO counteracts the development of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> yeast, which can settle in the mouth. Ultimately, the antimicrobial activity of cinnamon EO against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was confirmed by Herman’s research [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>], in which the author does not indicate the raw material from which the EO was obtained. Similarly, without giving the raw material from which the EO was obtained, Sumalan et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] reported activity indicating the inhibition of the growth of filamentous fungi of the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus, Cladosporium,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>. Overall, the antimicrobial activity of cinnamon EO is mainly associated with the content of cinnamaldehyde, for which the MIC was in the range of 0.5 to 1000 μg/mL in relation to 20 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
