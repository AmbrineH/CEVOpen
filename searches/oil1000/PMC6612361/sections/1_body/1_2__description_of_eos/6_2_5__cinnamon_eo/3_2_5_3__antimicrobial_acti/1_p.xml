<p class="p">In numerous studies of antimicrobial activity, cinnamon EOs of various origins are used. EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> displayed 100% inhibitory activity at 3.1 ÂµL/mL concentration against influenza virus A1/Denver/1/57 (H1N1) with 30 min exposure. Eugenol, the major component of 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> EO, possessed the most potent anti-influenza activity in both liquid and vapour phases [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Brochot et al. investigated the antiviral activity of a blend that was composed of equal parts (3.52% each) of 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> CT cineol (leaf) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> CT cinnamaldehyde (bark), 3.00% 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> CT cineol (leaf), 1.04% 
 <italic class="italic">Daucus carota</italic> CT carotol (seed), and 88.90% 
 <italic class="italic">Camelina sativa</italic> oil (seed). This blend significantly reduced viral units of H1N1 and HSV1. For both viruses, a reduction greater than 99% was observed with 1% blend and 60-min contact time [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Intorasoot et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] and Feng et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] carried out studies involving EO from the bark of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic>, which is rich in cinnamic aldehyde. They showed that the EO has a better effect compared to other EOs used (including clove EO, lemongrass, tea tree, ginger, basil), with very good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, E. coli, A. baumannii,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], and even better activity than the antibiotic against 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Cinnamon EO can cause destruction of bacterial cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of cinnamaldehyde against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> has been previously confirmed by Ferro [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. In a study carried out by Aumeerudda-Elalfi et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> EO from leaves was used. The experiment indicated better antimicrobial activity than antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) against 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis, E. coli, P. auerginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. However, it did not show better antimicrobial activity than other EOs examined during the study.
