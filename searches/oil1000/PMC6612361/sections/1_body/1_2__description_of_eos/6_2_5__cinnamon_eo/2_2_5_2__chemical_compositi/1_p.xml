 <xref rid="B70-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Depending on the raw material (bark or cinnamon leaves) from which the EO was obtained, the ratio of the two main components—eugenol and cinnamaldehyde—significantly differs. For EO obtained from cinnamon bark, it is characterized by a low amount of eugenol (5–10%) and abundance of cinnamyl aldehyde (65–80%), while EO obtained from cinnamon leaves is rich in eugenol (10–95%) and poor in cinnamyl aldehyde (1–5%) [
