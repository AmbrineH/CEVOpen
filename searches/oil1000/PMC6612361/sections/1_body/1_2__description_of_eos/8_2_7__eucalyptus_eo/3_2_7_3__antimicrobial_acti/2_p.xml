<p class="p">Antibacterial activity has been determined to a much greater extent. It is active, for example, against bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. gingivalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutant</italic>, which cause periodontitis and other dental ailments. Therefore, its main component 1,8-cineneol has been used in products for oral hygiene, such as Listerine Cleanmint (Pfizer), Listerine Freshmint (Pgizer), and Walgreens Fresh Breath Antiseptic Mouth Rinse (Walgreen Co.) [

 <italic class="italic">E. tarda, V. ichthoenteri, V. harveyi, P. damselae, S. iniae, S. parauberis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. garviae</italic>, considered to be pathogens of fish [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Eucalyptus EO is more active against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria, which is attributed to the presence of components such as 1.8-cineole, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-geraniol, and terpinolene, which can increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane through functional impairment. The most sensitive bacterium is 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> [
