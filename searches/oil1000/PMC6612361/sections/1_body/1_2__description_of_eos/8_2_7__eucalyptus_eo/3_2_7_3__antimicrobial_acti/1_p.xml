<p class="p">Eucalyptus EO has antimicrobial activity against viruses, bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. Eucalyptus EO, rich in 1,8-cineole (88%), was active against HSV-1 in vitro. EO was able to suppress viral multiplication by &gt;96%. This EO exhibits an anti-HSV1 activity by directly inactivating free-virus particles and might also interfere with virion envelope structures required for entry into host cells [

 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species grown in Tunisia against Coxsakievirus B3 Nancy strain was studied using Confluent Vero cell cultures that were treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the EOs, both during and after viral infections; activity depended on 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species. EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">E. sideroxylon</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. lehmannii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. leucoxylon</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. odorata</italic> had no antiviral activity, while those from 
 <italic class="italic">E. bicostata</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.7–4.8 mg/mL), 
 <italic class="italic">E. astringens</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. maidennii</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 136.5–233.5 mg/mL) were the most active against viral infections [

 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> EO was mildly active against mumps virus isolated from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infection. The antiviral activity was assessed by plaque reduction assay [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. This EO also displayed 100% inhibitory activity at 3.1 µL/mL concentration against influenza virus A1/Denver/1/57 (H1N1) after 10 min exposure [
