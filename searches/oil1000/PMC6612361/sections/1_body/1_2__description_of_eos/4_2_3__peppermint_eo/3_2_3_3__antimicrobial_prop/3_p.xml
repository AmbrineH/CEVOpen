<p class="p">Recently, the effect of peppermint EO on the development of yeast has been investigated. These microorganisms may be responsible for the spoiling of cashew, guava, mango, and pineapple juices. In preliminary studies, the MIC was 1.875 μL/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pichia anomala</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>. However, when used in mango and pineapple juices, even at higher concentrations of EO (7.5 μL/mL), no significant reduction in yeast was observed. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>, the addition of 1.875 μL/mL of mint EO to the cashew and guava juices strongly weakened the membrane permeability, membrane potential, and activity of the efflux pump in the yeast cells. It is true that mint EO did not affect the appearance, smell, and viscosity of fruit juices, but negatively influenced their taste [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] determined that mint EO in the volatile form inhibits the development of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> comparable to amphotericin-B, influencing the expression of various genes, such as secreted aspartyl proteinases (SAP 1, 2, 3, 9, 10), and being associated with the process of adhesion of hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1).
