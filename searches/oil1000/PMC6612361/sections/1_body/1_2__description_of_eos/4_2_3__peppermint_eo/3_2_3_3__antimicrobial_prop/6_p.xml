<p class="p">The possibility of using peppermint EO introduced into a chitosan nanogel was investigated in the protection of plaque against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> causing caries. The maximum release of peppermint EO from the nanogel was about 50% after 360 h in an aqueous-alcoholic solvent at ambient temperature. The adhesion of bacterial cells was highly sensitive to nanoformulation of mint EO, as compared to the unloaded chitosan nanogel. Inhibition of biosynthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> occurred at a concentration of 50 μg/mL, compared to 400 μg/mL for a nanogel without EO. In addition, it was found that chitosan nanogel containing mint EO inhibited the activity of glycosyltransferase genes (
 <italic class="italic">gtf</italic>B, 
 <italic class="italic">gtf</italic>C, and 
 <italic class="italic">gtf</italic>D) involved in the formation of extracellular polymers [

 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic>,
