<p class="p">Approximately 300 compounds have been identified in the EO. The main components are menthol (30–55%) and mentone (14–32%). Menthol occurs mainly as the isomer with the (1

 <italic class="italic">R</italic>, 4
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>) configuration (20–60%), while the main isomer of mentone is (1
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>, 4
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>) (5–35%). The Polish Pharmacopoeia VIII defines the content of other ingredients as follows: cineol (3.5–14%), menthyl acetate (2.8–10%), isomenton (1.5–10%), menthofuran (1.0–9.0%), limonene (1.0–5.0%), pulegone (&lt;4.0%), and carvone (&lt;1.0%). The quantitative composition of EO depends on many factors, such as the growing conditions, and the date of harvesting. Therefore, the date of the congregation should be chosen to ensure that it contains as much menthol as possible [
