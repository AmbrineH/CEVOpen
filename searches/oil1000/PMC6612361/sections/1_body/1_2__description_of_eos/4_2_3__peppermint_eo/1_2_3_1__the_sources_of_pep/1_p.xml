<p class="p">The genus Mentha is part of the family of Lamiaceae (
 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic>) and includes about 30 species grown in temperate climate zones around the world, especially in Europe, North America, North Africa (Syria, Ethiopia), and northern parts of Iran. Due to the high variability of the species and great ease of crossing species, the chemical composition of the EOs obtained from them is very diverse [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. One of the species—peppermint—is a natural hybrid of two species: 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha aquatic</italic> L. Peppermint is a perennial with a height of 30–90 cm with numerous underground and aboveground runners and a purple stem. The leaves are oblong and dark green. Purple flowers are collected in capitate inflorescences. This plant requires fertile and permeable soil. EO from peppermint is obtained after distillation of dried leaves with water vapor. As a result of this process, a light yellow or greenish liquid with an intense mint aroma is obtained [
