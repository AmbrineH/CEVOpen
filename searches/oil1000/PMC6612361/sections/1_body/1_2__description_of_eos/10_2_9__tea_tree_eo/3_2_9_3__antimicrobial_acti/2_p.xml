 <xref rid="B126-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>] determined that tea tree EO reduces the growth of bacteria responsible for halitosis—

 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonas endodontalis</italic> (MIC = 0.007% and MBC = 0.5%). The most important element of the study was the finding that tea tree EO not only inhibits the growth of bacteria responsible for halitosis leading to personal and social discomfort, but also limits the production of volatile sulfur compounds—H

 <xref rid="B131-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>] was the reduction of yeast resistance to the drug fluconazole due to the simultaneous use of tea tree EO or its main component (terpinen-4-ol). The authors indicated that as many as 62.5% of the 32 resistant strains became susceptible to the drug after 24 h exposure to the essential oil or its component. The minimum fluconazole concentration inhibiting fungal growth also decreased significantly (from 244.0 μg/mL to 38.46 μg/mL), along with its minimum fungicidal concentration (from 254.47 μg/mL to 66.62 μg/mL).
