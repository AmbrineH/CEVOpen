<p class="p">Recently [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], the antimicrobial properties of commercially available tea tree EOs were investigated. Of the 10 EOs, 5 were active. Identified components of the tea tree EO reduced the survival of the bacteria in the 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> biofilm and caused oxidative damage in 
 <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>. On the other hand, EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>) had only marginal antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> (MIC = 625 µg/mL), attributed to its active components terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. Another example is 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum,</italic> which is a cosmopolitan pathogen that can cause damage to fruit crops. Germination of this fungus was completely inhibited at the concentration of tea tree EO 250 µg/mL. Tea tree EO caused damage to the plasma membrane, leading to DNA, protein, lipid, and glucose leakage [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. In turn, the effects of tea tree EO on mitochondrial morphology and function in a culture of 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis cinerea</italic> was investigated. This EO at a concentration of 2 mL/L severely damaged mitochondria, resulting in matrix loss and increased mitochondrial irregularity. The next consequence of mitochondrial damage was the disruption of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species [
