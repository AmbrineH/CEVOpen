<p class="p">So far, the most promising tea tree EO in terms of antimicrobial properties is derived from a chemotype characterized by 30–40% terpinen-4-ol content [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. EO was active against 
 <italic class="italic">Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 in vitro. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of this EO was determined as 2.0 µg/mL. EO was able to suppress viral multiplication by &gt;96% [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Additionally, a randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded protocol was used to evaluate the efficacy of tea tree essential oil (6% tea tree EO gel) in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. The median time of reepithelization after treatment with this EO was 9 days compared to 12.5 days after placebo, indicating some benefit from tea tree EO treatment [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Meanwhile, the antibacterial activity has been determined to a much greater extent. The tea tree EO inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> at a concentration of 0.78% and inhibited the adhesion of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> [
