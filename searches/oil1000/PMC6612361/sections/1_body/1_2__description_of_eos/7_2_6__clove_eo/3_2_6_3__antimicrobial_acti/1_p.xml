<p class="p">The in vitro antiviral activity of eugenol—the main component of clove EO—has been tested against HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The replication of these viruses was inhibited with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 25.6 μg/mL and 16.2 μg/mL against HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Additional investigations revealed synergistic interactions with a combination of eugenol and acyclovir, a known antiviral drug. Studies have shown that application of eugenol delayed the development of herpes virus-induced keratitis in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Eugenol was evaluated for its anti-HSV properties on the plaque reduction assay. Only two isolates were inhibited by eugenol, but the inhibition against these isolates was greater than for the extract obtained from the flower buds of
