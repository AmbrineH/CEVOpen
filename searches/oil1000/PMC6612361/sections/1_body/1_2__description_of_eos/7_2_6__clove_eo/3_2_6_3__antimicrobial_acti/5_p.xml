<p class="p">It has been proven that compounds forming clove EO can destroy the wall and cellular membrane of microorganisms, pass through cytoplasmic membranes or enter cells, and then inhibit the proper synthesis of DNA and proteins. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> treated with clove EO, the DNA content decreased from 15.004 μg/mL to 5,587 μg/mL, thus by 62.76%. In addition, the bioluminescence assay showed 81.7% reduction in intracellular ATPase, which means that clove oil can damage the cell membrane and cause ATP outflow from the cell. This oil also inhibits the action of β-galactosidase, which by hydrolyzing lactose to galactose and glucose determines the use of this sugar as a source of carbon and energy. It also inhibits bacterial respiratory metabolism by affecting the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway [

 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, with the ability to destroy the cell wall and cause lysis of cells [
