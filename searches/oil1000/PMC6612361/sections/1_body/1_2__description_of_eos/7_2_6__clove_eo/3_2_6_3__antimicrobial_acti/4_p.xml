<p class="p">Due to the similarity of the composition of EO, tests of the antimicrobial activity of clove EO and cinnamon leaf EO are often carried out in parallel. Both EOs showed strong bacteriostatic activity at concentrations of 0.03–0.05% and bactericidal activity at concentrations of 0.04–0.1% in relation to 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, S. enteritidis, C. jejuni,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. The activity of both EOs was also compared in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and 5 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</italic> isolated in the hospital. Clove EO was slightly weaker than cinnamon EO in relation to strains of bacteria attacking the human respiratory system, such as 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic>. The antimicrobial properties of clove EO with cardamon EO, cinnamon EO, and 10% phenol solution were also compared. The research was carried out using the diffusion method with 9 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 4 Gram-negative bacteria, and 7 strains of molds. Clove EO was the most active. Schmidt et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-24-02130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] conducted a study in which eugenol-rich clove EO was active against 38 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> isolated from the oropharynx, damaged skin, and vagina. Interestingly, eugenol itself showed weaker activity than the clove EO isolated from leaves.
