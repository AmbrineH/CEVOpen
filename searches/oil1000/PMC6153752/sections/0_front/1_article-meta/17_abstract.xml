 <p class="p">Leaf-cutting ants are pests of great economic importance due to the damage they cause to agricultural and forest crops. The use of organosynthetic insecticides is the main form of control of these insects. In order to develop safer technology, the objective of this work was to evaluate the formicidal activity of the essential oils of two 
  <italic class="italic">Hyptis pectinata</italic> genotypes (chemotypes) and their major compounds on the leaf-cutting ants 
  <italic class="italic">Acromyrmex balzani</italic> Emery and 
  <italic class="italic">Atta sexdens rubropilosa</italic> Forel. Bioassays of exposure pathways (contact and fumigation) and binary mixtures of the major compounds were performed. The major compounds identified in the essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> were β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and calamusenone. The essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> were toxic to the ants in both exposure pathways. Essential oils were more toxic than their major compounds alone. The chemotype calamusenone was more toxic to 
  <italic class="italic">A. balzani</italic> in both exposure pathways. 
  <italic class="italic">A. sexdens rubropilosa</italic> was more susceptible to the essential oil of the chemotype β-caryophyllene in both exposure pathways. In general, the binary mixtures of the major compounds resulted in additive effect of toxicity. The essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> is a raw material of great potential for the development of new insecticides.
