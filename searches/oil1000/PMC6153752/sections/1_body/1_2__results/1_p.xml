 <xref rid="molecules-22-00621-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the chemical composition of the essential oils of the two chemotypes. Twenty-seven compounds were identified in the essential oils, and 90% of their composition consisted of sesquiterpenes. The genotypes SAM-016 and SAM-019 presented Î²-caryophyllene (17.66%) and calamusenone (36.08%) as major compounds, respectively. In both chemotypes, the second major compound was caryophyllene oxide (11.52% and 22.89%). Essential oil contents of 0.67% and 0.62% were obtained for the genotypes SAM-016 and SAM-019, respectively.
