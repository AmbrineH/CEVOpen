<p class="p">The objective of this work was to identify and quantify the chemical compounds; to evaluate the toxicity of the essential oils of two 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> genotypes (chemotypes) and their major compounds to 
 <italic class="italic">A. balzani</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. sexdens rubropilosa</italic>; and to determine whether or not synergistic, additism, and/or antagonistic effects occur by testing the binary mixture of the major compounds. Based on the results of the present study, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinate</italic> and its major compounds Î²-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and calamusenone showed formicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. balzani</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. sexdens rubropilosa,</italic> affecting the survival of these species.
