<p class="p">The present results demonstrate that the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> are a promising alternative to be used in the management of leaf-cutting ants. Thus, the confirmation of the formicidal potential of the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> qualifies this species as a source of raw material for formulation and commercialization of bioproducts to control leaf-cutting ants. Additional behavioral studies should be carried out in order to elucidate the behavior of the ants against bioactive substances, since they can reduce the action of these compounds by mechanisms such as chemical communication, olfactory sensitivity and learning ability [
