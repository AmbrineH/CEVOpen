<p class="p">The insecticidal activity reported in the present work is a result of bioactive substances synthesized by the secondary metabolism of plants, which can act in the natural defense against the attack of pathogens. Thus, these substances have increasingly been used as sources of raw material in the development of new bio-insecticides, since they have many advantages when compared with synthetic insecticides. The process of insect resistance to these substances is slower and essential oils are biodegradable [
