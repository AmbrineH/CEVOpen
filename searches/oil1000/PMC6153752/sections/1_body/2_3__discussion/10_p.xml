<p class="p">Regardless of the exposure pathway, the essential oils of the chemotypes calamusenone and Î²-caryophyllene were more efficient in 
 <italic class="italic">A. balzani</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. sexdens rubropilosa</italic>, respectively. The biological activity of the essential oils is directly related to their chemical compounds and to the physiological/biochemical responses of the insects when exposed to these compounds [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. These results are due to the differentiated chemical composition of the essential oils studied, as well as to the susceptibility of each ant species to the different compounds present in the essential oil. This susceptibility to different compounds may be related to the enzymatic complex inherent in each ant species, and the consequent capacity to metabolize them, besides the insensitivity of the target site of action [
