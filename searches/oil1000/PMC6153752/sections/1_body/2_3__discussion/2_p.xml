<p class="p">The identification of the compounds present in the essential oils of the genotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> allowed the distinction of these compounds into chemotypes. Studies on the essential oils of this plant have reported variations among their chemical compounds. Different authors have identified β-caryophyllene (12.9%–28.3%), caryophyllene oxide (18.0%–28.0%), calamusenone (24.7%), α-muurolol (25.5%), cubenol (11.4%) and germacrene-D (8.2%) as major compounds in plants collected in the state of Sergipe. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> plants from Africa presented 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (33.8%) and γ-terpinene (8.9%) as major compounds [

 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> plants, in which β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and calamusenone have been identified as major compounds [
