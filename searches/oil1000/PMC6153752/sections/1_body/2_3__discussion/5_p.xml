<p class="p">The insecticidal activity of the essential oil of this plant has already been demonstrated for larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Essential oils need to penetrate the body of the insect and reach the site of action, so that they can exhibit their insecticide activity. The present work showed that essential oils can penetrate the ants′ cuticle (contact) or their spiracles (fumigation). The ability of cuticle penetration of the insects can be restricted by the chemical composition of the essential oils, and the physico-chemical properties and thickness of the cuticle [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Possibly, the essential oil applied via contact could not penetrate the ants’ cuticle as efficiently as fumigation.
