<p class="p">Although plant essential oils have been increasingly tested against a wide range of insects with promising results, the amount of commercial bioinseticides consisting of essential oils is still small. This may be due to insufficient government support, which makes the process of bio-insecticide authorization highly complex and costly. Another factor is the rapid volatilization and oxidation of the chemical compounds of the essential oils, which impairs the chemical stability of the compounds and significantly reduces the persistence of the efficacy in its direct use, requiring the development of efficient stabilization processes, such as formulations [
