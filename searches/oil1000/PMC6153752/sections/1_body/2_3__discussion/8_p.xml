<p class="p">The sesquiterpenes tested in the experiment were less toxic when compared with the essential oils, suggesting the combined participation of the compounds. The biological activity of essential oils is also influenced by interactions between their compounds [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The contribution of each compound to the biological activity may depend on the other compounds, as a result of the interaction between the compounds [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Thus, the analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oil alone cannot confirm that the major compound is responsible for the biological activity in question, and its effect can be attributed to a compound in a lesser proportion, or to synergism between the compounds [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The synergistic effect of the compounds of the essential oils of geranium (
 <italic class="italic">Geranium maculatum</italic> L.) was demonstrated by the insecticidal activity against the domestic fly (
 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic> L.) [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Higher insecticidal activity of the essential oil of Thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) and lemon grass (
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf) was confirmed in relation to the major compounds when individually tested [
