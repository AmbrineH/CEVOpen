<p class="p">Similarly, once inside the body of the insects, the essential oils possibly act in the nervous system, regulating the neurotransmitters [

Thus, the toxicity of the essential oils or of their major compounds may be due to different mechanisms, such as: (i) octopaminergic sites of action, decreasing or increasing octopamine, a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator found exclusively in invertebrates, may result in the rupture of the nervous system activity, when alterations in the functioning of this neurotransmitter occur [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]; (ii) interference in the chlorine channels modulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a substance that controls the flow of chlorine ions by the nerve cell membrane and restores their resting state, causing hyperexcitation of the nervous system [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]; (iii) inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and is a neurotransmitter, causing nervous hyperactivity, and consequent death of the insect [
