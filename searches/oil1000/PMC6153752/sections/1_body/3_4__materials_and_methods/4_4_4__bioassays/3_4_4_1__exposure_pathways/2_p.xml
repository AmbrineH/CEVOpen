<p class="p">Preliminary bioassays were carried out with three doses (0.1; 1.0; and 10 μg essential oil/mg insect) for contact, and three concentrations (0.1; 1.0; and 10 μL essential oil/L air) for fumigation. From these tests, doses and concentrations for the subsequent bioassays were determined in order to obtain the curves of lethal dose and concentration. For the calculation of the doses, the mean weight of 30 ants was obtained, using a 0.01 mg analytical precision scale (Shimadzu AUW220D, Kyoto, Japan)</p>
