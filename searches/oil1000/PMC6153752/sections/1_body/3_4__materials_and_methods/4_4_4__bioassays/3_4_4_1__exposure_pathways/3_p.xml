<p class="p">In the contact bioassays, tests were carried out on Petri dishes (9 cm in diameter × 2 cm in height), with filter paper at the bottom (Unifil, code 501.009), moistened with 0.5 mL distilled water, with seven ants per dish. Preliminary tests indicated that this combination of moisture and ant density does not affect ants’ survival. Petri dishes were kept in a freezer at −4°C for 1 min to reduce ant activity and allow topical application of the treatments to the individuals. Each ant received 1 μL of the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">H. pectinata</italic> or of the major compounds in the pronotum region, applied using a 10 μL Hamilton
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> microsyringe. The dishes containing the ants were sealed with PVC plastic film and kept in B.O.D. chamber at 25 ± 1 °C and relative humidity &gt; 70%.
