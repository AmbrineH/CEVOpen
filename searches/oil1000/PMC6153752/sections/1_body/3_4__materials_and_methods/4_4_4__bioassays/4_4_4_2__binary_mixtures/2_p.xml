 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the most effective major compounds determined in the contact bioassay were used in the bioassays. The compounds were grouped in pairs using doses at 1:1 ratio. The major compounds were tested separately and in mixtures at these doses for each ant species. Actual mortality (observed) was compared with expected mortality, and the effects of binary mixtures were classified as additism (or no effect), synergism or antagonism.
