<p class="p">Analyses of the essential oil compounds were carried out using a GC-MS/FID (QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with an autosampler AOC-20i (Shimadzu). Separations were accomplished using an Rtx
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>-5MS Restek fused silica capillary column (5%-diphenyl–95%-dimethyl polysiloxane) of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25μm film thickness, at a constant helium (99.999%) flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Injection volume of 0.5 μL (5 mg/mL) was employed, with a split ratio of 1:10. The oven temperature was programmed from 50 °C (isothermal for 1.5 min), with an increase of 4 °C/min, to 200 °C, then 10 °C/min to 250 °C, ending with a 5 min isothermal at 250 °C.
