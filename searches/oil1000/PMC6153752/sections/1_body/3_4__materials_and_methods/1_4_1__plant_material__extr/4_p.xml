<p class="p">Retention indices were determined by the equation of Van den Dool and Kratz (1963) [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>C9-
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>C18), and compared with retention indices of the literature [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-22-00621" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] for the identification of the compounds. Simultaneously, three libraries (WILEY8, NIST107 and NIST21) of the equipment were used, which allowed the comparison of the spectra data with the data of the libraries, using an 80% similarity index.
