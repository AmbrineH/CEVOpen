<p class="p">The MS and FID data were simultaneously acquired by employing a Detector Splitting System; the split flow ratio was 4:1 (MS:FID). A 0.62 m × 0.15 mm i.d. restrictor tube (capillary column) was used to connect the splitter to the MS detector; a 0.74 m × 0.22 mm i.d. restrictor tube was used to connect the splitter to the FID detector. The MS data (total ion chromatogram, TIC) were obtained in the full scan mode (

The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the ion-source temperature was 250 °C. The FID temperature was set to 250 °C, and the gas supplies for the FID were hydrogen, air, and helium at flow rates of 30, 300, and 30 mL/min, respectively. Quantification of each constituent was estimated by FID peak-area normalization (%). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas, and they were arranged in order of GC elution.
