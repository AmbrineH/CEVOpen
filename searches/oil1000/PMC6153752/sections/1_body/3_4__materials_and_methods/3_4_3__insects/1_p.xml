<p class="p">Workers of 
 <italic class="italic">A. balzani</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. sexdens rubropilosa</italic> were directly obtained from nests from the campus of the Federal University of Sergipe, São Cristóvão-SE, Brazil (10°54′ S, 37°04′ W). The ants were kept in the nest fragments in round plastic containers (50 cm × 20 cm) at ambient conditions (temperature 25–27 °C and relative humidity 60% ± 5%), for 24 h prior to the test, and only distilled water was supplied during this period. Workers of the same size were used in the bioassays.
