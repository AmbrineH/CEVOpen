<p id="Par8" class="p">In the case of RTIs, the vapor of EOs can pass into the airway and make a direct contact with the infected surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is worth investigating the antimicrobial effect of EOs in the VP. Previously, in vitro assessments of antimicrobial efficacy of EO vapors were published, however, there is no standardized in vitro VP method nowadays, and the comparison of the results of different studies is very difficult or even impossible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of EOs may alter among different in vitro conditions; therefore, the parallel assessment of this property in two test systems (liquid medium and VP) should provide more valuable results and data for development of new natural products used in the alternative treatment of RTIs.
