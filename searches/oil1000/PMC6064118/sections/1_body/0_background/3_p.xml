<p id="Par7" class="p">There are a great number of products containing essential oils (EOs) in commercial marketing. However, EOs are generally applied based upon long-standing use in the complementary and alternative treatment of diverse diseases. Their antimicrobial potential is generally studied by several in vitro techniques, but mainly liquid phase is used in these assays instead of vapor phase (VP) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] so the results from the assays are very different and it is difficult to compare them. EOs are non-water-soluble substances, therefore, the commonly applied microbiological tests have been optimized to this condition.
