In conclusion, we must highlight cinnamon bark as the most active EO in both in vitro systems. Besides, thyme, citronella, and peppermint oil and vapor also had strong antibacterial effect. At lower concentrations, clove oil was a more potent inhibitor in liquid phase; in vapor form it showed activity against
