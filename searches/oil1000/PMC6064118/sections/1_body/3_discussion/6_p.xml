 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] than Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, we found that Gam-negative pathogens required less EO for their total inhibition in our both systems. We suggest that this is partly due to the fact that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> forms biofilm, which enhance the resistance of this pathogen. Our observation was in correlation with the results of Inouye et al. [

 <italic class="italic">H. influenzae</italic> may have an important function [

However, it should be taken into consideration that due to their lipophilic character they require effective formulation to achieve the proper activity in the respiratory tract. Thus, further development of effective and economical application of EOs’ special devices is indispensable in the future. [
