<p id="Par22" class="p">Due to the hydrophobic character of EOs, classical microbiological tests are not relevant for detection of the antibacterial activity of these substances, thus, some modifications and development of new techniques is essential for this purpose. With BDT, we could detect the antibacterial effect of EOs in liquid medium; however, the inhibitory effect of volatiles could be determined with VPT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The EOs application via inhalation is becoming more frequent nowadays, especially in the case of bacterial infections of the respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Classical antibacterial assays did not model the circumstances of inhalation; moreover, they usually focus on the activity of EOs via direct contact. In opposite, VPT detect the effect of gaseous phase produced by EO vapor and they can be easily combined with other techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. It should be highlighted that VPT can also be adapted to other different pathogens such as fungi and viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. According to the result of the microbiological assays, cinnamon bark, clove, thyme, peppermint, and citronella oils showed the most potent activity in both vapor and liquid systems. Therefore, they could be promising alternatives to support the current general treatment of bacterial infections. Their multicomponent composition gives them benefit in bacterial resistance; however, it simultaneously creates difficulties in their standardization and their effects’ proper comparison [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. In liquid form, cinnamon bark was the most effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic>, while thyme oil showed the best activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic>, clove oil produced the lowest MIC value, which was followed by citronella. Cinnamon bark and thyme were equally active against this pathogen, which was in accordance with previous results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Interestingly, Mulyaningsih et al. reported inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic> by eucalyptus fruit oil in lower amount compared to our MIC values. Because we used EO distilled from the leaves, we suggest that the difference is probably caused by the compositions of the eucalyptus oils in the experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Parallel to our results, a previous publication has reported the same inhibitory trend and cited strong antibacterial character of cinnamon bark and cinnamaldehyde against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Against this pathogen, antibiofilm activity of eucalyptus oil was also published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Between 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp., slight differences were observed between the EOs. Among our test materials, we detected the best inhibition in the case of cinnamon bark followed by thyme and clove, which was in accordance with previous observations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">H. parainfluenzae</italic> was more susceptible to citronella, eucalyptus, and scots pine. However, eucalyptus oil and its vapor was previously reported as promising solutions against respiratory viruses (e.g. Influenza Virus type A and mumps virus), their antibacterial value in several studies were less potent than the antiviral effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to other reports, which support our findings, eucalyptus oil could be a more potent inhibitor of 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> species in contrast with 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic> in liquid phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic> was completely inhibited by thyme in low concentration; as well as cinnamon and citronella showed similar activity against this pathogen. The same potency was observed previously by Dorman et al. and Tanaka et al., in addition, EO components such as cinnamaldehyde, citronellal, thymol, eugenol, geraniol, limonene; 
 <italic class="italic">cis/trans</italic> citral and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineole also produced activity in their test systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>].
