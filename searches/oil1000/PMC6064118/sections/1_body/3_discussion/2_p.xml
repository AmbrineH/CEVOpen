<p id="Par23" class="p">In VPT, Gram-negative pathogens were more sensitive to the EO treatment compared to Gram-positive bacteria. This observation was parallel to our experience in liquid media. Against all 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> species, cinnamon bark vapor produced the lowest MIC value in the range of 75–90 μL/L. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic>, the same inhibitory effect was observed than in BDT; however, we found scots pine vapor less active in gaseous phase. 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic> was equally sensitive to citronella and thyme vapor, which was followed by clove and peppermint. Cinnamon bark volatiles were equally active against 
 <italic class="italic">H. influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. parainfluenzae</italic>; however, slight differences were observed between these two bacteria considering the activity of thyme, citronella, and peppermint. Our observations were in accordance with previous reports [
