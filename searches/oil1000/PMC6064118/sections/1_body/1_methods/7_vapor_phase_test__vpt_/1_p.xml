<p id="Par16" class="p">The in vitro VPT were based on the method described by Kloucek et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] with modifications of our previously published observations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. The test system was developed in a four-section Petri dish (PD, diameter 90 mm, VWR, Debrecen, Hungary) containing 5 ml of 5% sheep blood agar in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococci</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp. required chocolate agar with 15 μg/mL NAD supplementation. Test medium was not added into the upper lid of the PD. All bacteria were grown in solid test medium at 37 °C for 24 h before the assay and then inocula were made by dilution in sterile 0.9% saline to 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL. Then three sections of the PD were inoculated with 20 μL of the selected bacterial suspensions. Different strains were spread into each section. The fourth compartment was left uninoculated as contamination control. Each EO sample was diluted with absolute ethanol (stock solutions: 0.5–195 μL/mL). 500 μL of stock solution was distributed on the surface of a sterile filter paper disc (thickness 0.18 mm, diameter 84 mm, Albet-Hahnemühle, Germany). The disc was placed on the separating wall of the PD after solvent evaporation. Therefore, there was approximately 2 mm distance between the disc and the inoculated agar surface. PDs were hermetically closed with Parafilm adhesive tape (Sigma Aldrich Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) to avoid the evaporation, and they were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, filter papers were removed and MIC values were determined. The MIC is the lowest concentration of an EO (expressed as μL of EO/free atmosphere above the growing microorganism) which can absolutely inhibit the visible growth of the bacteria. Filter paper discs containing absolute ethanol or left untreated were used as solvent and growth controls. All tests were carried out in triplicate.
