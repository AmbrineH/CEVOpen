<p id="Par14" class="p">The tests were performed against six bacterial strains including the most frequent respiratory tract pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria were 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (DSM 20566), 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> (DSM 20533), and 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic> (116). Gram-negative strains included 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (DSM 4690), 
 <italic class="italic">H. parainfluenzae</italic> (DSM 8978), and 
 <italic class="italic">Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> (DSM 9143). 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic> was isolated from blood cultures, it was used from the culture collection of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Medical School, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary. All the other strains were obtained from the German Culture Collection (Braunschweig, Germany). Test microorganisms were maintained on 5% sheep blood agar or chocolate agar at 37 °C at the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Pécs (Pécs, Hungary). Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria was tested by disc diffusion method according to the guidelines of the Manual of Clinical Microbiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. To avoid the contamination of the test materials, EOs were filtered through a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millex-GV filter, 0.22 μm, Millipore, Ireland) before the microbiological assays. The filtration did not modify the chemical composition of the EOs.
