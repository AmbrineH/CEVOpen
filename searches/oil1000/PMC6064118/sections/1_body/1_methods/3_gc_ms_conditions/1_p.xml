<p id="Par12" class="p">The analyses were carried out with an Agilent 6890 N/5973 N GC-MSD (Santa Clara, CA, USA) system equipped with an Agilent SLB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The GC oven temperature was programmed to increase from 60 °C (3 min isothermal) to 250 °C at 8 °C/min (1 min isothermal). High purity helium was used as carrier gas at 1.0 mL/min (37 cm/s) in constant flow mode. The injector temperature was 250 °C. The split ratio was 1:50. The mass selective detector was equipped with a quadrupole mass analyser and it was operated in electron ionization mode at 70 eV in full scan mode (41–500 amu at 3.2 scan/s). The data were evaluated using MSD ChemStation D.02.00.275 software (Agilent). The identification of the compounds was carried out by comparing retention times, linear retention indexes and recorded spectra with the data of authentic standards, and the NIST 2.0 library was also consulted.</p>
