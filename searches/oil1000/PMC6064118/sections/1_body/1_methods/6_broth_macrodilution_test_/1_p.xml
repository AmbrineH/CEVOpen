After this, a serial twofold dilution was prepared from 50 to 0.0075 μL/mL. As control of the bacterial growth, neither an EO nor a detergent was added to the tubes. Test media containing 0.2% of Polysorbate 80 or DMSO were also used separately as emulsifier controls. DMSO was applied only in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>, considering that this bacterium cannot tolerate Polysorbate 80. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp., we used 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> test medium which consisted of 15 μg/mL hematin and NAD and 5% of yeast extract per mL. For the dilution series of antibiotics, a detergent was not used. 10 μL of an overnight bacterial culture (~ 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cells/mL) were added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococci</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>, the tubes were plated out on 5% sheep blood agar and incubated again for 48 h. Chocolate agar was used for 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp. The number of bacterial colonies was compared to the controls and then the values of the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined. The MBC is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent able to completely inhibit the growth of colonies. The MIC value is the concentration that could reduce the visible growth of bacteria in comparison with the controls. All tests were carried out in triplicate and under aerobic conditions.
