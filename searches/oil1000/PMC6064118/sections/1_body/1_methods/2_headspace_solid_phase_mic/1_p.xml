<p id="Par11" class="p">The chemical composition of the EOs was determined and published by our research group previously in 2016. The detailed conditions of GC-FID were described there [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Because the vapor of the EOs were used in the VPT, they were also analysed by sHS-SPME-GC-MS. sHS-SPME analysis is an effective and flexible analysis for the rapid characterization of the main components of the volatile fraction of plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the method, 0.1 mL EO was put into a vial (20 mL headspace) sealed with a silicon/PTFE septum prior to SPME-GC-MS analysis. Using the static headspace solid phase microextraction technique, sample preparation was carried out with a CTC Combi PAL (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) automatic multipurpose sampler using a 65 μM StableFlex polydimethyl siloxane/divinyl benzene (PDMS/DVB) SPME fibre (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). After an incubation period of 5 min at 40 °C, extraction was performed by exposing the fibre to the headspace of a 20 mL vial containing the EO sample for 10 min at 40 °C. The fibre was then immediately transferred to the injector port of the GC-MS and desorbed for 1 min at 250 °C. The SPME fibre was cleaned and conditioned in a Fibre Bakeout Station in pure nitrogen atmosphere at 250 °C for 15 min.
