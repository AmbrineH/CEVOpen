<p id="Par19" class="p">This method allowed us to detect the antibacterial activity of EOs in liquid media. MIC and MBC values of EOs were summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. MIC values of general antibiotics are expressed in μg/mL in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Cinnamon bark, clove, citronella, and thyme presented the most potent inhibition against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. The least sensitive strain to cinnamon and thyme was 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes (</italic>MIC: 0.41–0.43 mg/mL), while clove produced the lowest MIC value against this pathogen (MIC: 0.1 mg/mL). Among our tested materials thyme oil showed the most potent activity (MIC: 0.04 mg/mL) against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, which was followed by citronella, cinnamon bark, and clove. Citronella oil produced the lowest MIC value against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pneumoniae</italic>. Peppermint presented inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> spp. in higher concentrations with MIC values in the range of 0.35–0.70 mg/mL.
