<p id="Par20" class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp., cinnamon bark was the most effective (MIC: 0.06 mg/mL) oil, which was followed by thyme, peppermint, and clove. We observed that 
 <italic class="italic">H. influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. parainfluenzae</italic> were similarly sensitive to these EOs, besides, 
 <italic class="italic">H. parainfluenzae</italic> showed an increased sensitivity to citronella, scots pine, and eucalyptus oil. In lower amount (MIC: 0.34 mg/mL), scots pine also showed activity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>. In general, it has been observed that eucalyptus showed activity only in higher concentrations (MIC: 0.7–2.82 mg/mL). Scots pine oil was active mostly in the case of our Gram-negative strains. In comparison with antibiotics, EOs produced inhibition only in higher concentrations. We must note that the effect of detergents did not influence our results.
