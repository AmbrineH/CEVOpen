<p id="Par17" class="p">Chemical analyses of EOs were performed by GC-MS techniques. Identified compounds and percentage evaluation of the volatiles are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. In all samples, the amount of the detected components was above 93%. In accordance with the literature and our previous observations, the main volatiles of the headspace of cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, peppermint, and clove oil were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (45.9%), 1,8-cineole (91.0%), thymol (46.1%), menthol (27.2%), and eugenol (66.9%), respectively. Beside the main constituents, γ-terpinene (3.2–6.5%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (3.2–27.9%), menthone (19.8%), and β-caryophyllene (1.3–26.5%) were determined as minor components in the above mentioned EOs. In citronella oil, citronellal (42.3%), limonene (12.8%), and nerol (12.9%) were dominant. Scots pine oil contained 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene in higher amount (26.1%), but 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-pinene (18.0%) and limonene (17.0%) were also detected in lower concentrations.
