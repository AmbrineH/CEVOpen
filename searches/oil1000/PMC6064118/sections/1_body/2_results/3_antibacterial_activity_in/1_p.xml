<p id="Par21" class="p">Due to the absence of direct contact between the pathogen and EO, this method allows us to detect the antimicrobial potency of volatile components exclusively. As a result, MIC values were calculated and summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. They were determined considering the amount of EOs and the free airspace (L) in the Petri dish. As control, absolute ethanol did not show any antibacterial effect. Among the EOs, cinnamon bark was the most effective against all investigated pathogens with MIC values in the range of 15.62–90 μL/L. Above 90 μL/L, thyme oil effectively inhibited the bacterial growth of Gram-positive pathogens. Besides, thyme volatiles also showed potent inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>. In the case of peppermint and citronella oils, moderate activities were detected against Gram-negative strains (MIC: 31.25–75 μL/L), moreover, their effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> species was also observed in higher amounts. In our test system, clove oil was active only above 90 μL/L. EO of scots pine did not show any inhibition in VP, except in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">H. influenzae</italic>. Therefore, we presume that scots pine has bacteriostatic effect, and its MIC is probably higher than 1500 μL/L. In contrast, vapor of eucalyptus oil effectively inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Haemophilus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic> in higher concentrations (MIC: 125–225 μL/L). In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">M. catarrhalis</italic>, we found citronella and cinnamon bark oils equally active, which was followed by peppermint, thyme, and clove. Among our tested pathogens, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> was the least sensitive to EO volatiles, in lower concentration only cinnamon bark performed potent inhibition (MIC: 90 μL/L) against this pathogen. In conclusion, we should highlight that Gram-negative strains were more sensitive to EO vapors: we detected higher MIC values against all Gram-positive bacteria.
