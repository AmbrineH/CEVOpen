<p id="Par28" class="p">In the case of EOs, the in vitro antimicrobial assays should be optimized because of their hydrophobic character and multicomponent composition. Based on our results, we suggest that VPT provides the best detection for the activity of EOs based on gaseous contact. However, BDT is one of the most suitable direct-contact assays. On one hand, only the optimized BDT and VPT are able to provide trustworthy results about the antimicrobial effect of EOs. On the other hand, the evaluation of antibacterial activity it should be taken into consideration that EOs have different characters in liquid form or in VP which results in diverse biological activity. We conclude that cinnamon bark oil possess the strongest antibacterial activity against all the respiratory tract pathogens used in our study. On the whole, it should be highlighted that cinnamon, thyme, peppermint, and citronella also showed potent antimicrobial activity in vapor and in liquid form; in contrast, clove oil was more potent inhibitor in liquid phase. Finally, in vitro and clinical studies are also required to calculate the effective doses of EOs, determine the interactions between the components and reveal their toxicity.</p>
