<p class="p">Potato (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) is one of the most important crops for human consumption, but it needs to be cooked to become edible, mainly due to the presence of toxic glycoalkaloids (Tajner‐Czopek, Rytel, Kita, Pęksa, &amp; Hamouz, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Frying is the most common potato processing technique (Pedreschi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), imposed by operational simplicity, speed, and formation of unique sensorial attributes (Gertz, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the inherent incorporation of fat, which can vary from 15% to 45% (Kita, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), makes it less advised from the nutritional and health points of view. Some strategies to reduce fat content were studied, including the new air‐frying systems available for domestic cooking (Santos, Cunha, &amp; Casal, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Teruel et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), or microwave‐assisted vacuum frying with potential industrial applications (Parikh &amp; Takhar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Still, not all people have access or want to invest in such types of equipment. The use of pre‐fried potatoes on common domestic devices as microwave grill and conventional ovens is also gaining popularity as a reduced fat alternative, but it cannot be regarded as a real low‐fat, with lipid amounts from 7 to 11 g/100 g (Giovanelli, Torri, Sinelli, &amp; Buratti, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Additionally, using pre‐fried potatoes, consumers cannot choose the fat type.
