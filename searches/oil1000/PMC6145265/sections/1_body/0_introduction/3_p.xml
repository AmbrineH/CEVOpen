<p class="p">Deep‚Äêfrying is based on the direct contact of the food with heated oil, with efficient heat transference by convection (Pedreschi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Microwave radiation is widely used at a domestic level, enabling short processing times. However, the formation of the typical browning colors is absent, due to the inherent characteristics of the processing principles, based on the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the dielectric properties of the food (Sumnu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Consequently, the microwave industry developed combined microwave grill/crisp alternatives, capable of generation

Convective oven cooking, on the other hand, uses hot air convection, with some secondary radiation emerging from oven walls and some conduction from the baking pan. Thus, the heat and mass transfer characteristics of foods cooked on these three equipment are entirely different, influencing not only the chemical composition of the processed food but also its sensory properties and hence acceptability.
