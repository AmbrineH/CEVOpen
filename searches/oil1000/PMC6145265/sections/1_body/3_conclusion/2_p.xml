<p class="p">The results of this work demonstrated that MWG and OV have potential to be implemented at domestic level as healthier “frying” alternatives. Its use with fresh potatoes, instead of pre‐fried frozen ones, enables consumer to choose the oil of their preference while achieving true low‐fat potatoes. Indeed, the amount of fat absorbed by the MWG and OV potatoes is around 80% lower than DF, corresponding to an average decrease in 50 kcal/100 g under the present conditions. However, the advantages are not restricted to the lipid amounts, with direct ingestion of fewer amounts of degraded fat, higher preservation of potatoes ascorbic acid, and total phenolic compounds, particularly with OO, and smaller amounts of acrylamide. Despite the expected higher acceptability for DF potatoes, and the vegetable oil type influence, MWG was sensory preferred to OV, being both similar from the chemical and nutritional points of view. Optimized instructions could be included in the equipment's manuals to grant good cooking results.</p>
