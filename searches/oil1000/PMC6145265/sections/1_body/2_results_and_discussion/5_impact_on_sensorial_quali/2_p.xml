<p class="p">Independently of the oil type (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), most sensorial attributes presented higher scores for classical deep‐frying (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05): color and odor intensities (DF &gt; MWG &gt; OV), color homogeneity (DF &gt; OV &gt; MWG), odor quality (DF, MWG &gt; OV), crispness and aftertaste (DF &gt; MWG, OV), and taste quality (DF, MWG &gt; DF, OV). Adhesively and graininess were similar between processes (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). The lower crispness scores on both low‐fat approaches are directly associated with water loss and fat incorporation data, previously discussed, essential for crust formation (Melema, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Data also show that, even with frequent turnover, oven and microwave grill are unable to achieve DF color homogeneity due to the direct contact with the metal recipient surfaces. Still, when MWG and OV are compared, MWG presented better odor and color intensities, as well as taste and color qualities, but lower color homogeneity, in agreement with the instrumental color measures. Crispiness and aftertaste were also similar on both low‐fat approaches. Global acceptability corroborated the individual scores, with higher acceptability for DF (4.5), followed by MWG (3.4) and OV (2.5). The MWG scores were within the range of commercial air‐frying devices (3.5–4.3) tested under similar processing condition (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). When the different oils were compared under DF, a general preference for SFO was perceived (6.1/10 global mean score) in opposition to CO (3.2/10), but no significant differences were observed in the low‐fat processes, probably due to the low amounts of incorporated fat (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
