<p class="p">Regarding total phenolics, expressed in equivalents of gallic acid (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), raw potatoes amounts (22 mg/100 g) increased with all cooking processes. These could again derive directly from moisture loss, but the oil type had some influence: OO natural richness in phenolic compounds (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) might have induced significantly higher amounts (

 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05), for all vegetable oils. Aware that fat incorporation was reduced in the low‐fat frying processes, this increase in phenolic content, more than doubling the initial raw potatoes content, could also derive from an increased protection during processing. Moreover, these values are in the same order than those found in air‐frying systems (Santos et al.,
