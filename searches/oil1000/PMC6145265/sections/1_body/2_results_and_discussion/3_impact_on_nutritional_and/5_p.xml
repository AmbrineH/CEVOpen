<p class="p">Vitamin E is almost absent in raw potatoes (&lt;0.02 mg/100 g), but present in substantial amounts in the vegetable oils, with intrinsic differences between them (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), therefore enriching potatoes by lipid incorporation (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Within each cooking process, a higher tocopherol content was quantified in SO, followed by SFO and CO, with the lowest amounts in OO (

Between processes, DF had significantly higher amounts of tocopherols due to the higher lipid content, while the differences between the two low‐fat processes were reduced, imposed by the small amounts of incorporated fat, and similar to air‐frying systems under similar processing conditions (Santos et al.,
