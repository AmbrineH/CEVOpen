<p class="p">Moisture and oil contents are among the most important chemical components of fried potatoes, affecting its nutritional and sensory quality (Pedreschi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moisture, initially at 81%, decreased with all cooking processes, with reduced but statistically significant differences (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) between DF (59%), and both MWG and OV (62%) (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Regarding incorporated lipids, an average of 6.9% was quantified in DF, against 1.8% in MWG and 1.3% in OV (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), corresponding to 70%–85% reduction of lipids, real low‐fat approaches (&lt;3 g/100 g). These moisture/oil contents are equivalent to those achieved with commercial low‐fat air‐frying systems when using fresh potatoes (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) but lower than when using pre‐fried potatoes, with significant amounts of fat already incorporated before processing (Giovanelli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). No statistical differences were observed between the different oils tested.
