<p class="p">Potatoes are an excellent source of ascorbic acid (Love &amp; Pavek, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the thermal and oxidative stress imposed during cooking inevitably induces losses on this vitamin. From an initial amount of 6.8 mg/100 g in raw potatoes, the values decreased significantly, ranging from 0.9 to 3.2 mg/100 g (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Regarding the frying processes, DF induced an average loss of 85%, significantly higher on all occasions (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) than the other two processes, but no significant differences were perceived between the two low‐fat frying processes, with losses ranging from 53% to 78%. Aware that processing occurs faster with DF (6 min) than with the other two alternatives (15 min MWG and 30 min OV), processing time cannot be the primary determinant for ascorbic acid loss, nor moisture, equivalent on all processes. Thermal transfer efficiency, higher in DF, can have contributed to this effect, as well as some potential leaching accompanying water loss in DF. Regarding the different oils, no differences were perceived in the vitamin contents, except an apparent reduced loss with OO in OV, indicative that the potential contribution of the oil components to an oxidant/antioxidant effect is reduced. The ascorbic acid values in this study are lower than those found in fried potatoes (Fillion &amp; Henry, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>), probably derived from the variety used and the small dimensions of the cubes, necessary to increase homogeneity between processes. Nevertheless, these values are higher than those found in air‐frying systems under similar processing conditions (Santos et al.,
