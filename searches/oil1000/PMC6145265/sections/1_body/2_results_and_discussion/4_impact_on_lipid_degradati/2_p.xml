<p class="p">During the thermal and oxidative stress induced by cooking, the lipids are gradually deteriorated. Several degradation indicators were used to understand the impact of each cooking procedures on the lipids quality, enabling to compare the potential ingestion of degraded lipids through cooked potatoes. Therefore, the lipids extracted from the processed potatoes were evaluated in terms of classical degradation indexes. It included the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐anisidine value, which gives an estimation of aldehydes formed as secondary oxidation products potentially impacting on odor quality and intensity, together with triglycerides hydrolysis, oxidation, and polymerization (Table
