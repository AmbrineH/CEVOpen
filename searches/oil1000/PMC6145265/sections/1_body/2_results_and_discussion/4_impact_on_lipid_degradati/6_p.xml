<p class="p">Acrylamide was included in this section because it corresponds to a compound formed during heating, with potentially deleterious effects on consumer's health. Acrylamide is a recognized processing contaminant in fried potatoes, being formed above 120°C and under low‐moisture conditions (Molina‐García et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Mean values from 130 (OV) to 550 μg/kg (DF) were detected in the cooked samples, with a clear distinction between processes. Deep‐fried potatoes presented the highest amounts (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) (718‐SFO, 606‐SO, 510‐OO, 369‐CO, in μg/kg), followed by MWG (298‐CO, 280‐SFO, 248‐OO, 186‐SO, in μg/kg) and OV [207‐SO, 144‐CO, 95‐SFO, 75‐OO, in μg/kg). The higher amounts in MWG compared to OV can probably be explained by the direct contact with the crisp plate in the former, with probable increased

 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). This is also consistent with the increased red tones (a*) in the instrumental color reading (

The average scores for each color coordinate were in agreement with the recommended tones for fried potatoes: between −5 and 0 for a* and &gt; 10 for b* (Krokida, Oreopoulou, Maroulis, &amp; Marinos‐Kouris, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) and similar to those reported for air‐frying systems (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Teruel et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). When oils are compared, a clear pattern was not perceived, with SFO presenting simultaneously the highest average amounts in DF and MWG, with 718 μg/kg and 280 μg/kg, respectively, and being within the lowest range in OV, with 95 μg/kg. In opposition, CO presented the lower acrylamide content in DF (369 μg/kg) but was within the highest range in MWG (298 μg/kg). This high variability between oils shows that the potential effects imposed by the processing technique superimpose those potentially derived from the oils composition.
