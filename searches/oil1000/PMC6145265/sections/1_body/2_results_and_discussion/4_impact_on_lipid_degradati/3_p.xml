<p class="p">Regarding oxidation, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐AV values were consistently higher in DF, without differences between the two low‐fat processes. When the oils are compared within each process, OO had significantly lower 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐AV values, being, therefore, less oxidized, which could be a consequence of its higher phenolic content although its lower polyunsaturated degree also contributes for its stability. In the low‐fat processes, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐AV value was generally low, reducing the ability to distinguish the different oils, but SFO had higher amounts of secondary aldehydes.
