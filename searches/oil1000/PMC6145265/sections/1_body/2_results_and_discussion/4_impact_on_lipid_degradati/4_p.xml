<p class="p">The TPC are a consensual index for oil degradation, corresponding to the sum of OTG with polymeric forms (DPTG), diglycerides (DG) and free fatty acids (FFA), with 22%–25% as the limit for rejection in several European countries (Gertz, 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). For the polymeric forms, DF potatoes had significantly higher amounts (5.9%–7.8%), being only residual in the two low‐fat approaches (3.1–3.9), without differences between them (Table
