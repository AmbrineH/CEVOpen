<p class="p">Fatty acids isomerization is also an indicator of thermal and oxidative degradation although occurring at relatively low rates and amounts (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Indeed, TFA were low with all extracted lipids, slightly higher in CO, and similar to those of the fresh oils (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3683-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). As to the processes, higher TFA were quantified in the DF, but always below 0.05%, corresponding to low amounts from a health point of view.
