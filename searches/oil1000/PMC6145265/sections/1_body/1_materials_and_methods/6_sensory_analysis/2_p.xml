<p class="p">A quantitative descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize and differentiate the sensorial attributes of the fried potatoes in the different oils and for each frying process/day, in a total of 24 samples, using a 10‐cm unstructured linear scale. Ten assessors (8 females and 2 males with age range of 23–55) of the Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Porto were trained for identification of sensory vocabulary and to become familiarized with the scale. Potatoes sensory evaluation was based in nine attributes, describing appearance (color intensity and homogeneity), odor (quality and intensity), taste (quality and aftertaste), and texture (adhesiveness, graininess, and crispiness), in the different oils and for each frying process/day, in a total of 24 samples. The panel was also asked to score global acceptability. In three training pre‐sessions, deep‐fried, microwave and oven‐fried samples were included. The final sensory analyses were performed after 3 min of removing samples from each cooking device. Two evaluation sessions were performed per day, at mid‐morning (around 10:30 hr) and mid‐afternoon (around 16:30 hr). Four samples, marked with three random digits, were presented to the assessors each time, and analyses took place according to Santos et al. (
