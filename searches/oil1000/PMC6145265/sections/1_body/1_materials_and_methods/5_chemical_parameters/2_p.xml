<p class="p">The moisture content of cooked potatoes was determined by infrared drying at 105°C (Scaltec SMO 01, Germany). Potatoes lipids were extracted with a ternary mixture of isopropanol, cyclohexane, and water, at room temperature, in the presence of BHT and ascorbic acid, and dried over a nitrogen stream (Santos et al.,
