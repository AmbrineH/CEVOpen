<p class="p">Microwave grill (MWG; Whirlpool, GT285/WH model, USA, nominal power of 1,900 W) and convective oven—OV (Teka, HI‐435 model, Germany, nominal power of 2,565 W) were both carried out using similar potato:oil ratios, using 2.4 g of oil for 200 g of fresh potatoes. The oil was spread homogeneously in the potatoes cubes before processing. The potatoes were cooked in the microwave during 15 min (5 min in microwave function, output power at 700 W; and 10 min in the grill function with the crisp plate, output power at 900 W), manually shaken at 10 and 12.5 min. In the oven, potatoes were cooked for 30 min at 190°C, manually shaken at 15 and 22.5 min potatoes, using a sheet of greaseproof paper commercially available for the purpose.</p>
