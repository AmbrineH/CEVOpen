 <p class="p">Two low‐fat “frying” alternatives to deep‐frying were tested using two domestic equipment (microwave grill and convective oven), with fresh potatoes and four different frying oils (sunflower, soybean, canola, and olive oil). Potatoes composition was compared concerning nutrients, bioactivity, and fat oxidation. Fat reduction achieved 80% on both methods, directly associated with a decrease in oil natural bioactive components (vitamin E, fatty acids) and degraded lipids (oxidized triglycerides, polymers, aldehydes, etc.). Both microwave grill and oven cooking preserved potatoes and oil health attributes better than deep‐frying, particularly ascorbic acid, tocopherols, and total phenolics. Additionally, a significantly lower formation of acrylamide (−55% microwave grill and −76% oven) and oxidized lipids (oxidized triglycerides and unsaturated aldehydes) was observed, with microwave receiving higher sensory scores than the convective oven. This work sustains the possibility of using domestic equipment (microwave grill and oven) as healthier “frying” alternatives to deep‐frying.</p>
