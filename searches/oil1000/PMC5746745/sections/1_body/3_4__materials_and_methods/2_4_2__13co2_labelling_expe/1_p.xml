<p class="p">Labelling experiments were performed with controls and transgenic HMGR5 plants. For 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> feeding, three or four potted plants were simultaneously placed in a closed gas incubation chamber (Biobox; GWS, Berlin, Germany) at 25 Â°C and illuminated with white light (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-07-00065-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>). Prior to the labelling period (pulse phase), the chamber was flushed with synthetic air containing oxygen and nitrogen until CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was fully removed. The plants were then fed with synthetic air containing 700 ppm of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. During this pulse period, the concentration of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was typically detected at a ratio of 9:1. Subsequently, the plants were transferred to the laboratory.
