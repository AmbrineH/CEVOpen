<p class="p">For 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR analyses, the plant material (600–1000 mg) was split into 3 different 10 mL glass tubes. Then, 2 mL of chloroform-d was added to the first tube, shacked gently and left at room temperature for 15 min. The chloroform was then transferred into the second tube and the whole process repeated. This procedure was also performed for the third tube. After drying with magnesium sulphate, finally 600 μL of the chloroform extract were placed in a NMR tube for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C analyses.
