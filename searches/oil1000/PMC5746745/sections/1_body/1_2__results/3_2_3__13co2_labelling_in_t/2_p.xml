The percentages of the five main components of the leaf essential oil (the monoterpenes cineole, camphor, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene) were considered in relation to the 15 main peaks of each sample and are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="metabolites-07-00065-t005" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. These five molecules accounted for almost 88% of the 15 peaks in the HMGR5 plants and 78% for the WT plants, revealing that apparently the HMGR5 plants had a higher proportion of monoterpenes in their essential oil. Coumarine was also detected in most samples (

The main compounds in all samples were camphor and 1,8-cineole that accounted for a total of 79% in the case of HMGR5 plants and less than 67% in the case of WT plants. These results are in accordance with those previously described by our group, with HMGR overexpressing plants that accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as compared to controls. Enhanced expression of HMGR1S also increased the amount of the end-product sterols, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, but did not affect the accumulation of carotenoids or chlorophylls [
