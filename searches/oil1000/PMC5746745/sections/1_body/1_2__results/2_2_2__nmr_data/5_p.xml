<p class="p">All camphor coupling constants are in concordance with the addition of a labelled IPP derived from G3P into the molecule through the MEP terpene synthesis pathway and not through IPP produced by the MVA pathway. The analysis of cineole provides enough evidence to also support the hypothesis that the MEP pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of 1,8-cineole due to the C9â€“C3 long-range coupling detected; this triple is only expected for a moiety where G3P serves as a precursor.</p>
