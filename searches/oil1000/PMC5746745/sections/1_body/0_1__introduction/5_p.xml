<p class="p">Spike lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula latifolia</italic> Medicus) is an aromatic shrub of high economic importance due to its essential oil, composed mainly of monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B22-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The main constituents in spike lavender oil from flowers are the monoterpenes linalool, cineole and camphor, while the main constituents in the oil from leaves are cineole and camphor [
 <xref rid="B23-metabolites-07-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. All monoterpenes are derived from geranyl diphosphate molecule (GPP). In the case of camphor, GPP is transformed via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate into bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by a hydrolysis reaction that produces borneol, which finally is oxidized to camphor. In the case of cineole, the GPP intermediate is first converted into α-terpineol by the α-terpineol synthase and this monoterpene is converted into cineole by the cineole synthase [
