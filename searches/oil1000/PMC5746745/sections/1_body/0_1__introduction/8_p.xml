<p class="p">The incorporation of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C- or 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C-labelled tracer compounds into the current metabolism is one of the most powerful tools to determine the metabolites biosynthetic pathways. To study primary and secondary metabolism in plants, general precursors (e.g., glucose) or more specific intermediates can be used as tracers and supplied to plant tissues maintained either in vitro (e.g., plant cell cultures, stem or leave cultures, seedlings) [
