<p class="p">Metabolic engineering studies in spike lavender demonstrated that MEP and MVA pathways may be implicated in the monoterpene biosynthesis. Nevertheless, essential oil yield was always higher in those transgenic spike lavender plants overexpressing the DXS gene. Previous work using specific inhibitors of both pathways and feeding experiments with [U-

Still, outcomes with HMGR overexpressing spike lavender plants cast doubt about the fact that the MVA pathway might be involved, even in a small share, on the production of monoterpenes because of the higher content of essential oil in those plants. It is well known that the MVA and MEP pathways are not totally independent as there is some crosstalk between them through common intermediates [
