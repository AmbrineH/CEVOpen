 <p class="p">This study is focused on the comparison and classification of parsley, lovage, basil, and thyme essential oils (EOs) based on their chemical composition, total phenolic content, antioxidant and antibacterial activities by using appropriate chemometric methods: Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The results showed that parsley, lovage, and thyme EOs are rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons, but basil EO is rich in oxygenated monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids, and that both PCA and HCA separated essential oils into two main groups of which one contains two sub-groups. Î²-Phellandrene was the major component identified in parsley and lovage EOs, estragole was the major component in basil EO, and 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene was the major component in thyme EO. Thyme EO showed the highest level of total phenolics, the highest antioxidant capacity, and exhibited the stronger antibacterial activity, results that were emphasized by both chemometric methods used. Among tested essential oils, the one of parsley was distinguished by a low total TPC, weak antioxidant activity, and weak antibacterial activity against 
  <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> (ATCC 13076); lovage EO by low TPC, weak antioxidant activity, but moderate antibacterial activity; and basil EO by low TPC, moderate antioxidant activity, and weak antibacterial activity against 
  <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19114).
