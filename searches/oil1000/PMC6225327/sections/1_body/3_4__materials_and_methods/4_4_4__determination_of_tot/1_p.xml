Then, 6 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 2 N Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent were added and immediately vortexed (Vortex V-1 Plus, Biosan Ltd., Riga, Latvia). After 4 min, 1.5 mL of 0.71 M sodium carbonate aqueous solution and 1.9 mL distilled water were added to the mixture. The incubation of the test sample was carried out in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. The absorbance value was read at 725 nm against blank sample using a double beam UV-VIS spectrophotometer (PharmaSpec UV-1700, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The blank sample was prepared with methanol and treated identically to the test sample. Three readings per sample were taken. The result was expressed in mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) 100 µL
