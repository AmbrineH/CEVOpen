 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Sterile nutrient broth (100 µL) and diluted essential oil (100 µL) were added into the first well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Serial 11-fold dilutions were obtained by pipetting 100 µL from well to well (on row), while 100 µL were discarded from the last well of the row. Next, a volume of 10 µL inoculum (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was added to each well. Concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 47.62 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were thus reached. For the negative control, eight parts 50% ethanol and one part Tween 80 were mixed with one part of the saline solution, while gentamicin (0.4 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in saline solution) was considered the positive control. Microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 21 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and at 37 °C for 45 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. A volume of 20 μL resazurin aqueous solution (0.2 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was added to each well. Microplates were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and at 37 °C for 23 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. The lowest concentration that retained the blue color was considered the concentration that completely inhibited bacterial growth (MIC). Three replicates were run for each essential oil. The result was expressed in µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively µg gentamicin (GE) mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
