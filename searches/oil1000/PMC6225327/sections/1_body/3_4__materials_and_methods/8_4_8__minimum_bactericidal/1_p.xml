A colony counter (Colony Star 8500, Funke Gerber, Berlin, Germany) was used to determine the relative number of bacterial colonies. The lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent causing negative growth (fewer than three colonies) was considered to be the concentration that completely killed bacteria [
