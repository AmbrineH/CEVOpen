<p class="p">The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay was used to measure the antioxidant activity of essential oils; it was performed according to the method described by Thaipong et al., 2006 [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The stock solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of 7.4 mM ABTS aqueous solution and 2.6 mM potassium persulfate aqueous solution and allowing them to react for 12 h at room temperature in the dark. The working solution was prepared by mixing 1 mL of stock solution with 60 mL of methanol to obtain an absorbance of 1.1 ± 0.02 units at 734 nm. One hundred and fifty microliters of test sample (dilution of essential oil with methanol—parsley EO:MeOH, 1:100 (

The incubation of the test sample was carried out in the dark, at room temperature for 2 h. The absorbance value was read at 734 nm against methanol using a double beam UV-VIS spectrophotometer (PharmaSpec UV-1700, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The blank sample was prepared with methanol and treated identically to the test sample. Three readings per sample were taken. The absorbance value of the test sample is extracted from the absorbance value of the blank sample; the final result was expressed in µM Trolox equivalent (TE) mL
