<p class="p">Qualitative ITEX/GC-MS analysis of the volatile compounds was performed using an analytical technique based on in-tube extraction (ITEX), as previously reported by our group [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Sample of 1 µL volume was measured into a sealed-cap headspace vial (20 mL) and maintained on continuous agitation at 50 °C for 10 min. The adsorption (5 strokes) of volatile compounds from the gaseous phase of the essential oil was performed by a Combi PAL AOC-5000 autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) with a headspace syringe ITEX-II equipped with a microtrap (ITEX-2TrapTXTA, Tenax TA 80/100 mesh, Switzerland). The analytes were released by thermal desorption into the injection port of the GC-MSQP2010 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan); the microtrap was then flash-heated with N
