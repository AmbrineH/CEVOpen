<p class="p">A Zebron ZB-5 ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for the chromatographic separation of volatile compounds. The column oven temperature program was set as follows: From 40 °C (kept at this temperature for 2 min) to 160 °C at 4 °C/min, then raised to 240 °C at 15 °C/min (kept at this temperature for 5 min). The ion source, injector, and interface temperatures were set at 250 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas, the constant flow rate being 1 mL/min. The split ratios were 1:200 for parsley EO, 1:250 for lovage and basil EOs, and 1:300 for thyme EO. The MS mode used was Electron Impact (EI) ionization, while a mass range from 40 to 650
