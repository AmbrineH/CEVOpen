<p class="p">The following microorganisms were tested: 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</italic> (ATCC 13076, Microbiologics Inc., St. Cloud, MN, USA) and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19114, Microbiologics Inc., St. Cloud, MN, USA). Each strain was grown into a test tube containing 10 mL sterile nutrient broth (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 37 °C for 24 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and at 37 °C for 48 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. The purity of the inoculum was confirmed by plating on appropriate selective media and microscopic examination of the Gram-stained smear (Optika microscope, B-252, M.A.D. Apparecchiature Scientifiche, Milan, Italy). A loopful of inoculum was transferred by streaking onto a selective medium: XLD agar (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) for 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and Palcam agar base (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) with added Palcam selective supplement for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and at 37 °C for 48 h in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. Bacterial morphology was confirmed by optical microscopy. Several colonies were collected with a sterile inoculating loop, transferred into sterile saline solution (8.5 g L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and adjusted to match the turbidity of a McFarland 0.5 standard (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Then, three 
 <italic class="italic">serial</italic> 10-fold 
 <italic class="italic">dilutions</italic> (10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>, 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>, and 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were prepared using the sterile saline solution as diluent.
