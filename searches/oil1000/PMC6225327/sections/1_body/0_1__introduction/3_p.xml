 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] has shown that essential oils extracted from dried leaves of parsley, lovage, basil, and thyme possess antimicrobial properties. For a better understanding of their active compounds and mechanisms of action, a further in-depth study is required. Consequently, the present work aimed to determine any relationship between the chemical constituents, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of parsley, lovage, basil, and thyme essential oils (EOs) extracted from dried leaves, in order to highlight the best potential of each one for future applications in the food industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of these essential oils regarding their biological activities by using chemometric methods.
