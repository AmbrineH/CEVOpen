 <xref rid="molecules-23-02261-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration tests. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.976; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) between values obtained using the two tests since the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were similar, except those of parsley EO against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. The lower the MIC/MBC value, the higher the antibacterial activity of an essential oil. Of the four essential oils tested, basil EO has proved to be more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and the others conversely. The results show that thyme EO was the most bacteriostatic/bactericidal against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic>, followed equally by lovage and basil EOs, and then by parsley EO. Thyme EO was also the most bacteriostatic/bactericidal against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, followed instead by essential oils of lovage, parsley, and basil. The essential oil of parsley showed similar MIC and MBC values against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> (22.68 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>); a MIC value of 5.14 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and MBC value of 10.80 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>. Essential oils of lovage, basil, and thyme revealed similar bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> (10.80 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 10.80 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.56 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively) and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (2.45 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 22.68 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.13 µL EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively). Jamali et al., 2013 [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] have reported levels of 270 µg EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for MIC and 540 µg EO mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for MBC in essential oil extracted from dried leaves of thyme tested against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>; an antibacterial activity much lower than the one found in the current study.
