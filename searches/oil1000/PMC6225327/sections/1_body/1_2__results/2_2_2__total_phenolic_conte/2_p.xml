 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], but they are not fully responsible for the antioxidant activity of essential oils. In a recent study, Ferreira et al., 2017 [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] have reported an enhanced antioxidant activity of essential oils rich in oxygenated monoterpenes. In the current study, the level of total phenolics in basil EO was proximate to that found in parsley and lovage EOs; however, its antioxidant activity was approximately 3 times higher. Since oxygenated monoterpenes (46.4%) prevailed in basil EO, we first suspected that this class of compounds is the major contributor to its antioxidant activity. However, no significant correlation between TEAC and oxygenated monoterpenes-C3 was found. In contrast, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.999; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between TEAC and phenylpropanoids-C4. These findings show that phenylpropanoids (41.2%) are in fact mainly responsible for the antioxidant activity of basil EO.
