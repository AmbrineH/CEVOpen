<p class="p">A number of studies have focused on the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from dried leaves of thyme. Contrary to our study, Jamali et al., 2013 [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] have found oxygenated monoterpenes as the main constituents in Moroccan essential oil, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes; the major components identified were carvacrol, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and α-pinene. Borugă et al., 2014 [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] have identified thymol, γ-terpinene, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene as the major components of essential oil from thyme cultivated in Romania. In another study, Calín-Sánchez et al., 2013 [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] have identified thymol, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, caryophyllene, and α-terpinene as the major constituents of Polish essential oil. Agili, 2014 [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] has reported thymol, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and carvacrol as the major constituents of essential oil extracted from thyme collected from Saudi Arabian markets. The main constituents found by Soto-Mendívil et al., 2006 [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] in essential oil extracted from thyme collected from Mexican markets were borneol, thymol, carvacrol methyl ether, camphene, α-humulene, and carvacrol.
