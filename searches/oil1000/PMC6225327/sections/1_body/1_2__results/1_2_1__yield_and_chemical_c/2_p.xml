<p class="p">Parsley essential oil: Twenty-three compounds, representing 99.8% of the total detected constituents, were identified in the essential oil of parsley and grouped on the basis of their chemical structure into six classes (monoterpene hydrocarbons-C1, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons-C2, oxygenated monoterpenes-C3, phenylpropanoids-C4, other compounds-C5, and unidentified compounds-C6). The most abundant constituents were monoterpene hydrocarbons (97.2%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenes (0.9%), phenylpropanoids (0.8%), others (0.5%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (0.4%), and unidentified compounds (0.2%). The major components identified in parsley EO were β-phellandrene (32.4%), 1,3,8-
