<p class="p">Lovage essential oil: Eighteen compounds were identified in the essential oil of lovage representing 100% of the total detected constituents. The most abundant constituents were monoterpene hydrocarbons (83.6%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenes (15.6%), others (0.5%), and phenylpropanoids (0.3%). The major components identified in lovage EO were β-phellandrene (53.9%), β-terpinyl acetate (12.7%), β-myrcene (11.4%), and trans-β-ocimene (7.0%); the β-terpinyl acetate belongs to the oxygenated monoterpenes class and the rest of them to monoterpene hydrocarbons. The study of Bylaiteù et al., 1998 [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] has evidenced α-terpinyl acetate as the major compound of essential oil extracted from dried leaves of Lithuanian lovage, followed by β-phellandrene, and Z-ligustilide.
