<p class="p">Basil essential oil: Twenty-four compounds were identified in the essential oil of basil representing 99.9% of the total detected constituents. The most abundant constituents were oxygenated monoterpenes (46.4%), followed by phenylpropanoids (41.2%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (10.7%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.6%), and unidentified compounds (0.1%). The major components identified in basil EO were estragole (40.9%), 1,8-cineole (24.3%), and linalool acetate (19.8%), first of them belonging to phenylpropanoids and the others to oxygenated monoterpenes. In a study on essential oil extracted from dried leaves of Polish basil, Calín-Sánchez et al., 2012 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02261" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] have found phenylpropanoids as the majority class, followed by monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, aldehydes, and alcohols with methyleugenol, eugenol, 1,8-cineole, and linalool being the major components.
