<p class="p">Monoterpenes hydrocarbons were the most abundant chemical compounds in parsley, lovage, and thyme EOs, while in basil, oxygenated monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids prevailed. Regarding the antibacterial activity, all tested essential oils showed inhibitory and bactericidal effects on both bacteria; most of them were more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19114) but basil EO was more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> (ATCC 13076). The highest amount of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity were found in thyme EO; this essential oil also exhibited the stronger antibacterial activity. Parsley EO instead had a low total phenolic content (TPC), weak antioxidant activity, and weak antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> (ATCC 13076); lovage EO by low TPC, weak antioxidant activity, and moderate antibacterial activity; basil EO by low TPC, moderate antioxidant activity, and weak antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19114)
