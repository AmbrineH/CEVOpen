 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02261-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c,d) revealed interesting and somehow surprising results with lovage and thyme EOs forming 1st sub-group (A1) and parsley EO the 2nd one (A2) of the same cluster (group A). Basil EO formed another cluster (group B). The PCA biplot of essential oils based on their chemical compound classes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02261-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c) showed a great chemical resemblance between lovage and thyme EOs (down-right plot), characterized by similar ratios of monoterpene hydrocarbons-C1 and oxygenated monoterpenes-C3 (83.6% C1 and 15.6% C3, respectively 83.5% C1 and 9.7% C3). PC1 horizontal axis explained 99% while PC2 vertical axis explained 1% of the total variance. On the same side of the axes (upper-right plot), parsley EO revealed higher ratio C1:C3 than thyme and lovage EOs such as 97.2% C1 and 0.9% C3. On the other side of the axes (upper-left plot), basil EO showed a much lower level of monoterpene hydrocarbons-C1 (10.7%) and higher levels of oxygenated monoterpenes-C3 (46.4%) and phenylpropanoids-C4 (41.2%) than parsley, lovage, and thyme EOs.
