<p class="p">Chemical PCA and HCA analysis of all compounds. The chemical constituents of parsley, lovage, basil and thyme EOs were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to better visualize and identify their grouping trends. The PCA biplot (

 <bold class="bold">10</bold>). The first principal component (PC1) explained 53% of the total variance while the second one (PC2) showed a further 41%. Basil and thyme EOs instead were positioned very distinctly based on their characteristics constituents: Estragole (No. 
 <bold class="bold">33</bold>), 1,8-cineole (No.
