Lovage EO was plotted close to them but in the bottom-left quarter of the chart as it exhibited moderate antibacterial activity; it formed the 2nd sub-group (A2) of the same cluster (group A). PC1 horizontal axis explained 71% of the total variance while the vertical axis explained a further 28%. Other two distinct clusters were formed by parsley (group B) and basil EOs (group C), each one showing different antibacterial properties, parsley EO (bottom-right plot in
