 <p> PCA and HCA performed on essential oil volatile compounds and their chemical classes. ( a) The PCA biplot of essential oils based on their individual volatile compounds; ( b) HCA dendrogram of essential oils based on their individual volatile compounds; ( c) The PCA biplot of essential oils based on their chemical compound classes; ( d) HCA dendrogram of essential oils based on their chemical compound classes. The numbers of chemical compounds are presented in Table 1; C1—monoterpene hydrocarbons; C2—sesquiterpene hydrocarbons; C3—oxygenated monoterpenes; C4—phenylpropanoids; C5—other compounds, and C6—unidentified compounds. </p>
