<p class="p">The total count of bacteria (TCB), LAB, and yeast and mold (YM) counts of the raw and fermented samples was determined as described by Harrigan and MacCance (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1976</xref>) with slight modification. Briefly, 1 g sample was mixed with 9 ml of sterile peptone water (0.1%). A volume of 1 ml of the homogenate was diluted with 9.0 ml of 0.1% peptone water to prepare serial 10‐fold dilutions. TCB was determined by plating (pour plate method) appropriate serial dilutions in duplicate with plate count agar and incubating at 37°C for 48 h. LAB were enumerated by plating appropriate serial dilutions anaerobically with MRS agar and incubating at 37°C for 4 days. YM counts were done by plating appropriate serial dilutions with malt extract agar and incubating for 48 h at 28°C.
