 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>) was employed in the traditional fermentation (lactic acid fermentation) of the sorghum flour of both genotypes (low and high tannin) as practiced in most Sudanese households. Initially, the sorghum flour was naturally fermented by the original microorganisms present in the grain. This involved addition of flour to water at a ratio of 2:1 (flour: water, 40 g flour:80 ml water), and the dough was kept in the incubator at 37°C for 24 h. The sorghum starter obtained was kept in the refrigerator until used for fermentation of the flour samples. Sorghum flour (180 g) was mixed with 360 ml of water, and then, 60 ml starter obtained from previously fermented dough was added to 540 ml of the flour paste and mixed thoroughly. This was followed by addition of FBFPF starter at different levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of FBFPF/60 ml of sorghum starter) to 540 ml dough, and the volume of the sorghum starter was decreased accordingly. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h in 1‐L sterile conical flask. This was followed by freeze‐drying of the fermented samples (FBFPF, naturally fermented sorghums, and sorghum flours fermented with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% FBFPF) for rheological analysis or drying in a hot air oven (Heraeus UT 5042, Germany) at 65°C for 16 h. The samples were then milled to pass through a 0.4‐mm mesh screen and stored at 4°C in tightly closed containers until analyzed. The control samples were Tabat and Wad‐Ahmed sorghum flours (TSF and WSF) fermented with only sorghum starter (60 ml) without addition of FBFPF starter and unfermented (or raw) TSF and WSF.
