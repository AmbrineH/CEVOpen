<p class="p">Mineral contents were determined according to Pearson (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>) with slight modification. Exactly 2 g of sample was heated at 550°C for 3 h and then cooled. The ash obtained was treated with 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (50% HCl; LabChem, USA) with the addition of 5 ml of nitric acid (33%) and then placed in a water bath (100°C) for 1 h. Ten milliliters of HCl was added, and the sample was returned to the water bath for 15 min. The mixture was then transferred to a 100‐ml volumetric flask containing distilled water with a final volume of 100 ml and well shaken. After sample preparation, mineral concentration was determined. Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) were determined by flame photometer (Jenway PFP 7, Essex, UK) as described by Overman and Davis (

 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Briefly, 5 ml of the mineral extract prepared above was mixed with 10 ml of ammonium molybdate–vanadate reagent and the mixture was kept for 30 min at room temperature. After that, the developed color was recorded by ultraviolet–visible (UV‐Vis) spectrophotometry (Jenway 6305, Essex, UK) at a wavelength of 440 nm and the P concentration was determined from the standard curve generated using different concentrations of P.
