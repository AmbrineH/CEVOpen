<p class="p">The method of Okezie and Bello (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) was employed to determine bulk density (BD). Briefly, 10 g sample was placed in a 25‐ml graduated cylinder and packed by gently tapping the cylinder on bench top (10 times) from a reasonable height (5–8 cm). The final volume was recorded, and the BD was expressed as g sample per ml volume occupied. Water absorption capacity (WAC) and fat absorption capacity (FAC) were determined following the method described by Lin, Humbert, and Sosulski (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>) with slight modification. Briefly, 3 g of the sample was added to 30 ml of water for WAC determination while 4 g sample was added to 20 ml of refined corn oil (specific gravity 1.52) for FAC determination in 50‐ml centrifuge tube. The mixture was stirred for 5 min, and the contents were allowed to equilibrate for 25 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4,400
