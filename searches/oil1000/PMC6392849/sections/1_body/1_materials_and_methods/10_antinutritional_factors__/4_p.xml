In this assay, 2% of the sample slurry was heated in a water bath at 100°C for 15 min, followed by the addition of 30 ml of 0.2 M glycine‐HCl buffer (pH, 2.0) containing 10 mg pepsin to 50 ml of the slurry. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h followed by the adjustment of the pH to 7 with 0.2 N NaOH. The final volume was adjusted to 100 ml with distilled water. Five milliliters of 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 15 mg of pancreatin (Carolina) and 15 mg amyloglucosidase (specific gravity: &gt;1, Carolina) was added to 10 ml of the mixture, which was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After that, the reaction was terminated by heating the mixture in a water bath at 100°C. Then, 2 ml of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was added to 0.5 ml of the mixture to determine the amount of reducing sugar (Miller,
