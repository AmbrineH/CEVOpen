<p class="p">The determination of phytic acid of the samples was carried out as described by Wheeler and Ferrel (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1971</xref>). Briefly, 2 g sample was extracted with 50 ml of 3% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 3 h with mechanical shaking. The mixture was centrifuged, and 10 ml aliquot of supernatant was added to 4 ml of FeCl

A standard catechin solution was prepared and used as reference standard. The absorbance of sample and standard solutions was read using spectrophotometer (Jenway V6300) at 500 nm after 20 min incubation at 30°C. Tannin concentration was expressed as catechin equivalent percentage.
