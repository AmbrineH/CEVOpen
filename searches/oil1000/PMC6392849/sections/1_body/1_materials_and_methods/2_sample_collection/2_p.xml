<p class="p">Two sorghum (
 <italic class="italic">Sorghum biocolor</italic>) genotypes, locally known as Wad‐ Ahmed (high tannin) and Tabat (low tannin), were collected from the Sinnar Research Station, Agricultural Research Corporation, Sinnar, Sudan. Baobab fruit was obtained from a local market in Khartoum, Sudan. The grains and fruits were carefully cleaned to remove all foreign materials. The grains were then decorticated with an extraction rate of 90%. Seeds of dried baobab fruit were detached from its pulp by using a special high rate mechanical extracting machine. Baobab fruit pulp flour was prepared by grinding the dried pulp to pass through a 0.4‐mm mesh screen and kept at 4°C until used. All reagents and media were of standard analytical grade.
