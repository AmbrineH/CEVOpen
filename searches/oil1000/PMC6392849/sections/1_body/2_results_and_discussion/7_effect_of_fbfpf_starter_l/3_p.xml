Raw WSF displayed higher BG and GT than raw TSF. Pasting temperature for raw TSF (74.6°C) and WSF (76.8°C) was reduced to 75.1°C and 75.8°C, respectively, after fermentation. The maximum pasting temperature was evident in fermented samples prepared without the addition of FBFPF starter, while the lowest pasting temperature was evident in FTSF and FWSF treated with 50% and 100% FBFPF starter. The maximum GTs for raw TSF and WSF were 86.9°C and 88.9°C, respectively. Fermentation decreased the GT of raw WSF and increased that of raw TSF without FBFPF starter (both

Unlike BG and GT, the GMV of TSF was higher than that of WSF. A sharp decline in GMV was noted after fermentation of raw TSF. Similar to GT, the GMV value varied after treatment with FBFPF starter at different levels, with the lowest values were obtained in fermented samples containing 100% FBFPF starter.
