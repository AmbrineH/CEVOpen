 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a–c summarizes the effect of FBFPF addition at different levels on the functional properties of raw and fermented TSF and WSF. Fermentation significantly decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) the WAC and BD of raw TSF (3.7 ml/g and 0.522–3.67 ml/g and 0.517, respectively) and WSF (3.79 ml/g and 0.5–3.76 ml/g and 0.496, respectively). The difference in WAC between the two sorghum genotypes may reflect differences in the nature of hydrophilic constituents. Decreased WAC and BD of fermented samples were reported for fermented sorghum flour by Alka et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). A further significant decrease (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) in WAC was observed following the addition of FBFPF at different levels. This decline was reduced with an increase in FBFPF levels. However, the BD of FTSF and FWSF increased (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) as the level of FBFPF increases. The FAC values of raw and fermented WSF were lower than that of TSF. Also, raw TSF and WSF displayed FAC values lower than their fermented samples without FBFPF addition. This result agrees with that of fermented

 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). FAC is necessary as it improves mouthfeel due to the retention of flavor by oil and also bestows a soft texture to food (Ubbor &amp; Akobundu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Incorporation of FBFPF reduced the FAC of the fermented samples with lowest value obtained after the addition of 100% FBFPF. This was probably due to the low‐FAC of FBFPF.
