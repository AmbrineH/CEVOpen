<p class="p">Fermentation raised the TA of raw TSF from 0.293 to 0.788 mg/100 g and of WSF from 0.27 to 0.73 mg/100 g (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). These values were higher than that of sorghum flour (0.22 mg/100 g) reported by AbdelRahman et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Further increase in TA was observed in fermented samples treated with FBFPF starter, with the increase becoming significant (
