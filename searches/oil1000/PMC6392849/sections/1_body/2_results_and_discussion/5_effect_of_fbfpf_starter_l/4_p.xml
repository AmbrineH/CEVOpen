<p class="p">Microbiological characterization (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c–e) revealed that raw TSF and WSF had the least microbial counts (LAB, TCB, and YM) compared to fermented samples. A sharp increase in YM counts was observed following the addition of 25% FBFPF to FTSF and FWSF. However, the addition of the same level of FBFPF to FTSF and FWSF had no significant effect on the TCB and LAB of the samples. Increasing the levels of FBFPF starter significantly (
