<p class="p">The effects of FBFPF levels on the antinutritional factors, IVPD, and IVSD of raw and fermented TSF and WSF are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. Raw TSF and WSF displayed the highest contents of tannin (0.445% and 0.57%, respectively) and phytate (234.57 and 279.33 mg/100 g, respectively) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a,b). The IVPD of raw TSF and WSF was 54.93% and 26.50%, respectively (Figure

 <xref rid="fsn3913-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). The values of IVPD were within the range of 49.25%–55.85% reported by Awadelkareem, Muralikrishna, El Tinay, and Mustafa (
