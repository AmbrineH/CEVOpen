 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) reduced the antinutritional factors contents, except for the phytate content of FTSF. Also, further significant reduction (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) occurred after addition of FBFPF, with the decrease becoming more pronounced with increased levels of FBFPF starter. However, significant increases in IVPD and IVSD were observed in the fermented samples (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). Moreover, sharp rises in IVSD and IVPD were evident following the incorporation of FBFPF, with further increases occurring as the FBFPF level increased. The decreased level of phytic acid of fermented sorghum grains has been reported (Idris et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) due to the action of the phytase enzyme released during fermentation. Also, the reduction in the level of tannin in fermented samples may be attributed to the action of tannase produced by microorganisms during fermentation (Barthamuef, Regerat, Pourrat, &amp; Pourrat, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). The increase in IVPD values with the length of fermentation agrees with the findings of Mohiedeen, Tinay, Elkhalya, Babiker, and Mallasiy (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) for fermented maize cultivars. The authors attributed the increase to the partial degradation of complex storage proteins to simpler soluble products. According to Hassan and El Tinay (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), fermentation can cause changes in the fractions of endosperm protein, which renders starch more accessible to the digestive enzyme, which may result in an increased IVSD.
