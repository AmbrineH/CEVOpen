<p class="p">Among the major minerals, the HCl extractability analysis revealed that Na was the most available mineral, while Mg was the least available mineral for both the raw TSF and WSF genotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). HCl extractability of Fe of both raw TSF and WSF was 47.72% and 41.02%, respectively. The HCl extractability of the minerals was enhanced after fermentation of the sorghum genotypes. In a similar study, Sokrab, Mohamed Ahmed, and Babiker (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that fermentation of high and low phytate corn genotypes improved the HCl extractability of Na and Ca. The improvement in the HCl extractability of the minerals of the two genotypes may be due to the hydrolysis of phytate and tannin by the released phytase and tannase enzymes, respectively. The dephosphorylation mechanism involves the removal of phosphate groups from the inositol ring of phytate, which decreases the strength of mineral binding to phytate, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of essential minerals (Sandberg et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For FTSF, the HCl extractability of Mg increased from 51.22% to 61.95%, while that of FWSF increased from 48.82% to 53.59% after preparation of the sample with 100% FBFPF. Furthermore, the iron extractability of FTSF and FWSF prepared with 100% FBFPF was also enhanced (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) to 51.44% and 41.02%, respectively. The obtained values were high as compared to that of fermented sorghum genotypes flour reported by Idris et al. (
