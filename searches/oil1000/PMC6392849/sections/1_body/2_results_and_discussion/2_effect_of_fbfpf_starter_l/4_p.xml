 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Osman et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). This increment in the amount of protein during fermentation could be due to solubilization of insoluble proteins of the flours and also the synthesis of protein by microorganisms from metabolic intermediates. The decrease in crude fiber content during fermentation was previously attributed to degradation by fermenting microbes (Babalola &amp; Giwa, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which is contrary to the present findings. Preparation of the fermented sorghum genotypes with FBFPF starter at different levels further significantly increased (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) the protein and fiber contents with increasing FBFPF levels. Abdalla, Hussain, and Mudawi (
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) described that baobab fruit pulp has a protein content range of 5.15%–5.75%, and this could have contributed to the improvement in the protein content of the fermented sorghum flours.
