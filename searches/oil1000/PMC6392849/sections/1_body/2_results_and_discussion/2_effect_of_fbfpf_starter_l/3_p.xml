<p class="p">Fermentation significantly lowered (

The fat and ash contents were low compared to previously reported values (Osman, AbdelRahman, Hamad, &amp; Dirar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The decrease in fat contents after fermentation agreed with that observed in pigeon pea (Adebowale &amp; Maliki, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), which may have been due to an increase in the rate of lipolysis to fatty acids and glycerol during the fermentation process. Also, the low ash content observed in fermented sorghum genotypes was different from the high ash contents following fermentation of pearl millet flour, which was attributed to utilization of ash during microbial growth (Azhari, Adiamo, Awad, &amp; Babiker, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). A further decrease in fat contents was observed in fermented TSF (FTSF) and fermented Wad‐Ahmed sorghum flour (FWSF) prepared with FBFPF starter. The decrease became significant (

 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). However, the addition of FBFPF starter to fermented TSF and WSF significantly increased (
