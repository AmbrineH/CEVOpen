<p class="p">The contents of major minerals and Fe were higher in raw WSF than in TSF genotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The difference could be due to genetic as well as environmental factors. Fermentation significantly increased the mineral contents for both genotypes, especially P and Mg. The incremental increase in P content during fermentation may have been due to the activity of the phytase microbial enzyme, which hydrolyzes phytate, thereby releasing more P from phenolic compounds. Preparation of FTSF and FWSF with FBFPF starter at different levels significantly enhanced (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05) the mineral contents, with FTSF and FWSF having a maximum value of P after treatment with 100% FBFPF. This could be attributed to the high mineral content of baobab fruit pulp. However, incorporation of different levels of FBFPF had no significant effect on the Mg content of both genotypes. Similarly, the Na and P contents of FWSF were significantly (

The increases were especially pronounced with increased FBFPF levels, with the exception of Fe, where no significant improvement was observed as the levels of FBFPF increased. These values were high as compared to the values obtained with fermented sorghum genotypes flour (Afify et al.,
