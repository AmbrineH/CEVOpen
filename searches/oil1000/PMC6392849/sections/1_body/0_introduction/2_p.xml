<p class="p">The recent increase in sorghum production could be due to several factors, such as genetic improvement and introduction of new varieties that are highly productive. Most of the production in Africa and Asia is mainly for human consumption as it is a main source of nutrients for many people (Godwin &amp; Garry, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). However, like other cereals, the nutritive value of sorghum is inadequate due to its deficiency in essential amino acids and also the presence of some antinutritional factors, such as tannin and phytate that interact with proteins, vitamins, and minerals and reduce the bioavailability of these nutrients for absorption in the human digestive tract (Ahmed, Mahgoub, &amp; Babiker, 
 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). In the gastrointestinal tract, dietary minerals are chelated by these antinutritional factors, reducing their bioavailability and bio‚Äêaccessibility (Idris, AbdelRahman, El Maki, Babiker, &amp; El Tinay,
