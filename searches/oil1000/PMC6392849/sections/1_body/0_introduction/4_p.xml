<p class="p">It is well known that exogenous and endogenous enzymes produced during domestic processing can substantially reduce the levels of antinutritional factors, such as phytate and tannin, in the products of some tree fruit, cereals, and legumes. Processing methods, such as dehulling, malting, fermentation, and cooking, can reduce antinutritional factors and improve the nutritional content of cereals and legumes (Idris et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3913-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). However, there is no report on the impact of fermented baobab seeds on the quality of this traditional food. It is conceivable that fermentation with baobab starter culture is useful in improving the nutritional, antinutritional contents, and functional properties of low and high tannin sorghum genotypes. To address this, the present study assessed the effect of different levels of fermented baobab fruit pulp flour (FBFPF) as a starter on the chemical composition, antinutritional factors, mineral contents and extractability, microbiological characteristics, and the physicochemical and functional properties of high and low tannin sorghum genotypes.
