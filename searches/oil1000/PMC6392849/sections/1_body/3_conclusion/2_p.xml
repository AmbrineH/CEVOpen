<p class="p">The FBFPF as a starter in the fermentation of sorghum flour substantially lowers the antinutritional factors of the fermented product. Furthermore, fermentation with FBFPF starter is valuable in improving the nutritional, total and extractable minerals, and functional properties of sorghum flour. Further research should specifically address the proportional incorporation of FBFPF starter in cereal‚Äêbased traditional foods, such as
