 <p class="p">Two sorghum genotypes termed Wad‐Ahmed (high tannin) and Tabat (low tannin) in Sudan were fermented with different starter levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of fermented baobab fruit pulp flour (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">FBFPF</styled-content>). Chemical composition, antinutrients, extracted minerals, and the microbiological, physicochemical, functional, rheological, and pasting properties from the fermented flours were determined. Fermentation of both genotypes with higher levels of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">FBFPF</styled-content> starter enhanced protein, fiber, ash, and major mineral contents and extractability (
  <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
  <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). Total acidity, bulk density, rheological properties, in vitro protein, and starch digestibility of both genotypes increased with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">FBFPF</styled-content> levels, with a concomitant decrease in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">pH</styled-content>, phytate and tannin contents, and water and fat absorption capacities (
  <italic class="italic">p </italic>≤
  <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.05). Microbial loads, especially lactic acid bacteria, increased with increasing 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">FBFPF</styled-content> starter levels in both genotypes. Use of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">FBFPF</styled-content> as a starter in the fermentation of sorghum flour can improve the nutritional value of sorghum. This could be usefully applied to the food industry for the development of fermented sorghum products.
