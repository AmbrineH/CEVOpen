 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] indicate that LAB are an important part of precooked chicken microflora, irrespective of the packaging conditions and the antimicrobial treatment combination. This could contribute to their rapid growth between days 0 and two of storage, similar to LAB growth in beef stored under MAP at 5 °C [
