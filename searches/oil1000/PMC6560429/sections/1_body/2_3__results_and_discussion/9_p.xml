<p class="p">Different essential oils, such as oregano, were applied to control the growth of LAB. Oregano oil with a concentration of 1% was more effective than the concentration of 0.1% in regards to reducing the populations of LAB, while the combination of (modified atmosphere packaging) MAP and oregano oil at a concentration 1% had the greatest effect, as described by Chouliara et al. [

 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] reported that oregano and its essential oil inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, but oregano spice stimulated 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> acid production. 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> in a liquid medium stimulated its growth and acid production of cumin at concentration 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 % (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>). 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> with acid production is inhibited with essential oil from cumin in high concentration (300 and 600 ppm). In our study, the count of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. was found only on day 0, with a number of 3.43 log cfu/g in all samples.
