Dawson et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported a reduction in growth of aerobic bacteria by 1–1.5 log cfu/g in ground chicken meat after 14 days of storage under modified atmosphere packaging. The data of the study Adiguzel et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] clearly indicated that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja hortensis</italic> plant has strong antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and fungi, since 25 bacteria, eight fungi, and one yeast species were inhibited. In the study by Mahboubi and Kazempour [

 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] found that fennel essential oils exhibited very low antimicrobial activity. Our results of the TVC are in agreement with what has been previously reported and have shown that the treatment was successful for VP+F.
