 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> reached 4.87 ± 0.04 log cfu/g in APCS samples. In the case of VPC, the count of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> was lowest at 3.75 ± 0.46 log cfu/g on day 0 and highest at 4.88 ± 0.01 log cfu/g on day eight. The counts of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in VPRO was highest at 0.43 ± 1.06 log cfu/g on day 16 and lowest at 3.75 ± 0.46 log cfu/g on day 0.
