 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00134-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The initial TVC value of chicken thigh was 3.43 ± 0.33 log cfu/g on day 0. A similar result was observed by Ismail et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], who reported mean TVC populations of 3.32–5.77 log cfu/g for various raw and processed chicken products. We observed the highest TVC, 4.58 ± 0.48 log cfu/g, in APCS on day eight, and the lowest TVC, 3.09 ± 2.39 log cfu/g, was found in VPC samples after day 16 of storage at 4 ± 0.5 °C. In samples treated with essential oils, the lowest TVC, 3.43 ± 0.33 log cfu/g, was found on day 0. For VP + F samples, the highest TVC, 4.57 ± 0.30 log cfu/g, was found on day 16; for VP + S samples, the highest TVC, 4.42 ± 0.41 log cfu/g, was found on day 1. Statistically significant differences (
