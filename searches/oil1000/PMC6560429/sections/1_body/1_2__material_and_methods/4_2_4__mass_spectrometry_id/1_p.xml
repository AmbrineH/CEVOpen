<p class="p">The qualitative analysis of microbial isolates was performed with MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Isolates from the agar were transferred into 300 μL of distilled water. Then, a quantity of 900 μL of ethanol was added, and the tubes with bacterial suspension in water were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 npm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was centrifuged repeatedly. After the remaining ethanol was removed, the pellet was allowed to dry. An amount of 10 μL of 70% formic acid was mixed with the pellet, and a 10 μL of acetonitrile was added. Tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 npm, and 1 μL of the supernatant was used for MALDI identification. Once dry, every spot was overlaid with 1 μL of the α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) matrix and left to dry at room temperature before analysis. Generated spectra were analyzed on a MALDI-TOF Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics) instrument using Flex Control 3.4 software and Biotyper Realtime Classification 3.1 with BC-specific software. Criteria for reliable identification were a score of ≥2.0 at species level and ≥1.7 at genus level. </p>
