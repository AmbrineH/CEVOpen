<p class="p">For each sample, appropriate serial decimal dilutions were prepared in 0.1% BPW solution. The amount of 0.1 mL of serial dilutions of prepared samples was spread on the surface of dry media. Total viable counts (TVC) were counted on a Plate Count Agar (PCA, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C, aerobically. The number of pseudomonads were determined on a Cephaloridine Fucidin Cetrimide agar (Oxoid, supplemented with SR 103, Basingstoke, UK) after incubation at 25 °C for 2 days, aerobically. For the detection of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, 15 mL of molten (45 °C) Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar (Oxoid) was inoculated with 1.0 mL of the sample. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h, aerobically. The number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined on a Man Rogosa Sharpe agar (Oxoid) after incubation at 25 °C for 5 days, anaerobically. Then, the agars were evaluated for bacterial growth, and 8 colonies (depending on the different morphological characteristics of colonies) per plate were selected for further confirmation with the MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics, Germany).
