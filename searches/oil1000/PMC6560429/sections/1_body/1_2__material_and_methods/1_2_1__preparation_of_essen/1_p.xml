<p class="p">The dried medicinal plants for essential oil isolation were donated by established growers. Essential oils were distilled in the large-scale distillation apparatus specifically designed for aromatic and medicinal plants. The apparatus consisted of the main distillatory apparatus, a steam condenser, a steam boiler, and an apparatus for the improvement of used water. There were two types of equipment—an HV-3000 with a height of 5250 mm, a width of 2180 mm, and a container for 200–250 kg of dried plant material and an HV-300 with a height of 3400 mm, a width of 1300 mm, and a container for 40–50 kg of dried plant material. An analysis of the essential oils was carried out with Hewlett-Packard 5890/5970 GC-MSD system.</p>
