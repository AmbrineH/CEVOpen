<p class="p">C6a and C6b two derivatives of the C8 anti-FIV peptide, although very similar to their precursor show different activity profile: in particular, C6a preserves anti-viral activity, while C6b is nearly inactive. We analysed C6a and C6b in bio-membrane mimicking environments using confocal microscopy and CD and NMR spectroscopy. Our data provide additional evidence that common antiviral activity profiles correspond to similar membrane binding properties: actually C6a, similarly to C8, has the ability to destabilize membrane vesicles, producing complex network of membrane tubes. Conformational data show that the action of C6a and C8 at membrane level is mediated by interactions involving 
 <sup class="sup">772</sup>D and two Trp residues, which correspond to 
 <sup class="sup">770</sup>W and 
 <sup class="sup">776</sup>W in C8, and 
 <sup class="sup">773</sup>W and 
 <sup class="sup">776</sup>W in C6a. These residues define a pharmacophoric model that can be considered the basis to design simplified molecules, overcoming the pharmacokinetic and high cost limitations affecting the entry inhibitors currently used as anti-HIV therapeutics.
