<p class="p">The conformational behaviour of C6a and C6b was studied in mixed DPC/SDS (90:10 M/M) micelles using CD and NMR spectroscopy. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] Micelle solutions are often used as a biomimetic membrane model to study the structural features of membranotropic molecules. They are made of surfactants, such as the zwitterionic DPC and the negatively charged SDS, at concentrations much higher than their critical micelle concentration (c.m.c.). These surfactants form spherical aggregates where the polar head groups are located on the surface and the hydrophobic tails point to the centre. Micelle solutions are ideal systems for solution CD and NMR spectroscopy, as they tumble sufficiently quickly to result in high-resolution spectral lines. [
