 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> shows the far UV CD spectra of C6a and C6b recorded in DPC/SDS 90:10 M/M micelle solution. The shapes of the far UV CD spectra are consistent with the prevalence in C6a of regular turn-helix conformation, and non-canonical secondary structures in C6b. Quantitative evaluation of the CD spectra using CONTINN algorithm (DICHROWEB website) [
