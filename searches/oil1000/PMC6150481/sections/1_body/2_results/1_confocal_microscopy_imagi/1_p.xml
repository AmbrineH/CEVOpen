<p class="p">Confocal microscopy imaging of C6a and C6b was carried out in MLVs of different DOPC/DOPG compositions. To evaluate the behaviour of C6a and C6b in MLVs characterized by different membrane charge, we used MLVs composed of zwitterionic DOPC, negatively charged DOPG and DOPC/DOPG varying in composition (90:10; 70:30; 30:70; 10:90 M/M). The peptides were labelled with NBD fluorophore [
