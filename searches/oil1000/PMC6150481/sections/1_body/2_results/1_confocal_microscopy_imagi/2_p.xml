 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows that in MLVs composed of DOPC/DOPG 90:10 and including C6b, the diameter ranges between 5 and 10 μM; only sporadically membrane fusion occurs, generating MLVs up to 50 μM diameter. In the presence of the C6a peptide, highly dynamic budding and fusion events are observable: large spherical liposomes characterized by 5–20 μM diameter, often appear because of the impaired budding of the smaller vesicles. Notably, MLVs are interconnected through the formation of straight-chain tubular structures (

These “tubulation” events occur in different z-planes, forming a crowded three-dimensional network of tubules and liposomes.
