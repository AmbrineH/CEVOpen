<p class="p">The frequency of tubule formation is high in DOPC and 90:10 DOPC/DOPG samples and decreases with the reduction of DOPC concentration, until nearly disappearing in the 10:90 DOPC/DOPG and fully DOPG samples. A similar pattern of tubulation and budding is shown by MLVs in the presence of C8 peptide (Figs
