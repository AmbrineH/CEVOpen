<p class="p">The NMR analysis in DPC/SDS 90:10 M/M micelle solutions was the starting point to investigate the positioning of the peptides with respect to the surface and interior of the micelle using 5-doxylstearic acid (5-DSA) and 16-doxylstearic acid (16-DSA) as paramagnetic probes. Both of these compounds contain a doxyl head group and a cyclic nitroxide with unpaired electrons that is bound to the aliphatic carbon chain at either position 5 or 16. NMR experiments were recorded in micelle solutions containing 5-DSA or 16-DSA. Paramagnetic probes are able to induce a broadening of the NMR signal and a decrease in the resonance intensities. Generally, the sites of the peptide that are closest to the NO· moiety are affected by the unpaired electrons, with an increase in nuclear relaxation rates and, thus, a decrease in proton signals. If the peptide is close to the surface, a decrease in intensity is observed in the 5-DSA spin-labelled micelles, but if the peptide penetrates the inner core of the micelle, a decrease in intensity is observed in the 16-DSA spin-labelled micelles.

 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR proton spectra of the C6a and C6b peptides recorded in the presence and absence of 5-DSA show a selective perturbation of Trp CHα-NH and Trp-indolyl proton signals in the presence of 5-DSA. Comparison of TOCSY spectra of C6a and C6b recorded in DPC/SDS 90:10 molar ratio micelle solutions in the presence of 5-DSA shows that the Trp Hε1 signals are decreased in intensities due to the presence of the spin label. This effect is nearly 60% in C6a and 30% in C6b. Backbone NHs of Trp are 30% and 15% decreased in intensities for C6a and C6b respectively. This effect is consistent with the localization of the peptide on the surface of micelles, as observed in the confocal microscopy imaging (Figs
