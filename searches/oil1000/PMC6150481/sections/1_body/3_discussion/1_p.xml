<p class="p">C8 is a tryptophan-rich octa-peptide belonging to the MPER of gp36. [

 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] It exerts antiviral activity by inhibiting the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. In membrane models of different complexity and composition, C8 destabilizes phospholipid bilayer and induces membrane fusion. [

 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] C8 includes three equally spaced Trp residues and several evidence suggest that its antiviral molecular mechanism consists in the inhibition of the interaction of gp36 MPER with the surface of the host cell. [

 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] SAR studies on C8 derivatives indicated that the presence and the position of Trp residues are essential for the antiviral activity: C6a and C6b, resulting from the truncation of the N-terminus 
 <sup class="sup">770</sup>WE
 <sup class="sup">771</sup> and the C-terminus 
 <sup class="sup">776</sup>WI
 <sup class="sup">777</sup> respectively, differ in their activity profiles: C6a inhibits the replication of primary FIV isolates in lymphoid cells, whereas C6b is nearly inactive. C6a and C6b are structurally similar: i) both are fragments of C8; as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>, they are characterized by the same amino acid composition, except for one residue; ii) both include two out of the three Trp residues. To elucidate the structural factors causing the different biological activities of C6a and C6b, we performed CD and NMR conformational analysis in mixed micelle solutions composed of zwitterionic DPC and negatively charged SDS. On a larger scale, we analysed by confocal microscopy the effect of the two peptides on MLVs containing zwitterionic DOPC and negatively charged DOPG phospholipids. Confocal microscopy data confirmed the relationship between antiviral activity and the membrane active properties. The interaction with the vesicle surface of the antiviral active peptides C6a and C8, induce perturbation of the bilayer architecture and consequent modification of vesicle size and shape. On the contrary, DOPC/DOPG vesicles remain unmodified in their size and shape upon the action of C6b. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows a comparison of confocal microscopy images of MLVs with different DOPC/DOPG compositions, including either C6a or C8. Both, C6a and C8 induce membrane tubulation in a manner dependent on the DOPC/DOPG ratio. In MLVs characterized by zwitterionic phospholipid content less than 50%, the effect of C6a is an increase of vesicle size possibly consequent to vesicle fusion. In contrast, in MLVs having a zwitterionic phospholipid content greater than 50% (or in pure DOPC vesicles), C6a induces membrane deformation with the appearance of a complex network of membrane tubes. Interestingly, our data indicate that the effect of the peptide on the membrane is critically dependent on the properties of the phospholipid bilayer: this aspect is important and requires attention when considering the risk for virus resistance.
