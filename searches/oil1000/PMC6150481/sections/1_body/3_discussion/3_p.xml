<p class="p">Many peptide molecules have been studied as antiviral fusion inhibitors. However, those approved for antiviral therapy have high molecular weight, with complications deriving from the high economic cost and the difficulty of administration. C8 and its derivatives are small peptides. The comparison of the most representative conformations of C8 and C6a (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>) indicates that it is possible to draw a pharmacophore model including the indolyl rings of the two Trp residues (which in C8 belong to 
 <sup class="sup">770</sup>W and 
 <sup class="sup">776</sup>W, and in C6a belong to 
 <sup class="sup">773</sup>W and 
 <sup class="sup">776</sup>W) and the side chain of 
 <sup class="sup">772</sup>D. This model may be the starting point to design new small peptide-peptidomimetic molecules endowed with improved pharmacodynamics/ pharmacokinetic properties.
