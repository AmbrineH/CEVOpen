<p class="p">Using atomistic molecular simulations, [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] we previously demonstrated that the binding of C8- with phospholipid bilayers is mediated by i) hydrophobic interactions involving the Trp indolyl rings and the hydrophobic chains of phospholipids ii) salt bridge interactions established between the negatively charged amino acids (i.e., 
 <sup class="sup">771</sup>E and 
 <sup class="sup">772</sup>D) and the phospholipid zwitterionic polar heads. The pharmacophore shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204042.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> is consistent with this model of interaction for C6a and C8, but not for C6b; notably, the absence of the 
 <sup class="sup">770</sup>WE
 <sup class="sup">771</sup> N-terminal residues may explain the 2 times less activity of C6a as compared to the C8 for FIV-M2. Accordingly, we can speculate that activity at vesicle surface and at cell membrane rely in the synergic molecular interactions involving Trp indolyl rings and negatively charged aminoacid: these induce destabilization of the bilayer, determining membrane tubes and membrane fusion.
