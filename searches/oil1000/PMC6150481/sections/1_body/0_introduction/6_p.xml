<p class="p">Previously, we extensively investigated the membrane active properties of C8 using different physical-chemical methodologies. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] C8 was studied by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, showing β-turn conformations in micelle solution; the regularity of this structure varies with the charge of the micelle surface and the positioning of the Trp side chains on the lipid surface.

 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] C8 was analysed by EPR and fluorescence spectroscopy and the results were validated by molecular dynamic calculations: in lipid vesicles of varying complexity and composition, C8 was able to disrupt phospholipid bilayers, reducing membrane thickness and inducing membrane fusion.
