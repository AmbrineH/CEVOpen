<p class="p">One major concern relative to the anti-HIV fusion inhibitors is their peptide chemical structure and the high number of residues. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] A valuable quality of C8 and its derivatives is the small size. The structural features of C6a and C6b derived from our analysis, matched to those of their parent peptide C8, lead to describe a pharmacophore model for anti-HIV fusion inhibitors; this includes the essential structural motifs to design new simplified molecules overcoming the limitations affecting the entry inhibitors that currently are in clinical application.
