<p class="p">In the present work, we report the conformational analysis of C6a and C6b by CD and NMR spectroscopy in micelle solution composed of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC)/sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) 90:10 M/M. On a higher dimension scale, we studied C6a and C6b using confocal microscopy imaging on vesicles characterized by different phospholipid compositions. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] Our data allow identifying the conformational factors determining the different C6a and C6b membrane binding properties and hence the different antiviral activity profiles.
