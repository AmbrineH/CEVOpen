<p class="p">A crucial event for the entry of HIV in host cell membranes is the conformational rearrangement of the envelope glycoprotein gp41. During the structural refolding of gp41, more than one conformational events synergically work to realise the fusion of virus and cell membranes: i) the C-terminal heptad repeats (CHR or HR2) come in close proximity with the N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR or HR1); ii) the extreme hydrophobic “membrane proximal external region” (MPER) is exposed to the host cell and interacts with lipid surface, destabilizing the lipid bilayer.
