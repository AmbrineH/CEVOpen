<p class="p">The multilamellar lipid vesicles (MLVs) of DOPC, DOPG and DOPC/DOPG (90:10, 70:30, 30:70, and 10:90 M/M) were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of lipids, dissolved in dichloromethane/methanol mixture (25 mM lipid concentration), in a round-bottom test tube. The total weight of the lipid for each sample was 1.0 mg. MLVs were prepared from lipid DOPC and DOPG solutions that were desiccated, dried overnight and hydrated in a 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. MLVs were prepared in six different lipid compositions: DOPC only, DOPG only, DOPC/DOPG 90:10 M/M, DOPC/DOPG 70:30 M/M, DOPC/DOPG 30:70 M/M and DOPC/DOPG 10:90 M/M. MLVs, in the presence of NBD-labelled C8, NBD-labelled C6a and NBD-labelled C6b peptides, were prepared by adding during their formation, the labelled peptides at a concentration of 0.5 mM (lipid to peptide 50:1 M/M). Lipid solutions in the presence or absence of labelled peptides were used for microscopy analysis. [
