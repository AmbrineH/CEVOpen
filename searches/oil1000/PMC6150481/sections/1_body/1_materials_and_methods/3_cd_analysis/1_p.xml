<p class="p">CD experiments were performed at 25°C on an 810-Jasco spectropolarimeter as an average of 4 scans with 10 nm/min scan speed, 4 s response time and 2 nm bandwidth, using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm, a measurement range from 190 to 260 nm (far UV), at temperature of 25°C. Throughout the measurements, the trace of the high-tension voltage was verified to be less than 700 V, which ensures the reliability of the obtained data.</p>
