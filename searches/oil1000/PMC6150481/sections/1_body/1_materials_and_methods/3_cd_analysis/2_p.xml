<p class="p">Far UV CD spectrum of only mixed micelles (DPC/SDS 90:10 M/M (27 mM/3 mM)) in aqueous solution (pH 7.4, 10 mM phosphate buffer containing H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) was acquired as reference, than 500 Î¼M of C6a and C6b peptides were added to mixed micelles for the conformational analysis. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204042.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] The processed curves of C6a and C6b peptides in mixed micelles were obtained by using Spectra Analysis tool of Jasco software. The CD curves of C6a and C6b peptides in mixed micelles were corrected for the solvent contribution by subtraction of CD reference spectrum and then final CD spectra were obtained after baseline correction and binomial smoothing. Those resulting spectra were used for the estimation of the secondary structure content using the algorithms CONTIN and SELCON from the DICHROWEB website. [
