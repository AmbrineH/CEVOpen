 <p> Confocal microscopy images of MLEVs in presence of NBD labelled C8 (left) and C6a (right) peptides. MLEVs vary in DOPC/DOPG composition moving from DOPC/DOPG 100:0 M/M (top) to DOPC/DOPG 0:100 M/M (bottom). Images were acquired on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a plan Apo 63X, NA 1.4 oil immersion objective lens. For each field, both fluorescent and transmitted light images were acquired on separate photomultipliers and were analysed with Zeiss LSM 510 4.0 SP2 software. </p>
