 <p> Molecular surface calculated as propensities of the different portions of the molecules to interact according to the specific surface properties. Molecular surfaces of Trp residues are coloured in green-white: they account for the propensity of the peptides to engage hydrophobic interactions. Molecular surfaces of Asp residues are coloured in blue: they account for the propensity of the peptides to engage polar/electrostatic interactions. </p>
