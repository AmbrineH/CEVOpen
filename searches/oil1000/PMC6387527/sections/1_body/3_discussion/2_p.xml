<p id="Par38" class="p">Despite the known anti-microbial properties of resin acids extracted from coniferous trees [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>], dietary inclusion of resin acids had no effect on the microbial richness or diversity in either the ileum or caecum, nor did it alter the overall microbial community composition of the caecum. The composition of the ileal microbial structure did show differences between the resin acids-supplemented group and control birds, without affecting the composition of the caecal microbial structure. This is consistent with previous studies using either plant derived growth promoters or antimicrobial growth promoters, where the major microbial responses were observed in small intestinal compartments rather than in caecal or colorectal compartments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. In the current study, the overall effects on ileal microbial composition were mainly due to low abundant genera (&lt;â€‰0.1% relative abundance). Moreover, no effect on the metabolic microbial functions were detected (both as inferred functional capacities of the microbial communities as well as measured SCFA production), indicating that dietary supplementation of resin acids had likely no relevant effect on the microbiota of healthy broilers.
