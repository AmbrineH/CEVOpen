<p id="Par39" class="p">Intestinal homeostasis is the result of a delicate balance between toxic and inflammatory elements in the gut that constantly challenge its integrity on the one hand (e.g. antigens, toxins, invasive bacteria), and beneficial microbes and host signals that are supporting intestinal integrity and regulating immunity on the other hand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. In the ideal situation, the intestinal wall is covered by a protective layer of mucins and the intestinal epithelial cells are strongly sealed by intercellular junctions. Additionally, there exists a symbiotic homeostasis between the intestinal microbiome and the intestinal immune system, inducing a low-grade stimulation of the innate immune system that is continuously regulated and controlled, thereby preventing intestinal tissue damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. To ensure optimal performance, normal physiological inflammation should be maintained while limiting pathological inflammatory triggers. However, features of modern animal production likely predispose broilers to particularly chronic, inflammatory triggers (e.g. increased feed intake and nutrient excesses) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory nutritional strategies and other strategies that support optimal gut barrier function are important means to improve the performance of broilers. By reducing the inflammatory tone, the production of protein can be assigned to support growth instead of to the production of immune modulators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory and wound healing activities described for coniferous resin acids might be beneficial to maintain broiler gut health and can be a possible explanation for the previously reported performance-enhancing effects. Indeed, dietary resin acids-supplementation resulted in decreased abundance of inflammatory T-cells in the duodenal tissue and reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, while maintaining optimal intestinal morphology. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that are able to degrade extracellular matrix molecules as well as a wide range of other molecules that might be important within the mucosal layer, such as, amongst others, membrane receptors, adhesion factors, signaling molecules and cytoskeleton proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. MMPs are important in many normal physiological processes, but some MMPs are also involved in various enteric inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>] and necrotic enteritis in broilers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]. The most profound effect of resin acids-supplementation on MMP activity was observed in the ileum, resulting in a reduction of both collagen type I and collagen type IV degrading activity. Both collagen subtypes are important for the structural integrity of the intestinal wall: collagen type I is a major supportive component of the extracellular matrix, whereas type IV collagen is an integral component of the basement membrane supporting the epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. The main enzyme responsible for the reduced collagenolytic activity in the resin acids group had a molecular weight corresponding to both the latent and active forms of MMP7. No other MMPs in this molecular weight range are currently described. However the identity of this enzyme should be confirmed in future research. In the healthy intestine, various MMPs are expressed, but the production of MMP7 is mainly linked to injured epithelium and seems not to be involved in regular epithelial renewal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]. MMP7 can disrupt epithelial barrier integrity by degrading intercellular junction molecules such as cadherins and occludins. Furthermore, MMP7 is able to activate α-defensins by cleaving its precursor into the active form. Αlpha-defensins are antimicrobial peptides that are secreted by epithelial cells and granulocytes, which might play a role in protection of the host against microbial invasion during intestinal inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>] and can induce IL6 secretion by macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. While IL6 has a protective role in many infections, these effects are context dependent, and the same activities can also contribute to intestinal leakage and inflammation. As the broiler gut is continuously exposed to various challenges that affect intestinal barrier integrity and can trigger inflammation (e.g. coccidia, mycotoxins, bacterial toxins, amongst others), reducing MMP7 activity through resin acids-supplementation to the diet might support intestinal health by enhancing intestinal barrier integrity and controlling inflammation in the avian gut.
