<p id="Par23" class="p">The Molecular Probes EnzChek® Gelatinase/Collagenase Assay Kit was used to evaluate the breakdown of gelatin, collagen type I and collagen type IV by enzymes present in the small intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum or ileum). These substrates were labeled with fluorescein and a quenching agent. Duplicate measurements were performed in 200 μL reaction volume containing 20 µL of either fluorescein labelled substrate (DQ Collagen I (25 μg/mL, D12060), DQ Collagen IV (25 μg/mL, D12052), or DQ Gelatin (12.5 μg/mL, D12054)), 100 μL of the tissue lysate (500 µg/mL) and 80 μL of reaction buffer (0.5 M Tris–HCl, 1.5 M NaCl, 50 mM CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 2 mM sodium azide with pH 7.6). Samples were incubated for 10 h at room temperature in the absence of light, after which fluorescence was measured (excitation 485 nm, emission 527 nm; Fluoroskan Ascent Fluorometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Background fluorescence was subtracted for each sample.
