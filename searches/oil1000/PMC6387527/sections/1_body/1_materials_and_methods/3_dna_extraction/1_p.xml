<p id="Par14" class="p">DNA was extracted from intestinal content using the CTAB method as previously described by Griffiths et al. and De Maesschalck et al. with minor modifications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. In brief, 100 mg of caecal content or 200 mg of ileal content was suspended in 0.5 mL CTAB buffer (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide &gt; 98% (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 5% (w/v), 0.35 M NaCl, 120 nM K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>HPO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and 0.5 mL phenol–chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The mixture was homogenized by grinding (2×) with 0.5 g unwashed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) in a bead beater (1.5 min, 22.5 Hz; TissueLyser; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a 30 s interval between shakings. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm and 300 µL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. A re-extraction from the remaining content was performed by adding 0.25 mL CTAB buffer and homogenizing and centrifuging the sample as described above. An equal volume (600 µL) of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added to the supernatant collected in order to remove the phenol from the samples. The mixture was further centrifuged at 16 000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 s. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 2 times the volume of polyethyleenglycol-6000 solution (30% w/v; 1.6 M NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged (13 000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 20 min) and washed with 1 mL ice-cold ethanol (70% v/v). The pellet obtained was further centrifuged (13 000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 20 min), dried and resuspended in 100 µL de-ionized water (LiChrosolv Water, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The quality and the concentration of the DNA was examined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
