<p id="Par24" class="p">Gelatin zymography was used to identify the gelatinolytic enzymes in the ileal tissue lysates. Polyacrylamide gel (10%) containing 0.2% gelatin (2 mg/mL) as substrate was used for determination of MMPs gelatinolytic activity. Equal concentrations of ileal tissue lysates from the resin acids-supplemented birds or control birds were pooled, after which 10 µL pooled ileal tissue lysate (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 10 µL 2 × loading buffer (0.5 M Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, a pinch of bromophenol blue) and loaded to the gel. After standard electrophoresis, the gel was incubated with renaturing buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 30 min, room temperature) to remove SDS from the gel. This allows the enzymes in the gels to renature and autoactivate. The gel was washed with developing buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 0.05% NaN
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5) and incubated with fresh developing buffer under continuous shaking at 37 °C for 18 h. After incubation, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Activity of gelatin-degrading enzymes is visualized as colorless bands on a blue background. Gel images were analyzed with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer and the Quantity One software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).
