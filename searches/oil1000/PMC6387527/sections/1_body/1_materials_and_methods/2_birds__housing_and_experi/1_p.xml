<p id="Par13" class="p">The study was undertaken following the guidelines of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU. Twenty, 1-day-old Ross 308 broilers were obtained from a local hatchery and housed in two pens (10 chickens per pen) on wood shavings. The animals were not vaccinated. Water and commercial starter feed (day 1–10) or grower feed (day 11–22) were provided ad libitum (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The control group received the standard non-supplemented diet, whereas the birds in the treatment group were fed the same feed supplemented with 200 mg resin acids/kg feed throughout the whole trial period. This resin acids supplementation level is in the same order of magnitude as used previously in studies assessing the effect of resin-based products on broiler performance [

Ileal and caecal content were stored at −70 °C for microbiota composition analysis (16S rRNA sequencing) and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis. Intestinal tissue from the different segments of the small intestine was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until protein extraction was performed for MMP analysis. Additionally, duodenal and ileal tissue samples were collected and fixed in 4% phosphate buffered formaldehyde for histological analysis.
