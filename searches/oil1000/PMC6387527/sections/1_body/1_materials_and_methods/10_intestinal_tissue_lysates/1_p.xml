<p id="Par22" class="p">Proteins were extracted from the small intestinal tissue (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) using mechanical lysis. In brief, intestinal tissues (~30 mg) were homogenized in 400 µL TBS-1% NP-40 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 1% (v/v) NP-40, supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche, Mannheim, Germany)) by grinding (2x) with a combination of 2.3 mm zircon/silica and 3.2 mm stainless steel beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) in a bead beater (1.5 min, 22.5 Hz; TissueLyser) with a 30 s interval between shakings. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and samples were stored at −20 °C until further analysis.</p>
