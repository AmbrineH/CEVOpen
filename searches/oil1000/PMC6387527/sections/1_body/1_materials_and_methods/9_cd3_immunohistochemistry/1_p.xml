<p id="Par21" class="p">Slides for immunohistochemical staining for CD3
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> cells were automatically deparaffinized (Shandon Varistain-Gemini) before antigen retrieval with a pressure cooker in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treating the slides with peroxidase blocking reagent (S2023, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 5 min. The presence of T-cells (CD3-positive cell abundance) in intestinal tissue from both duodenum and ileum was evaluated using polyclonal primary antibodies against CD3 (A0452, Dako, 1:100 dilution, 30 min at room temperature), followed by incubation with a secondary labelled polymer-HRP anti-rabbit (Envision + System-HRP (DAB) (K4011), 30 min at room temperature). Slides were evaluated using the computer based image analysis program, LAS V4.1. The CD3
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> area percentage in either the duodenal or ileal tissue was quantified using three representative fields of view per intestinal section.
