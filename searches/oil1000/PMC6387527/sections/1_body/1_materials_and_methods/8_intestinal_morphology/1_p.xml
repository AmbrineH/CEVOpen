<p id="Par20" class="p">Intestinal morphology was analyzed by measuring villus length and crypt depth. Formalin-fixed intestinal tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 µm. To analyze the intestinal morphology, duodenal tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Villus height and crypt depth were assessed using a PC-based image analysis system (Leica Application Suite V4, LAS V4.; Leica, Diegem Belgium). Villus height was measured from the tip of the villus to the crypt-villus junction. Crypt depth was measured from its base up to the crypt-villus invagination. Measurements were performed in duodenal sections by random measurement of 10 villi/crypts per section, after which the average per animal was calculated.</p>
