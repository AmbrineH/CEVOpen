<p id="Par15" class="p">To characterize the taxonomic groups in the caecal and ileal microbiota of the chickens, the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16s rRNA gene was amplified using the gene-specific primers S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17 (5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21 (5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Each 25 µL PCR reaction contained 2.5 µL DNA (~5 ng/µL), 0.2 µM of each of the primers and 12.5 µL 2 × KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The PCR amplification consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified using CleanNGS beads (CleanNA, Waddinxveen, The Netherlands). The DNA quantity and quality was analyzed spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop) and by agarose gel electrophoresis. A second PCR step was used to attach dual indices and Illumina sequencing adapters in a 50 µL reaction volume containing 5 µL of purified PCR product, 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (25 µL) and 0.5 µM primers. The PCR conditions were the same as the first PCR with the number of cycles reduced to 8. The final PCR products were purified and the concentration was determined using the Quantus double-stranded DNA assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The final barcoded libraries were combined to an equimolar 5 nM pool and sequenced with 30% PhiX spike-in using the Illumina MiSeq v3 technology (2 × 300 bp, paired-end) at the Oklahoma Medical Research center (Oklahoma City, OK, USA).
