 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T-cells was determined in both the ileal and duodenal tissue as a marker for intestinal inflammation. No changes in ileal T-cell abundance were observed, whereas the amount of CD3
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> positive cells in the duodenal tissue from birds fed the resin acids-supplemented diet was significantly decreased as compared to the control birds (TableÂ
