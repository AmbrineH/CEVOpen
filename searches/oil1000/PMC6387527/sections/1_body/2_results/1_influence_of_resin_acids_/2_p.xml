<p id="Par27" class="p">Bray–Curtis dissimilarity was used to investigate beta diversity between either the caecal or ileal microbiota from birds fed the control diet or the diet supplemented with resin acids. Addition of resin acids to the diet resulted in a significant differentiation of the ileal microbial community structures as compared to the control group (ANOSIM statistic R = 0.23, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002), whereas no statistical difference could be observed in the caecum (ANOSIM statistic R = 0.12, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.055) (Figure
