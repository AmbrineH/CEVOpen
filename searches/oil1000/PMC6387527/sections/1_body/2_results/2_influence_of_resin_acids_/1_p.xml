<p id="Par28" class="p">The caeca from broilers fed a resin acids-containing diet or the control diet were highly abundant in 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> (83.2% and 77.2%, respectively) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> (14.5% and 17.8%, respectively). The relative abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic> in the caeca from birds fed a resin acids-supplemented diet (0.07%) was decreased as compared to birds receiving the control diet (3.4%) (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0042), a difference that was mainly due to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> (0.004% and 3.4% in respectively the resin acids group or control group). The phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> accounted for 0.7% of total sequences in the control birds, whereas a relative abundance of 1.8% was observed in the caeca from birds receiving resin acids (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.1992). The ileal microbiota was characterized by a high abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> (97% in resin acids supplemented group, 96.1% in controls), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic> as the second most abundant group (3.7% in control, 2.8% in resin acid fed birds) (Figure
