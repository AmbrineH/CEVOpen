<p id="Par29" class="p">Differentially abundant genera in the caecal or ileal microbiota from birds fed a resin acids-supplemented diet as compared to the control diet were identified using DESeq2. Seven genera were differentially abundant between the caecal microbiota derived from birds fed either the control or resin acids diet. Six of these genera were more prevalent when resin acids were supplemented to the diet, with two belonging to the family 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic>, three classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcaceae</italic> and the sixth belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus.</italic> Only the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> was decreased when birds were fed a resin acids-containing diet (TableÂ
