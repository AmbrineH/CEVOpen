<p id="Par30" class="p">Addition of resin acids to the broiler diet resulted in 12 genera in the ileal microbiota that were differentially abundant as compared to the control diet. Nine of these genera were less abundant when birds were fed the resin acids-containing diet. Five of these genera showed a mean relative abundance below 0.1%. The four more abundant genera belonged to the families 
 <italic class="italic">Corynebacteriaceaea, Planococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiaceae 1</italic>. The three genera that were more prevalent in the resin acids-supplemented group all showed an overall low prevalence in the ileal microbiota (mean relative abundance &lt; 0.1%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> was the only genus that was significantly different between the diet groups in both the ileal and caecal microbiota.
