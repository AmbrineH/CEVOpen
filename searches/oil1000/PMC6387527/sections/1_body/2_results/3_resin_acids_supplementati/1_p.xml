<p id="Par31" class="p">To determine whether the resin acids-induced alterations of the microbiota might have an effect on the microbial functions, microbial pathways present in the ileal and caecal microbiome were in silico predicted. The main functional pathways predicted in both the ileal and caecal microbiome were involved in membrane transport, DNA replication and repair, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. No significant differences could be observed between the microbiota from birds fed a resin acid-supplemented diet as compared to the control diet (Additional file
