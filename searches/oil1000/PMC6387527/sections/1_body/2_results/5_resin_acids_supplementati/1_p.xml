<p id="Par35" class="p">The enzymatic activity towards gelatin, collagen type I or collagen type IV present in the small intestinal tissue was assessed as a measure for extracellular matrix degradation in the gut. Resin acids-supplementation did not influence the gelatin, collagen type I or collagen type IV degrading activity in the duodenal tissue (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>A–C). In the jejunum, significantly lower gelatinase activity was measured in the tissue from resin acids fed birds as compared to the control group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0197; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>D). Although still numerically lower in the resin acids-supplemented group, this difference did not reach statistical significance when looking to the specific collagen type I or collagen type IV breakdown in the jejunal tissue (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.14 or 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.21 respectively, Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>E and F). The biggest effect of resin acids was observed in the ileal tissue, where gelatin (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.021), collagen type I (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.046) and collagen type IV (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0045) degrading activity was significantly decreased by supplementation of resin acids to the broiler feed (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>G–I).
