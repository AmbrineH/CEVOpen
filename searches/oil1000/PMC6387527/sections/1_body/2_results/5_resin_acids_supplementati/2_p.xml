<p id="Par36" class="p">To gain more information on the identity of these enzymes, pooled ileal tissue lysates were subjected to gelatin zymography (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The ileal tissue from the control birds showed three different gelatinolytic bands, whereas in the ileal tissue from the resin acids group, only the highest molecular weight enzyme was present. The two enzymatic bands that were exclusively detected in the ileum from control birds correspond to MMP7 (~18 kDa) and its latent pro-enzyme forms (pre-proMMP7: ~30 kDa and proMMP7: ~28 kDa) (UniprotKB: F6R1W4_CHICK; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]). MMP7 is the smallest of all MMPs and the only MMP in this molecular weight range. The third, unaffected enzymatic band has a molecular weight between 50 and 75 kDa, which is predicted to be MMP2 (~62 kDa), but might as well be MMP1 (54 kDa), MMP3 (52 kDa) or MMP13 (55 kDa). As this bigger enzyme was not affected by resin acids-supplementation, the identity of this enzyme was not further investigated.
