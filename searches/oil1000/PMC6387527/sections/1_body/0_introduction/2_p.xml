<p id="Par8" class="p">Regulatory and consumer pressure to reduce antimicrobial usage in production animals has encouraged studies on alternatives to antimicrobials. Most of these alternatives are feed additives that aim to steer towards a healthy gut microbiota, and towards preserving intestinal integrity and thus reducing excessive inflammatory responses [
