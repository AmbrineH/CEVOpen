<p id="Par11" class="p">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of pure resin acids on broiler intestinal health under non-challenged conditions. Therefore, we focused on the effect of resin acids on both the intestinal microbiota as well as the intestinal tissue morphology and collagenolytic activities, since host metalloproteinases involved in collagen breakdown are known to play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal mucosal structure.</p>
