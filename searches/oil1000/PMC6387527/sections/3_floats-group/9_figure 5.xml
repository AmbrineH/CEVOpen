   <bold class="bold">Effect of resin acids-supplementation on ileal gelatinolytic enzymes.</bold> Ileal tissue lysates from either the control group or the resin acids-supplemented group were pooled and subjected to gelatin zymography. Gelatinolytic enzymes are observed as clear bands of digested gelatin. Control tissue shows three different gelatinolytic bands, whereas only one band was observed in the ileal tissue lysate from birds fed the resin acids-containing diet.
