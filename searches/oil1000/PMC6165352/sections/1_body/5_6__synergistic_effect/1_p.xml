<p class="p">It is important to note the possible synergistic effect between rosemary extract and other natural antioxidants. The results shown in the scientific literature offer contradictory conclusions. Resurreccion and Reynolds [
 <xref rid="B102-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>], observed that the joint addition of rosemary extract and tocopherols in meat products failed to increase the antioxidant efficacy of these individually used compounds. On the contrary, Wong et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>], concluded that the components of rosemary participate in the regeneration of α-tocopherol, which can be used as substitutes for vitamin C to enhance the stability of vitamin E. Wada and Fang [
 <xref rid="B104-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>], proposed that the synergism between both antioxidants is due to the capacity of the rosemary extract to yield hydrogen atoms to the tocopheryl radicals. This fact justifies the results obtained by Fang and Wada [
 <xref rid="B37-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], who observed that the antioxidant activity of the α-tocopherol-rosemary mixture on a model fish system was significantly higher than that exhibited by the individually added products. In addition, these authors found that the α-tocopherol molecule remained stable for 10 more days when administered together with rosemary extract.
