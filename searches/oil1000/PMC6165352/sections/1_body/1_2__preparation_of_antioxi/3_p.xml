<p class="p">Previous extraction processes are obsolete and unusual in the industry. Chang et al. [

 <xref rid="B16-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] demonstrated the possibility of separating an active fraction of the rosemary extract by molecular distillation. The process realized by Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] for the extraction of antioxidant involves the extraction with ethyl ether under refluxing conditions. The crude material is washed with water and the solvent is removed. The crude material is dissolved in methanol and activated with carbon at 60 °C for 15 min. Another process reported by Bracco [
 <xref rid="B16-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], involves reducing the particle size to 600 µL and suspending in peanut oil. The finely antioxidant components have a molecular weight range lower than the triglyceride components of the oil used (peanut oil) and can therefore be physically separated by molecular distillation on either a fall-film or centrifugal system.
