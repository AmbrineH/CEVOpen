<p class="p">The health problems derived from lipid oxidation have attracted the attention of consumers and researchers. Numerous diseases, such as aging, cancer, ischemia and atherosclerosis are linked to dietary and biological lipid oxidation products. In this regard, antioxidant compounds present in rosemary extracts and essential oils, delay lipid oxidation in biological systems and food. However, it is essential to consider that the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of rosemary depend on the fruiting stage, nature of the extracts, mode of extraction, presence of an inhibitor, presence of a synergistic effect with other components, and the concentration of active extract components. If these aspects are taken into account, the application of this natural extract can be complimented in different food systems such as meat, oils and dressing. In view of its application, rosemary extracts could be used in functional foods, pharmaceutical products, plant products and food preservation. Because rosemary is a cheap, available, and a non-toxic herb, these considerations warrant the introduction of rosemary extracts or essential oils, with high phenolic compound contents, into the food industry.</p>
