<p class="p">The antibacterial effect of rosemary has been widely demonstrated in several food studies: beef meatballs [
 <xref rid="B96-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], cooked beef [
 <xref rid="B97-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] and in pork sausage [
 <xref rid="B98-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Gomez-Estaca et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] reported that rosemary oil inhibited the growth of common food bacteria contributing to food spoilage. Burt [
 <xref rid="B85-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] also showed the antibacterial activity of rosemary essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. In addition, Sirocchi et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] showed that rosemary essential oil inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. Govaris et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] reported an inhibitory effect of dietary supplementation of turkeys with rosemary (5 and 10 g/kg) on the growth of bacteria responsible for spoilage (psychrotrophs, mesophilics, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria). Camo et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] also observed an inhibitory effect of the use of rosemary extract added to lamb meat packed in a modified atmosphere in the growth of psychrotrophic bacteria, compared with control meat. This same effect was observed by Quattara et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>], however these authors studied pure rosemary essential oil. On the contrary, Ismail et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] showed that rosemary had no antibacterial effect in chicken.
