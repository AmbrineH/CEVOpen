 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, antimicrobial activity improves with the presence of Î±-pinene as a major component. This effect can be correlated with the fact that terpenes can disorganize the cell membrane, and therefore promote the lysis, as stated by Bjapai et al. [

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, are very resistant bacteria and highlight the importance of chemical composition and proportion between the oil components on their antimicrobial efficacy [
