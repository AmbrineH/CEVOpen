<p class="p">Vegara et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] reported that the effectiveness of carnosic acid against pathogenic bacteria is superior to that of any other major extract component, including rosmarinic acid. In contrast, several scientific publications disagree about the possible relationships that may exist between the composition of the polyphenolic extract and its antimicrobial activity. Such is the case of Moreno et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] and Ivanovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] who demonstrated that the effectiveness of rosemary is related to a possible synergy between the rosmarinic phenolic acid and the carnosic acid diterpene. Bernardes et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>], however, state that there is a close relationship between the concentration levels of the carnosic acid, carnosol diterpenes and the antimicrobial activity of these extracts.
