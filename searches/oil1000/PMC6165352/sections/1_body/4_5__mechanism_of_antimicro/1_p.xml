<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of rosemary has been determined in various assay types based on either MIC or MBC. In this regard, Sienkiewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], demonstrated the antibacterial activities of basil (
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic>, L.) and rosemary (
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, L.) These authors reported the inhibition of microbial growth by both essential oils, presented as MIC values. Antibiotic susceptibility was carried out using disc diffusion. The results showed that both essential oils tested are active against all the clinical strains from 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>. Mihajilov-Kristev et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], showed that essential oils containing mainly carvacrol (67.0%) and γ-terpinene (15.3%) were effective against Gram-negative strains, including 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, with MIC values from 0.025 µL/mL to 0.78 µL/mL according to the broth microdilution method. Probuseenivasan et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], confirmed that rosemary essential oil strongly inhibits 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922. The minimal inhibitory concentration for rosemary oil against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was &gt;6.4 mg/L.
