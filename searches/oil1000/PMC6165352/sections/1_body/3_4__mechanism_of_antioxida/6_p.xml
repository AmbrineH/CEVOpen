<p class="p">The catechol group is responsible for scavenging the radical electron formed as result of oxidation. The skeleton formed by the three rings allows the delocalization of the charge. The presence of the carboxylic group (in the case of carnosic acid) increases this conjugation, especially in aqueous systems. However, in slightly polar media, such as fats, it is the lactone structure that seems to confer greater stability.</p>
