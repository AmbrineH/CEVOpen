<p class="p">The antioxidative activity of rosemary extracts has been evaluated using different solvents. In this regard, Inatani et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported that rosmanol, showed an antioxidant capacity four times higher than BRT and BRA (synthetic antioxidants) in both linoleic acid and lard. In addition, this study reported the antioxidant activity of carnosol and rosmanol by TBA and ferric thiocyanate methods. They reported the correlation between activity and chemical structure as an antioxidant. Aruoma et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] studied the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of rosemary. The main constituents with antioxidant properties are carnosic acid and carnosol that are responsible for 90% of the properties. Both are inhibitors of lipid peroxidation in liposomal and microsomal systems, they are good scavengers of CCl
