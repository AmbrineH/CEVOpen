<p class="p">In addition, rosemary has been added as an antioxidant in oils: Tohma et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] studied the effect of the rosemary plant, its alcoholic extracts and essential oil on the oxidative stability of hazelnut oil during deep frying. This study showed that rosemary plant, or its extracts, could be used to extend the usage life of hazelnut oil for frying. The rosemary additives considerably inhibited the formation of oxidation products. The total phenolic compounds and profile of the enriched oils might cause increased frying stability. In addition, Reblova et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and Taha et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] reported that rosemary extracts improved the sensory characteristic of fries, increased the oxidative stability of the oil, inhibited the decomposition of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols and the formation of polar substances in rape-seed oil. Urbancic et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] reported that rosemary extract reduced acrylamide formation during potato frying. This effect was due to the transfer of phenolic compounds from rosemary into the oil.
