<p class="p">Moreover, activation of redox-dependent signalling pathways such as Nrf2-dependent transcriptional regulation is known to take part in the antioxidant response of rosemary. The main metabolites carnosol and carnesolic acid have been reported to mediate antioxidant activities by differential mechanisms. Carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmanol and epirosmanol are the major phenolic diterpenes responsible for the antioxidant properties of rosemary (the first proposed oxidation pathway of carnosic acid was reported by Wenkert et al.

 <xref rid="B50-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] suggest that the antioxidant activities of carnosic acid are due to their ability to increase or maintain superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. These authors reported that carnosic acid and carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation by 88–100% and 38–89%, respectively, under oxidative stress conditions.
