<p class="p">The mechanism of action of these compounds has been widely covered in several publications. For example, HÃ¶ulihan et al. [

 <xref rid="B37-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] determined that the antioxidant properties of rosemary are attributed to its richness in isoprenoid quinones, which act as chain terminators of free radicals, and as chelators of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, Gordon [
 <xref rid="B38-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] indicated that the phenolic compounds existing in the commercial extracts of rosemary act as primary antioxidants when reacting with the lipid and hydroxyl radicals to turn them into stable products. Subsequently, Fang and Wada [
 <xref rid="B39-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] pointed out that these compounds could act as metal ion chelators (Fe
 <sup class="sup">+2</sup> fundamentally), therefore reducing the formation ratio of the reactive species derived from oxygen.
