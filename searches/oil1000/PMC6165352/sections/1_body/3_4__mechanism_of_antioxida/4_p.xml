<p class="p">The antioxidant properties depend on fruiting stages: the increase in concentration of polyphenols, which include carnosol, rosmarinic acid and hesperidin, during the fruiting stage, is directly related to the improvement of the extract antioxidant capacity. This statement is supported by scientific papers previously published by Cui et al. [
