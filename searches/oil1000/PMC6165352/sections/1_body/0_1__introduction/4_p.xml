<p class="p">EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) has reviewed the safety of rosemary extracts [
 <xref rid="B14-medicines-05-00098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. It concluded that there are high-intake estimates ranging from 0.09 (the elderly) to 0.81 (children) mg/kg per day of carnosol and carnosic acid. Nowadays, in the European Union, rosemary extracts are added to food and beverages at levels of up to 400 mg/kg (as the sum of carnosic acid and carnosol).
