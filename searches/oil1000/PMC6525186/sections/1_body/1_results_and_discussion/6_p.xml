<p id="Par13" class="p">The relationship between the deposition time of each layer with the transparency and superhydrophobicity was also investigated. The depositions times were increased for each layer of 5 min, 6 min, 7 min and 10 min; keeping fixed depositions temperatures at 450 °C for MPS, 350 °C for TEOS and 270 °C for POTS. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a–d</xref>) shows the visible transparency and CA for the different deposition time. Increasing the time of deposition, resulted in the particle density become greater, thus leading to a higher degree of texture on the surface (SI Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) and the water CA increase until 169°. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e</xref>, the sample at 5 min was compared to an uncoated glass. The sample at 5 min, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, gives the best transparency while preserving a higher water contact angle.
