<p id="Par22" class="p">The coating described in this paper comprises three layers, deposited separately by AACVD which helps the creation of transparent, durable superhydrophobic coating. The lower and middle layers have created a silica nanoparticles dual scale roughness, keeping excellent optical performance. Finally, the fluoro-based top layer provides water-repellency because of its low surface tension chain. It is well known that the coexistence of surface roughness and low surface energy material are requisites for achieving superhydrophobicity

 </sup>. Hence, highly transparent superhydrophobic, environmentally durable and self-cleaning MPS-TEOS-POTS coating can be easily applied in industrial applications as architectural glazing, screens for electronic devices and protective layers for solar panels
