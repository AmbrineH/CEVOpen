<p id="Par16" class="p">The chemical composition of the film was also confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) microanalysis. The EDS spectra of the three layers confirms a composition consistent of silica nanoparticles, which gave a Si: O ratio of 1:2 in each spectrum. Furthermore, EDS spectra of the lower and top layer shows the presences of C and F, in agreement with the FTIR data spectra.</p>
