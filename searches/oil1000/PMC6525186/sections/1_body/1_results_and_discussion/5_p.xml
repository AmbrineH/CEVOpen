 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, the wettability behaviour of the coating made by various combinations of the layers are compared. The lower layer formed by MPS shows a CA around 90°. Then the film fabricated with two layers (MPS-TEOS) showed an increased contact angle of 122° due to micro-nano silica particles. However, with the combination of the full three layers, MPS-TEOS-POTS, a higher water CA, around 165° (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and a lower SA of 0.5° (SI Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) was formed. Therefore, silica nanoparticles modified by the addition of the lower energy compound POTS, greatly increases the hydrophobicity of the layers. The results show a synergetic effect between dual scale micro/nano particles and low surface energy species

 </sup>. The randomly distributed silica particles created by deposition of MPS and TEOS, with a moderately dense coverage of the surface and POTS enables the superhydrophobic properties to be achieved.
