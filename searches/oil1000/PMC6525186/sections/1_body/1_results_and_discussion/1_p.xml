<p id="Par8" class="p">In the AACVD process, an aerosol is generated from a solution of precursors dissolved in a solvent via the use of an ultrasonic humidifier. The precursor mist is transported by a nitrogen carrier gas to a CVD reactor (cold-wall reactor), where a heated substrate is located. Once inside the reactor, solvent aerosol droplets undergo evaporation; meanwhile precursor droplets can react leading to the formation of a thin film. The morphology and particle size of the deposited film is controlled by the deposition temperature, solvent and deposition time

 </sup>. The precursors solutions SOL-MPS, SOL-TEOS and SOL-POTS were prepared by using acidic aqueous solutions so that alkoxysilane can react with water to form hydrolysed species able to react in the aerosol/reactor to form silica nanoparticles. The hydrolysed siloxanes, by condensation reaction form siloxane bonds (Si–O–Si), and subsequently silica nanoparticles. For MPS, TEOS and POTS, it was necessary to stir the precursor solutions for 1 hour, in order to promote the hydrolysis reaction

 </sup>. The formation of silica nanoparticles was improved by the presence of the acidic catalyst, HCl, and a lower amount of water had to be used for the hydrolysis reaction, in order to obtain a more transparent film (molar ratio SiOR
