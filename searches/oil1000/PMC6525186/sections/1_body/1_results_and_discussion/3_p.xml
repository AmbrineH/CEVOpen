 </sup>. Therefore, it was important to optimize the solution parameters, such as concentration of silicon alkoxide and solvent. The solvents MeOH and EtOH, in a volume ratio 1:1, were chosen for two reasons. First, to have the same carbon chain as the ligands of the alkoxide, to prevent the possibility of ligand exchange. Second, MeOH is more volatile than EtOH improving the formation of the aerosol. Another key factor was the concentration of starting solution. Different concentrations were tested and at lower concentration of precursor solution (0.1–0.4 mol/l) a non-homogenous deposition of the film was obtained caused by the low presence of silica nanoparticles on the substrate (SI Fig.

 </sup>. Moreover, higher concentration of solutions favoured the nucleation of larger and fewer particles with a loss in optical transmission (SI Fig.

 </sup>. A concentration of 0.9 mol/l and a gas flow rate of 1 l/min were used to deposit homogeneous films. Using higher gas flow rates resulted in less control of the homogeneous and optical quality of the films. The optimum parameters for the deposition of the multilayer films is provided in Table
