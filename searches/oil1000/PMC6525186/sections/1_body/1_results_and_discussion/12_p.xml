<p id="Par19" class="p">Supplementary test was performed to evaluate the behaviour of the MPS-TEOS-POTS film in an organic environment. The surface was tested in two different kind of the solvents, in order to observe the effect of a slightly polar organic solvent, (ethanol EtOH) and of an apolar solvent (toluene). The samples were immersed in organic solvent for 5 hours; CA and SA were checked every 30 min. Organic solvent test results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8b</xref>. It can be seen that the samples resist both the ethanol test and toluene test, without any change in CA and SA. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8c</xref>, the heating test results are illustrated, after 5 hours at 300 °C, and then at 400 °C. The contact angle remained high at 165° and sliding angle lower than 1°. Hence, the samples resisted prolonged thermal stress. The UV light resistance test was carried out because UV radiations can be potentially harmful for a material. In order to test the UV resistance of the superhydrophobic multilayer surfaces, the samples were exposed to UV light (365 nm, 3.7 mW/cm2) for 72 h at room temperature, and CAs and SAs of the resulting surfaces were measured after each 24 h period as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8d</xref>. The results showed excellent UV stability no changes on wettability, preserving the CA and SA.
