 </sup>. In the XPS survey spectrum binding energies of 102.5, 284.8, 533.3, and 688.8 eV were observed, indicating the presence of Si, C, O, and F, respectively. Moreover, to further analyse the superhydrophobic film, high-resolution spectra of Si 2p, F 1s, C 1s and O 1s were obtained, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>. The C 1s region of the XPS spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>), showed that the carbon atoms were present in five chemical states. The peak at 284.6 eV corresponds to carbon linked to hydrogen C-H or carbon C-C; at 285.66 eV to carbon linked to one oxygen C-O; at 288.8 eV to one carbonyl oxygen C=O and at 291.8 and 293.8 eV to CF

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref> shows the F 1s spectra, where it is evident that the typical symmetric peak of organic fluorine was present at 688.9 eV. The elements that act as a marker for silica nanoparticles are the Si 2p and O 1s signals. The intense peaks due to silica nanoparticles, in the spectra of Si 2p and O 1s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d,e</xref>), were at 102.2 and 532.3 respectively
