<p id="Par18" class="p">The durability of superhydrophobic coating is an issue that currently represents a hindrance for the technology transfer from laboratory to industrial applications. Therefore, different tests were performed to evaluate the resistance of the MPS-TEOS-POTS film in various environments. Corrosion testing was performed by immersing the films for 72 h in hydrochloric acid (pH = 2) and sodium hydroxide (pH = 14) solutions. The CA and SA were checked every 12 h. The CA and SA of the surface were still unchanged after 48 hours. However, after 48 hours soaking in acidic and alkaline solutions a slight lowering of CA and a raising for SA was observed. This change at 48 h was more evident for the sample in alkaline environment, for CA and SA until 150° and 3°, respectively Fig.
