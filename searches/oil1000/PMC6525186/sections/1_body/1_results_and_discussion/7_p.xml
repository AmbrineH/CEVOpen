<p id="Par14" class="p">Optical transmission measurements were performed to evaluate the optical clarity of the coatings obtained at different deposition times. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the UV-vis spectra of the MPS-TEOS-POTS films at different deposition times were compared with the UV-vis spectra of blank glass. Absorption was examined in the wavelengths 200–800 nm. From UV-vis spectra, in the visible light wavelength range, it was observed that for deposition at 5 minutes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> blue line), the uncoated glass transparency declined by just 10%. In the spectra, it is also possible to see how transparency drastically decreases with deposition time. At a deposition time of 10 minutes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> green line), the transparency was reduced by 50%. In addition, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, there is a constant decrease in transparency on raising the deposition time from 6 (pink line) to 7 minutes (orange line). The deposition at 5 min showed the best transparency property with a water contact angle of 165° and sliding angle lower than 1°, thus it was analysed in more detail.
