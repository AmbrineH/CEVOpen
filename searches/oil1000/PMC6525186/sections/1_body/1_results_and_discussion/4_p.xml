 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. showed how different deposition temperatures in AACVD allows for the formation of silica microparticles with various sizes. The silica microparticles surface were converted from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic with a posttreatment using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)

 </sup>. The fabrication process of the MPS-TEOS-POTS film consisted of using different deposition temperatures for each layer, in order to produce a micro and nano-roughness on the surface. The lower layer was formed using MPS nanoparticles deposited at 450 °C via AACVD of SOL-MPS, resulting in the formation of nanoparticles of &lt;100 nm, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b,g</xref>. The MPS nanoparticles assume a square shape, probably due to the presence of the methacrylate group in the MPS precursor. These nanocube particles, with size range at 20–100 nm, result in almost unaltered glass transparency. Comparison of the glass transparency is provided in SI, after deposition of SOL-MPS (SI Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2b</xref>) at 450 °C. The observed differences are likely due to changes in particle shape and size at 450 °C. The middle layer consisted of a silica nanoparticles layer deposited from SOL-TEOS at 350 °C. SEM images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>) and microscope image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2h</xref>), clearly show a structure with spherical silica particles arranged in microscopic clusters distributed across the surface. The particle sizes were concentrated in the 300 nm–1 µm range. These aggregates created a number of peaks and cavities thereby roughening the surface. Such structured surfaces has a maximum peak height of 2.17 µm (SI Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e,f,i</xref>, shows the morphology after the SOL-POTS deposition. This final layer grafted on the silica nanoparticles through covalent bonds that form via condensation and polymerization reactions between the SiOH of pre-hydrolysed POTS precursor and silanol groups present on the silica nanoparticles
