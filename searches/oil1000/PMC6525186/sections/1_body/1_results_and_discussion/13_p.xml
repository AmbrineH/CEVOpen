<p id="Par20" class="p">Mechanical durability is another important factor that affects the practical application of superhydrophobic materials, especially mechanical friction that leads to the damage of the surface micro/nano structure, resulting in the loss of superhydrophobicity. In this work, a sandpaper abrasion test was used to examine the surface mechanical durability of the MPS-TEOS-POTS film fabricated at 5 minutes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a</xref> shows detail of how this was carried out, and in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9b</xref>, the contact angles and sliding angles after 5, 10, 15 and 20 of abrasion cycles are shown. At 5 cycles, which is equivalent to 1 m in distance, the surface retained a contact angle of 150° and sliding angle around 3°. However, the CA reduced to 138° after 10 cycles and 120° after 15 cycles (3 m), which is an indication that the top layer was completely removed from the surface (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Increasing the cycles to 20, i.e. 4 m in distance, the contact angle went down to 90°, corresponding to the lower layer on the surface such that most of the middle layer has been removed. The SEM imagine (SI Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) showed the MPS-TEOS-POTS film after having been subjected to the abrasion test, the surface micro- and nanostructured has been removed by abrasion-induced. In order to overcome this problem, an adhesive layer between MPS-TEOS-POTS film and substrate could be used. The silica particles could be more stably fixed and linked to the glass substrate throughout a highly adhesive bottom layer. Incorporating new high mechanical stability precursors in coating could be another possible approach to mitigating this effect.
