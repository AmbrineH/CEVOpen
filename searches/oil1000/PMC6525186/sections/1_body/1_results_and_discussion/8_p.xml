<p id="Par15" class="p">The chemical composition of the MPS-TEOS-POTS coating was identified by FT-IR; EDS and XPS analysis. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the FT-IR spectra of the lower, middle and top layers within the wavenumber range of 400–3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In all FT-IR spectra, the bands from 400 to 1000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are characteristic for different modes of the Si–O vibrations. The peaks around 430–780 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> can be attributed to the rocking transverse and symmetric stretching of Si-O bonds respectively

 </sup>. The highest frequency band with the highest intensity at 1000–1070 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> corresponds to the asymmetrical stretching of Si-O-Si

 </sup>. In the FTIR spectra of the middle and top layer peaks at 961, 898 and 948 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, were observed which are likely due to Si-OH vibrations

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the lower layer, corresponds to –C=O of the methacrylate group of the MPS

 </sup>. The characteristic peaks at 1187 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1138 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are the stretching vibration absorptions of –CF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and CF
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> group in the top layer. It should be noted that the Si-O peaks in the top layer spectra are slightly broadened and this may be due to partial overlap of the C-F peak with the siloxane peaks

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> caused by the C-H stretch of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups were present in MPS and POTS precursors.
