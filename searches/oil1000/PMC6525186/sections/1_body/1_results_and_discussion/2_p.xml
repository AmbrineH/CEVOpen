<p id="Par9" class="p">In AACVD, the hydrolysis and condensation reactions take place mainly during the aerosol transport. The aerosol phase of the alkoxysilane precursors, once in the reactor, lose water and solvent via evaporation leaving micro/nano-particles in the gas phase

 </sup>. The precursors react and nucleate in the aerosol to form silicon dioxide particles. These silica particles move away from the immediate vicinity of the heated bottom plate and are attracted towards the colder top plate. This phenomenon, called the thermophoretic effect, allows the deposition of solid particles on the top glass substrate
