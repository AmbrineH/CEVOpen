<p id="Par25" class="p">The mechanical robustness testing indicated that the film retains superhydrophobicity after 5 cycles (1 m) after abrasion test. Meanwhile, the film also demonstrated excellent performance in self-cleaning testing. The procedure we have described ensures that the transparent superhydrophobic coating results from alkoxysilane
