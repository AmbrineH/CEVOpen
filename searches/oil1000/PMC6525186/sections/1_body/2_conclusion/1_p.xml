<p id="Par23" class="p">Transparent superhydrophobic film with hierarchical micro/nano-structured MPS-TEOS-POTS was prepared on glass substrates using aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition. To accomplish this combination of properties, a three layer assembly method was utilized to control the placement and level of aggregation of differently sized nanoparticles within the resultant multilayer thin film. The films demonstrated water droplet contact angles up to 168°, sliding angles less than 1° and excellent optical transmittance exceeding 90% in the visible range (400–760 nm). In order to obtain a micro/nano structure and transparent superhydrophobic surfaces from alkoxysilane precursor by using AACVD, deposition parameters and concentration of the solutions plays an important role.</p>
