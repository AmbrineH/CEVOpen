<p id="Par27" class="p">Precursors solutions were prepared, one for each precursor. The solutions were prepared by mixing alkoxysilane and deionized water with HCl as catalyst, absolute ethanol and methanol as solvent in a volume ratio 1:1. All precursors solutions were prepared with an alkoxysilane concentration of 0.9 M in absolute ethanol-methanol mixtures. Solution of 3methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (SOL-MPS) was prepared in a molar ratio 1:1.5 with a aqueous acidic solution of HCl 0.1 M; solution of tetraethylorthosilicate (SOL-TEOS) in a molar ratio 1:2 and solution of 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (SOL-POTS) in 1:1.5. In all solutions, processing was initiated by mixing the alkoxide and ethanol-methanol for 15 min. In the second step, aqueous HCl solution was added dropwise to the alkoxide/ethanol-methanol solution under constant stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 1 hour under atmospheric conditions, the solutions were used to prepare the films.</p>
