<p id="Par31" class="p">Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were recorded on a Bruker FT-IR Platinum ATR single reflection, over the range of 400 to 4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The samples for FT-IR characterization were prepared by removing the film from the substrate using a stainless steel knife. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific K-alpha photoelectron spectrometer with monochromatic Al-Kα source to identify the chemical state and constituents of the film. Ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy was conducted using a Shimadzu UV-VIS 2600 spectrophotometer. Water contact angles (CA) were measured with a FTÅ 1000 B Class instrument with a 7 µl water droplet used and the sliding angle (SA) measurement were performed using the tilted drop method with a water droplet volume of 15 µl and were measured with a Silverline digital angle level. It was tested at five different positions on each sample, and the average value was used.
