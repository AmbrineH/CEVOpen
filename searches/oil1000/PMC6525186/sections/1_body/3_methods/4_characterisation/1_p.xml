<p id="Par30" class="p">The surface morphologies of the sample were studied using a JEOL JSM-6301F field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). A thin layer of gold or carbon was sputtered onto the sample surfaces under vacuum to improve the electrical conductivity. Energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) was also carried out on the same machine and was used to obtain the chemical composition of the film. An optical Leica DM LM microscope was used for examination of the layers.</p>
