<p id="Par35" class="p">The self-cleaning properties were investigated by dispersing dye powders on the film surface, which were removed through water droplets being continuously dropped on the surface. The superhydrophobic glass was supported in a petri dish with a determined tilt angle. The dye powders, Congo red and Methyl red, were used to simulate contaminants or dusts on the surfaces. When the surface remained clear without contaminants, the film shows excellent superhydrophobic properties and low surface energy
