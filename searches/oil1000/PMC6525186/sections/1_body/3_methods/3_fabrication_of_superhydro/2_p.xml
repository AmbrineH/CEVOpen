 </sup>, and was carried out in a cold-walled horizontal CVD reactor. The CVD reactor consists of a quartz tube that enclosed a carbon block for heating, on which the bottom plate was placed and a top plate was positioned 8 mm above and parallel to the bottom plate. The aerosol was formed using a PIFCOHEALTH ultrasonic humidifier, operating at a frequency of 40 kHz and 25 W of power. A nitrogen gas flow, with a rate at 1 l/min, was used to move the aerosol from a cylindrical mixing chamber to the CVD reactor, and it was continued throughout the deposition time. The superhydrophobic films were deposited using 20 ml of the precursor solutions, previously described in section 2.2, for the three main parts of the film: lower, middle and top layers, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The multilayer MPS-TEOS-POTS film was created by depositing three layers, with the AACVD reactor, each at a different temperature but with a constant deposition time. First, the lower layer, in contact with the substrate, was obtained by depositing SOL-MPS at 450 °C. Then, the deposition of the middle layer was performed at 350 °C using SOL-TEOS. The top layer was deposited from SOL-POTS at 270 °C. Depositions were carried out for various durations 5 min, 6 min, 7 min and 10 min for each layer. Once all 3 layers were deposited, the film was cooled
