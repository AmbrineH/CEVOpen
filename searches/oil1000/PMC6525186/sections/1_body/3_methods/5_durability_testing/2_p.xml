<p id="Par33" class="p">In the UV resistance test, the samples were exposed to UV light (365 nm, 3.7 mW/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for 72 h at room temperature, the wavelength was chosen to be as close as possible to the common external UV irradiation. In order to determine the anticorrosion resistance of the film, the samples were immersed in alkali (NaOH) and acidic (HCl) aqueous solution (pH = 1 and 14) for 72 h, then rinsed until neutral with pure water and dried in air. To observe the effect of slightly polar organic solvent and of an apolar solvent, the surfaces were tested in two different kinds of solvents, ethanol and toluene respectively, for 5 hours. The heat thermal resistance was conducted in an oven, at 300 °C for 5 h and subsequently at 400 °C for a further 5 h to measure the samples resistance to prolonged thermal stress.
