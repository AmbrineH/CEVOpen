<p id="Par34" class="p">The mechanical robustness property of the as-prepared superhydrophobic film was demonstrated by sandpaper (Standard England sandpaper grit no. 240). A 40 × 30 mm sample was placed onto the sandpaper sheet, with the superhydrophobic film side into direct contact with the abrasive sheet. Then, a 100 gr weight was put on the middle of the sample and moved for 20 cm along the ruler. The sample was rotated by 90° (face to the sandpaper) and then moved for 20 cm along the ruler, thus ensuring the longitudinally and transversely abrasion of the surface.</p>
