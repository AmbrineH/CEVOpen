<p id="Par4" class="p">One of the key issues in the fabrication of a superhydrophobic surface is the competition between transparency and roughness. Indeed, roughness is an essential requirement for superhydrophobicity but it frequently causes light scattering, which can lead to opacity of the surface causing a lower transparency

 </sup>. To achieve higher transparency of the superhydrophobic films, surface roughness should be lower than the wavelength of visible light (&lt;400–760 nm)

 </sup>. Moreover, superhydrophobicity is also closely related to micrometer- and nanometer-scale roughness on the surface, which along with a low surface energy material leads to apparent CA &gt;150° and lower sliding angle (SA). Efficiency and effectiveness of dual scale roughness is demonstrated in nature, for example with superhydrophobic Lotus leaves
