<p id="Par6" class="p">In the present work, a novel multilayer transparent superhydrophobic coating was fabricated on a glass surface by using functional alkoxysilanes via aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). It was possible to obtain dual-scale roughness of silica nanoparticle films, through a three-layer deposition of hydrolysed acidic solutions of the following precursors: 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS). This multilayer film shows better transparency compared to superhydrophobic films created by AACVD and silica nanoparticles formed by hydrolysis of acidic solutions of TEOS

 </sup>. Therefore, the most appropriate parameters to obtain an aerosol from a solution of the alkoxysilanes was investigated in detail. The advantages of using three layers was exploited to optimize the water CA, creating dual-scale roughness nanocomposite silica films. In addition, different tests to evaluate the durability in various environments, UV-resistance, mechanical robustness and self-cleaning properties of the surface were studied.
