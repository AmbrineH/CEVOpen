<p id="Par3" class="p">In general, when a surface has a contact angle (CA) higher than 150° and a sliding angle (SA) lower than 10°, it can be defined as superhydrophobic

 </sup>. Generally increasing the water contact angle results in lower surface wettability. To explain the effect of roughness on the CA of a liquid droplet on a superhydrophobic surface, two models are used: the Wenzel model

 </sup> and the Cassie and Baxter model
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Wenzel’s theory assumes that liquid droplet fully penetrates the interstices on the rough surface. This therefore increases the available surface area that can be wetted by the liquid compared to a smooth surface. On the other hand, in the Cassie and Baxter model, the liquid droplet does not wet the whole surface, but lies on the peaks of the superficial roughness, leaving air trapped between the liquid and the surface. Either way, increasing the irregularity of the surface causes the CA of the liquid to increase. Thereby, a superhydrophobic surface increases its hydrophobicity with surface roughness.
