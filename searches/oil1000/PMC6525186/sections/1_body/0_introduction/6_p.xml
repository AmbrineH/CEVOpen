<p id="Par7" class="p">Thanks to the novel strategy adopted in this article, this multilayer silica coating exhibits higher level of transparency and superhydrophobicity by using AACVD compared to existing works. Colin R. 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. prepared silica microparticles films deposited using AACVD which showed extreme hydrophobicity, water contact around 180° but films appear white hazy

 </sup>. Zhuang A. 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. fabricated a robust superhydrophobic surface depositing epoxy resin and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).via AACVD. Such film was found to have transparency in the visible light of 80% but a WCA of 127.4°
