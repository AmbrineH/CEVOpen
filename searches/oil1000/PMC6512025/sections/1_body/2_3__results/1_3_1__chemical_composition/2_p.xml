<p class="p">The compounds were identified by HPLC and by the analysis of ultraviolet spectra of each peak. Caffeic acid (15 min) and rosmarinic acid (53.7 min) were identified in the EEB (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2</xref>). In the EEL, caffeic acid (15.1 min), p-coumaric acid (25.2 min), rosmarinic acid (53.7 min), quercetin (59.1 min), and luteolin (59.7 min) were identified (Figures
