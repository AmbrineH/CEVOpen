<p class="p">The results are expressed as the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value and maximal activity of both the extracts (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The EEB had IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> results similar to those of the antioxidant control, ascorbic acid, in both assays. Additionally, it presented superior results compared to the synthetic antioxidant BHT, requiring concentrations 1.3 and 2.2 times smaller to inhibit 50% of DPPH and ABTS free radicals, respectively. The EEL had IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> results similar to those of the BHT in both assays; however, it showed less activity than the standard antioxidant ascorbic acid.
