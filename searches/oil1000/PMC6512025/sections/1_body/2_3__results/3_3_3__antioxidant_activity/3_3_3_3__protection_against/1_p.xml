<p class="p">After assessing the hemolytic activity of extracts in human erythrocytes, the protective activity of EEB and EEL was observed in the erythrocytes subjected to oxidative hemolysis by AAPH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). At 120 and 180 min (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5(b)</xref>), the extracts exhibited protective action against oxidative hemolysis at the lowest concentrations of 10 to 100
