<p class="p">According to Morales et al. [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] different parameters of antimicrobial activity were considered: MIC &lt; 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, active; MIC 100–500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, moderate; MIC 500–1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, weak antimicrobial activity; and MIC &gt; 1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, inactive. Based on the adopted criteria, the EHEB showed good antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> and moderate activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. gattii</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> might have gained resistance to fluconazole, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> is intrinsically resistant to the same antifungal agent and is often isolated from opportunistic and invasive infections caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Therefore, a search for new techniques for the development of new antimicrobials is important to improve the treatment of infections. With respect to gram-positive bacteria, in the present study, the EAEL and HYEB showed good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> and moderate activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>.
