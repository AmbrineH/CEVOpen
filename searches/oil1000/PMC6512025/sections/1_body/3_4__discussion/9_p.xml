<p class="p">When evaluating the antioxidant properties of extracts in human erythrocytes, although the EEB and EEL at the highest concentrations induced high hemolysis rates, both promoted the reduction of AAPH-induced lipid peroxidation at lower doses and during the early evaluation times, protecting the erythrocytes from cell lysis. The peroxidation of the phospholipid membrane is induced by reactive species, especially oxygen and nitrogen species, causing cell lysis and death. Furthermore, a byproduct of this reaction is malondialdehyde [

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], which is a toxic product leading to the release of unsaturated fatty acids and the fragmentation of phospholipids, causing mutations and cellular rupture [

The EEB and EEL reduced the generation of malondialdehyde during the early evaluation times, contributing to the maintenance of a cellular structure, at low concentrations. Thus, protection against this type of cellular damage is considered a positive effect [
