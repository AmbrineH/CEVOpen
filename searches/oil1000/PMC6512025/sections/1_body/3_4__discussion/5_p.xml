<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity exhibited by the EEB and EEL of 
 <italic class="italic">O. minarum</italic> is probably due to the presence of sesquiterpenes: lanceolic acid, curcumen-12-oic acid, (+)-E-exo-abergamoten-12-oico acid, loliolide terpene lactone, and nor-sesquiterpene [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, present in EEB and EEL, have been associated with antimicrobial activity, as they can penetrate cellular phospholipid membranes due to their hydrophobicity [
