Microorganisms have several defense mechanisms; gram-positive cells have only one lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid layer, thus conferring a higher penetration sensitivity of antibiotic substances, whereas gram-negative cells have a double layer of lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid, hindering the passage of molecules into the bacterial cell [
