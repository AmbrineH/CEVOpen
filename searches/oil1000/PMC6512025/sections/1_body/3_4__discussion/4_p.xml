<p class="p">Bruni et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] showed the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea quixos</italic> flowers against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis</italic>. Gil et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] demonstrated that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea caudata</italic> leaves has antibacterial action against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. In the present study, the EEB and EEL of 
 <italic class="italic">O. minarum</italic> did not present active antibacterial action against gram-negative bacteria. This suggests that the extracts probably act on the cell wall and peptidoglycan bonds of gram-positive bacteria and do not have good activity against the gram-negative bacteria due to the presence of a double layer of lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid, conferring less sensitivity.
