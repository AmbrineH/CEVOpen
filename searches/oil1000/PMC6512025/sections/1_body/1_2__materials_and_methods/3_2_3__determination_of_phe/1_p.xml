<p class="p">The content of phenolic compounds was determined as described by Djeridane et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. To obtain 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the EEB and EEL at a concentration of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 1 mL of distilled water were added and incubated at ambient temperature for 1 min. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of 20% sodium carbonate was added to this solution and incubated for 2 h in the dark at ambient temperature. The absorbance was read at 760 nm. The concentration of phenolic compounds was calculated by preparing an analytical curve using gallic acid as standard at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. With the data, the linear regression was developed and the equation of line was obtained, with a linear correlation coefficient of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.997, slope 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = −0.018, and linear coefficient 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.0016. The results are expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent (mg/GAE) per gram of extract. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
