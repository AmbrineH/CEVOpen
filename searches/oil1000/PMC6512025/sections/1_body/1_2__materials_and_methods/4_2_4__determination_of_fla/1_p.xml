<p class="p">The content of flavonoids was determined by the method described by Lin and Tang [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Five hundred microliters of EEB and EEL at a concentration of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL was added to 1.5 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol, 0.1 mL of 10% aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), 0.1 mL of 1 M potassium acetate (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COOK), and 2.8 mL of deionized water. The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 40 min, and the absorbance was read using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 415 nm. To determine the concentration of flavonoids, an analytical curve was prepared using quercetin as standard at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, and the respective absorbance was read. With the obtained data, the linear regression and the equation of the line with 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.999, 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 0.0019, and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.0105 were obtained. The results are expressed as milligrams of quercetin equivalent (mg/QE) per gram of extract. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
