<p class="p">The tannins were quantified by the vanillin reaction according to the method of Broadhurst and Jones [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], adapted by Agostini-Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Five milliliters of freshly prepared vanillin reagent (vanillin-HCL-methanol, 4 : 10 : 86) was taken in a test tube and 1 mL of EEB or EEL, at a concentration of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, was added and agitated for 30 s. The reaction mixture was undisturbed for 15 min, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm. The quantification was done using an external calibration curve with catechin as standard, at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, and their absorbance was read, to obtain the equation of line with

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.998, 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 0.006, and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.0018. The results are expressed as milligrams of catechin equivalent (mg/CAE) per gram of extract. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
