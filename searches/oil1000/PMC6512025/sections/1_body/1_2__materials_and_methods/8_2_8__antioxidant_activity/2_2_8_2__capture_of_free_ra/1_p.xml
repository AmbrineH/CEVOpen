 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as positive controls. The stock solution of ABTS was prepared using potassium persulfate at 12–16 h prior to the experiment and maintained at ambient temperature, protected from light. The ABTS radical was diluted in ethanol PA until the absorbance reached 0.70 ± 0.05 at 734 nm and was incubated for 6 min with the extracts or controls at the concentrations used in the antioxidant assay. The volume of ABTS and extract used was 1980
