<p class="p">The extracts (final concentrations of 10-125 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) were preincubated with the erythrocyte solution at 37°C for 30 min. After this period, 0.9% NaCl solution or 50 mM AAPH solution was added to investigate whether the extracts promote hemolysis in erythrocytes or inhibit oxidative hemolysis, respectively. The samples were incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 4 h, and the mixture was homogenized steadily during this period. After 120, 180, and 240 min, the samples were removed, centrifuged at 1500 rpm/10 min, and then, the absorbance of the supernatant using a spectrophotometer (Quimis, Diadema, SP, Brazil) at 540 nm was read. The positive control ascorbic acid was maintained under the same conditions in assays. As a solvent control, the erythrocytes were incubated with ethanol at a final concentration of 0.4%. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicates. The percent of hemolysis was determined using formula
