<p class="p">A byproduct of lipid peroxidation, MDA, was measured to assess the ability of extracts to protect erythrocytes against oxidative stress. For this, the ascorbic acid or extracts (final concentrations of 10-125

After this period, the oxidizing agent AAPH, at 50 mM concentration, was added and the mixture was incubated for 4 h, under periodic agitation. After 120, 180, and 240 min, the samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and 500

The control was prepared by the mixture of TBA and 20 mM MDA solution. The samples were incubated in a water bath at 96°C for 45 min.
