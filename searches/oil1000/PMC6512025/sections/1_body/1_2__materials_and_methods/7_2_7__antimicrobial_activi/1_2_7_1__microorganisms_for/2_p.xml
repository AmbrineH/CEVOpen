<p class="p">To prepare the inoculum, the microorganisms were suspended in sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and adjusted using a spectrophotometer (Quimis, Diadema, SP, Brazil). 90% (±2) transmittance at 530 nm corresponding to a suspension of 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> UFC/mL concentration, for yeasts, and an absorbance of 0.110 (± 0.005) at 625 nm corresponding to a concentration of 1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> UFC/mL, for bacteria, were used.
