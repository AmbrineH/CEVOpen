<p class="p">The EEB, EEL, HYEB, HEEB, EAEB, HYEF, HEEL, and EAEL were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted (1 : 2) to concentrations of 1.9 and 1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. As a control, 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of culture medium and 50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of extracts were added to the wells of column 1 of a 96-well microplate. The amount of inoculum added to the plates was 10 and 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L for bacteria and yeasts, respectively. The culture medium used was RPMI-1640 for yeasts and Müller Hinton broth for bacteria. The microplates were incubated at 35°C for 48 h for 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> sp. and 72 h for 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodotorula</italic> sp. and at 37°C for 24 h for the bacteria. Fluconazole was used as a control antifungal agent and ampicillin as a control antibiotic. The experiments were performed in triplicate at three different times.
