<p class="p">Additionally, tropical and subtropical plant species are of increasing research interest, as they have diverse properties, such as potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In this context, the members of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic> stand out, which are among the most expressive of the family Lauraceae. Among these, approximately 300–400 species are found in the tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], and it has been estimated that 120–160 species are found in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] dispersed in the biomes of Atlantic Forest and Cerrado [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Studies on species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic> have demonstrated several biological activities, such as antimicrobial [
