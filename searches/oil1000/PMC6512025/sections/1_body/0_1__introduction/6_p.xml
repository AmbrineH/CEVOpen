<p class="p">Among the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic>, the species 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea minarum</italic> (Nees &amp; Mart) Mez., a medium-sized tree, popularly known as “canelinha” or “canela vassoura” [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], contains aporphine alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], indole alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, biflavonoids, bis-lignans, alkyl benzene, steroids, sesquiterpenes, nor-sesquiterpenes, and terpene lactone [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, studies on the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of 
 <italic class="italic">O. minarum</italic> are limited. Thus, the objective of the present study was to (1) determine the phytochemical profile, (2) evaluate the antifungal activity, and (3) for the first time, evaluate the antibacterial activity and antioxidant potential of 
 <italic class="italic">O. minarum</italic> bark and leaf extracts.
