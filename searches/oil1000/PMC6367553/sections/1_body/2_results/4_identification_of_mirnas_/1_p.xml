<p class="p">To identify miRNAs, the clean sequence tags were aligned to all plant miRNA mature sequences deposited in miRBase 21.0. The averages of 135,670 and 89,524 redundant reads of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit were matched to the currently known miRNA sequences, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In total, 1,231 miRNAs, which belong to 42 families, were obtained from sequencing in two libraries (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S3</xref>). Among the 42 families, miR156 was the largest represented with 284 members, followed by miR167 and miR160 with 156 and 108 members, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S3</xref>). Five miRNA families (miR168, miR159, miR166, miR396, miR858) were represented with the top read abundance above 10, 000 in all libraries (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S3</xref>). In addition, the miRNA sequences which met the threshold of the miRDeep2 analysis but did not have any known homologous miRNA gene families in miRBase were further analyzed to predict novel miRNAs in the flower and fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic>. The miRNAs which met the total score of &gt; 0 were considered to be true novel miRNAs. A total of 147 novel mature miRNA sequences belonging to 23 miRNA families were identified in flower and fruit (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S4</xref>).
