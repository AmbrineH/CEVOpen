<p class="p">SEM was used to investigate the morphological features of the internal cellular structure of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> seeds. The results of the SEM observations confirmed that oil grains existed in 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> seeds (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>C), while the fresh 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit and seeds are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>A and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>B, respectively.
