<p class="p">In order to obtain the comprehensive profiles of miRNAs in 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit, two small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced. Average totals of 13,461,290 and 12,824,110 raw reads were generated from 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S2</xref>). After removing low quality reads and adaptors, totals of 13, 459,418 and 12,823,613 clean reads were obtained from flower and fruit groups, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S2</xref>). The clean reads were used for analysing the distribution of 18 to 40 nt length small RNAs and the majority of small RNAs were 21 to 24 nt in length, producing similar length distributions in both sample types. The most abundant sRNAs were 21 (27.35%) and 24nt (22.95%) lengths in flower and 22 (13.03%) and 24nt (40.32%) lengths in fruit, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). These clean reads were further annotated by Bowtie; 7,948,865 and 3, 854,767 mapped small RNA tags were obtained in 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit, respectively, and were classified into miRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs and others by Blasting with Rfam and miRBase (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
