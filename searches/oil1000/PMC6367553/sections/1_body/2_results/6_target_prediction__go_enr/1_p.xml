 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S6</xref>). To further investigate the potential functions of these miRNA target genes, we applied gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses to categorize the miRNA targets. The miRNA target genes were categorized according to biological process, cellular component and molecular function by GO-based enrichment analysis. A total of 358 potential miRNA targets were classified into 143 biological processes, 29 cellular components and 41 molecular functions (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S7</xref>). Some of the significant biological processes with the highest annotation numbers were: cellular response to stimulus (GO:0051716), developmental process (GO:0032502), single-organism developmental process (GO:00447670), signaling (GO:0023052), system development (GO:0048731), response to organic substances (GO:0010033), and developmental processes involved in reproduction (GO:0003006) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S7</xref>). The common cellular component terms were: macromolecular complex (GO:0032991) and protein complex (GO:0043234) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S7</xref>). Active transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0022804), lipid binding (GO:0008289), hormone binding (GO:0042562), and mismatched DNA binding (GO:0030983) were among the most abundant classes in the molecular function category (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S7</xref>). GO terms were submitted to enrichment analysis by the agriGO tool 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>. Among the GO terms related to biological processes, the results showed that several target genes were involved in organism development and signaling pathways (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>A). In the cellular component category, the target genes were mainly related to chromosomal behavior in the nucleus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>B). In molecular function, the majority of the target gene functions were related to transmembrane transporter activity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>C).
