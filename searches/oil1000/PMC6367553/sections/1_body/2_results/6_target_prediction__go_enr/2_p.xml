<p class="p">KEGG is a major public database for Pathway Mapping; the most important biochemical metabolic and signal transduction pathways of differentially expressed genes participation were determined by Pathway significant enrichment. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 112 pathways including 109 genes were obtained involving metabolic pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, RNA transport, starch and sucrose metabolism, RNA degradation, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, lipid metabolism and fructose and mannose metabolism (Table

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>. The plant hormone signal transduction pathway was represented by 4 genes and contained auxin-, cytokinine- and gibberellin- inducible via flower developed to fruit (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). For example, tryptophan metabolism was involved in the pathway, contributes to auxin synthesis, enriched transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and auxin response factor (ARF). These genes were regulated by the miR393 and miR160 families, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). Arabidopsis histidine kinase 2/3/4 (CRE1) was enriched to zeatin biosynthesis associated with cytokine synthesis, and the gene was targeted by ath-miR858a (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>A). Similarly, DELLA protein (DELLA) was enriched to gibberellin biosynthesis associated with cysteine and methionine metabolism, and the gene was targeted by gma-miR171k-5p and osa-miR171c-5p. The photosynthesis pathway was represented by 1 gene and involved in photosynthetic electron transport inducible via flower developed to fruit, and contained ferredoxin (PetF) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>B).
