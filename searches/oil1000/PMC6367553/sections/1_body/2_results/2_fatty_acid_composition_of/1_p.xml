 <italic class="italic"> Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit, which was a light yellow liquid at room temperature, was determined to be 21.54%. The results of the analysis of the fatty acid composition of camellia oil by GC-MS (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>) show that the highest fatty acid proportion consisted of oleic acid (76.91±0.33%), followed by palmitic acid (10.33±0.08%), linoleic acid (9.08±0.34%), and finally stearic acid (0.51±0.08%).
