<p class="p">To validate the data obtained from the high-throughput sequencing, we randomly selected six miRNAs (ahy-miR156a, ath-miR858a, stu-miR384-5p, lus-miR394a, ath-miR168a-5p, hbr-miR156) and their corresponding target genes (CL7673.Contig1_All, Unigene31238_All, CL2703.Contig3_All, CL2703.Contig1_All, Unigene62526_All, CL15005.Contig2_All). For this purpose, we determined the expression levels between
 <italic class="italic"> Camellia oleifera</italic> flower and fruit using log2 fold change (2
 <sup class="sup">-∆∆Ct</sup>) values with three technical and three biological replicates. The expression results showed that miRNAs were both up-regulated (ahy-miR156a, ath-miR858a, stu-miR384-5p, lus-miR394a) and down-regulated (ath-miR168a-5p, hbr-miR156) in the qRT-PCR analysis, which were similar to the deep sequencing data results (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>A). Similarly, the RT-PCR up-regulated and down-regulated results of the miRNAs corresponding target genes were consistent with the prediction (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>B).
