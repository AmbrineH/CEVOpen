<p class="p">A total of 797 miRNAs belonging to two libraries were significantly differently expressed based on fold change (≥1 or ≤-1) and P-value (&lt;0.05) criteria (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S5</xref>); among them, 388 miRNAs were up-regulated and 409 miRNAs were down-regulated. We evaluated the miRNA distribution among two libraries and determined that 751 miRNAs were commonly expressed in flower and fruit libraries (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). The results of comparing the specifically expressed miRNAs showed that 24 miRNAs were expressed only in flower and 22 miRNAs were expressed only in fruit, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0" class="xref">S5</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>).
