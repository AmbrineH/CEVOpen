<p class="p">Total RNAs were isolated from flower and fruit tissues of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> using TRlzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of the RNA was checked using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo, MA, USA) system. The concentration of the RNA was measured using a Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the RNA samples was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA isolation was carried out individually for each sample with three biological replicates, and then the purified RNAs were used to construct small RNA libraries according to Illumina recommendation and high-throughput sequencing using the Hiseq2500 platform.
