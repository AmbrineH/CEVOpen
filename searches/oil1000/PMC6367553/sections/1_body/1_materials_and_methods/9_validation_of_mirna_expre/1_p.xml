<p class="p">Total RNA was isolated from CBMCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNA with Reverse Transcriptase M-MLV (RNase H-, Takara Bio Inc.) and then quantified on a Step OnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) using SYBR Green qPCR Super-Mix-UDG with Rox (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was conducted at 95˚C for 5 min, followed by incubations at 95˚C for 15 sec, and 60˚C for 31 sec repeated for 40 cycles. Each PCR analysis was repeated at least three times. The relative expression level of each miRNA was normalized against EF1a2 expression levels. The fold-change was calculated according to the 2
 <sup class="sup">-ΔΔCT</sup> method. The qRT-PCR primers are listed in the file (Table
