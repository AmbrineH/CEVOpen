<p class="p">In order to determine the fatty acid composition of the camellia oil, the fatty acids were first converted to methyl esters 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>. For this procedure, 200mg of camellia oil in a tube were dissolved by 20 ml sodium hydroxide-methanol solution (0.5 mol/L), shaken, and immersed in a 60°C water bath for 30 min. After this, 50ml of n-hexane were added, mixed well, and left to stand for a while. After the solution stratified, the upper layer of solution was removed and stored at 4°C until needed for further analysis.
