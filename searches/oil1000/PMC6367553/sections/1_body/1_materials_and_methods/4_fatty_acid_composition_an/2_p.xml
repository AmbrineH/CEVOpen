<p class="p">The fatty acid composition analysis of camellia oil was determined by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) using the above methylated samples. An HP-5 capillary GC column (30m×0.25mm×0.25µm) was used in a GC equipped with an MS detector (Shimadzu, QP2010S), with an inlet temperature of 250°C. The injection volume was set at 1 µL, and the split ratio was 20:1. High purity helium was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was set at 1.0 mL·min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, the oven temperature of the instrument was raised from 180°C (held for 5 min) to 230°C (held 15min) at 3°C·min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization energy system with ionization energy of 70 eV was used. The electron ionization energy system temperature was 230°C, the temperature of the quadrupole rod was 150°C, and the transmission line temperature was 280°C. The mass range of the quadrupole mass spectrometer was scanned over the range 30-450 amu, with a solvent delay of 3min.
