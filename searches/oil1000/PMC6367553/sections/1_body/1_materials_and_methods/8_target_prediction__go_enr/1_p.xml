<p class="p">Significantly expressed conserved and novel miRNAs were used for target prediction using the psRNA Target server by psRobot_tar in psRobot
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used on the target gene candidates of differentially expressed miRNAs (“target gene candidates” in the following). GOseq based Wallenius non-central hyper-geometric distribution 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, which could adjust for gene length bias, was implemented for GO enrichment analysis. KEGG 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref> is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems, such as cells, organisms and ecosystems, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref> software to test the statistical enrichment of the target gene candidates in KEGG pathways.
