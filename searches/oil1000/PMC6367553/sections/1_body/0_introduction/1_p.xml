 <italic class="italic">Theaceae</italic>, which originated in China 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>. As an important woody oil plant, edible oil can be obtained (camellia oil) from 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> seeds. Approximately 95% of the global production of camellia oil comes from China, about half of which comes from Hunan Province 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>. Camellia oil has medicinal and food value 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, and contains a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (including oleic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid) and the lowest level of saturated fatty acids. Its fatty acid composition is similar to that of olive oil, thus it is often referred to as “Oriental olive oil” 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>. Xianglin No.210 is an excellent 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia</italic> clonal plant widely planted in Hunan Province. It has the characteristics of drought resistance, barren resistance, and high resistance to various pest diseases and high yield performance, as the oil rate of its dry seeds can reach over 35% 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>. The flowering period is moderate in length, usually from October to late December. The fruit enlargement period is mainly from July to September, but the fully matured fruiting stage will be extended to October. The fat content accumulation generally starts from July until the fruit fully matures
