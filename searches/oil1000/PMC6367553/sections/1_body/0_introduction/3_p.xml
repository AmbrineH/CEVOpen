<p class="p">In recent years, molecular methods have been used to study the growth and development, metabolism regulation and resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic>. However, the basic molecular research on 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> is weak and poorly understood, especially for the molecular mechanisms which determine the yield and quality of camellia oil and growth traits of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic>, which certainly hinders the sustainable development of the camellia oil industry. In order to explore the potential role of miRNAs in the synthesis and storage of important nutrients during the development of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit, miRNA expression profiles of flower and fruit samples were investigated using high throughput next generation small RNA sequencing technology. This permits the unraveling of the differentially expressed miRNAs to help understand their involvement in the regulation of the synthesis and storage of important nutrients in fruit.
