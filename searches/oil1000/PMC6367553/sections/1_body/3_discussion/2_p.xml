<p class="p">In this study, we observed differentially expressed miRNA in the fruit and flower of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> by using high-throughput RNA sequencing. We found 42 families of known miRNAs and 23 families of novel miRNAs, respectively. Among the 65 families, the most highly expressing miRNAs were miR168, miR166, miR396, miR157, miR156, miR390 and so on, which were similar to the high expression miRNA of flowers and fruits in 
 <italic class="italic">Camelina sativa</italic>
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>. The results of comparing the differentially expressed miRNAs showed that 751 miRNAs were overlapped between fruit and flower miRNAs, such as miR168, miR160, miR396, miR164, miR156, miR393, miR858, and those were similar to the overlaps of 
 <italic class="italic">Camelina sativa</italic>
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>.
