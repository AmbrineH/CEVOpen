 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> is one of the most important woody oil species in China and has very high economic value 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>. The fruit is the main source of the economic benefits of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic>, and how to achieve high yield, quality and efficiency of the species and its fruit has become an important research area 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>. The fruit is a plant reproductive organ that develops from the ovary or other parts of the flower (such as receptacle, calyx, etc.) by pistils after pollination fertilization 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>. The growth and development of fruit include the whole process from fertilization to fruit growth, maturation and senescence, and it is also the process of continuously accumulating and transforming nutrients and fruit morphogenesis construction 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>. During the fruit growth and development process, the accumulation of nutrients mainly includes carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, most of which are transported by other organs of the plant, such as roots and leaves, while carbohydrate metabolism is the basis of regulation in its process

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>. During the early stages of 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia oleifera</italic> fruit development, carbohydrates come from the photosynthesis of leaves and fruits
