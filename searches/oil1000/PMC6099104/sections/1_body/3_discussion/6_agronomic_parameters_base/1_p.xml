<p class="p">At the same time, the database also covers data related to different agronomic parameters based and provide an option to the user to see either in tabular or graphical forms. For example, in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> Gomti variety, the database covers five observation readings revealing variations in Z-Linalool oxide compound percentage ranges from 2.2 to 2.7% from January to May 2015. This data suggest that the highest yield of Z-Linalool oxide was 2.7 February. Likewise, the user can see other parameter based graph plot analysis and get benefited from future cultivation, for example, if the user sees the Himalaya variety of 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic>, there are five readings based on the age of the plant (in days) and menthol compound yield percentage. This data showed that the study was performed for 30 days old plants to 150 days old plant (menthol mint) and menthol yield ranges from 70.66 to 82.18%. Graphical analysis revealed that highest yield obtained at 120 days old plant (
