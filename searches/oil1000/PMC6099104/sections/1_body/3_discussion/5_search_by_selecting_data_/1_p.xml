<p class="p">Similarly, naive users can directly see and select the interesting data through search menu buttons provided at the end of the home page of aroma database and the further user may browse more information without wasting time on thinking about aroma (fragrance), aroma molecules name, essential oils, plant varieties, and plants. This type of search display option will help the fresh researchers, scholars, and students. For example, a new user can directly browse the home page header menu field “Plants,” which will display the list of all aromatic plants with their common and scientific names and a number of their available plant varieties or highly yielding chemotypes. Users can see more details of these plants by clicking on the button “View Detail.” For example, if the user wishes to search for Menthol mint plant (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha arvensis</italic>), which included at present 11 mint plant varieties or chemotypes based on different aroma molecules constituent’s ratio variations. Users can see more details such as brief introduction, family, localization, uses, essential oils types, and the name of 11 mint varieties used by Indian growers or farmers. Users have the option to print or save this data. In this page, users have two options to see further details; (i) essential oil types and (ii) variety details. For example, if the user searches for 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> MAS-1 essential oil details, database will display brief introduction, major constituent Menthol with 84% with multiple minor components such as Menthone (5.8%), etc., comparative graph plot showing percentage ratio of different chemical constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. arvensis</italic> MAS-1 essential oil (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>
 </bold>), and the Indian scientists or researchers contribution, if any, showed in the references. Users have the option to print (or save) this data and graph plot. Also, the user can directly move to see details of major or minor compounds and yield percentage by simply enter on the name of compounds.
