<p class="p">Users can search and download interested aroma molecules (2D and 3D chemical structures) through structure search option. In this option, users can draw or edit any structure of their interest and convert it to SMILES and MOL file format and subsequently search whole AromaDb database aroma molecules and resulted most similar matched structures available in the database and can easily see details of these matched small molecules or free downloads the structures. For example, if the user draws the phenyl ring in the JME editor and enter the option either “get SMILES” or get MOL file’ resulted in SMILES or MOL file data would be shown on the other side of JME editor and subsequently enter the key similarity search within database, results of matched structures showed in the new web page, with no exact match aroma molecule found, and enlisted the similar matched compounds, e.g., (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-cinnamyl acetate, 1,1-diisobutoxy-2-phenylethane, 1,1-dimethoxy-2-benzylideneheptane, etc. All these matched structures have phenyl ring in common. Moreover, the user can see further details of each matched compound by entering key on “details” button. Details of aroma compound include calculated properties related to aroma molecule identification, hazards, physical and chemical properties, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicological information, and ecological information. The database also represents the 2D structure, 3D structure visualization in 3D structure viewer window with spin-on/off option so that to see the structural conformations quickly with free download option. The compounds search outputs are oriented to explore the matched compounds by following the “details” hyperlink to the table of physical, ADMET and safety properties described earlier.
