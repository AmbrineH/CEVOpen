<p class="p">The AromaDb database would be helpful to answers the queries of researchers, industries, and growers related to aroma compounds and essential oils. However, a variety of database resources of, essential oils, scent, fragrance and flavor (synthetic) components are already reported but still limited at some extent focused on certain subgroups, for example, SuperScent (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dunkel et al., 2009</xref>), OdorDB, Pherobase, EssOilDB (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>); ScentBase
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, AroChemBase
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, and Flavornet
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Consequently, these databases are good but useful for special purposes, and therefor there is a need for a comprehensive listing of commercially important volatile aroma molecules found in plant’s essential oils from different local and globally grown aromatic plants with information of chemotype-specific varieties, type of fragrance (aroma), physicochemical properties of aroma molecule, chemical identification, chemical structures (2D &amp; 3D) for free downloads, Pharmacokinetic properties (ADMET), effect of aroma on human genes, their vapor pressure and logP,” and export and import trade data trends in terms of global demand and business turnover in India and abroad, so that to guide the future research directions for researchers, growers, farmers, and industries.
