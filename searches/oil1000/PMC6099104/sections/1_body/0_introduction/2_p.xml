<p class="p">Aroma is a mixture of volatile compounds with a molecular weight &lt;300 and high vapor pressure, but the complete group of volatile compounds comprises thousands of inorganic and organic compounds stemming from major pathways of secondary metabolism (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frauendorfer and Schieberle, 2006</xref>). There are three significant pathways which involved in the biosynthesis process of the main aroma components in plants, such as the shikimic acid pathway by which eugenol (cloves) biosynthesized, degradation of lipids for the formation of short-chain alcohols and aldehydes and terpenoid pathway by which geraniol (Rose) and menthol (Peppermint) are synthesized. These aroma molecules act as semiochemical (mixture or chemical that carries a message for the purpose of communication), pheromones, defense mechanism, allow animals to recognize and detect individuals. The pheromone aroma molecules are essential for mating choices, sexual behavior, fertilization, and nursing and to warn kin in situations of danger (alarm pheromones) and to defend against predators. Aroma molecules are also involved in communication and interaction like plant–plant interaction (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heil and Silva Bueno, 2007</xref>). Aroma compounds can also be found in food, spices, perfumes, wine, fragrance oils, and essential oils. These molecules form biochemically during ripening of fruits and other crops. Aroma fragrance molecules are of great commercial interest, resulting in many applications of volatile aroma molecules in research, health, food, cosmetic, and health industries.
