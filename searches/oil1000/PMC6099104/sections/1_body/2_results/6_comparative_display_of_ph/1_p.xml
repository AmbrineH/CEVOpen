<p class="p">The database features the properties related to aroma molecule, hazard identification, exposure controls and personal protection, physical and chemical properties, toxicological and ecological information. Compound identification properties include chemical name, IUPAC name and chemical class. Hazards identification includes properties related to physical hazards, health hazards such as skin corrosion and ocular irritancy property. Toxicological properties such as irritation, absorption level, aqueous solubility level, LogP (octanol/water partition coefficient), polar surface area (PSA), and blood–brain barrier level indicate the precautionary properties related to exposure controls and personal protection (eye/face protection, skin protection, respiratory protection, and thermal hazards). Physical and chemical properties indicated by molecular weight, molecular formula, fragrance type, LogP (

Toxicological information includes properties related to information on likely routes of exposure such as inhalation, skin contact, eye contact, ingestion, symptoms related to the physical, chemical and toxicological characteristics, information on toxicological effects, e.g., acute toxicity (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> – dermal/oral, rabbit/rat, mg/kg), skin corrosion/irritation, serious eye damage/eye irritation, respiratory or skin sensitization, germ cell mutagenicity (genotoxic), carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, specific target organ toxicity (single exposure/repeated exposure), and aspiration hazard. However, the ecological information includes properties related to eco-toxicity (environmentally hazardous), persistence, and degradability. Since these aroma molecules used in aroma based natural therapy (aromatherapy) in traditional herbal medicine system of India (Ayurveda and Unani) and other East Asian countries, therefore, database covered properties related to pharmacokinetics such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). These properties indicate drug-likeness properties, ADME compliance, and toxicity risk assessment data. Moreover, the database also includes information related to the molecular interaction of aroma molecules/essential oils with human proteins (genes) directly or indirectly affecting the metabolic processes and therefore causing their useful biological activity or responses. This information is supported with cross-references or proper evidence based on reported publications and therefore offer a possibility for biological interpretation of these aroma molecules. Moreover, an investigation of medical effects is also possible by browsing the “biological activity” field for each essential oils/aroma molecules. The comparative trends or pattern plots shows the emitted aroma compounds of the chosen species compared with all other plants species, which emit these compounds. The comparative data analysis through graph plots shows the unique pattern of aroma molecules (fingerprints), essential oil, yield, major constituent percentage (chemotype), trade analysis trend, and others based on changes in different agro-morphological parameters, e.g., soil type, stress conditions, temperature, weather type, months wise oil yield, etc., which are important feature for distinguishing between more or less useful features/parameters during agriculture practices and/or cultivation by farmers, or industrial growers. As an example, a snapshot represents these calculated properties of aroma showing molecule, chemical identification, description and 3D structure for download snapshot represented in the given figure (
