<p class="p">The secondary information, which was derived from the plant essential oil (primary information) includes the essential oil description details, chemical constituents, major minor compound details, content percentage, and exportâ€“import essential oil trade data. The tertiary information is further derived from secondary information which comprises detailed information about the essential oil compounds as followed: IUPAC name, Chemical class biochemical classes (e.g., terpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds: phenols, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, lactones, coumarins, ethers, and oxides), Fragrance type, Physical and chemical properties, Absorption and Metabolism information, Toxicological information, Ecological information, Hazards information, and compound bioactivity data for therapeutic use or drug formulation development. This information provides the user a comprehensive aroma molecules database, together with substantial options, such as chemical compounds search based on structural similarity using compound Canonical SMILES within databases.
