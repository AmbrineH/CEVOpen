<p class="p">The AromaDb database provides the diverse and commercially important aroma molecules, fragrance types, essential oils, aromatic plants, trade data, and other industrially important information as required while formulating any herbal product formulation for human uses. We have incorporated various tools for making the database easy and more convenient for users. The database contents could be accessible with different search tools, options, e.g., simple and advance search tools. The simple search tool is powered by Google search engine, which search data from within the AromaDb database and also from public databases, where another mining tool search the query within the database, the Advance search tool option further divided into two types: (i) search based on structural similarity (within AromaDb database) and (ii) search based on structural physicochemical and pharmacokinetics (ADMET) properties. The database search fields enable the user to look for compounds using physicochemical properties, plants, varieties, chemotype, essential oil, aroma molecules, chemical classification, biological activity, etc. Database allows the user to choose certain functional groups, species or range of molecular weights, which search whole entries and retrieve the user required results. To mine the database user require a 2D molecular structure or structure canonical SMILES code (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) or a MOL-file of interested aroma compounds. Structure drawing/editing option is provided in the AromaDb database with the help of JSME (JavaScript Molecular Editor; JSME Homepage
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn010" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>). With the help of JSME user can draw either full structure or part of it. The most similar database entries are listed in the order of structural similarity. For each compound, details of plant, plant name, variety, essential oil constituents, chemical class, ADMET properties, 2D/3D chemical structures, trade data, and the SMILES based similarity search percentage are presented. Furthermore, a similarity search to find the most similar compounds analogs are provided. Additionally, similar information can be viewed separately by accessing database header fields or the menu.
