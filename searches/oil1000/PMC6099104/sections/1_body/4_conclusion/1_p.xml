<p class="p">The AromaDb database is a useful tool to retrieve information about aroma molecules, aroma or fragrance types, essential oils, plants varieties, bioactivity of essential oils or aroma molecules, toxicological and ecological data, and trade data. The database provides, 3D structures of aroma compounds for free downloads and option to see the essential oil yields or constituents percentage variation trends at different agro-morphological conditions during plant growth. The included data on aroma molecules along with a focus on associated plants and their essential oils chemotype (varieties) will enable systematic experimental approaches on the relation between structural similarities, essential oils, and aroma (fragrance) type and aroma chemical classes. Besides, last 18 years global export and import trade data of plants essential oils will educate the growers or farmers to prioritize the cultivation of aromatic plants based on expected global demand. Furthermore, structure comparisons of self-edited molecules with the database aroma molecules as well as the external database may allow a first rough estimation of the potential aroma of new chemicals. The AromaDb database is a free resource with embedded screening functions for aroma molecule based on molecular weight, plants, varieties, essential oils, fragrance or aroma type, toxicological and ecological information (allergic or toxic responses).</p>
