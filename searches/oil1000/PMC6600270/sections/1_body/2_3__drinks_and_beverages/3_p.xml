 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], who used MDGC-MS and GC-MS/O to determine odour-active trace compounds, as well as the off-odorants responsible for sweaty smell and a possible metabolic pathway for their formation. The authors reported having found the compounds 5-vinylguaiacol (phenolic, banana-like, sweet), 3-phenylpropionic acid (honey-like), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione (pungent, warming, musty, mouldy), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-4-methyl-3-hexenoic acid and its (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>) isomer (sweaty), for the first time in the sample. The cyclic diketone was formed through thermal degradation of monosaccharides in alkaline conditions. The last two compounds may be derived from L-isoleucine and sugars, via Maillard reaction.
