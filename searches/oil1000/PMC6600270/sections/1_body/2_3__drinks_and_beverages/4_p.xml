 <xref rid="B89-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] studied the aroma composition of coffee (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) and different alcoholic beverages, such as wine, spirits and cachaça, applying different GC×GC and MDGC approaches, including integrated systems permitting MDGC and GC×GC and olfactometry in the same system (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Heart-cutting strongly overlapped regions from the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D column to a high resolution 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column allowed easier correlation of olfactometry and MS data. Banana Terra spirits were investigated for the first time by the authors, who identified 18 aroma-impact regions, and the main odorants found were 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol acetate, 2-phenylethylacetate and phenylethyl alcohol [
