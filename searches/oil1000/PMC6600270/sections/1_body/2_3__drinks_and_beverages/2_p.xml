Although no new compounds were identified after the sample storage, they observed a decrease in concentration of many terpenes and some inversions in the enantiomeric configuration for compounds, such as (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-(−)-linalool to (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-(+)-linalool and (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>)-(−)-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol to (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>)-(+)-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol, which can be an explanation for the sensorial differences perceived between the fresh and aged samples.
