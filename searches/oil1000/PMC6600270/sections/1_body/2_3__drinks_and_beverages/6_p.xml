 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] developed a MDGC method to identify and quantify four impact esters odorants in wine, brandy and whiskey samples. The method enabled assessment of the levels and olfactory impact of these compounds in different beverages, which may be related to the sweet fruit notes in some samples and can be formed by a slow esterification during the aging process of wines.
