 <xref rid="B128-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>] developed a method to identify neutral aroma components in tobacco leaves, using a GCÃ—GC-TOFMS system. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>] used the same method to investigate the distribution of 28 neutral aroma components in flue-cured tobacco leaves and classified them into five categories, according to their formation reaction. Ochiai et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>] identified and quantified sulfur compounds in smoke extract, many of which are usually present in trace quantities in several matrices though have a high odour impact. Using a MDGC system equipped with a quadrupole time-of-flight MS (qTOFMS) and a sulfur chemiluminescence detector (SCD), they successfully identified 30 compounds that were present at nanogram levels in the smoke.
