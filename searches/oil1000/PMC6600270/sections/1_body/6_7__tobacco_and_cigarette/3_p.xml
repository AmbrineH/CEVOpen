<p class="p">Gordon et al. [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>] used a MDGC approach to analyse the alkaloid-free essential oil of flue-cured tobacco leaves. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D separation of about 60 min gave a relatively poor overall precolumn separation. A total of 23 heartcuts—each of about 2–4 min—analysed on the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column, revealed a series of chromatograms comprising a multitude of peaks, with maybe 1500 compounds observed. The authors identified a total of 360 compounds, of which 80 were reported for the first time in the sample.
