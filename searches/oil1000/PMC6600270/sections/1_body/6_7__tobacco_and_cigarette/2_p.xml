<p class="p">Tobacco is a widely studied complex matrix, not only because of the smoking by-products but also because of potential bioactive—e.g., nitrogenous—compounds. The volatile and semi-volatile aroma compounds in tobacco can be divided into three groups: acidic (represented by carboxylic and fatty acids), basic (typically N-containing compounds) and neutral (mainly constituted by free or conjugated aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, alkenes, esters and lactones). They can be present in both the flue-cured tobacco leaves and its smoke and there are some studies applying MDGC and GC×GC to better identify these analytes [
