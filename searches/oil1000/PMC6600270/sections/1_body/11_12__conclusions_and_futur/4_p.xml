<p class="p">Another potential application is in the clinical diagnostics of diseases through their odour signatures and biomarkers. There are some technological e-nose devices that have already been studied for this purpose, which could help in the detection of a range of illnesses, from pneumonia to lung cancer, in a fast, non-invasive and inexpensive way, as discussed by Friedrich [
 <xref rid="B172-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. The use of new detectors, such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and barrier discharge ionisation (BID) and post-column reaction with FID, coupled to gas chromatography techniques await evaluation for their role on improving identification for flavours and aromas. Similarly, newer commercial phases such as ionic liquids, have been little used in flavour analysis for MDGC and GCÃ—GC, and limited in general 1D analysis of these samples, so cannot be fully evaluated here. Improved multidimensional methods are also important in the identification and quantification of allergens, skin sensitisers and toxic compounds present in trace amounts in fragranced products, as well as the study of their interaction with the body.
