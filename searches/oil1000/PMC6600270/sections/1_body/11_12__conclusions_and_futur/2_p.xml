<p class="p">Not surprisingly, many different matrices related to aroma and flavour samples and their chemical composition are fertile areas for these techniques, primarily due to the many compounds of similar structures in the complex suite of analytes. This means compound overlap is very common in samples when using a 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D GC separation. MDGC and GC×GC address these shortcomings. Since minor compound abundances are often of interest, this also demands improved separation. These techniques make possible, not only the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the analytes, but also GC×GC offers a simpler approach to fingerprint pattern recognition since it may be based on a 2D ‘picture’ representation, which is useful to distinguish the type, origin, variety and other intrinsic characteristics of the samples. Moreover, discovering new odorants, as well as enantiomeric separation and enantiomer ratio determination are supported by these methodologies.
