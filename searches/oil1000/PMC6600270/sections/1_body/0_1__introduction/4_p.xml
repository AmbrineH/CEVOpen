<p class="p">The analyst may rely on different chromatographic systems and detectors to achieve improved sample characterisation. This is usually performed by matching the chromatographic information (e.g., retention times, retention indices) of sample analytes and authentic standards with the response of different detectors. The detectors can be general/universal (e.g., flame ionisation detection—FID, mass spectrometry—MS, Fourier transform infrared—FTIR, vacuum ultra-violet—VUV), element-selective (e.g., flame photometric detection—FPD, nitrogen-phosphorus detection—NPD, electron capture detection—ECD) or sensorial (e.g., olfactory port—O, electronic nose—e-nose, electronic tongue—e-tongue) [

Important detectors for determination of aroma-active compounds are the mass spectrometer and the olfactory port, which provide a measure of chemical and sensorial identification, respectively. The continuous development and commercial introduction of new stationary phases, such as ionic liquids and cyclodextrins, may address new mechanisms of separation, but in complex samples may do little to expand the separation capacity in 1D GC. Thus, the problem of incomplete separation of components remains, and for the MS and ‘O’ detectors, generally complete resolution provides best affirmation of chemical properties or identification.
