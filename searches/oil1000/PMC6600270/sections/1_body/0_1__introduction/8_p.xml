<p class="p">As a disclaimer, in the applications which follow, some studies claim to detect compounds that had not previously been reported in particular samples, attributed to new higher resolution separation technology. We reproduce these claims, but do not examine the veracity of these, nor subject them to scrutiny as to whether they have completed thorough processes in ‘discovery’ of these compounds such as retention indices on two different columns, comparison and high correlation of mass spectra, and use of authentic reference compounds. </p>
