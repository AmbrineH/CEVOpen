 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], coupled with different detectors, to address even more demanding separations and to accomplish greater separation. The overriding aim is to expand the separation capacity of the system. MDGC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) does this by taking heart-cuts of specific regions on a first column and passes them to a conventional length second column for greater separation, which is of particular value in enantioselective analysis where the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column comprises the enantioselective phase. A cryotrap assists in reducing 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D dispersion. By contrast, GC×GC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) uses a modulator device (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) in conjunction with a short 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column to rapidly and sequentially transfer solute between the two columns, according to the modulation period, to produce a significantly increased overall capacity for the total sample. Presentation is conveniently expressed as a 2D plot—with axes 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D and 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D time—with individual compounds located throughout the plot according to their chemical/physical properties and interaction with the stationary phases. A further option of hybrid nature (MDGC/GC×GC; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) allows operations such as select target zones, improve their separation, and subject them to GC×GC.
