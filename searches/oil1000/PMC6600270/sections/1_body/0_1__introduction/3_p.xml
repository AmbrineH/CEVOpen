<p class="p">Sample preparation techniques are often used to increase analyte concentration. Likewise, MDGC can increase concentration through making multiple injections, whilst maintaining resolution. This increase in sensitivity corresponds to greater chemical and sensorial responses. The complexity of many matrices, including a multitude of (semi-)volatile compounds, from different chemical classes and ranging from major to trace concentration, makes it harder to achieve reliable identification and quantification in a single dimension separation. In addition, important (odour/flavour-active) stereoisomers are usually present, which may lead to ambiguous mass spectrometry library matches [
