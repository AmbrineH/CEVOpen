<p class="p">Niebler et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>] investigated the odour profile of six different Frankincense (
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia sacra</italic> Flueck) samples. A MDGC-MS/O approach was used together with other techniques for better resolution and more reliable compound identification. All samples had very similar profiles with 23 main odorants identified; most were terpenoids. The major compounds and their odour descriptions were 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (rosiny, pine), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-myrcene (geranium), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (solvent-like, fruity) and limonene (citrus, soapy, fresh). The MDGC technique allowed the authors to separate and evaluate the odour impact of 1,8-cineole and limonene, and also reliably confirm, for the first time, the presence of serratol (also known by cembrenol) in Frankincense samples. The non-terpenoid odour constituents thymoquinone, sotolone, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol were also reported for the first time in the samples.
