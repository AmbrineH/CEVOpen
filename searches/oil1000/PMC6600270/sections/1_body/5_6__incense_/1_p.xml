<p class="p">Incenses are aromatisers commonly made with resins and oleoresins, woods, essential oils, flowers, synthetic fragrances, fixatives, etc., which are generally burnt to release a pleasant smell. They are used since antiquity for many purposes, including religious, odour neutralisation and health (aromatherapy) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>) by GC×GC-FID, GC×GC-TOFMS and GC×GC-ECD/NPD (electron capture detector/nitrogen phosphorus detector) to obtain a qualitative fingerprint and investigate the compounds generated from incense combustion, comparing this with the unburnt incense. The original publication illustrates the relatively few peaks obtained in the incense headspace (mainly aroma compounds) compared with the many new products in the combusted incense. In the first study (2007), the researchers tentatively identified around 120–150 components in the incense powder and more than 200 in the smoke, while in the second study (2008), more than 250 and 1000 compounds were identified in the same samples, respectively. Among the classes present, there was nitrogenous (NPD-active) and halogenated (ECD-active) compounds, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hydrocarbons, terpenoids and phenyl propanoids (essential oils derivatives), fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Different types of nitromusks were also proposed. Naphthalene and biphenyl, both PAH products, were found in all the samples, even the ones claiming to be medicinal incense and environmentally-friendly; they are typical combustion product pollutants.
