Some of the most intense and unpleasant odours detected in these products were classified as car tyre/rubber-like, pungent, burning sensation, artificial leather-like, plastic-like, glue-like and nail-polish-like. The most frequent compound classes identified were aldehydes, carboxylic acids, lactones, indoles, phenols, alcohols, hydrocarbons and PAHs.
