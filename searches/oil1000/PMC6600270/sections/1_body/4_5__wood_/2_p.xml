 <italic class="italic">Bulnesia sarmientoi</italic>. GC×GC-FID/MS was applied for identification and quantification of the substances, which was mainly composed of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxides, alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes and ketones. The main odorants were identified by GC-O, highlighting the compounds bulnesol (rosy) and β-ionone (fruity), which had the most odour impact contribution. Typical notes of leather, clove and vanilla were also detected and related to phenolic compounds.
