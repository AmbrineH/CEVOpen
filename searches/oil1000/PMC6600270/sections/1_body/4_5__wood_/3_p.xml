 <xref rid="B109-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] assessed the composition of Agarwood (
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria malaccensis</italic>) oils through different multidimensional approaches. An integrated 3D GC-GC×GC system was used to improve the resolution of oxygenated sesquiterpenes of Agarwood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The conventional 1D analysis is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>A. In the first multidimensional step a 4 min heart-cut was taken using a Deans switch (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> Bi), with the number of detected compounds increased by approximately two-fold compared with 1D GC. However, overlapping peaks were still observed and a subsequent separation was necessary. The application of a cryogenic modulation GC×GC step (
