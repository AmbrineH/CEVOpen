 <xref rid="B118-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>], dedicated their studies to the identification of aromas in cedar incense (
 <italic class="italic">Calocedrus decurrens</italic> (Torr.) Florin), Scots pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) and oak wood (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus frainetto</italic>), respectively. A MDGC-MS/O system was used to identify trace constituents. In cedar incense, a rot-resistant wood with many commonly used applications, researchers found more than 60 odour substances, with 22 of them being potent odorants, including terpenoids, fatty acid derivatives and phenols as the main classes of odour-active compounds. The pencil-like and carpenter’s shop-like smells were the most dominant impressions in the sample, according to panellists. In Scots pine, 39 odorants were identified, with main classes of terpenoids, aldehydes, ketones and lactones. The highest impacting odour was described as resin-like, attributed to α-pinene, the most abundant compound in all three pine wood samples analysed. In oak wood, a material very frequently used as barrels for alcoholic beverage storage, a total of 91 substances were identified, comprising terpenoids, aldehydes, acids, lactones and phenols. The predominant aroma descriptions were vinegar, green-musty and resin-like.
