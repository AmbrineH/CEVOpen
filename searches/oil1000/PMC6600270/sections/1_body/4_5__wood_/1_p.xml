<p class="p">One of the more interesting notes in the flavour and fragrance industry, woody aroma can be found in, for instance, perfumes and household products to alcoholic beverages due to its storage in wood barrels.

Smaller amounts of inorganic compounds and extractable substances, such as proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, terpenes, resin, acids, steroids, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones and others are also present; it is in this group that we find the aroma compounds.
