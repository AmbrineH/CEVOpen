 <xref rid="B122-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] used MDGC and GCÃ—GC to identify the main cork taint odours, reporting geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (mouldy and cellar-like), 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (green), 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (musty-like), and 3,5-dimethyl-2-methoxypyrazine (musty-like) as the main unpleasant odour-active compounds. Furthermore, the compounds 3,4,6-trichloroveratrole and 3,5-dichloroveratrole (musty-like) were described for the first time as cork off-flavours. Multidimensional approaches were indispensable for good separation, identification and quantification.
