They suggested potential odorant markers in the bio-solid cakes based in statistical analysis; 20 compounds were identified with the main classes being alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons. The sulfur compounds were considered the most determinant to the overall aroma of the sample, due to low olfactory threshold. In the atmospheric air, they found aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes and esters as main compounds. The technique allowed the identification, tracking and hazard evaluation of the unpleasant odour pollutants in the area.
