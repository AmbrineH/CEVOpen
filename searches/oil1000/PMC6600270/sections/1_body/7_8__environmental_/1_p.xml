<p class="p">Contamination of soil, water and air can lead to the emission of odour substances, which may be hazardous to health. The control of taste and smell of drinking water are important parameters to ensure favourable palatability. Many works focus on detection of odorants in environmental related samples, with GCÃ—GC useful to achieve identification of trace-odour compounds in these samples.</p>
