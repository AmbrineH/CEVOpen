 <xref rid="B135-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>] indicated four thioether compounds and (

The authors suggested that 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin are responsible for the musty odour in the first river. Among the 54 substances studied by Rong et al. [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>], 2-methylisoborneol was considered the main source of the odour problem in the water from Shiyan reservoir, with its origin mainly attributed to the presence of the cyanobacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudanabaena</italic> sp. The GC×GC-TOFMS technique allowed a high sensitivity assessment of compounds from different classes without derivatisation [
