The authors reported that the most abundant compounds in headspace of the real samples were not of the greatest odour impact. Furthermore, the pseudo-scent formulations analysed did not match the chemical concentration and odour impact of the analytes from real samples. The marijuana-like product had more alcohols and aromatics; the cocaine-like product had more alcohols, aldehydes, aromatics, esters, ethers, halogenates, hydrocarbons, ketones and N-containing compounds; and the heroin-like product contained many more acids, alcohols, aromatics, esters, ketones, and N-containing compounds than the real samples. The use of MDGC-MS/O was indispensable to achieve a well-resolved separation, detect minor compounds with high odour impact and achieve simultaneous aroma evaluation using the two detectors.
