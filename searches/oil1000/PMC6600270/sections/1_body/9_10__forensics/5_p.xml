 <xref rid="B164-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>] studied the headspace of taggants and other minor volatile compounds associated with commercial thermally-unstable explosives: 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX); [3-nitrooxy-2,2-bis(nitrooxymethyl) propyl] nitrate (PETN) and 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT). GC×GC-TOFMS analysis revealed the presence of plasticisers (phthalates) and stabilisers (amino benzoic compounds), as well as nitro- and nitroso- compounds that can be from the explosive or its degradation products. Obtaining a fingerprint signature for each product, with respect to specific characteristics of the manufacture and storage conditions, can be useful to aid the training of detection dogs, assist tracking of the explosive’s origin and to provide faster confirmatory identification of explosives by the forensic laboratory.
