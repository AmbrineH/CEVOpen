 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>] used GC×GC-TOFMS to assess the volatile composition of ecstasy samples, from different countries, seizures and tablet physical characteristics (logo, colour, diameter and thickness), and developed a method to determine their origin through the profiles of some specific organic impurities. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows a typical GC×GC 2D result for ecstasy and which contains clear signatures of the processing of the sample from the safrole starting material, since it was possible to identify reaction intermediates in the final product. Enhanced efficiency and sensitivity were achieved with the comprehensive approach, which enabled the clear discrimination of the samples into eight groups in the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) plot. Three compounds were chosen to discriminate the samples: 3,4-MD-acetophenone, 1,3-benzodioxole-5-MeOH and unknown 147. Macedonia samples (named XTC) were rich in
