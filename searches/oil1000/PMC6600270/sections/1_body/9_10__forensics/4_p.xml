 <xref rid="B153-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]; some potential key decomposition compounds were 1-butanol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-and 3-methyl butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, octanal, indole, phenol, benzaldehyde, dimethyl disulfide and trisulfide. Stefanuto et al. [

 <xref rid="B161-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>] compared the odour volatile profiles of human and pig carcasses and also observed that sulfides may be important markers to discriminate the decomposition volatiles from different organs in human intracadaveric gas reservoirs. Dubois et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>] analysed the soil and adipocere samples collected from the decomposition site of a real crime scene, seven days after body removal. The GCÃ—GC-TOFMS profile results showed advantages, such as detection of trace compounds, high selectivity, accuracy and high resolution. The image offers a simple way to locate analytes through their compound classes and to recognise separation patterns, enabling an easier differentiation of samples collected from different places and facile communication of scientific evidence.
