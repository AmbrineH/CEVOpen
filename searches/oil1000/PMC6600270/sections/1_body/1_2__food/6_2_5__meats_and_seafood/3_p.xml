 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] developed GCÃ—GC studies of ham aroma volatiles to identify sulfur odorants in a cooked sample, and obtain volatile profiles to differentiate three dry-cured samples, respectively. Odorants present in trace amounts in cooked hams included 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-methyl-3-(methyldithio)furan and bis(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Increased resolution power enabled separation and identification of dihydro-4-hydroxy-2(3H)-furanone and acetic acid (co-eluting in 1D GC), as well as another six differentiating odorants in dry-cured Chinese hams [
