<p class="p">Fresh and grilled eel samples were analysed by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], using GC×GC. The authors identified around 39 more compounds with this technique than with 1D GC. The volatile fingerprint for both fresh and grilled samples was clearly different. The main odorants suggested for the grilled eel were methyl propyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, heptane, octane and camphene. The results were converted into “odour barcodes,” based on the odour activity values, concentration ratio and odour descriptions.
