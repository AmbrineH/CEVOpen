<p class="p">A MDGC method was used by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] to obtain aroma volatile profiles of two types of flour and related pasta products. GC parameters, especially the automatic pressure control and flow rates were optimised to allow complete transfer of the analytes from 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D to 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D. A multi Deans switch was used and the repeatability of the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D retention times were evaluated. An automated multiple headspace SPME sampling method was developed and optimised for quantification purposes. The technique allowed correlation between products (raw and processed), by identification of substances in common in the samples. Chiral separation enabled identification of 14 enantiomer pairs and their ratios in the samples, of use to evaluate authenticity of the ingredients.
