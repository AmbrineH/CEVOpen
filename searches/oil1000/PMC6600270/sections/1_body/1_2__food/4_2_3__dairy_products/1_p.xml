<p class="p">Dairy foods are very common in the human diet; the aroma of some products have been investigated by applying GC×GC techniques [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Butter flavour compounds were analysed by GC×GC-FID and GC×GC-TOFMS, with superior resolution enabling detection and identification of many more compounds, compared to the 1D approach, along with more reliable quantification of some target analytes. The main classes identified were aldehydes, alcohols, enals, ketones, fatty acids, alkanes, lactones, furans, pyridines and pyrroles [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The lactones responsible for the milky odour in dairy products were the focus of another study, which used GC×GC-TOFMS to quantify some γ- and δ-lactones in raw and pasteurised cream samples. This demonstrated that heating increased the concentration, mainly, of the 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-lactones and therefore the process could be a way to change the aroma of the products [
