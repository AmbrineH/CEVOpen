<p class="p">Two different Chinese truffle samples (black and white) were also analysed by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], using GCÃ—GC-TOFMS. The profile of the both samples was dominated by acids, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes and esters. However, the samples can be distinguished by some differences observed in composition, mainly by the higher concentration of sulfur compounds in the white truffles.
