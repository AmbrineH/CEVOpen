<p class="p">Dried fennel seeds (
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgaredulce</italic>) were analysed by Maikhunthod and Marriott [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] using an integrated GC-O/GC×GC-FID and a GC×GC-TOFMS system to assess aroma-impact compounds. The main odorants identified were limonene, 1,8-cineole, fenchone, camphor, estragole, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-anisaldehye. The authors reported a relationship between higher amounts of terpenes and freshness of the sample, evaluated using different shelf-aged fennel seeds. This characteristic can be observed in GC×GC profile results, and represents a facile approach to assess the freshness and, therefore the quality of the sample.
