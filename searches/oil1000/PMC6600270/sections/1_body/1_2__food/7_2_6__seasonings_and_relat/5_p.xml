<p class="p">Sghaier et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] developed a GCÃ—GC method to resolve and quantify the main off-flavour compounds (1-penten-3-one, 1-octen-3-one, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-4-heptenal, (
 <italic class="italic">E,Z</italic>)-2,6-nonadienal, (
 <italic class="italic">E,Z</italic>)-2,4-heptadienal, and (
 <italic class="italic">E,Z,Z</italic>)-2,4,7-decatrienal) responsible for the fishy-odour in rapeseed oil after thermal treatment. This allowed a two-fold increase in the number of identified compounds compared to classical one-dimensional analysis, based on improved separation.
