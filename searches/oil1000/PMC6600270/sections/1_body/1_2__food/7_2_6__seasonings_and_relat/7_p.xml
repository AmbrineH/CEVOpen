 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] used a MDGC system coupled to a combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (MDGC-C-IRMS) to assess authentication of truffle (
 <italic class="italic">Tuber magnatum</italic> Pico) and related products, monitoring the key-aroma compound bis(methylthio)-methane. As truffle is one of the most expensive food flavouring products, and its main aroma component can be easily and legally added to commercial products, the authors employed IRMS to determine the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C/
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>C ratio abundance of the natural and synthetic analyte to track product authenticity. The authors reported a range of −33.9% to −42.6% for δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C for bis(methylthio)-methane in 24 genuine truffle samples analysed, while the natural-origin and petrochemical standards had values of −28.5% and −56.4% or lower, respectively. Among the 14 truffle-based products analysed they found only eight with compatible δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values that confirmed a natural source. However, two of these were declared to be from black and summer truffle, which do not contain the evaluated analyte that was probably derived from a natural additive. All the remaining samples had δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values below −50%, indicating the addition of a synthetic flavour.
