<p class="p">Curry leaf aroma compounds and odour activity values were assessed by Steinhaus [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], using a MDGC system. The study confirmed that 1-phenylethane-1-thiol (sulfury/burnt notes) is the main impacting aroma compound present in the leaves and that the formation of other odorants, such as (3
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-hex-3-enal, (3
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-hex-3-en-1-ol (grassy notes) and (2
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>,6
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-nona-2,6-dienal (citric notes) can be increased by enzymatic processes unleashed after the leaf tissue was disrupted.
