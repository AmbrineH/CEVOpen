<p class="p">Coriander (
 <italic class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</italic>) and wild coriander (
 <italic class="italic">Eryngium foetidum</italic>) were the focus of Eyres et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], in which the volatile profiles were identified for character impact odorants by using GC×GC-TOFMS, MDGC and GC-O analysis. The comprehensive technique allowed the identification of more than 50 compounds in both samples with a number found for the first time, reproduced in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Alcohols, aldehydes, hydrocarbons and terpenes were the main classes present. A clear delineation of homologous compound series in the 2D GC×GC space was an advantage recognised by the authors, making isomer identification easier due to the relationship of related peaks in the 2D plot. The most important odorants found in 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> were (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-2-decenal, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ionone, eugenol and the co-eluting cluster (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecen-l-ol, and 1-dodecanol. In 
 <italic class="italic">E. foetidum</italic> the main odour compounds were (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-dodecenal, eugenol, β-ionone and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-4-dodecenal.
