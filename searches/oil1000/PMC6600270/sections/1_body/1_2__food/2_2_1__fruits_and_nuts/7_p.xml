<p class="p">Yellow (
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora edulis</italic> f. 
 <italic class="italic">flavicarpa</italic>) and purple (
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora edulis</italic> Sims) passion fruit flavours and odours were investigated by Werkhoff et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and Strohalm et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], using different MDGC approaches. In the former work, the authors used the MDGC system to obtain an enriched fraction of sulfur compounds, and to determine the enantiomeric distribution ratios for 20 substances of the yellow passion fruit. Forty-seven sulfur-containing compounds were identified, of which 35 were found for the first time in the sample and 23 not been previously reported as flavour constituents in food, such as hexyl 3-(methylthio)propanoate (fruity/geranium-like odour). Furthermore, among the chiral substances evaluated, it was found that sulfur-containing volatiles with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> configuration were present at the highest amount in passion fruit samples [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The enantioselective analysis of passion fruit aroma volatiles was also explored by the latter work, assessing the chiral ratios for secondary alcohols and their esters in both yellow and purple fruit types. The predominance of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>-enantiomers for the 2-alkyl esters were observed for both fruits. In addition, an opposite configuration in each fruit type was observed for 2-heptanol and 2-pentanol, having higher amounts of the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> configuration in the purple fruits and higher-to-racemic amounts of the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> configuration in the yellow fruits [
