 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] used MDGC-O/MS, GC×GC-FID and GC×GC-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) techniques to identify odour-active volatiles in processed orange juice, providing better resolution for seven most potent odour regions identified from 13 previously identified through GC-O. Confirmation by matching the identity and odour of four aldehydes (hexanal, heptanal, octanal, citral), two esters (ethyl butanoate, methyl hexanoate) and four monoterpenes (α-pinene, D-limonene, linalool, α-terpineol) was established.
