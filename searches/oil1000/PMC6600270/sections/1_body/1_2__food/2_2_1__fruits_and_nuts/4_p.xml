 <italic class="italic">Citrus hystrix</italic>) fruits by GC×GC-TOFMS to identify and quantify key aroma compounds (α-pinene, limonene, citronellal, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, myrcene, α-terpineol, and citral) and their bioactive properties for cosmetology applications. Peel and pulp had different volatile profiles. The major compounds identified were citronellal (peel) and terpinen-4-ol (pulp). Terpinene compounds, characterised by a woody-earthy odour, were present in higher amounts in the pulp of the fruit, while the citrus-fruity odorants dominated peel extract, and explains the perceived differences in the smell of both fruit parts.
