They are consumed raw, prepared as drinks and beverages, flavourings, perfumes, essences, cosmetics, medicines, etc. Revealing the composition of fruit aroma and flavour, the use of MDGC and GCÃ—GC techniques resolve their complex profiles, and with enantioselective separation strategies the composition may be determined. Enantiomeric separation preferably demands complete resolution of the isomers from matrix to allow evaluation of impact and characteristic odour, and supports their use as authentication markers [
