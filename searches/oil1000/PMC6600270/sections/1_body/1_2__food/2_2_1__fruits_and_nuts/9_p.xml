 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], using GC×GC and MDGC approaches. The techniques allowed the determination of the volatile fingerprints, identification of potent odorants and correlation of datasets to the product’s origin and/or processing chain. Differences in the amount of the compounds from each class can be observed in cocoa samples, according to the origin or processing step. For hazelnuts, the combination of optimal drying (18–20 °C) and storage (atmosphere with 99% N

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] studied the influence of the processing on hazelnut aroma, applying GC×GC-TOFMS analysis to identify and quantify the main odorants released from raw and roasted samples from different cultivars. They found 24 key-aroma compounds in the analysed samples and observed a dose-response relationship between the concentration of six compounds with nutty/roasty notes and the degree of roasting, which is directly related to the quality of the product.
