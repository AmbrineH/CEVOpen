 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], applied GCÃ—GC-TOFMS to obtain the volatile profiles of two varieties of strawberries harvested in Australia (Albion and Juliette). They identified a total of 94 volatiles of which 20 were not previously reported in the literature. Cannon et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] also analysed strawberry samples of Ciflorette variety, using a MDGC-MS system. According to the authors, the methodology allowed the identification of 252 compounds not previously reported in strawberries. In addition, 24 volatile sulfur compounds were found in the extracts, and resolution of otherwise co-eluting carboxylic acids was achieved. The aroma of the extracts was evaluated by panellists through a GC-O interface and a total of 43 odour-active compounds were identified.
