 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), using GC×GC–MS, and submitted their results to principal component analysis which illustrated clustering of similar sample maturity. The higher sensitivity and resolution power reportedly allowed the identification of 291 compounds, from which 97 were described for the first time in the sample. The main classes identified were esters, terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and lactones, and fatty acids and their esters. In their later study, more than 400 detected signals were submitted to principal component analysis. Differences in the volatile profiles were observed for the four ripening stages investigated (2, 12, 18 and 24 days after harvesting), of which 25 substances, mostly esters, were tentatively identified and suggested as maturation marker compounds. GC×GC allowed the discovery of postharvest genesis of mono and sesquiterpenes, which could be induced as a self-defence mechanism to fungal infection.
