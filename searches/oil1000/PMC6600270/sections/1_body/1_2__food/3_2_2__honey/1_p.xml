<p class="p">As a popular natural food product with a distinctive flavour, honey was investigated by Siegmund et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], who used GC×GC-MS to compare the volatiles and sensory profiles of Austrian and Mediterranean honeys. Eight different monovarietal/unifloral samples according to their source were studied: robinia, rapeseed, dandelion, fir tree, orange, lavender, linden and chestnut honeys. The GC×GC approach enabled separation of co-eluting 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D compounds and the identification of 34 compounds described for the first time in dandelion honey. The authors also identified odour-active compounds that were not related to the samples, suggesting that their origins were probably related to contamination with essential oils.
