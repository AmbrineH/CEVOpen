<p class="p">Food aroma and flavour are formed by a complex mixture of volatile and non-volatile substances. Among this rich mixture, there are different active-compounds, which are responsible for the taste, odour, texture and other sensorial perceptions and, therefore, are the focus of many studies in food science. Comprehensive and multidimensional GC analysis are indispensable tools to identify, quantify and correlate the key compounds (volatiles and semi-volatiles) to their sensory activity, as well as performing a well resolved fingerprint or profile [
