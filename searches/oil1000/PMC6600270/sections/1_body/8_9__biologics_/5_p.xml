<p class="p">Concerning human odours, some studies take advantage of MDGC and GC×GC to explore this field. Buettner et al. [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>] used a two-dimensional system to analyse human milk odorants. More than 40 odour-active compounds were identified and can be used to study the impact of diet and lifestyle habits of women based on their milk composition. Kuhn et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>] assessed the body odours of monozygotic twins by GC×GC-TOFMS. Important carboxylic acids related to the sweat odour, allowed the proposition of a possible contribution of genetics to human body scent, as the twins’ samples showed greater similarity in profiles than those from unrelated individuals. Doležal et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>] evaluated the scent of women’s skin, focusing on the less volatile compounds by using GC×GC-TOFMS. The study resulted in separation and identification of more than 137 substances, including fatty acids and their esters, ketones, aldehydes, esters and alcohols.
