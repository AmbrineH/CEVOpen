<p class="p">Following a similar idea, but with different purposes, Ueland et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] used GCÃ—GC-TOFMS to distinguish the horns of different rhinoceros species through odour profiles. Seventeen horn samples (eight white rhinoceros and nine black rhinoceros) were analysed. A consistency in the odour profile of black rhinoceros samples of different origins, clearly differed from the white species samples. The technique proved to be a faster and non-invasive way to identify parts of animals that are illegally trafficked.
