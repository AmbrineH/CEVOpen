<p class="p">In textile science, GCÃ—GC-TOFMS was applied to obtain a profile and chemometric study of human axillary sweat in two different knit fabrics. The results showed useful application to distinguish different types and wash treatment of fabric, as well as identify the gender of the wearer. Carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols were the classes selected, through application of chemometric algorithms, to distinguish between cotton and polyester textiles. Moreover, aldehydes, alcohols and some aromatics were the most representative to discriminate the sex of the user [
