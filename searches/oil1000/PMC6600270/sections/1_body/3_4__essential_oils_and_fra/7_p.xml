 <xref rid="B116-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] used GC×GC and MDGC to analyse suspected allergens in fragrance products. They found that different column set approaches can be complementary, providing different separations in 2D space. The authors also highlighted the importance of cryogenic focusing to improve peak shapes and separation in the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column by reducing the effect of peak dispersion (broadening) on the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>D column. In another study, the authors applied principles of the comprehensive GC×GC technique to develop a rapid repetitive modulation MDGC method to analyse sequential heart-cuts of peppermint essential oil volatiles, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. Using a relatively short (~ 6 m long), narrow bore (0.1 mm ID) 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column and a cryogenic modulation system, heart-cuts of 60 s were sampled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a) and delivered to the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b) to greatly expand separation as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c with each heart-cut analysis shown from the time of delivery to the 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D column; the authors obtained 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>D separations in 30 s and with up to a 40-fold increase in signal response as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>d for the 4th heart-cut.
