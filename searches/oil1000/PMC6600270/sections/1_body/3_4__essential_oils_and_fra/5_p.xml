 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] conducted a qualitative and quantitative study of vetiver essential oil components, using a GC×GC-FID/MS system. The method allowed the identification of 135 compounds in four different samples by dosing in internal calibration standards, as well as observation of differences in composition of each sample related to their origins and ages. Tissandié et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>] studied the composition of different samples of a perfume ingredient called “vetiveryl acetate,” an improved odorant product derived from vetiver essential oil processing. The GC×GC-MS/FID analysis allowed identification of more than 200 compounds in the samples, generating a new dataset that can be used to assess the impact of the manufacturing process on essential oil composition and odour properties. Francesco et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] used GC×GC to assess the composition of natural vetiver oil with transformed products—a vetiveryl acetate biocatalysed product, obtained from a lipase-catalysed acetylation of vetiver essential oil. The esterification process was highly chemoselective towards primary sesquiterpene alcohols, and had more sustainable processing features (i.e., mild reaction conditions, reusable catalyst, etc.). The use of the comprehensive technique was indispensable to deeply understand and compare and contrast the differences of the crude and the modified oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02080-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>), since the matrix is highly complex and not suitable for discovery purposes by using the poor resolution of a 1D GC method.
