<p class="p">Flower stereoisomer odorants, linalool and lilac aldehydes/alcohols, from 15 different plant species were assessed by DÃ¶tterl et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-24-02080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>], using 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>-MDGC separations and electrophysiological tests in a noctuid moth. Eight lilac aldehydes and their alcohol isomers were identified, and found to induce the insect response. The 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>-configured isomers were predominant in almost all the plant species studied. The technique was indispensable as a route to identify and collect the individual stereoisomers.
