 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>. The results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> harbors several endophytic fungi producing various antimicrobial compounds with selective antibacterial characteristics. It was mentioned that these antimicrobial properties may be due to secondary metabolites produced by these endophytic fungi such as
