<p class="p">Many studies have indicated the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the genus Opuntia in many various extract types like fruit extract, lyophilized cladodes or the phytosterols from fruit and stem extracts [
 <xref rid="b47-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. It has been reported that this plant presents anti-inflammatory effects. Lyophilized aqueous extract of the fruits of the plant, used in 
 <italic class="italic">Canarian</italic> traditional medicine for gastrointestinal and bronchial troubles, was evaluated for analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in rats and mice. The 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> extract (100–400 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited, in a dose-related way, carrageenan- induced paw edema in rats. A dose-dependent action was obtained against chemical (writhing test) and thermic (hot plate test) stimuli, respectively, with doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="b9-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In another study, evaluation of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the alcoholic extracts of flowers, fruits and stems of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and electrical current tests showed the most anti-inflammatory effect at the dose of 200 mg/kg of flower extract. Bioassay-guided fractionation of this extract by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) followed by Sephadex and paper chromatography showed three flavonoid glycosides i.e. kaempferol 3-O-α-arabinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside [
 <xref rid="b48-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Siddiqui 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. showed the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> cladode methanol extracts using inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolites and cytokines. Their report also described the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">opuntiol</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">opuntioside</italic> for the first time [
 <xref rid="b26-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The other members of this genus such as 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia ficus indica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia humifusa</italic> have also been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="b49-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>–
 <xref rid="b53-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Investigation of specific modulation of the immune system by 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> polysaccharides in a murine model immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (ip) showed that this plant can potentially enhance the specific immune function of immunosuppressed mice as well as the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro [
