 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. could isolate six compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic>stems called 3-O-methyl quercetin, kaempferol, kaempferide, quercetin, isorhamnetin and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol on the basis of the chemical evidence and spectral analysis. In another study, a new compound named 4-ethoxy-6-hydroxymethyl- alpha-pyrone was isolated from the 80% ethanolic extract of the stems of this plant [
 <xref rid="b38-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Kaempferol, kaempferide and 3-O-methyl quercetin were isolated for the first time from 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> stems [
 <xref rid="b39-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Some studies demonstrated that compounds like methyl linoleate, 7-oxositosterol, 6
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-hydroxystigmast-4-ene-3-one and eucomic acid were isolated from the stems of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> for the first time [

 <xref rid="b41-2093-6966-v22-n03-016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Furthermore, investigations obtained three new compounds, opuntioside I, 4-ethoxy-6-hydroxymethyl- α-pyrone and kaempferol 7-O-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-D- glucopyranosyl-- 1→4)- 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside, from the stem extract of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic>. The structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence [
