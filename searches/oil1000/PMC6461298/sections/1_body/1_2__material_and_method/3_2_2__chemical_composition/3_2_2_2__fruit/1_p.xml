<p class="p">In a study conducted by Elena Díaz-Medina 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., differences in chemical compositions between the fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia ficus indica</italic> were evaluated. Results showed 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> had higher contents of fiber, fat, ash, acidity, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, Na, Ca, Mg, Mn and Cr (p &lt; 0.05) and lower values of °Brix, proteins, pH, K, Fe, Zn and Ni [

Other studies also had revealed the chemical composition (protein, Brix, moisture, acidity, saccharose, glucose, fructose and minerals), the physical properties (Linear dimensions, density, mass, shrinkage and porosity) and equilibrium properties (sorption isotherms, enthalpy and entropy) of 
 <italic class="italic">OD</italic> fruit. This fruit is a valuable resource for water content, minerals, and acidity. Investigation on another plant of this family named prickly pear has revealed a value of total soluble solids (12–17%), acidity (0.03–0.12%), pH (6.0–6.6), ascorbic acid contents (20–40 mg/100 g fresh weight) nutritional values of energy (172 kJ), vitamin C (14 mg), glucose (7.8 g), fibre (1.8 g), protein (0.7 g), fats (0.5 g), potassium (220 mg), magnesium (85 mg), calcium (56 mg) and phosphorous (24 mg) for 100 g eatable portion. This plant is used in dehydrated areas as an edible product too [
