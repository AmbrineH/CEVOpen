<p class="p">The SAEO inclusion complexes were prepared by the freeze-drying method according to the published procedure [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. SAEO was added to 25 mL HPCD aqueous solution with the mole ratio of 1:1. The mixture was ultrasonically treated and magnetically stirred for 96 h at 30 °C in the dark. The encapsulation solution was filtered through 0.45 μm filters to eliminate any undissolved compounds after the complexation reaction. The filtrates were lyophilized at −60 °C and 100 Pa in a Millrock Technology BT85 freeze dryer (Millrock Technology, Inc., Kingston, NY
