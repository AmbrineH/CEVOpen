<p class="p">The ratio of the resistance (G/G0) of the volatile gas in the sample to the blank was obtained by the 10 gas sensors of the PEN3 electronic nose (Schwerin, Germany), in order to describe the volatile stability of the sample. That is, the smaller the ratio, the better the volatility stability. Twelve milligrams of SAEO and the encapsulation complex containing the same amount of SAEO were added to the sample bottle with 5 mL deionized water, respectively. Their volatility stability data were detected by 10 gas sensors of PEN3 electronic nose after standing for 30 min at room temperature. The same method was used to detect the volatility stability of HPCD. All the test samples were performed in triplicate.</p>
