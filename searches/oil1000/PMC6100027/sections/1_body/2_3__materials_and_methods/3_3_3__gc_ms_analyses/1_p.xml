<p class="p">SAEO was accurately weighed and dissolved in n-hexane to prepare sample solution A at a concentration of 0.003 mg/mL. Ten milligrams of SAEO/HPCD encapsulation compound was accurately weighed and dissolved in 5 mL deionized water, after which 10 mL n-hexane was added. The sample underwent ultrasonic extraction for 10 min to prepare sample solution B. The constituents of SAEO before (sample solution A) [
