<p class="p">The MICs of free and encapsulated SAEO were determined using a microdilution assay [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The antimicrobial inclusion complexes were added to the microtiter plates as aqueous suspensions, while the SAEO was added as aqueous microemulsions. The concentration of inclusion complexes added to the test wells ranged from 62.5 to 1000 mg/mL (equivalent to 1.25â€“20 mg/mL of SAEO concentration based on the entrapment efficiency), while the concentration of free SAEO ranged from 1.25 to 20 mg/mL.
