<p class="p">Negative control wells were prepared with sterile culture medium containing tested samples (free and encapsulated SAEO). Positive control wells were prepared with microbial suspension inoculating in culture medium. The microplates were incubated at 37 °C or 28 °C for 24 h and the turbidity was determined at 600 nm. The MICs of free and encapsulated SAEO were recorded as the lowest concentration where no visible growth (≤0.05 changed in
