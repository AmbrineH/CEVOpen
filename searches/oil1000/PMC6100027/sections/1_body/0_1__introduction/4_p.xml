<p class="p">CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides, occurring in nature by bacterial degradation of starch. In these natural processes, CDs have six, seven, or eight glucose units linked by α-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, being named α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrin, respectively. CDs have a cyclic molecular space structure, and exhibit special spatial properties, specifically a hydrophobic endothecium and hydrophilic exothecium, in aqueous solutions. This property allows CDs to form an inclusion complex with appropriately-sized lipid-soluble molecules [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. HPCD is a derivative of β-CD and is introduced to the hydroxypropyl groups in the molecular structure of β-CD to enhance its water solubility and toxicological properties. SAEO contains a variety of volatile components, such as terpenes, terpenoids and phenol-derived aromatic components, and the compositions are vital for their antimicrobial activities. Moreover, the encapsulation ability of HPCD is different toward a variety of components, which may affect the biological activity of SAEO. However, to our knowledge, few reports have focused on molecular modeling of selective encapsulation of SAEO by HPCD and changes of composition, volatility stability, and antibacterial activity of SAEO after HPCD encapsulation.
