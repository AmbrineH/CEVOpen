<p class="p">The present study investigates the effect of selective encapsulation of SAEO by HPCD on its components, volatility stability, and antibacterial activity. The component change after the SAEO encapsulated in HPCD was determined through a solvent extraction and GC-MS method, and the inclusion complex was characterized by FTIR and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR. According to the principle of lowest energy, the structure of the host and guest after encapsulation was simulated by Hyperchem 8.0 issued by Hypercube, Inc. (Gainesville, FL, USA). The volatility stability of SAEO before and after encapsulation was described by electronic nose for the first time. Furthermore, the effect of HPCDâ€™s selective encapsulation of SAEO on its antibacterial properties was evaluated via the restraint of its in vitro microbial growth (i.e.,
