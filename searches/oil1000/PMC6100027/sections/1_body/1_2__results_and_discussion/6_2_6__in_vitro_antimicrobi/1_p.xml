<p class="p">According to the previous literature, SAEO is beneficial in its ability to inhibit microorganism growth [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, its instability and strong volatility challenges its widespread application in food preservation. The present study described the capsulation method of SAEO to the HPCD cavity, of which the restraining effects on 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonoifer</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> before and after encapsulation were compared. According to 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01126-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, SAEO and the inclusion complex had inhibitory effects on 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonoifer</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, the inhibition effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonoifer</italic> was better than that of 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, which is consistent with the reported results in the literature [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In addition, under the same concentration, the antibacterial effect of the clathrate was obviously better than that of the free SAEO. It is possible that the relative content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole, the main antibacterial component of encapsulated SAEO, increased (from 91.38% to 95.36%) due to the encapsulation selectivity of HPCD. Moreover, the encapsulation by HPCD improved the water solubility of SAEO so that the antibacterial components in SAEO can more easily penetrate the cell membrane of microorganism, thereby exerting the inhibitory effect. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> also shows that the antibacterial stability of the inclusion complex was better than that of the free SAEO in 24 h, especially at two concentrations of 5.400 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> mmol/mL and 0.108 mmol/mL, which may be due to the encapsulation slowing the release of SAEO.
