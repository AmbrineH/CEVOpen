 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR can provide valuable information about the spatial position of guest molecules in the cyclodextrin cavity, as well as the formation and dissociation encapsulation conditions in the solvent. H3 and H5 are atoms in the inner wall of the cyclodextrin cavity. When the guest molecules enter the cavity, the chemical shift of the H3 and H5 atoms in the cyclodextrin cavity changed due to the interaction between the guest molecule and the hydrophobic cavity of the cyclodextrins [
