 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> presents the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra of SAEO, the inclusion complex, and the HPCD. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR diagram of SAEO exhibited obvious proton peaks at 7.3 and 6.8 ppm, which indicates that the molecular structure of the compositions in SAEO contains a benzene ring. The proton peaks near 6.3 and 6.1 ppm indicate the presence of a double bond in the molecular structure of the chemical composition of SAEO. The proton peaks near 3.3 and 3.7 ppm symbolize that the SAEO molecular composition contains a C-O-C structure. The proton peak near 1.8 ppm is a characteristic peak of H on the methyl or methylene structure linked to the double bond. These results were well in agreement with the analytical results of the GC-MS analysis. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR diagram of the encapsulation complex exhibited the presence of both HPCD and SAEO proton peaks. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B,C presents the chemical shift changes in the protons of the D-glucopyranose units in the HPCD molecules. No changes were observed in the H1 atoms in the mid-structure and H6 atoms at the outermost side of the HPCD cavity, whereas the H2 and H4 atoms outside the cavity shifted slightly towards the low field. The H3 atoms near the wider edge in the cavity visibly shifted towards the high field, and the H5 atoms in the depth of the cavity also exhibited a high field shift. Based on the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra analysis of the SAEO and the inclusion complex, the benzene ring structure and the double bond entered the cavity of HPCD. The stronger shielding effect of the benzene ring and the double bond resulted in an obvious increase in the electron cloud density around the H3 and H5 atoms and a decrease in the chemical shift. As a result, the H3 and H5 atoms shifted towards the high field. These changes indicate that the inclusion complex has been successfully formed.
