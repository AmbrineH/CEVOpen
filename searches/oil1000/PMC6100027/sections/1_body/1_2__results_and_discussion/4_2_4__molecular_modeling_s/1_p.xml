<p class="p">At present, molecular modeling based on molecular mechanics is been widely applied to characterize the three-dimensional structure of inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The above results indicate that the main components of SAEO in the encapsulation compound were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole, estragole, and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin, of which the possible molecular models and corresponding three-dimensional encapsulation structures were generated according to the PM3 method of Hyperchem 8.0. The models of the three types of inclusion complexes obtained by the methods in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The ΔE of model A (1.595 kcal/mol) of the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole molecule was positive and was significantly higher than that of model B (−9.067 kcal/mol) given that the encapsulating process reduced the energy of the CDs. As a result, it is unreasonable to generate model A of the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole molecule. The ΔE of model B (−7.881 kcal/mol) was slightly lower than that of model A (−7.323 kcal/mol) of the estragole molecule. The ΔE of model B (−14.583 kcal/mol) was significantly lower than that of model A (−1.973 kcal/mol) of the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin. Therefore, model B of the three guest molecules exhibited the most reasonable inclusion complex structure. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>(B1–B3) indicates that all three guest molecules were inserted into the cavity of HPCD of the isoallyl (or allyl) side. Moreover, the isoallyl (or allyl) group was deeply inserted, and the benzene ring was observed near the wide edge of the HPCD, whereas the ether bonds were exposed outside the HPCD cavity. The formation of the inclusion complex was largely a result of the addition of the benzene ring of the three molecules to the hydrophobic HPCD cavity by hydrogen bonding, which is consistent with the analysis results of FT-IR and
