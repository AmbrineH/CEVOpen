 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> reveals that the IR spectrum of the complex is very similar to that of HPCD. In addition, some characteristic absorption peaks (3020, 1609, and 790 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) of SAEO in the IR spectra of the inclusion complex were not identified. These bands are masked due to overlapping with the more intense bands of HPCD. However, the absorption peaks at 1507 and 1248 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> exhibit a decrease in the intensity, whereas that at 842 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> exhibits a slight shift due to the stretching vibration of C-O-C and the bending vibration of C-H of the

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This could be explained by the stretching vibrations of the benzene framework and aromatic ether bond in the SAEO molecules being restricted following the formation of the inclusion and the low guest quantity in the inclusion complexes. The above information shows that the benzene ring and the aromatic ether bond in the SAEO molecules entered the cavity of the HPCD, and indirectly validates that some SAEO components were successfully encapsulated by the HPCD.
