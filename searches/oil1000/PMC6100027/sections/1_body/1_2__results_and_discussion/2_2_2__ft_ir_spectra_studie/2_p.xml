<p class="p">According to the IR spectra of the SAEO, very strong absorption peaks were observed at 3020 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 3008 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which represent the C-H stretching vibration peaks of the benzene ring and the C=C, respectively. The four sharp absorption peaks between 1609 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 1447 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (1609, 1507, 1464, and 1447 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) is defined by the stretching vibration peaks of the benzene ring framework. The stretching vibration peaks of C-O-C were represented by the peaks at 1248, 1175, and 1038 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The C-H bending vibration peaks of the substituent aromatics are represented by the peaks at 842 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 790 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The relative content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole in the SAEO was calculated to be 91.38% ± 0.98%. Therefore, the IR spectrum of the SAEO was very similar to the spectrum of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The above information indicated that the molecules of the main constituents in the SAEO contained C=C bonds and aromatic ether bonds. This inference was consistent with the above-mentioned GC-MS analytical results.
