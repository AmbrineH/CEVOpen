<p class="p">During the extraction of the encapsulation complex, 12 components were identified, which constituted for 99.00% ± 1.93% of the gross components. Among these components, the relative contents were dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole (95.36% ± 1.09%), estragole (2.23% ± 0.33%), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin (0.91% ± 0.40%). Furthermore, the main components of the SAEO were the same before and after encapsulation. One of components was not identified in the extract due to its low content. In addition, the relative contents of the other SAEO components were all declined observably, except for 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-anethole, which indicates that the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-anethole are more likely to be encapsulated in HPCD. These changes may be due to the difference in structure and polarity of the different constituent molecules in the SAEO and selective encapsulation of HPCD. The encapsulation effect of the HPCD on the guest molecules may be closely related to the structure of the guest molecules. According to 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01126-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the structures of the three guest molecules with relatively high contents were similar, i.e., an isoallyl (or allyl) is connected to the benzene ring and an ether bond is connected with the benzene on the side of the 
 <italic class="italic">para</italic>-position. However, the group connected to the structure mentioned above in 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin was much more complex than that in 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole and estragole. Consequently, it was more difficult to enter the HPCD cavity and form clathrate, which may have resulted in the bad encapsulate effect observed on the HPCD of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin.
