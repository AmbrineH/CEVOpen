 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The identification of a single compound is based on the retention time and mass spectrometry of the sample. The GC-MS analysis of the SAEO before and after encapsulation is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01126-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. It can be seen from the 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01126-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> that the compositions and relative contents of SAEO after encapsulating changed, which may affect its antibacterial properties. Thirteen of SAEO main components were identified by GC-MS, which represent 97.09% ± 2.35% of all the components in SAEO (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01126-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The major components were identified as 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole (91.38% ± 0.98%), estragole (2.55% ± 0.41%), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-foeniculin (2.15% ± 0.65%). This result is similar to that of Aly et al. [
