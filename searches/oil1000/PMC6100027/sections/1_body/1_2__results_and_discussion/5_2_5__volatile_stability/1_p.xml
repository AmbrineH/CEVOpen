<p class="p">SAEO contains a large number of volatile components with a strong smell, and that volatile losses may affect its antibacterial activity, and the pungent smell will limit its application in food preservation. This volatile loss can be effectively reduced after encapsulating SAEO to HPCD, while masking this pungent smell without diminishing its biological activity [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A shows that the volatile components in the emulsion of SAEO and inclusion complex were sensitive to sensors no. 2, no. 7, and no. 9. The sensors no. 2, no. 7, and no. 9 indicate “broad range”, “sulfur-organic” and “sulf-chlor”, respectively. The electronic nose describes the smell characteristics of SAEO as “sulfur-organic” and “sulf-chlor”, which may be related to its strong volatile irritation. It is also shows from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A that there is a difference in the shape of the smell radar map of the SAEO and clathrate. This result corroborates the “changes in the composition and content of SAEO after the HPCD encapsulation” analyzed by the GC-MS analysis. The signal values detected by no. 7 and no. 9 sensors in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01126-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>B shows that the “sulfur-organic” and “sulf-chlor” smell of the emulsion of SAEO was significantly stronger than that of the encapsulation solution. This indicates that the embedding of HPCD masks the partial irritating smell of SAEO, which makes the encapsulation compound have a sustained release effect.
