<p class="p">To promote the proper use of herbal medicine and to determine their potential as sources for new drugs, it is essential to study medicinal plants, which have folklore reputation in a more intensified way.[
 <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] The quantitative composition and relative proportions of the oil components are widely influenced by the genotype, ontogenic development, and the environmental and growing conditions or on the plant species, the chemotypes and the climatic condition. In conclusion, the stage of development obviously influenced the yield and composition of the hydrodistilled volatiles of the flower and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">F. tingitana</italic> and consequently affected its antimicrobial and cytotoxic potency. The latter could not be exclusively correlated to the efficiency of a specific constituent but rather to a synergistic effect of all components. The difference in composition observed in comparison with samples obtained from other localities may be referred to a number of extrinsic factors which affect growth conditions and production of secondary metabolites. Finally, the transport, storage, and emission of plant volatiles are neglected areas of study that must be addressed to complete our understanding of how plants use these specialized metabolites in diverse ecosystems. Plant volatiles synthesis or emission may be influenced by environmental factors such as light, temperature, and moisture[
