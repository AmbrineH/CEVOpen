<p class="p">Light may directly interfere with the regulation of the MEP pathway and with the cross-talk between the cytoplasmic MVA and the plastidial MEP pathways.[
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] Activation of the MEP pathway by light is documented by rapid emission of isoprenoids known to be derived from MEP pathway on irradiation of green tissue, isoprene, and monoterpenes.[
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] Rates of biosynthesis of plant volatiles in leaf were highest when leaves are young, not fully expanded and need the most protection, which plant volatiles provide directly because of their toxicity or indirectly through the summoning of herbivores’ predators.[
