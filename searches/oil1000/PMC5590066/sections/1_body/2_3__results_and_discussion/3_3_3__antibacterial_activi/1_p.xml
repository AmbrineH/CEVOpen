<p class="p">Antibacterial effect of EO was evaluated in vitro against nine pathogenic bacteria species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="medicines-04-00030-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Gram-positive bacteria were more delicate to the EO than Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> was the most susceptible bacteria to 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil at the applied concentrations (5 and 10 µg/mL). The smallest inhibition zones were obtained in 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. agona</italic> cultures while 
 <italic class="italic">St. epidermidis, S. enteritidis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were resistant against all concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil. MIC for 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">St. aureus</italic> were 100 and 120 µg/mL, respectively; while the MIC for 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> was 310 µg/mL. Among the Gram-negative tested bacteria, a remarkable antibacterial effect was observed only for 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. agona</italic> with their respective MIC values 2000 and 1000 µg/mL. The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil from Turkey [
 <xref rid="B3-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] was also tested against 
 <italic class="italic">St. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic>; it was found that the MIC was 72 mg/mL, which is remarkably higher than the MIC of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil measured in our study. As was shown, the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oils from various locations may be rather different. The properties and the content of individual constituents may have an important power on the antibacterial effect of oil against different bacteria species. For instance, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, which were abundant in 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> oil studied in this work, are well-known natural chemicals with antibacterial potentials [
 <xref rid="B21-medicines-04-00030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The EO also studied in our work also contained 12% of germacrene-D and 7.3% of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol, which were absent in the Turkish oil. The antibacterial activities of germacrene-D and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol were previously reported as well [
