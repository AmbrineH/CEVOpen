<p id="Par12" class="p">In recent years, utilization of whey in food and nonfood applications is mounting across the globe. Whey protein has higher biological value and despite the fact that about 30â€“35% of the whey is still discarded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. In food industries, whey proteins are used as emulsifying, gelling and bulking agent. Antioxidant activity of whey protein is scientifically established and antioxidants of whey can efficiently inhibit the lipid oxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Antioxidant activity of whey protein is due to the chelation of transition metals by lactoferrin and scavenging of free radicals by sulphur containing amino acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Whey proteins boost the level of glutathione peroxidase which is regarded as one of the most significant water soluble antioxidant system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Whey proteins have antioxidant activity and addition of whey protein in soybean oil emulsion increased the oxidative stability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Antioxidant characteristics of salmon oil emulsion increased as a function of addition of whey protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Food containing whey proteins have better antioxidant activity. Lactoferrin and casein can inhibit lipid peroxidation, generation of peroxide radicals, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, uptake of oxygen and iron oxide free radicals [
