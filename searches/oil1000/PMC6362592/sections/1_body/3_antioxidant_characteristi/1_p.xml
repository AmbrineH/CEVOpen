Auto-oxidation and light induced oxidation is affected by a complex interaction of pro and antioxidants. Photo-oxidation is predominantly inhibited by β-carotene, it absorbs light that would otherwise be absorbed by riboflavin, which may give rise to quality related issues. β-carotene absorbs light in a concentration dependent manner [
