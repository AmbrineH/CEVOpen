<p id="Par11" class="p">Caseins are the major protein of bovine and ovine milks present in the form of macro-molecular aggregates. Due to the difference in phosphate content, various casein fractions are present in milk, for example, phosphate content of α, β and κ caseins are 10, 5 and 1 mol per casein mole and phosphate can provide antioxidant activity to the casein micelles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Milk proteins have shown antioxidant activity for the scavenging of reactive oxygen species. Studies have shown that casein inhibited the lipoxygenase-catalyzed lipid autoxidation. Free amino acids cannot quench the free radicals and for the scavenging of free radicals, primary structure of casein molecules acts as scavenger [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Phosphoserine residues associated with casein molecules and inorganic phosphate present in casein and serum can bind the non-heme iron. In a previous investigation, it was observed that 72 and 21% of the supplemented non-heme iron in skim milk was recovered from αs- and β-caseins and phosphoseryl rich peptides of casein phosphatides can bind the divalent metal and casein derived peptides inhibited lipoxygenase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Casein derived phosphopeptides revealed the capability of sequestering iron in lipid and aqueous food systems [

Browning is a serious problem in many foods and casein based coatings are commercially used to prevent oxidation induced browning of fruits and vegetables. Efficacy of calcium caseinate and whey powder in delaying the enzymatic browning in sliced potatoes and apples were investigated and results showed that milk protein based edible coating efficiently postponed the enzymatic browning. Whey protein powder revealed better antioxidant activity than calcium caseinate and the differences in antioxidant activity of whey protein and caseinate was attributed to the difference in amino acid profile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, casein and certain peptides are well established [
