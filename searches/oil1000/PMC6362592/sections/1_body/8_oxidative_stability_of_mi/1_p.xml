<p id="Par20" class="p">The oxidative stability of milk and dairy products is of concern to the dairy industry. Oxidation in milk can result in strong off-flavors and in deterioration of the nutritional quality of milk. The oxidative stability of milk and dairy products is the result of a delicate balance between the anti- and pro-oxidative processes in milk. Oxidative stability of milk and dairy products depends upon fatty acid composition (TablesÂ
