<p id="Par25" class="p">Cultured milk has higher antioxidant properties as compared to the normal milk and intake of two servings of cultured milk on daily basis reduced the risk of bladder cancer up to 38% as compared to the people who do not use cultured milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. Intake of milk fermented with 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecium</italic> RM11 and 
 <italic class="italic">L. fermentum</italic> RM28 had 21 and 29% less chances of colon cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>]. In another investigation, it was observed that men and women consuming milk on daily basis had 53% lower risk of bladder cancer while Swedish women containing four servings of high fat milk and dairy products showed 13% less risk of colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>]. Reyes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>] found that milk fermented with 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. had a protective effect against liver cancer. Consuming more than 500 ml milk/day significantly decreased the risk of colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. Individuals consuming lower amount of milk had higher chances of colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. Intake of half liter milk and ricotta cheese on daily basis reduced the risk of colon cancer to 12 and 17% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>]. Intake of 25 g white cheese on daily basis decreased the chances of premenopausal cancer up to 50% as compared to the women consuming less than 6 g white cheese on daily basis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>]. Milk proteins and peptides have shown anti-carcinogenic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>]. For instance, lactoferrin is well known for anti-cell proliferation, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Oral administration of lactoferrin derived from bovine milk considerably reduced the risk of several types of cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>]. Casein and whey proteins may protect from colon, breast and prostate gland cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. The anticancer capability of casein and whey protein may be attributed to the presence of higher concentration of glutathione, which is well known for its antioxidant activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Immunoglobulins such as IgG1, IgM, IgA and IgG2 has antimicrobial and glutathione enhancing activities which is the important antioxidant of the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>]. The association between the dietary intake of milk and dairy products was evaluated and no association was found between the intake of dairy products and cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>]. An inverse relation was found between the intake of dairy products and non-fatal cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. No significant association was recorded between the intake of cheese and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>]. Intake of low fat, medium fat and high fat cheese had no correlation with cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. Intake of 54 g whey protein on daily basis for a period of 12 weeks significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>]. Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>] observed as strong correlation in the concentration of bioactive peptides produced by the activities of microbiota and gastrointestinal enzymes which are abundantly present in fermented dairy products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">101</xref>]. A study was conducted on 3435 Parisians for the duration of three days, it was found that higher intake of dairy products led to a lower risk of types 2 diabetes up to 14% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]. Components of milk and dairy products are industrially used to increase the functional value of the foods. For example, phosphopeptides of casein are used as supplement for several dietary and pharmaceutical applications [
