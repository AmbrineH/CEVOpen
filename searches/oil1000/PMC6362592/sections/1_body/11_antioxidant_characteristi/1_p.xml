<p id="Par23" class="p">The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Pediococcus pentosaceus</italic> on antioxidant characteristics of probiotic yoghurt was studied in cow, goat and camel milk and results evidence that antioxidant of goat milk yoghurt was 93% as compared to 86% in camel milk. These results suggested that antioxidant characteristics of yogurt can be enhanced by probiotic bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. Yoghurt is a fermented milk product with distinctive therapeutic value and presented in diversified forms and flavors. Yoghurt was added with carrots, pumpkin, broccoli and red sweet pepper at 10% concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH assays were used for antioxidant activity during the storage period of 14 days. Yoghurt added with broccoli and red sweet pepper revealed higher DPPH free radical scavenging activity and FRAP. However, antioxidant activity decreased during the storage period of 14 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Similarly, cow, buffalo and goat milk yoghurts were supplemented with aqueous extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Beta vulgaris</italic> DPPH free radical scavenging activity and FRAP of goat milk yoghurt was greater than other cow and buffalo milk [

In another study, antioxidant capacity of yoghurt was increased by supplementing the yoghurt milk 60 mg vitamin C, 12 mg vitamin E and 3 mg beta-carotene. Antioxidant characteristics of supplemented yoghurts were higher than non-supplemented yoghurts with no effects on sensory properties [

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus bulgaricus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus thermphillus</italic> as starter cultures and total phenolic contents, ascorbic acid and total antioxidant activity were analyzed. Yoghurt added with papaya fruit pulp had higher total phenolic contents, antioxidant activity and vitamin C concentration [

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">bulgaricus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus thermophiles</italic> inhibited the lipid peroxidation through the scavenging of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen perode and hydroxyl radicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Antioxidant activity of milk fermented with 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> ME-3 was significantly increased higher than milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. The antioxidant activity in fermented dairy products is mainly due to the bioactive peptides released from α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and α-casein [
