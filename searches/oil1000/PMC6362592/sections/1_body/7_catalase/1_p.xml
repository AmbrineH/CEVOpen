<p id="Par19" class="p">Milk catalase is a heme protein and molecular weight of catalase is 200 kDa with isoelectric pH of 5.5. This enzyme is stable in a wide range of pH 5–10 and however, it rapidly loses activity out this pH range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Most of the catalases contain heme and catalase causes the dismutation of H
