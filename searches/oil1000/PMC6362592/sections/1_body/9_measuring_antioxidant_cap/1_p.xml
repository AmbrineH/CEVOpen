<p id="Par21" class="p">Antioxidant capacity assays are useful in measuring the overall antioxidant activity in foods. Antioxidant capacity assays can be categorized into hydrogen atom transfer based assays and electron transfer based assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Zulueta et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>] reported that hydrogen atom transfer based assays measured antioxidant activity from amino acids in milk that can act as hydrogen donors. Determination of nitric oxide free radicals, total phenolic contents, flavonoid contents, DPPH free radicals, inhibition of oxidation of linolenic acid and total reducing capacity can be used for the characterization of antioxidant capacity in milk and dairy products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. Lipid oxidation in milk can be measured by several methods which include instrumental methods, such as transition in fatty acid profile, concentration of vitamin A, E and C and total antioxidant assays. Peroxide value measures the primary stages of auto-oxidation and it a useful parameter to determine the oxidation status of milk, cheese, butter and ice cream [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Thiobarbituric acid test (TBA) has been used for the determination of secondary oxidation products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. Lim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>] used gas chromatography for the determination of oxidation status of ice cream. Sensory techniques are also commonly used for the assessment of oxidized flavor in milk and milk products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Antioxidant characteristics of some dairy products have been illustrated in TableÂ
