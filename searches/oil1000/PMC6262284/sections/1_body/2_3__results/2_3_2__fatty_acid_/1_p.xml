<p class="p">Regarding the FA composition of backfat (
 <xref rid="animals-08-00193-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), there was a significant interaction between oil source and duration of feeding for saturated stearic acid 
 <italic class="italic">(p</italic> = 0.018), monounsaturated palmitoleic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.042), and polyunsaturated linoleic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002) and ALA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.039). Supplementing the diet with rapeseed oil for two weeks before slaughter decreased stearic acid content. Supplementing the diet with soybean oil for six weeks before slaughter decreased palmitoleic acid content. An increase of linoleic acid content was found in the 4- and 6-week soybean oil diet treatments. The ALA content increased after six weeks of feeding with rapeseed oil, contrary to the other groups. In addition, with the increasing length of the feeding period of vegetable oil enriched diets, the content of myristic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007), palmitic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and myristoleic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.009) decreased, and the content of eicosenoic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), eicosadienoic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), eicosatrienoic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.032) and EPA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased. Rapeseed oil in the pig diet increased the percentage of myristoleic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007), oleic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), eicosenoic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.030) and EPA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023), whereas soybean oil increased the percentage of eicosadienoic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002).
