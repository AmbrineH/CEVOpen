<p class="p">The FA composition of backfat corresponds with sums and ratios of FA and indices (
 <xref rid="animals-08-00193-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Four and six weeks of supplying soybean oil significantly increased the content of PUFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.024) and n-6 PUFAs (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003). The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs was decreased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.040) by feeding rapeseed oil for 4 and 6 weeks. The atherogenic index (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and thrombogenic index (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) decreased with the duration of fat feeding. Moreover, lower thrombogenic index (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004) values were detected after using rapeseed oil as the oil source.
