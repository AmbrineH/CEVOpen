<p class="p">From the point of view of human health, rapeseed oil is a more suitable source of UFA than soybean oil in composing the diet for pigs. The high content of n-3 FAs in rapeseed oil leads to the reduction of the n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio to under 5:1 in backfat. An inclusion level of 40 g/kg rapeseed oil in the four weeks before slaughter is sufficient for improving the FA profile without adversely affecting the consistency of the backfat.</p>
