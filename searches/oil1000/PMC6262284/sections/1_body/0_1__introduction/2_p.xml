Because research has confirmed that the increased intake of n-3 fatty acids (FAs) can decrease the risk of heart disease and vascular disorders and can improve the clinical features of some autoimmune and inflammatory disorders [

These acids can be accreted in animal tissue directly from the feed. The EPA and DHA can be synthesized from precursor α-linolenic acid [
