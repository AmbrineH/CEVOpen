<p class="p">The fatty acid profile of pork directly reflects the FA profile of the pig diet [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Vegetable oils such as soybean or rapeseed oil contain high levels of UFAs and may lead to healthier products for consumers [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. On the other hand, the incorporation of PUFAs into the diet is restricted by the resulting decrease in lipid oxidative stability [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], which influences taste, flavour, colour [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], and shelf life [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Moreover, feed with a high level of vegetable oil that is rich in UFAs affects the fat consistency (soft and sticky), and thus decreases the quality of meat products [
