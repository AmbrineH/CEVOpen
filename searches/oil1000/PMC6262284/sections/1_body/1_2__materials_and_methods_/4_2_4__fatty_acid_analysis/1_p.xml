<p class="p">The methyl esters of fatty acids after the extraction of total lipids were detected according to the methodology of Folch et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Methanolysis was carried out in the presence of KOH and extraction of the acids in the form of methyl esters into heptane. Isolated methyl esters were detected by a flame ionization detector (FID) using the split regime of the chromatography Master GC (Dani Instruments, S.P.A., Milano, Italy) equipped with the Famewax column with polyethylene glycol (Famewax; 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) as the stationary phase. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 5 mL/min, and the split ratio was 1:9. The peaks were identified using Clarity 5.2 and quantified based on known retention times of standards for the Food Industry FAME Mix (Restek Corporation Company, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Atherogenic index (AI) was calculated from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and PUFA ratio in accordance with the methodology of Chillard et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] as follows: AI = (C12:0 + 4 × C14:0 + C16:0)/(MUFA + PUFA). The thrombogenic index (TI) was calculated according to Ulbright and Southgate [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] as follows: TI = (C14:0 + C16:0 + C18:0)/(0.5 × MUFA + 0.5 × n-6 PUFA + 3 × n-3 PUFA + n-3/n-6 PUFA).
