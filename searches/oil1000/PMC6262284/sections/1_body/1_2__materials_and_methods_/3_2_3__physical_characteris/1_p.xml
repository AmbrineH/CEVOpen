<p class="p">The colour parameters of lightness (
 <italic class="italic">L*</italic>; 0 = black, 100 = white), redness (
 <italic class="italic">a*</italic>; −100 = green, 100 = red), and yellowness (
 <italic class="italic">b*</italic>; −100 = blue, 100 = yellow) of backfat were measured using a Minolta CM-700d spectrophotometer (Minolta Ltd., Osaka, Japan) 24 h post mortem. The perforation of the upper (between skin and 1st fascia) and lower (under the 1st fascia) part of backfat was detected 24 h post mortem using an Instron Model 3342 (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) with the injection probe. Each sample was perforated with 6 injections above and 6 under the fascia. The crosshead speed was 200 mm/min with a pressure elongation of 22 mm and sampling rate of 20 mm/s. The maximum perforation (N) was detected.
