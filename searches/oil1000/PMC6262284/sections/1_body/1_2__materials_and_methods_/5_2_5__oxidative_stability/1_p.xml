<p class="p">The lipid oxidative stability of backfat was measured immediately after defrosting (0) and the 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> and 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> days of storage in the fridge at 5 Â°C. For the extraction, the samples of backfat were homogenized, weighed, and distilled using hydrochloric acid. The results were expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in mg malondialdehyde (MDA) per kg of backfat. For measuring the absorbance of the colour complex, a Genesys 10vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used at lambda 538 nm against the standard calibration curve 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane.
