<p class="p">The pigs were divided into 6 experimental groups according to the addition of rapeseed or soybean oil and duration of supplying either oil in the pig diet (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10). The pigs were fed the P1 feed mixture without added oil from the beginning of the experiment until 110 days of age. Then, for 2, 4 or 6 weeks before slaughter the pigs were fed the P3 feed mixture with rapeseed (40 g/kg) or soybean oil (40 g/kg). The groups receiving feed supplemented with oils for 2 or 4 weeks before slaughter were fed the P2 diet until old enough to receive the supplemented P3 diet. The composition and nutritional values of each feed is shown in
