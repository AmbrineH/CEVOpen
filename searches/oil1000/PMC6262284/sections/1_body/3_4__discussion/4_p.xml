<p class="p">Lipid peroxidation is a complex process that is affected by several factors including the degree of saturation. Lipid sources that contain high concentrations of PUFA are highly susceptible to peroxidation [

In this study, however, the malondialdehyde content was not influenced by oil source in fresh backfat nor in backfat stored for three or five days. This was probably because these two vegetable oils are not contrasting fats. A surprising finding was that the feeding of vegetable oils for six weeks decreased malondialdehyde content in backfat stored for five days. This can be explained by the higher oleic acid content in these vegetable oils, especially in rapeseed oil, which can reduce lipid oxidation. In addition, soybean oil used in the feed industry is rich in choline, phospholipids, antioxidants and vitamin E, which prevent oxidation [
