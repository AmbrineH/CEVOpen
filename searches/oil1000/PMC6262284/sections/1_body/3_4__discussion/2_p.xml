<p class="p">Rapeseed oil is rich in MUFA and has higher levels of n-3 PUFAs while soybean oil has a high C18:2 content and moderate levels of C18:1 and C18:3. In pigs, dietary FAs are absorbed unchanged from the intestine and incorporated into tissue lipids [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Hence, dietary fat influences the FA profile of the adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These data correspond with our findings that dietary rapeseed oil increased n-3 FAs and decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio to 4.5:1, whereas soybean oil increased n-6 FAs in backfat. In accordance with our results, Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], in a study testing soybean oil as a lipid source for pig diets, showed that the content of PUFA, especially n-3 FAs, in the carcass can be linearly increased depending on the length of the feeding period of a diet supplemented with soybean oil. Similar findings were obtained by Stephenson et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] who stated that increasing the duration of feeding with soybean oil lowered MUFA and increased PUFA concentrations for all fat depots. When pigs are fed diets with n-3 fatty acids, pork and pork products could be recognized as functional foods with new health-promoting properties [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. This would change the view of pork, which is considered less healthy because the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the meat from pigs fed a commercial feed exceeds the 5:1 recommended by the World Health Organization for meat with health-promoting properties.
