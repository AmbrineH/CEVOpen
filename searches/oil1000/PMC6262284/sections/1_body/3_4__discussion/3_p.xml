<p class="p">Moreover, rapeseed oil is a rich source of oleic acid (54.5% compared to 21.9% in soybean oil in the present study), which has similar effects as the n-3 FAs. It was demonstrated that oleic acid leads to a reduction in cholesterol levels, risk of atherogenesis and high blood pressure [

These indices reflect the probability of an increase in pathogenic phenomena, such as atheroma and thrombus formation. The values of the atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were significantly reduced as the rapeseed or soybean oil feeding period increased. In the case of the thrombogenic index, rapeseed oil was more efficient than soybean oil.
