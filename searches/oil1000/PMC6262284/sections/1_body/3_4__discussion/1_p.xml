<p class="p">From the results of the present study, it is evident that the values of backfat perforation significantly decreased after six weeks supplementing the diet with vegetable fats. The negative effect on backfat consistency of feeding with vegetable oils is explained by higher UFA levels in these fat sources [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Consistent with our results, Benz et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] stated that increasing feeding duration of soybean oil increased the amount of UFAs leading to softer carcass fat. In addition, Gl√§ser et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] showed that only approximately 30% of the variation in firmness of native backfat could be explained by the fatty acid composition. The amount of superficial fat and therefore thickness of backfat seemed to be more important for firmness of native backfat than its composition. Moreover, there is a strong inverse correlation between the amount of fat and the concentration of PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Koczanowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-08-00193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found that with the increasing thickness of backfat (from 12 to 16 mm), the concentration of SFAs increased (from 37.7 to 40.4%), while the concentration of PUFAs decreased (from 16.1 to 12.9%).
