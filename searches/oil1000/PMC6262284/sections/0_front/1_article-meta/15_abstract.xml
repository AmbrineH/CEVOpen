  <p class="p">The fatty acid profile of pig backfat directly reflects the fatty acid profile of the pig diet. The increased intake of n-3 fatty acids, whose higher content is in vegetable oils, can decrease the risk of heart disease incidence and vascular disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rapeseed and soybean oils and the duration of supplementing the pig diet until slaughter on physical characteristics, fatty acid profile and lipid oxidation of backfat. With the supplementation of oil in the diet for 6 weeks until slaughter, the value of lightness and perforation part of backfat significantly decreased. A dose of 40 g/kg of rapeseed oil in the last 4 weeks before slaughter is sufficient for improving the fatty acid profile without adversely affecting the consistency of the backfat. From the point of view of human health, rapeseed oil is a more suitable source of unsaturated fatty acid than soybean oil in composing the diet for pigs.</p>

  <p class="p">This study compared the effect of two vegetable oils and their feeding duration on pig backfat quality. The experiment was conducted with 60 DanBred pigs that were fed a diet supplemented (40 g/kg) with rapeseed or soybean oil for 2, 4 or 6 weeks before slaughter at 152 d of age. The supplementation of both vegetable oils in the diets for 6 weeks negatively changed backfat consistency. The pigs fed soybean oil for 4 (17.64%) and 6 weeks (18.52%) before slaughter showed an increase in backfat linoleic acid content (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002), whereas, in contrast to the other groups, rapeseed oil in the diet for 6 weeks (2.38%) increased Î±-linolenic acid content (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.039). The content of PUFAs (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.024) and n-6 PUFAs (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003) was increased by adding soybean oil to the diet for 4 and 6 weeks. The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs was decreased (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.040) by supplementing rapeseed oil for 4 and 6 weeks. The oil feeding duration decreased (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) the atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. The lipid oxidative stability of backfat stored for 3 and 5 days increased (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in pigs fed dietary vegetable oils for 6 weeks prior to slaughter. In conclusion, the feeding of rapeseed oil for 4 weeks before slaughter is sufficient for improving the FA profile without negative effect on the consistency of the backfat.
