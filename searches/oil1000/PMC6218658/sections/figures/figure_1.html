 <p> Canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) to test the significance of the effects of pollutant (A,D), soil depth (B,E), and time (C,F) on the total structure of bacterial and fungal communities as determined by the relative abundances of all the OTUs resulting by Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S and fungal ITS amplicons. (A–C) Graphs in the first line are for bacteria, (D–F) are for fungi. </p>
