<p class="p">ITS taxonomy-based analyses were conducted in Mothur: sequences shorter than 120 bp were discarded. We discarded homopolymers &gt; 10 bp and chimeras, which were identified with the UCHIME algorithm implemented in Mothur, with the UNITE database version 6 as reference. The same database was used to classify the retained sequences and to eliminate non-fungal sequences. OTUs were produced in USEARCH with the â€“fastx_uniques and - cluster_otus commands. Sequences that did not belong to fungi were identified with the sintax command against the Utax reference database and discarded.</p>
