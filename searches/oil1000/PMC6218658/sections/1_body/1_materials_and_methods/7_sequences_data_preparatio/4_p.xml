<p class="p">The OTU- and taxonomy-based matrixes obtained were analyzed in R to estimate the associated α and β diversity of the samples. The Good’s coverage estimate was calculated to assess the “percentage diversity” captured by sequencing. The most abundant OTUs identified were confirmed with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search) searches against the GenBank and the RDP database.</p>
