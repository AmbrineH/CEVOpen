<p class="p">The flasks were incubated on a rotary shaker at 30°C and 180 rpm for bacteria and at 24°C and 120 rpm for fungi. After 7 days, 5 mL of the culture was transferred to another flask with MM and the corresponding target analyte: benzene (50 ppm); naphthalene (200 ppm), phenanthrene (200 ppm), pyrene (200 ppm); paraffin oil (1% v/v), and crude oil (1% v/v). Three consecutive subcultures were performed in the same conditions.</p>
