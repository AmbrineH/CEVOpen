<p class="p">Genomic DNA of each strains was extracted from about 100 mg of mycelium scraped from the MEA petri dishes using the NucleoSpin
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The quality and quantity of extracted DNA was measured spectrophotometrically by Infinite M200 (TECAN Trading, Austria). De-replication of fungal isolates was performed by using the minisatellite core sequence derived from the wildtype phage M13 (5′-GAG GGT GGC GGT TCT-3′) as specific primer to amplify variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Poli et al., 2016</xref>). Molecular identification of each fungal isolate was carried out by amplification of specific markers (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Glass and Donaldson, 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bensch et al., 2012</xref>). PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE). PCR products were purified and sequenced at Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Consensus sequences were obtained by using Sequencer 5.0 (Gene Code Corporation). Taxonomic assignments were inferred by querying with the Blastn algorithm (default setting), hosted at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), the newly generated sequences against the nucleotide database of NCBI (GenBank). Pairwise alignments were also performed against the CBS-Knaw Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Centraalbureau voor Schimmel cultures) database. Similarity values equal or higher than 98% (e-value &gt; e-100) were considered reliable; results were confirmed morphologically.
