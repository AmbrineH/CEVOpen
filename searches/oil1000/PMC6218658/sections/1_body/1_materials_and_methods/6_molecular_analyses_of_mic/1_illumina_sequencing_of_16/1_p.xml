<p class="p">For bacteria, PCR amplicons covering the V3–V4 regions of the 16S rRNA were analyzed in Illumina MiSeq with V3 chemistry in 300 bp paired-reads mode. PCR reactions were performed using indexed primer pairs 343F (5′-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 802R (5′-TACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC-3′), as described in 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vasileiadis et al. (2015)</xref>. A multiplexing strategy was employed to analyze several amplicon samples simultaneously in the same sequencing run. A nine nucleic acids extension was added to the 5′ end of the forward primer, where the first seven bases served as a tag to identify to each sample, and the following two bases were a linker designed not to match bacterial sequences in the same position according to RDP entries. In order to reduce possible biases related to the primer extension, the two step-PCR approach described in 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Berry et al. (2011)</xref> was adopted. The PCR conditions were set as described by 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vasileiadis et al. (2015)</xref>. The final PCR products were checked on 0.8% agarose gel and pooled in equimolar amounts according to QuBit measurements. The final pool was cleaned with the SPRI (Solid Phase Reverse Immobilization Method) using the Agencourt
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> AMPure
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> XP kit (Beckman Coulter, Milan, Italy). Finally, the pool was sequenced by BioFab Company (Rome, Italy) with a MiSeq Illumina instrument (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States) operating with V3 chemistry and producing 300 bp paired-reads.
