<p class="p">The nr ITS2 region was amplified from all DNA by means of a semi-nested PCR approach. In the first PCR, the nr ITS (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) was amplified with universal primers ITS1F-ITS4 (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White et al., 1990</xref>). For the second PCR, ITS3 and ITS4 (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White et al., 1990</xref>) tagged primers were used to amplify the ITS2 region of each DNA sample (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Voyron et al., 2017</xref>).
