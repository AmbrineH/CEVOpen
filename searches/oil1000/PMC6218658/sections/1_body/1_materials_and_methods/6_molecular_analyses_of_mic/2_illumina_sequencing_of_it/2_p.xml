<p class="p">PCR products were pooled and purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After quantification with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), the purified PCR products were mixed in equimolar amounts to prepare sequencing libraries. The libraries were paired-end sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq technology (2 bp × 250 bp) by IGA Technology Services S.r.l. Unipersonale (Udine, Italy).</p>
