<p class="p">Fungal species with their relative abundance are reported in Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3</xref>, according to the soil depth and in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> according to the pollutant used in the enrichments. Isolated fungi belonged mostly to the phylum Ascomycota, and only 5% to Basidiomycota; Mucoromycota were not isolated. Most of the strains were isolated from enrichments inoculated with contaminated soils S1 (35 strains) and S3 (36 strains); a lower number of isolates (23) were retrieved from the contaminated soil S2 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3</xref>). In general, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> was the most abundant genus (43.8%) followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic> (and its teleomorph 
 <italic class="italic">Hypocrea lixii</italic>) (13.8%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> (11.0%). The majority of the isolates detected in soils S1 and S3 were indeed ascribable to these three genera, while in S2 only 44.4% of the strains were affiliated to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> and 16.7% belonged to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3</xref>).
