<p class="p">The retrieval of fungal species was influenced by the pollutant used as sole carbon source in the enrichments, as reported in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The highest number of isolates was obtained from pyrene and phenanthrene (23-22 isolates) followed by benzene and crude oil (15 isolates); 11 strains were isolated in the presence of naphthalene and only eight strains were isolated in the presence of paraffin oil (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). With the only exception of crude oil, the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> was the most abundant in each pollutant. Benzene and paraffin enrichments revealed the highest variety of genus and species.
