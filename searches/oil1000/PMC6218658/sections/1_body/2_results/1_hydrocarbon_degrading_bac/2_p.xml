<p class="p">For bacteria, sequence similarity searches in NCBI GenBank and RDP database revealed the presence of cultivable members of different genera under the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Sphingobacteria. On the whole, the bacteria isolated where ascribed mainly to 12 genera belonging to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> was the most abundant genera (56.8%) followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium</italic> (12%), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> (6%), 
 <italic class="italic">Stenothrophomonas</italic> (6%), 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic> (6%), and 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia</italic> (3%). Most of the bacterial strains (46) were isolated from enrichments inoculated with soil S2 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S2</xref>): the most represented bacterial genera in soil S2 were 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> (23 isolates), 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia</italic> (3 isolates), and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium</italic> (9 isolates). A lower number of bacterial strains was isolated from enrichments of soil S1 and S3 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S2</xref>). A total of 26 isolates were obtained from soil S1 and were mainly affiliated to the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoxanthomonas</italic>, while the 23 bacterial strains isolated from the deepest soil S3 were mainly affiliated to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S2</xref>). The influence of pollutants used in the enrichments on the distribution of bacterial species is reported in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The highest number of bacterial isolates was obtained from paraffin (29 isolates), followed by naphthalene (19 isolates), benzene (15 isolates), and phenanthrene (15 isolates) microcosms; 10 strains were isolated in the presence of pyrene and only six strains were isolated in the presence of crude oil (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> dominated all the microcosms enriched on pollutants. Benzene and paraffin enrichments showed the highest diversity of bacterial genera. In particular, benzene enrichment selected also bacterial species of the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas</italic>, while paraffin enrichment resulted also in the isolation of species of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoxanthomonas</italic>. Beside 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ochromobactrum</italic> were the most abundant genera in crude oil and pyrene microcosms (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). At species level, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic> was dominant and was isolated in the presence of all the tested pollutants. Other frequently isolated species were 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas fluorescence</italic> (four pollutants), 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (</italic>two pollutants), 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila</italic> (two pollutants), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (two pollutants), and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium multivorum</italic> (two pollutants). Three strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia marcescens</italic> were isolated only from the enriched microcosms with the crude oil of the contaminated site (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
