<p class="p">A collection of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial and fungal strains was isolated from microcosms enriched on each pollutant (benzene, paraffin, pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and crude oil) and from three depths of the contaminated soil of the SIN in Fidenza. Molecular de-replication of isolated colonies resulted in 95 and 94 unique colonies for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Molecular identification of the strains was inferred by 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing and is reported in Table
