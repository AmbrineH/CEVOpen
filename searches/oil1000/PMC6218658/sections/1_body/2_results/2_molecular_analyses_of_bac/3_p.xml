<p class="p">Multivariate canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed on bacterial and fungal OTUs abundance tables in order to assess how the microbial communities responded to contaminants, depth of soil collection and enrichment time (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the tested factors, in the case of bacteria, pollutant was the most significant: the percentage of variance explained (36.1%, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>) was much higher than the variance explained by the soil (6.1%, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>) and by the time (8.3%, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>) factors. The bacterial communities differed among the six tested contaminants: pollutants that shared the chemical structure (e.g., the three PAHs) grouped together, while oil, benzene, and paraffin formed separate groups (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>). A similar picture was obtained by the CCA analyses performed on fungal communities: only the pollutant factor was significant (25.6% of variance explained, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1D</xref>) contrary to soil and time factors. The pollutant used in the enrichment significantly affected the evolution of fungal communities: phenanthrene and pyrene enriched fungal communities formed groups that separated from those enriched from oil (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1D</xref>). For both fungi and bacteria, the groups formed by soil-depth (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B–E</xref>) and time (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C–F</xref>) were mainly overlapping: this indicates that the depth, as well as the time of enrichment, did not affect the evolution of enriched microbial communities. Grouping of samples was also evaluated by UPGMA clustering of sequencing classified at genus level. Results are reported in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref> for bacteria and in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref> for fungi: samples are labeled according to the soil depth, followed by the pollutant and the enrichment step. Results confirmed that the relative composition in bacterial genera was partly dependent on the pollutant: several pyrene and phenanthrene samples formed two sub-clusters in a common cluster, with 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirillum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> being the dominant genera; naphthalene enrichments were dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> in similar proportions, while oil enrichments showed a dominance of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic>. Finally, benzene and paraffin enrichments revealed a more diverse community, with high relative presences of 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoxanthomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic>. Neither the soil depth nor the time of enrichment influenced the samples clustering, confirming the CCA results presented above.
