<p class="p">Illumina HTS of PCR amplicons of the 16S V3–V4 region resulted in 1,991,866 sequences, which were reduced to 1,742,447 after the exclusion of homopolymers, of sequences &lt;380 bp, sequences not aligning to the targeted V3–V4 regions, chimera and sequences not classified as bacterial after alignment against the RDP 16S training set. In order to reduce biases in diversity estimates related to the analyses of samples with different number of sequences, rarefaction to a common minimum number of 10,065 sequences per sample was carried out (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gihring et al., 2012</xref>). The rarefaction step resulted in the loss of only 5 out of 82 samples, while retaining a sequencing depth able to depict most of the bacterial diversity in the samples, as indicated by an average Good’s coverage of 90.4%.
