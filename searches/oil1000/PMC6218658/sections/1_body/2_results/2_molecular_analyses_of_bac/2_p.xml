<p class="p">As for fungi, Illumina sequencing of ITS2 amplicons resulted in 795,742 high quality sequences. Taxonomy-based analyses were performed in Mothur and consisted in a screening to remove homopolymers, sequences shorter than 120 bp, chimera, and sequences that were not correctly classified as fungal after alignment against the UNITE v6 database. Rarefaction was performed with a common number of 5,001 sequences per sample. The coverage of fungal diversity was not affected by this rarefaction step: average Goodâ€™s coverage was 99.7%, thus showing that the sequencing effort covered the totality of fungal biodiversity in the samples. OTU-based analyses for fungi were performed in USEARCH and resulted in a very similar number of sequences per sample (4,942) and a total of 188 fungal OTUs.</p>
