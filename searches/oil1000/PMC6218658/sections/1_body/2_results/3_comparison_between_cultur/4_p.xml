<p class="p">Regarding fungi, the rate of OTUs that could be classified at species level is similar to the one for bacteria: 14 out of 21. The number of OTUs also detected among isolates was instead slightly lower, 9 isolates (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). It is worth noting that, as for bacteria, the taxa comprising more isolates were also the most abundant OTUs: that was the case for 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> spp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium solani</italic>. These data highlighted the different adaptation abilities developed by fungi: while species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> were abundant and widely distributed among pollutants and depth, other fungi seemed to be particularly adapted to individual contaminant. For instance, the relative percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">Cladosporium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoallescheria</italic> spp. was significantly high only in the presence of oil and benzene, respectively.
