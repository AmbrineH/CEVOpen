<p class="p">The same analyses were conducted on fungi (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Sordariomycetes was the most abundant class, with the order Hypocreales (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Acremonium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clonostachys, Fusarium, Hypocrea/Trichoderma</italic>) and Microascales (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Ceriosporopsis, Pseudoallescheria/Scedosporium</italic>). Xylariales were instead a minor component of the detected fungi (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Arthrinium, Eutypella</italic>). Results from culture-dependent and culture-indepentent methods confirmed each other in the case of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>, whose relative percentages were highly similar (ranging 40 and 69%). 
 <italic class="italic">Clonotachys</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudallescheria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic> were mostly isolated from S1 soils where also Illumina data showed the highest relative percentage. In the case of fungi too, there are some contrasting results, as fungal genera isolated in pure culture that were not detected with Illumina sequencing of ITS2 amplicons (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Bjerkandera</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Epicoccum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eutypella, Irpex, Polyporus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Sulcatispora</italic>). As for the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Ceriosporopsis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Phanerochaete</italic>, they were detected with Illumina in significant amounts (above 5% of total sequences) but no isolates were obtained.
