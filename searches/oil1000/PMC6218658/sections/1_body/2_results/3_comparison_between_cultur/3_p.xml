<p class="p">The most abundant OTUs (i.e., those who had a relative abundance higher than 1% in at least one sample) are reported in Tables 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> for bacteria and fungi, respectively. This screening criterion retained 19 OTUs for bacteria, and 21 OTUs for fungi: in both tables, the highest taxonomic affiliation is reported, together with the relative abundances in each enrichment microcosm. In the case of bacteria, most OTUs (16 out of 19) were classified at species level, two at genus and only one at the family level. Nine out of 19 OTUs were retrieved in the cultivated isolates. By comparing the data on the isolates in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> with the molecular data in Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, it is possible to notice that the species comprising more isolates (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas putida</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas veronii</italic>) were also the most abundant in terms of Illumina OTUs. As above reported for genera, also for OTUs classified at genus or species level there was a good agreement between molecular and microbiological data.
