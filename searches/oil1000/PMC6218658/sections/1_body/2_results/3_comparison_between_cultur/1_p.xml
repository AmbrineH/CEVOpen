<p class="p">A number of analyses were performed in order to compare the results on the diversity of bacterial and fungal strains isolated with culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. In Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> the relative percentages of bacterial genera retrieved from each of the three soil depths are compared. Results generally agree: 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> was the dominant genus in both cases, with 24.2, 25.2, and 63.5% of relative abundances in Illumina and 57.7, 48.9, and 69.6% as isolates for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The other genera, in terms of relative percentages, were 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrophomonas</italic> for the culture-dependent data; 
 <italic class="italic">Achromobacer</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Azospirilllum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Shinella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacterium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrophomonas</italic> for the Illumina data. It is worth noting that for some genera, the soil depth with the highest relative percentage was the same with both approaches. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> reached 60% of abundance in soil three from both the approaches. There are a number of discrepancies: 
 <italic class="italic">Agrobacterium</italic> sequences were above 9% in all soils while no strains belonging to this genus was isolated; and 2.2% of isolates (i.e., two strains) from S2 belong to 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter</italic> while no sequences affiliated to this genus were detected with Illumina.
