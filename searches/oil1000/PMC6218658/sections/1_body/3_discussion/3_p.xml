<p class="p">According to literature, a relation between pollutants load and microbial communities can be drawn. Several studies assessed a different distribution of PAHs and other oil pollutants along soil depths (

As far as we know, no experiments were previously conducted to assess the impact of the soil samples depths on the community structure and enrichment outcomes. Contrary to this general background, in the present study, neither the soil depth nor the enrichment step had significant effects on the community structure (Figures
