<p class="p">Generally, fungi involved in the degradation of PAHs include ligninolytic and non-ligninolytic fungi. Most of the strains isolated after the enrichment steps belonged to the phylum Ascomycota, although few Basidiomycota were isolated. The dominance of Ascomycota in polluted soil has been extensively acknowledged: 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> reported that Ascomycota represented up to 73â€“96% of the total 18S sequences of a coking area soil; eight of the 10 strains isolated from a PAHs contaminated pond were Ascomycetes and were also able to remove anthracene (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aranda et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, an oilfield with a history of 50 years pollution influenced mainly the bacterial community, whereas fungi, mostly related to this phylum, were abundant, demonstrating to be less sensitive to soil PAHs (
