<p class="p">The total load of bacteria and fungi was lower than unpolluted soils (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>), although no differences were observed among the collection depths: a strong and long-lasting pollution of this site may shape a microbial community adapted to the pollutants pressure mostly composed by oil-utilizing strains. As illustrated in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>, differences among samples are more evident for bacteria. However, it is not possible to define clear clusters based on soil depths; the structure of the microbial community was not dependent by the collection point. Since the microbial community is selected by the total content of the pollutants, we can speculate that, in this soil, a pollutants threshold has been reached in the surface topsoil: beyond this level, only the selected and adapted microflora can survive. Indeed, in a less polluted site, the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms decreased with the vertical soil profile (

Regarding the enrichment steps, it was surprising to find that already after 1 week of enrichment, the communities were similar to those found after 4 weeks. This indicates that when dealing with strong polluted soils, as in this study, a single enrichment step may be enough.
