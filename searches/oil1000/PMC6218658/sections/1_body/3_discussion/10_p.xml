<p class="p">On the other hand, Mucoromycota were absent in this contaminated soil. Unlike 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morais et al. (2016)</xref> who found more than 50% of Mucoromycota in a petroleum contaminated costal site, we did not identified any organism belonging to this phylum. Mucoromycota represented a small fraction of the isolates also in an estuarine sediment contaminated mainly by PAHs (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Da Silva et al., 2003</xref>) and in heavy crude oil-contaminated soil (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zafra et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, Mucoromycota could be included in the “unclassified” group (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>), even though they would be a negligible fraction of the mycoflora.
