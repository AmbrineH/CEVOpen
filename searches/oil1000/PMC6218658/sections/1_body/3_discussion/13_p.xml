<p class="p">A thorough comparison was performed between the relative abundances of bacterial and fungal strains. The comparisons carried out at genus level (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> for bacteria, Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> for fungi) and at OTU level (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> for bacteria, Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> for fungi) showed an agreement between the culture-dependent and the culture-independent approaches. In most cases, species level was reached, thus confirming that the Illumina sequencing of the two hypervariable V3â€“V4 regions and of the partial ITS2 are sufficient to reach the species level for bacteria and fungi respectively. The species with more isolates (such as

 <italic class="italic">A. xylosoxidans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ochromobactrum anthropi</italic> for bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> for fungi) were also the dominant OTUs, thus showing that the culturing methods reflect the relative composition of total communities. Furthermore, the two approaches also agree for the less abundant genera: this is expected since enrichment procedures indeed select for the cultivable species among the total bacterial and fungal communities that is originally present in the polluted soil. A novel aspect shown in our work is that the two approaches had detection levels that were generally in good agreement. Composition of the actual microbial community and are not much subjected to biases.
