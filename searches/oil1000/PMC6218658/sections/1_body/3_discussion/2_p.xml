<p class="p">In this work, we assessed whether the pollutant and the collection depth had significant effects on the microbial community arrangements. Enrichments were performed using five pollutants (three PAHs, benzene, and paraffin) and a complex mixture (i.e., crude oil collected from the polluted site). The results obtained (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>) highlighted that for both bacteria and fungi, the pollutant partially shaped the enriched communities. Although it was difficult to highlight separate clusters according to the pollutants, some differences were observed as bacteria grown in the presence of paraffin and benzene or with PAHs, and fungi grown with paraffin or PAHs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). This is not surprising, if we consider that different metabolic pathways are involved in the degradation of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, but that single strains can be also equipped with both pathways (
