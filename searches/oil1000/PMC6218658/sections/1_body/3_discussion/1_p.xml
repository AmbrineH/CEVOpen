<p class="p">Since the discovery of the great plate count anomaly in the middle â€˜80s of the last century (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Staley and Konopka, 1985</xref>), microbiologists are facing the issue of non-cultivable microorganisms and the underestimation of the actual microbial community by means of direct isolation techniques. This has become more and more relevant with the advent of HTS techniques, and it is of utmost importance in the environmental microbiology sector of bioremediation, where studies must rely on the isolation and identification of bacterial and fungal strains to be inoculated in soil for efficient degradation of target pollutants (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Megharaj et al., 2011</xref>). These strains are usually obtained through enrichment procedures, aimed at isolating autochthonous microorganisms capable of using the pollutants as sole carbon sources (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>). Although many data are available in literature about the assessment of microbial community dynamics following the addition of enriched microbial strains (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">MacNaughton et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aburto-Medina et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuentes et al., 2014</xref>), little is known on the developments that occur within the bacterial and fungal communities during the enrichment steps. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt was made to assess how soil samples with a high petroleum hydrocarbons content and collected at different depths affect the organization of the bacterial and fungal communities.
