<p class="p">All samples were dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic>. The identification of these genera as polluted soil inhabitants has been already discussed elsewhere. Sordariomycetes is the most represented class with 
 <italic class="italic">Acremonium, Arthrinium, Clonostachys, Eutypella, Fusarium, Hypocrea/Trichoderma</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoallescheria/Scedosporium</italic>. Fungal taxonomy analysis of an oil-contaminated soil detected almost 25% of Sordariomyecetes (

 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma harzianum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Da Silva et al., 2003</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Scedosporium apiospermum</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (

 <italic class="italic">Fusarium solani</italic> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chaıneau et al., 1999</xref>) were also isolated from contaminated soil or sediments. 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> (three strains), 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic> (three strains), and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudallescheria</italic> (two strains) represented the 40% of the isolates from heavy and extra-heavy crude oil polluted soils (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Naranjo et al., 2007</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhou et al. (2017)</xref> detected more than 20% of 
 <italic class="italic">Gibberella</italic> species in an oilfield site. Since 
 <italic class="italic">Gibberella</italic> is the teleomorph of the majority of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leslie and Summerell, 2008</xref>) we can state that this finding is in agreement with our observations. The isolation of 42 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic>, among which 64% were ascribable to 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic>, opens to intriguing solutions for their application in bioremediation processes. Indeed 
 <italic class="italic">F. solani</italic> isolated from oil polluted soil by enrichment method using phenanthrene as the sole source of carbon was capable of degrading a mixture of low and high molecular weight PAHs (up to 84.8%) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hesham et al., 2017</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Eutypella scoparia</italic> has been isolated from a polluted soil. Previous researches reported the isolation of this species only in a non-polluted Arctic soil (
