<p class="p">A total of 95 bacterial and 94 fungal strains were identified. These strains were well-distributed along soil depths and pollutant (Supplementary Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3</xref>). The taxonomical identification of bacteria confirmed the selection of specific bacterial communities following the addition of different hydrocarbons, indicating a high specialization of bacterial taxa involved in their degradation. 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria, Firmicutes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacteria</italic> were the prevailing bacterial phyla: all these phyla comprised several phylogenetic groups involved in the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons (

On the whole, isolated bacteria where ascribed mainly to genera belonging to Gamma-proteobacteria class, whose dominance within the enriched microcosms can be expected since it comprises many of the hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria responsible for the first steps of hydrocarbons degradation (
