<p class="p">In the present study, we evaluated the evolution of bacterial and fungal communities enriched from polluted soil by culture-independent and dependent methods. The results showed that already after 1 week of enrichment, both bacterial and fungal communities resembled those found after 4 weeks, and that the soil depth did not influence the evolution of microbial communities, contrary to the pollutant used. Isolation results were in agreement with HTS molecular data, indicating that the strains isolated reflected the microbial composition of the enriched consortia. Future studies will focus on the biodegradation abilities of the isolates microorganisms.</p>
