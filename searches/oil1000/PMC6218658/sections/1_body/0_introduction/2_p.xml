<p class="p">Due to the public awareness and to the strict legal constraints on the release of pollutants into the environment, it is necessary to find effective and affordable technologies for the treatment of oil industrial wastes. Bioremediation is a biological approach that relies on the metabolic potential of microorganisms to remove contaminants (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hara et al., 2013</xref>). The use of bioremediation techniques proved economical, environmentally friendly and flexible (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Obi et al., 2016</xref>). In this prospect, bioremediation is gaining more and more importance as constructive approach for the remediation of polluted sites. Several studies reported the catabolic abilities of indigenous microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and algae to degrade hydrocarbons (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Badr El-Din et al., 2014</xref>). These microorganisms, adapted to the contaminated environments, are equipped with specific enzyme systems that enable them to use hydrocarbons as sole carbon source. Different hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea have been found in hydrocarbons contaminated environments (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al. (2011)</xref> observed that, at the early stage of remediation, the bacterial community was responsible for the degradation of the saturated and partially aromatic hydrocarbons; the fungal community instead became dominant in decomposing the polar hydrocarbons fraction in post-remediation. Generally, thanks to the variety of extracellular enzymes and fungal hyphae, fungi are the first key players in degrading available contaminants and recalcitrant polymers (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deshmukh et al., 2016</xref>). Fungal mobilization and degradation of contaminants contribute to release bioavailable intermediates on which, in a later stage, the bacterial community can act more easily (

Therefore, in order to characterize and to monitor the native microbial community, the dynamics and the functional potential of both bacteria and fungi in polluted ecosystems is essential for the development of a successful bioremediation strategy (
