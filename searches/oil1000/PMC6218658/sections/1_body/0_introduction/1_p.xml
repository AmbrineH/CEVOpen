<p class="p">Oil hydrocarbons are the most widespread environmental pollutants, including n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been regarded as serious ecological and public health concerns (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bao et al., 2012</xref>). Oil contamination of ecosystems is a serious issue associated with crude oil drilling, transportation, refining, and related activities which demands immediate attention for restoration. Crude petroleum oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons mainly composed of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons, asphaltenes and resins (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moubasher et al., 2015</xref>). Aliphatic hydrocarbons consist of readily biodegradable n-alkanes followed by less biodegradable branched and cyclic alkanes (
