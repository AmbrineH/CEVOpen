<p class="p">Many investigators have reported successful bioremediation, where biostimulation with the addition of appropriate nutrients (N and/or P), to avoid metabolic limitations, resulted in an improved metabolic activity of indigenous microorganisms (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghaly and Yusran, 2013</xref>;

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, autochthonous bioagumentation, based on the re-inoculation in polluted sites of indigenous microorganisms previously enriched under laboratory conditions, enhanced the microbial activities, thus improving the degradation of hydrocarbons (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dueholm et al., 2015</xref>). In order to provide an inoculum for bioaugmentation, the isolation of microorganisms in pure culture from these contaminated environments is fundamental. However, due to the complexity of crude oil, a microbial consortium composed of microorganisms endowed with diverse metabolic capacities and syntrophic interactions would work better than a pure culture. Several reports demonstrated the better metabolic versatility of mixed cultures in using hydrocarbon pollutants as sole carbon source in comparison to pure cultures (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Das and Chandran, 2011</xref>). In laboratory conditions, bacterial, and fungal co-culture(s) showed improved degradation rates of diesel oil and of polyacyclic romatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, catabolic interactions among different microbial groups during biodegradation is extremely important (

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varjani et al., 2015</xref>). Although identifications and characterizations of the microorganisms involved in the degrading processes are available (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Desai and Banat, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rojo, 2009</xref>), less is known on the biodiversity and dynamics of the native hydrocarbons-degrading microbial community of a contaminated soil, especially during the enrichment process applied to isolate the most effective strains (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Omrani et al., 2018</xref>). The development of effective bioremediation strategies requires an extensive understanding of the resident microorganisms of these habitats. Recent techniques such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have greatly facilitated the advancement of microbial ecological studies in oil-polluted sites.
