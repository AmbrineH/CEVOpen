<p class="p">The success of on-site bioremediation, employing native microbial populations, could be voided by imbalanced nutrients and/or adverse factors (temperature, moisture content, pH, availability of electron donor and/or acceptor, high pollutant concentration, etc.), which are common in contaminated sites (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Bioremediation can be accomplished by either boosting the growth of the indigenous microbial community through biostimulation or by introducing naturally occurring microorganisms with excellent catabolic abilities (bioagumentation) that are adapted to the ecological conditions of the site (
