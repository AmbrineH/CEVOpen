<p class="p">In the present work we have assessed by molecular methods the evolution of bacterial and fungal communities during the enrichment on different pollutants of a soil strongly polluted by mixtures of aliphatic and polycyclic hydrocarbons. Three consecutive enrichments were carried out on soil samples from different soil depths (0–1, 1–2, 2–3 m), and analyzed at each step by means of HTS of bacterial and fungal amplicons biomarkers. At the end of the enrichment, bacterial, and fungal contaminants degrading strains were cultivated and identified.</p>
