  <p class="p">Microscopic photograph of the kidney in the female (A) and male (B) test group of rats and female (C) and male (D) mice that received the repeated dose (100 mg/kg) of the 
   <italic class="italic">Mentha mozaffarianii </italic>essential oil for 28 days. From a clinical perspective, the renal corpuscle (G) is probably the most significant histological feature of the kidney. In these cases, the G was disturbed and most of the tissue contained collecting tubules (CTs), while the renal cortex mostly contained convoluted tubules (CVTs).
