<p class="p">Analysis of the essential oil: Oil sample analysis was performed on an HP-6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame injector detector (FID) and a DB-5 capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm film thickness). The temperature was programmed as follows: 60 °C to 240 °C at 4 °C/min. The carrier gas was N2 at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min; the injector port and detector temperature were 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The sample was injected by splitting, and the split ratio was 1:10. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890/5972 system with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm film thickness). The operating conditions were as described above, but the carrier gas was He. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV. The scan mass range was 40 to 400 m/z at a sampling rate of 1.0 scan/s. Computable data were obtained from the electronic integration of the FID peak areas. The components of the oils were identified by their retention times, retention indices relative to C9-C28n-alkanes, and computer matching with the WILEY275.L library, as well as by comparison of their mass spectra with data already available in the literature. The percentage composition of the identified compounds was computed from the gas-chromatograph peak areas without any correction factors and was calculated relatively. The result of the oil analysis was the average of 3 replicates. </p>
