<p class="p">Biochemical assays: At the end of the treatment in the repeated toxicity model, the experimental animals were subjected to fasting for 12 hours. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation under anesthesia and their heart blood was collected into dry tubes and centrifuged at 3000 g at 4 °C for 15 minutes. The serum collected was stored at 20°C for biochemical analysis (blood glucose, ALT, AST, ALP, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, creatinine, urea, T3, T4, and TSH) using a commercial kit. </p>
