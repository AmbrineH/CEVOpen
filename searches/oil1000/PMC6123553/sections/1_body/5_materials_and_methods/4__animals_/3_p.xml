<p class="p">Repeated oral toxicity study: The subchronic oral toxicity test was performed in compliance with the OECD guideline No. 407 (OECD, 2008). After the acute test and the previous pharmacological study, the necessary dose for subchronic toxicity was estimated at a single dose of 100 mg/kg. The male/female mice and rats were divided into 2 groups: control (sweet almond oil) and test (MMEO), each of which consisted of 3 animals per each sex. The test group was daily treated with the oral administration of the MMEO at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 28 days. On day 28th, the animals of the control and test groups were sacrificed. During the experimental period, the behavioral parameters, body weight change, and food intakes were recorded weekly. </p>
