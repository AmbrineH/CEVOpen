 </sup> The test was carried out on 24 mice and rats, comprising 12 females/males (6 cases and 6 controls). The determined dose of the essential oil was the selected dose of 2000 mg/kg of body weight, which was administered by oral gavage. The treated animals were observed for general behavior changes and physical examination was done to observe death, hair coat, mucus membrane/eye/skin color, body temperature, respiratory rate, lacrimation, salivation, and eye prominence. Mortality was observed continuously for 30 minutes and then intermittently for 4 and 24 hours and then twice daily for 14 days after the administration of the MMEO.
