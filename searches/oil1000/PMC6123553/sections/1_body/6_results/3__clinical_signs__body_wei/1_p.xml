<p class="p">In mice: The daily oral administration of the MMEO (100 mg/kg) for 28 days did not induce any obvious symptom of toxicity in the mice of both sexes. No deaths or obvious clinical signs were found in either group throughout the experimental period. The physical observation of the treated rats throughout the study indicated that none of them showed signs of toxicity in their skin, fur, eyes, or mucus membrane. In addition, there were no behavioral changes, diarrhea, tremors, salivation, sleep, and coma. Normal body weight gain was observed during the study period compared to the control group. The food consumption of the treated mice, measured throughout the study, was not significantly different from the control mice. Nonetheless, at the higher dose (200 mg/kg), some of the animals died on the 5th day. </p>
