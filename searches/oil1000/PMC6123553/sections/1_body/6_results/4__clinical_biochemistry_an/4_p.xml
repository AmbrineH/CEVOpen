<p class="p">Histopathology: The histopathological examination of the control and treated rats showed normal structure and absence of any gross pathological lesion in the organs. The macroscopic examination of the vital organs of the treated animals revealed no abnormalities in the color or texture when compared with the organs of the control group. Chemically induced histological changes were not seen in the heart, lung, and spleen in the test group. However, mild changes were present in the liver, kidney, and small intestine in the MMEO-treated rats (

Apropos of the liver, the parenchymal cells of the liver had a cord-like arrangement of hepatocytes radiating outward from a central vein and sinusoid structure, whereas in some of the MMEO-treated animals the arrangement of the hepatocytes around the central vein and sinusoid structures was disturbed (

In these cases, the renal corpuscle was disturbed and most of the tissue contained collecting tubules, while the renal cortex mostly contained convoluted tubules (

The intestinal villi constitute a part of the mucosa and have simple columnar epithelia; nevertheless, in the current study, there were no villi in the mucosal layers in some sections (
