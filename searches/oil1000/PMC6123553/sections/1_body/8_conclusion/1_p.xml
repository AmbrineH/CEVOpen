<p class="p">The findings of the present study demonstrated that the MMEO was slightly toxic with LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> greater than 2000 mg/kg. However, the repeated administration of the MMEO over a period of 28 days and at a relatively lower dose induced important damage in the rats and mice. At the dose of 100 mg/kg, there were significant changes in some biochemical parameters and histological analyses. Thus, it would be prudent to use the MMEO at a maximum dose of 100 mg/kg in order to limit its adverse effects. These results confer additional evidence that essential oils, if applied at non-recommended doses, can cause functional damage to critical organs such as the liver, kidney, stomach, and small intestine in animals and probably in humans. Overall, in this study, the mice and rats appeared to tolerate the MMEO at the dose of 2000 mg/kg of body weight well.
