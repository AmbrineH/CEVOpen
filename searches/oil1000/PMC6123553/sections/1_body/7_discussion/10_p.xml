<p class="p">The main limitation of our study is that we examined the changes in blood biochemical parameters in the subchronic toxicity model only in the rats. In future studies, a simultaneous assessment of blood biochemical and histological changes should be undertaken to evaluate the organ toxicity of the MMEO in mice. </p>
