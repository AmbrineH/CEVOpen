<p class="p">Since the essential oils of plants can be administered orally in some therapeutic applications, it is advisable that their safety profiles be assessed and recorded in repeated-dose studies.

 </sup> Having observed the therapeutic effects at a dose of 100 mg/kg in a previous study, we started the subchronic test at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d. Although this dose appeared to be safe in the 28-day study period, it exhibited some toxic effects in each sex and species at the end of the study period. In repeated treatment, the administration of the essential oil at the dose of 100 mg/kg did not cause significant changes in food consumption and body weight in the rats. Nonetheless, repeated oral administrations to the mice produced a reduction in food intake in both sexes, which may have been brought about by loss of appetite in the animals. These results show the role of animal species in different responses to essential oil toxicity.
